Prime Meridian Holding Co's Comment on Competitors and Industry Peers  

Our competition is made up of a wide range of financial institutions, including 
  credit unions, local, regional, and national commercial banks, mortgage companies, 
  insurance companies, and other non-traditional providers of financial services. 
  There were 16 FDIC-insured financial institutions serving Tallahassee; three 
  of them, including Prime Meridian Bank, are headquartered in Leon County. According 
  to the Summary of Deposits, Prime Meridian Bank had a 3.7% share of the FDIC-insured 
  deposits in the Tallahassee MSA.

  Some of our competitors are not subject to the same level of regulation and 
  oversight that is required of banks and bank holding companies. As a result, 
  some of our competitors may have lower cost structures. By emphasizing our exceptional 
  client service, knowledge of local trends and conditions, and local decision-making 
  process, we believe the Bank has developed an effective competitive advantage 
  in its market, thus maintaining a strong level of growth. We also are actively 
  engaged in Small Business Administration guaranteed financing to support local 
  borrowers who might not otherwise qualify for conventional financing, which 
  helps mitigate our credit risk and results in fee income if we sell the guaranteed 
  portion.

  Some of our competitors are much larger financial institutions with greater 
  financial resources. It is not our goal to compete on all products and services, 
  but to support the product mix that best suits our strategic plan. This strategy 
  has yielded solid growth for our Bank thus far.

  Other important competitive factors that have contributed to our success in 
  our market area include convenient office hours, electronic banking products, 
  community reputation, quality of our banking team, capacity and willingness 
  to extend credit, and our ability to offer cash management and other commercial 
  banking services. Many of our competitors’ approaches and processes may 
  appear to be more efficient, however, these efficiencies may not allow for the 
  same level of personal service we provide to our clients. Although offering 
  competitive rates is important, we believe that our greatest competitive advantages 
  are our experienced management team, client relationship culture, and personal 
  service.

	PRIME MERIDIAN HOLDING COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY






	Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)



	 





	(1)




	General





	Prime Meridian Holding Company (PMHG) owns 100% of the outstanding
	common stock of Prime Meridian Bank (the Bank) (collectively the Company). PMHGs primary activity is the operation of the Bank. The Bank is a Florida state-chartered commercial bank. The deposit accounts of the Bank are
	insured up to the applicable limits by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The Bank offers a variety of community banking services to individual and corporate clients through its three banking offices located in Tallahassee
	and Crawfordville, Florida and its online banking platform.


	In the opinion of management, the accompanying condensed consolidated
	financial statements of the Company contain all adjustments (consisting principally of normal recurring accruals) necessary to present fairly the financial position at March 31, 2017, and the results of operations for the three ended
	March 31, 2017 and 2016. The results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2017 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year.




	Comprehensive Income.


	Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) generally
	require that recognized revenue, expenses, gains and losses be included in earnings. Although certain changes in assets and liabilities, such as unrealized gains and losses on


	available-for-sale


	securities, are reported as a separate component of the equity section of the condensed consolidated balance sheet, such items along with net
	earnings, are components of comprehensive income. The only component of other comprehensive income is the net change in the unrealized (loss) gain on the securities available for sale.




	Stock-Based Compensation.


	The Company expenses the fair value of any stock options granted. The Company recognizes stock option
	compensation in the condensed consolidated statements of earnings as the options vest.




	Mortgage Banking Revenue.


	Mortgage
	banking revenue includes gains and losses on the sale of mortgage loans originated for sale and wholesale brokerage fees. The Company recognizes mortgage banking revenue from mortgage loans originated in the condensed consolidated statements of
	earnings upon sale of the loans.




	Recent Accounting Standards Update.


	In January 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards
	Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU)

	No. 2016-01,


	Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic

	825-10):

	Recognition and
	Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities,

	which is intended to enhance the reporting model for financial instruments to provide users of financial statements with more decision-useful information. The ASU requires equity
	investments to be measured at fair value with changes in fair values recognized in net earnings, (public entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes), simplifies the impairment
	assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values by requiring a qualitative assessment to identify impairment and eliminates the requirement to disclose fair values, the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate
	the fair value of financial instruments measured at amortized cost. The ASU also clarifies that the Company should evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset related to


	available-for-sale


	debt securities in combination with the Companys other deferred tax assets. For public business entities, the ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017,
	including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.

	General, Continued





	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU

	No. 2016-2,


	Leases (Topic 842)

	which will require lessees to recognize on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases with term of more than
	twelve months. Consistent with current GAAP, the recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee primarily will depend on its classification as a finance or operating lease. The new ASU will
	require both types of leases to be recognized on the balance sheet. The ASU also will require disclosures to help investors and other financial statement users better understand the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases.
	These disclosures include qualitative and quantitative requirements, providing additional information about the amounts recorded in the financial statements. For public companies, the ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within
	those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is in the process of determining the effect of the ASU on its consolidated financial statements. Early adoption is permitted.


	In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU

	No. 2016-09,


	Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718)

	intended to improve the accounting for employee share-based payments. The ASU affects all organizations that issue share-based payment awards to their employees. The ASU simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award
	transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the consolidated statement of cash flows. For public companies, the amendments in this ASU are effective for annual
	periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is in the process of determining the effect of the ASU on its consolidated financial statements.


	In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU

	No. 2016-13,


	Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic
	326)

	. The ASU improves financial reporting by requiring timelier recording of credit losses on loans and other financial instruments held by the Company. The ASU requires the Company to measure all expected credit losses for financial assets
	held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Many of the loss estimation techniques applied today will still be permitted, although the inputs to those techniques will
	change to reflect the full amount of expected credit losses. The Company will continue to use judgment to determine which loss estimation method is appropriate for their circumstances. The ASU requires enhanced disclosures to help investors and
	other financial statement users better understand significant estimates and judgments used in estimating credit losses, as well as the credit quality and underwriting standards of an organizations portfolio. These disclosures include
	qualitative and quantitative requirements that provide additional information about the amounts recorded in the financial statements. Additionally, the ASU amends the accounting for credit losses on


	available-for-sale


	debt securities and purchased financial assets with credit deterioration. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after
	December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is in the process of determining the effect of the ASU on its consolidated financial statements.

	The unrealized losses at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 on twenty-five and
	twenty-four securities, respectively, were caused by market conditions. It is expected that the securities would not be settled at a price less than the par value of the investments. Because the decline in fair value is attributable to market
	conditions and not credit quality, and because the Company has the ability and intent to hold these investments until a market price recovery or maturity, these investments are not considered other-than-temporarily impaired. Securities available for
	sale measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below:

	Loans, Continued





	 


	The Company has divided the loan portfolio into three portfolio segments and five portfolio
	classes, each with different risk characteristics and methodologies for assessing risk. All loans are underwritten based upon standards set forth in the policies approved by the Companys Board of Directors. The Company identifies the portfolio
	segments and classes as follows:




	Real Estate Mortgage Loans.


	Real estate mortgage loans are typically divided into three
	classes: commercial, residential and home equity and construction loans.




	Commercial.




	Loans of this type are typically
	our more complex loans. This category of real estate loans is comprised of loans secured by mortgages on commercial property that are typically owner-occupied, but also includes

	non-owner

	occupied investment
	properties. Commercial loans that are secured by owner-occupied commercial real estate are repaid through operating cash flows of the borrower. The maturity for this type of loan is generally limited to three to five years; however, payments may be
	structured on a longer amortization basis. Typically, interest rates on our commercial real estate loans are fixed for five years or less after which they adjust based upon a predetermined spread over a market index rate. At times, a rate may be
	fixed for longer than five years. As part of our credit underwriting standards, the Company typically requires personal guarantees from the principal owners of the business supported by a review of the principal owners personal financial
	statements and tax returns. As part of the enterprise risk management process, it is understood that risks associated with commercial real estate loans include fluctuations in real estate values, the overall strength of the borrower and the economy,
	new job creation trends, tenant vacancy rates, environmental contamination, and the quality of the borrowers management. In order to mitigate and limit these risks, we analyze the borrowers cash flows and evaluate collateral value.
	Currently, the collateral securing our commercial real estate loans includes a variety of property types, such as office, warehouse, and retail facilities. Other types include multifamily properties, hotels,

	mixed-use

	residential and commercial properties. Generally, commercial real estate loans present a higher risk profile than our consumer real estate loan portfolio.




	Residential and Home Equity.


	The Company offers first and second


	one-to-four


	family mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit; the collateral for these loans is generally the clients owner-occupied residences. Although
	these types of loans present lower levels of risk than commercial real estate loans, risks do still exist because of possible fluctuations in the value of the real estate collateral securing the loan, as well as changes in the borrowers
	financial condition. The

	nonowner-occupied

	investment properties are more similar in risk to commercial real estate loans, and therefore, are underwritten by assessing the propertys income potential and
	appraised value. In both cases, we underwrite the borrowers financial condition and evaluate his or her global cash flow position. Borrowers may be affected by numerous factors, including job loss, illness, or other personal hardship. As part
	of our product mix, the Bank offers both portfolio and secondary market mortgages; portfolio loans generally are based on a

	1-year,


	3-year,


	5-year,

	or

	7-year

	adjustable rate mortgage; while

	15-year

	or

	30-year

	fixed-rate loans are
	generally sold in the secondary market.

	Loans, Continued





	 




	Construction.


	Typically, these loans have a construction period of one to two
	years and the interest is paid monthly. Once the construction period terminates, some of these loans convert to a term loan with a maturity of one to ten years. This portion of our loan portfolio includes loans to small and midsized businesses to
	construct owner-user properties, loans to developers of commercial real estate investment properties, and residential developments. This type of loan is also made to individual clients for construction of single family homes in our market area. An
	independent appraisal is used to determine the value of the collateral and confirm that the ratio of the loan principal to the value of the collateral will not exceed policies of the Bank. As the construction project progresses, loan proceeds are
	requested by the borrower to complete phases of construction and funding is only disbursed after the project has been inspected by a third-party inspector or experienced construction lender. Risks associated with construction loans include
	fluctuations in the value of real estate, project completion risk, and changes in market trends. The ability of the construction loan borrower to finance the loan or sell the property upon completion of the project is another risk factor that also
	may be affected by changes in market trends since the initial funding of the loan.




	Commercial Loans.


	The Bank offers a wide
	range of commercial loans, including business term loans, equipment financing, lines of credit, and U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) loans to small and midsized businesses.


	Small-to-medium


	sized businesses, retail, and professional establishments, make up our target market for commercial loans. Our Relationship Managers primarily underwrite
	these loans based on the borrowers ability to service the loan from cash flow. Lines of credit and loans secured by accounts receivable and/or inventory are monitored periodically by our staff. Loans secured by all business assets,
	or a blanket lien are typically only made to highly qualified borrowers due to the nonspecific nature of the collateral and do not require a formal valuation of the business collateral. When commercial loans are secured by specifically
	identified collateral, then the valuation of the collateral is generally supported by an appraisal, purchase order, or third party physical inspection. Personal guarantees of the principals of business borrowers are usually required. Equipment loans
	generally have a term of five years or less and may have a fixed or variable rate; we use conservative margins when pricing these loans. Working capital loans generally do not exceed one year and typically, they are secured by accounts receivable,
	inventory, and personal guarantees of the principals of the business. The Bank currently offers SBA 504 and SBA 7A loans. SBA 504 loans provide financing for major fixed assets such as real estate and equipment while SBA 7A loans are generally used
	to establish a new business or assist in the acquisition, operation, or expansion of an existing business. With both SBA loan programs, there are set eligibility requirements and underwriting standards outlined by SBA that can change as the
	government alters its fiscal policy. Significant factors affecting a commercial borrowers creditworthiness include the quality of management and the ability both to evaluate changes in the supply and demand characteristics affecting the
	business markets for products and services and to respond effectively to such changes. These loans may be made unsecured or secured, but most are made on a secured basis. Risks associated with our commercial loan portfolio include local,
	regional, and national market conditions.

	Loans, Continued





	 


	Other factors of risk could include changes in the borrowers management and
	fluctuations in collateral value. Additionally, there may be refinancing risk if a commercial loan includes a balloon payment which must be refinanced or paid off at loan maturity. In reference to our risk management process, our commercial loan
	portfolio presents a higher risk profile than our consumer real estate and consumer loan portfolios. Therefore, we require that all loans to businesses must have a clearly stated and reasonable payment plan to allow for timely retirement of debt,
	unless secured by liquid collateral or as otherwise justified.






	Consumer and Other Loans.




	These loans are made
	for various consumer purposes, such as the financing of automobiles, boats, and recreational vehicles. The payment structure of these loans is normally on an installment basis. The risk associated with this category of loans stems from the reduced
	collateral value for a defaulted loan; the collateral may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the principal. The underwriting on these loans is primarily based on the borrowers financial condition. In many cases, these are unsecured
	credits that subject us to risk when the borrowers financial condition declines or deteriorates. Based upon our current trend in consumer loans, management does not anticipate consumer loans will become a substantial component of our loan
	portfolio at any time in the foreseeable future. Consumer loans are made at fixed and variable interest rates and are based on the appropriate amortization for the asset and purpose.

	Loans, Continued





	 


	The Company categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the
	ability of borrowers to service their debt such as current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors. The Company analyzes loans individually by
	classifying the loans as to credit risk. Loans classified as substandard or special mention are reviewed quarterly by the Company for further deterioration or improvement to determine if they are appropriately classified and whether there is any
	impairment. All loans are graded upon initial issuance. Furthermore, construction loans,

	non-owner

	occupied commercial real estate loans, and commercial loan relationships in excess of $500,000 are reviewed at
	least annually. The Company determines the appropriate loan grade during the renewal process and reevaluates the loan grade in situations when a loan becomes past due.


	Loans excluded from the review process above are generally classified as pass credits until: (a) they become past due; (b) management
	becomes aware of deterioration in the credit worthiness of the borrower; or (c) the client contacts the Company for a modification. In these circumstances, the loan is specifically evaluated for potential classification as to special mention,
	substandard or even

	charged-off.

	The Company uses the following definitions for risk ratings:



	Pass

	 A Pass loans primary source of loan repayment is satisfactory, with secondary sources very likely to be realized if
	necessary.



	Special Mention

	 A Special Mention loan has potential weaknesses that deserve managements close attention.
	If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in the deterioration of the repayment prospects for the asset or the Companys credit position at some future date. Special Mention loans are not adversely classified and do not expose
	an institution to sufficient risk to warrant adverse classification.



	Substandard

	 A Substandard loan is inadequately
	protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified must have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by
	the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.



	Doubtful

	 A loan
	classified Doubtful has all the weaknesses inherent in one classified Substandard with the added characteristics that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly
	questionable and improbable.



	Loss

	 A loan classified Loss is considered uncollectible and of such little value that
	continuance as a bankable asset is not warranted. This classification does not necessarily preclude the potential for recovery, but rather signifies it is no longer practical to defer writing off the asset.


	At March 31, 2017, there were four nonaccrual loans, totaling $805,000.

	Regulatory Capital





	The Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements
	administered by the banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the
	Companys and the Banks financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the
	Banks assets, liabilities, and certain

	off-balance

	sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Banks capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative
	judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors.


	Effective January 1, 2015, the Bank, became subject
	to the new Basel III capital level threshold requirements under the Prompt Corrective Action regulations with full compliance with all of the final rules requirements phased in over a multi-year schedule. These new regulations were designed to
	ensure that banks maintain strong capital positions even in the event of severe economic downturns or unforeseen losses.


	Changes that
	could affect the Bank going forward include additional constraints on the inclusion of deferred tax assets in capital and increased risk weightings for nonperforming loans and acquisition/development loans in regulatory capital. Under the new
	regulations in the first quarter of 2015, the Bank elected an irreversible

	one-time


	opt-out

	to exclude accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) from regulatory
	capital. Beginning January 1, 2016, the Bank became subject to the capital conservation buffer rules which place limitations on distributions, including dividend payments, and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. In order
	to avoid these limitations, a bank must hold a capital conservation buffer above its minimum risk-based capital requirements. As of March 31, 2017, the Banks capital conservation buffer exceeds the minimum requirement designated for
	March 31, 2017 of 1.25%. The required buffer is to be phased in over three years.


	Quantitative measures established by regulation to
	ensure capital adequacy require the Bank to maintain minimum amounts and percentage (set forth in the table below) of total and Tier 1 capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets (as defined), and of Tier 1 capital (as defined)
	to average assets (as defined). Management believes, as of March 31, 2017 that the Bank meets all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject.


	As of March 31, 2017, the Bank is well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. To be categorized as
	adequately capitalized, the Bank must maintain minimum total risk-based, Tier 1 risk-based, and Tier 1 leverage percentages as set forth in the table. There are no conditions or events since that notification that management believes have changed
	the Banks category. The Banks actual capital amounts and percentages are also presented in the following table.

	Stock Option Plans





	The 2015 Stock Incentive Compensation Plan (the 2015
	Plan) was approved by the Shareholders at the Companys annual meeting of shareholders on May 20, 2015 and permits the Company to grant the Companys key employees and directors stock options, stock appreciation rights,
	performance shares, and phantom stock. Under the 2015 Plan, the number of shares which may be issued is 500,000, but in no instance more than 15% of the issued and outstanding shares of the Companys common stock. As of March 31, 2017,
	11,540 stock options have been granted under the 2015 Plan.

	At March 31, 2017, the fair value of shares vested and recognized as compensation expense was $15,000 for
	the three months ended March 31, 2017. There was no unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested share-based compensation arrangements granted under the 2015 Plan.


	The fair value of each option granted during the three months ended March 31, 2017 was estimated on the date of grant using the
	Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions:


	 



















	Weighted average risk-free interest rate

	Per share fair value of options issued during period



	  


	$

	The Company used the guidance in Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 to determine the estimated life of
	options issued. Expected volatility is based on volatility of similar companies common stock. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.

	In 2012, the Companys Board of Directors and shareholders adopted the Directors Plan. The
	Directors Plan permits the Companys and the Banks directors to elect to receive any compensation to be paid to them in shares of the Companys common stock. Pursuant to the Directors Plan, each director is permitted to
	make an election to receive shares of stock instead of cash. To encourage directors to elect to receive stock, the Directors Plan provides that if a director elects to receive stock, he or she will receive in common stock 110% of the amount of
	cash fees set by the Board or the Compensation and Nominating Committee. The value of stock to be awarded pursuant to the Directors Plan will be the closing price of a share of common stock as traded on the

	Over-the

	Counter Bulletin Board, or a price set by the Board or its Compensation and Nominating Committee, acting in good faith, but in no case less than fair market value. The maximum number of shares to be
	issued pursuant to the Directors Plan is limited to 74,805 shares. For the three months ended March 31, 2017 our directors received 1,273 shares of common stock, in lieu of $18,728 in cash fees, under the Directors Plan. At
	March 31, 2017, 60,741 shares remained available for grant.

	Federal Home Loan Bank Advances





	Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances are

	Off-Balance

	Sheet Financial Instruments





	The
	Company is a party to financial instruments with

	off-balance-sheet

	risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its clients. These financial instruments are commitments to extend
	credit, construction loans in process, unused lines of credit, standby letters of credit, and guaranteed accounts and may involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and

	interest-rate

	risk in excess of the
	amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheets. The contract amounts of these instruments reflect the extent of involvement the Company has in these financial instruments.

	Off-Balance

	Sheet Financial Instruments, continued





	 


	The Companys exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party
	to the financial instrument for available lines of credit, construction loans in process and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. The Company uses the same credit policies in making commitments as
	it does for


	on-balance-sheet


	instruments.


	Commitments to
	extend credit, construction loans in process and unused lines of credit are agreements to lend to a client as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other
	termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since some of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Company evaluates each
	clients credit worthiness on a


	case-by-case


	basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Company upon extension of credit, is based on
	managements credit evaluation of the counterparty.


	Standby letters of credit are written conditional commitments issued by the
	Company to guarantee the performance of a client to a third party. These letters of credit are primarily issued to support third-party borrowing arrangements and generally have expiration dates within one year of issuance. The credit risk involved
	in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to clients. In the event the client does not perform in accordance with the terms of the agreement with the third party, we would be required to fund the
	commitment. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make is represented by the contractual amount of the commitment. If the commitment is funded, we would be entitled to seek recovery from the client. Some of the
	Companys standby letters of credit are secured by collateral and those secured letters of credit totaled $834,000 at March 31, 2017.


	Guaranteed accounts are irrevocable standby letters of credit issued by us to guarantee a clients credit line with our third-party credit
	card company, First Arkansas Bank & Trust. As a part of this agreement, we are responsible for the established credit limit on certain accounts plus 10%. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make is
	represented by the dollar amount disclosed in the table below.


	Standby letters of credit and commitments to extend credit typically result
	in loans with a market interest rate when funded.


	In 2016, the Company entered into an agreement with another bank. This agreement
	references an interest rate swap that was transacted between the other bank and its loan client (the Counterparty). Should the Counterparty default on its obligations under the interest rate swap agreement with the other bank, then the
	Company would be liable for 13.208% of all swap liabilities. The maximum potential credit exposure under this contract at March 31, 2017 is $74,000.

	Item 2. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
	RESULTS OF OPERATIONS



	Managements discussion and analysis is presented to aid the reader in understanding and evaluating the
	financial condition and results of operations of Prime Meridian Holding Company, and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Prime Meridian Bank. This discussion and analysis should be read with the condensed consolidated financial statements, the footnotes
	thereto, and the other financial data included in this report and in our annual report on Form

	10-K

	for the year ended December 31, 2016. Results of operations for the three months ended March 31,
	2017, are not necessarily indicative of results that may be attained for any other period. The following discussion and analysis presents our financial condition and results of operations on a consolidated basis, however, because we conduct all of
	our material business operations through the Bank, the discussion and analysis relates to activities primarily conducted at the subsidiary level.


	Certain information in this report may include forward-looking statements as defined by federal securities law. Words such as
	may, could, should, would, believe, anticipate, estimate, expect, intend, plan, project, is confident
	that, and similar expressions are intended to identify these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty and a variety of factors could cause our actual results and experience to differ materially
	from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in these forward-looking statements. We do not have a policy of updating or revising forward-looking statements except as otherwise required by law, and silence by management over time
	should not be construed to mean that actual events are occurring as estimated in such forward-looking statements.


	Our ability to predict
	results or the effect of future plans or strategies is inherently uncertain. Factors that could have a material adverse effect on our and our subsidiarys operations include, but are not limited to, changes in:

	GENERAL



	Prime Meridian Holding Company (PMHG) was incorporated as a Florida corporation on May 25, 2010, and is the

	one-bank

	holding company for, and sole shareholder of, Prime Meridian Bank (the Bank) (collectively, the Company). The Bank opened for business on February 4, 2008, and was acquired by
	PMHG on September 16, 2010. PMHG has no significant operations other than owning the stock of the Bank. The Bank offers a broad array of commercial and retail banking services through three

	full-service

	offices located in Tallahassee and Crawfordville, Florida and through its online banking platform.


	As a one bank holding company, we
	generate most of our revenue from interest on loans and investments. Our primary source of funding for our loans is deposits. Our largest expenses are interest on those deposits and salaries and employee benefits. We measure our performance through
	our net interest margin, return on average assets, and return on average equity, while maintaining appropriate regulatory leverage and risk-based capital ratios.


	The following table shows selected information for the periods ended or at the dates indicated:

	CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES



	Our critical accounting policies which involve significant judgements and assumptions that have a material impact on the carrying value of
	certain assets and liabilities, and used in preparation of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of March 31, 2017, have remained unchanged from the disclosures presented in our Annual Report on Form

	10-K.




	FINANCIAL CONDITION



	Average assets totaled $307.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, an increase of $51.1 million, or 20.0%, over
	the three months ended March 31, 2016. The increase quarter over quarter can be primarily attributed to higher average loan balances.




	Investment Securities.




	Our primary objective in managing our investment portfolio is to maintain a portfolio of high
	quality, highly liquid investments yielding competitive returns. We use the investment securities portfolio for several purposes. It serves as a vehicle to manage interest rate and prepayment risk, to generate interest and dividend income, to
	provide liquidity to meet funding requirements, and to provide collateral for pledging of public funds. At March 31, 2017, our available for sale investment portfolio included U.S. Treasury notes, municipal securities, and mortgage-backed
	securities and had a fair market value of $43.0 million and an amortized cost value of $43.2 million. At March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, our investment securities portfolio represented approximately 13.6% and 10.9% of our
	total assets, respectively. The average yield on the average balance of investment securities for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was 2.31%, compared to 2.12% for the three months ended March 31, 2016.




	Loans.




	Our primary earning asset is our loan portfolio and our primary source of income is the interest earned on the
	loan portfolio. Our loan portfolio consists of commercial real estate loans, construction loans, and commercial loans made to


	small-to-medium


	sized companies and their
	owners, as well as residential real estate loans, including first and second mortgages, and consumer loans. Our goal is to maintain a high quality of loans through sound underwriting and lending practices. We work diligently to attract new lending
	clients through direct solicitation by our loan officers, utilizing relationship networks from existing clients, competitive pricing, and innovative structure. Our loans are priced based upon the degree of risk, collateral, loan amount, and
	maturity. We have no loans to foreign borrowers.


	Loans grew $28.5 million, or 14.4% when compared to March 31, 2016, and have
	grown $3.0 million, or 1.3% from December 31, 2016. Construction loans accounted for the majority of the Banks loan growth in the first quarter of 2017. In total, approximately 78.0% of the total loan portfolio was collateralized by
	commercial and residential real estate mortgages at March 31, 2017, compared to 77.5% at December 31, 2016.




	Nonperforming
	assets.




	We generally place loans on nonaccrual status when they become 90 days or more past due, unless they are well secured and in the process of collection. We also place loans on nonaccrual status if they are less than 90 days
	past due if the collection of principal or interest is in doubt. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, any interest previously accrued, but not collected, is reversed from income.


	Accounting standards require the Bank to identify loans as impaired loans when, based on current information and events, it is probable that
	the Bank will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. These standards require that impaired loans be valued at the present value of expected future cash

	flows, discounted at the loans effective interest rate, using one of the following methods: the observable market price of the loan or the fair value of the underlying collateral if the
	loan is collateral dependent. We implement these standards in our monthly review of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, and identify and value impaired loans in accordance with regulatory guidance on these standards. Four loans totaling
	$805,000 were deemed to be impaired under the Banks policy at March 31, 2017, compared to four loans totaling $811,000 at December 31, 2016. The Banks nonperforming assets represented 0.26% of total assets at March 31,
	2017, compared to 0.27% at December 31, 2016.




	Allowance for Loan Losses.


	Managements policy is to maintain the
	allowance for loan losses at a level sufficient to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The allowance is increased by the provision for loan losses and decreased by charge-offs, net of recoveries.
	Management believes that the allowance for loan losses, which was $2.9 million or 1.3% of total loans, at March 31, 2017, is adequate to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio. One impaired loan carried a reserve of $69,000 at
	March 31, 2017 and $76,000 at December 31, 2016. Collateral values on the remaining impaired loans did not require specific reserves at March 31, 2017 or December 31, 2016.




	Deposits.


	Deposits are the major source of the Banks funds for lending and other investment purposes. Total deposits at
	March 31, 2017 were $286.2 million, an increase of $10.9 million, or 4.0%, from December 31, 2016, with the majority of growth coming from noninterest-bearing accounts. The average balance of noninterest-bearing deposits
	accounted for 23.2% of the average balance of total deposits for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to 22.2% for the three months ended March 31, 2016.




	Borrowings.




	The Bank has an agreement with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta (FHLB) and pledges its
	qualified loans as collateral which would allow the Bank, as of March 31, 2017, to borrow up to $29.6 million. In addition, the Bank maintains unsecured lines of credit with correspondent banks that totaled $16.3 million at
	March 31, 2017. There were no loans outstanding under any of these lines at March 31, 2017.



	RESULTS OF OPERATIONS



	Net interest income constitutes the principal source of income for the Bank and results from the excess of interest income on interest-earning
	assets over interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities. The principal interest-earning assets are investment securities and loans receivable. Interest-bearing liabilities primarily consist of time deposits, interest-bearing checking accounts,
	savings deposits, money-market accounts, and other borrowings. Funds attracted by these interest-bearing liabilities are invested in interest-earning assets. Accordingly, net interest income depends upon the volume of average interest-earning assets
	and average interest-bearing liabilities as well as the interest rates earned or paid on these assets and liabilities. The following tables set forth information regarding: (i) the total dollar amount of interest and dividend income of the Bank
	from interest-earning assets and the resultant average yields; (ii) the total dollar amount of interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities and the resultant average costs; (iii) net interest income; (iv) interest-rate spread;
	(v) net interest margin; and (vi) weighted-average yields and rates. Yields and costs were derived by dividing annualized income or expense by the average balance of assets or liabilities. The yields and costs depicted in the table include
	the amortization of fees, which are considered to constitute adjustments to yields.


	As shown in the following table, lower yields on
	loans combined with higher funding costs, led to a decrease in the interest-rate spread and net interest margin for the three months ended March 31, 2017 when compared to the same period a year ago.

	Comparison of Operating Results for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 and 2016





	Net Earnings.




	For the three months ended March 31, 2017, the Company reported net earnings of $536,000, or $0.27 per
	basic and diluted share, compared to net earnings of $382,000, or $0.19 per basic and diluted share, for the three months ended March 31, 2016.




	Net Interest Income.




	Our operating results depend primarily on our net interest income, which is the difference between
	interest and dividend income on interest-earning assets such as loans and securities, and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowings. Net interest income was $2.7 million for the three months ended
	March 31, 2017, compared to $2.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016.




	Interest Income.


	Interest income increased to $2.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, a $414,000 or 16.6%, increase over the three months ended March 31, 2016. The increase was driven by an increase in average loans from
	$193.6 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2016 to $227.1 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.




	Interest Expense.


	Interest expense was $247,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to $192,000 for the
	three months ended March 31, 2016. The year-over-year increase resulted primarily from a 19.9%, or $35.5 million, increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits from the first quarter of 2016 to the first quarter of 2017.




	Net Interest Margin.




	The net interest margin was 3.60% for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, compared to 3.74%
	for the same period in 2016. Our net interest margin continues to be compressed due primarily to declining loan yields. Despite the decrease in net interest margin, net interest income rose 15.6% to $2.7 million due to a higher volume of
	interest-earning assets.




	Provision for Loan Losses.


	The provision for loan losses is charged to earnings to increase the
	total loan loss allowance to a level deemed appropriate by management. The provision is based upon the volume and type of lending conducted by the Bank, industry standards, general economic conditions, particularly as they relate to our market area,
	and other factors related to the collectability of the loan portfolio. The provision for loan losses for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was $35,000, compared to $134,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The higher
	provision in 2016 was due to higher loan growth in that quarter.


	Management believes that the allowance for loan losses, which was
	$2.9 million or 1.3% of total loans, at March 31, 2017, is adequate to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio based on the assessment of the above-mentioned factors affecting the loan portfolio. While management believes the estimates
	and assumptions used in its determination of the adequacy of the allowance are reasonable, there can be no assurance that such estimates and assumptions will not be proven incorrect in the future, or that the actual amount of future losses will not
	exceed the amount of the established allowance for loan losses, or that any increased allowance for loan losses that may be required will not adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the determination of the
	amount of our allowance for loan losses is subject to review by bank regulators, as part of the routine examination process, which may result in additions to our provision for loan losses based upon their judgment of information available to them at
	the time of their examination.




	Noninterest income.




	Noninterest income consists of revenues generated from a broad
	range of financial services and activities, primarily service charges and fees on deposit accounts, mortgage banking revenue, income from bank-owned life insurance and any gains on the sale of securities available for sale. Noninterest income for
	the three months ended March 31, 2017 totaled $423,000 an increase of $132,000, or 45.4%, from the three months ended March 31, 2016. The increase was


	 


	32







	Table of Contents



	primarily driven by a 66.2%, or $100,000, increase in mortgage banking revenue. Increased service charges and fees on deposit accounts and gains in other income from higher merchant card services
	and credit card fee income also contributed to growth in noninterest income for the first quarter of 2017 when compared to same period a year ago.




	Noninterest expense.




	Noninterest expense increased $330,000 or 17.6%, to $2.2 million for the three months ended
	March 31, 2017 compared to the same period a year ago. The majority of the increase occurred in overall bank salaries and employee benefits


	as full-time equivalent employees increased from 56 at March 31, 2016 to 67 at
	March 31, 2017. The increase in personnel and the Banks new branch building in Crawfordville also led to a 21.7% increase in occupancy and equipment, which further contributed to higher noninterest expense.




	Income Taxes.




	Income tax expense is based on amounts reported in the statements of earnings after adjustments for
	nontaxable income and nondeductible expenses, and consists of taxes currently due plus deferred taxes on temporary differences in the recognition of income and expense for tax and financial statement purposes. Income tax expense was $309,000 for the
	three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to income tax expense of $203,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The higher provision relates to earnings before income taxes of $845,000 for the three months ended March 31,
	2017 compared to earnings before income taxes of $585,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2016.



	LIQUIDITY



	Liquidity describes our ability to meet financial obligations, including lending commitments and contingencies, which arise during the normal
	course of business. Liquidity is primarily needed to meet the borrowing and deposit withdrawal requirements of the Companys clients, as well as meet current and planned expenditures. Management monitors the liquidity position daily.


	Our liquidity is derived primarily from our deposit base, scheduled amortization and prepayments of loans and investment securities, funds
	provided by operations, and capital. Additionally, as a commercial bank, we are expected to maintain an adequate liquidity reserve. The liquidity reserve may consist of cash on hand, cash on demand deposit with correspondent banks, federal funds
	sold, and marketable securities such as United States government agency securities, municipal securities, and mortgage-backed securities. Our primary liquid assets accounted for 24.8% and 22.8% of total assets at March 31, 2017 and
	December 31, 2016, respectively.


	The Bank also has external sources of funds through the FHLB, unsecured lines of credit with
	correspondent banks, and the State of Floridas Qualified Public Deposit Program (QPD). At March 31, 2017, the Bank had access to approximately $29.6 million of available lines of credit secured by qualifying collateral
	with the FHLB, in addition to $16.3 million in unsecured lines of credit maintained with correspondent banks. As of March 31, 2017, we had no borrowings under any of these lines. Furthermore, some of our securities are pledged to
	collateralize certain deposits through our participation in the State of Floridas QPD program. The market value of securities pledged to the QPD program was $9.3 million at March 31, 2017.


	Our core deposits consist of noninterest bearing accounts, NOW accounts, money market accounts, time deposits and savings accounts. We closely
	monitor our level of certificates of deposit greater than $250,000 and large deposits. At March 31, 2017, total deposits were $286.2 million, of which $7.3 million was in certificates of deposits of $250,000 or more, excluding
	Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs). We maintain a Contingency Funding Plan (CFP) that identifies liquidity needs and weighs alternate courses of action designed to address those needs in emergency situations. We perform a quarterly
	cash flow analysis and stress test the CFP to evaluate the expected funding needs and funding capacity during a liquidity stress event. We believe that the sources of available liquidity are adequate to meet all reasonably immediate short-term and
	intermediate-term demands and do not know of any trends, events, or uncertainties that may result in a significant adverse effect on our liquidity position.

	CAPITAL RESOURCES



	Stockholders equity was $27.6 million at March 31, 2017, compared to $27.1 million at December 31, 2016. During
	the first quarter of 2017, the Board of Directors declared and PMHG paid an annual dividend of $0.07 per share of common stock. On March 28, 2017, the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a Registration Statement on Form

	S-1

	to sell up to $15.0 million in shares of common stock. We expect the offering to close during the second quarter of 2017. At March 31, 2017, the Bank was considered to be well capitalized
	under the FDICs Prompt Corrective Action regulations with an 8.65% Tier 1 Leverage Capital Ratio, a 11.54% Common Equity Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio, a 11.54% Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio, and a 12.79% Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio,
	all above the minimum ratios to be considered well capitalized.


	The following is a summary at March 31, 2017 and
	December 31, 2016 of the regulatory capital requirements to be well capitalized and the Banks capital position.

	CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES







	(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures




	We maintain controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that PMHG files or submits
	under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Based upon managements evaluation of those controls
	and procedures performed within the 90 days preceding the filing of this Report, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that, subject to the limitations noted below, the Companys disclosure controls and
	procedures (as defined in Rule

	13a-15(e)

	under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) are effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by PMHG in the reports that it files or submits under
	the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commissions rules and forms.


	We intend to continually review and evaluate the design and effectiveness of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures and to
	improve the Companys controls and procedures over time and to correct any deficiencies that we may discover in the future. The goal is to ensure that senior management has timely access to all material financial and nonfinancial
	information concerning the Companys business. While we believe the present design of the disclosure controls and procedures is effective to achieve its goal, future events affecting its business may cause the Company to modify its disclosure
	controls and procedures.

	Table of Contents





	(b) Changes in Internal Controls




	We have made no significant changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended March 31, 2017, that have
	materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.




	(c) Limitations on the
	Effectiveness of Controls




	Our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, does not
	expect that our disclosure controls and internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control
	system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems,
	no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty,
	and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control.


	The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no
	assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
	deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

	Item 1.




	Legal Proceedings





	From time to time, we are a party to various matters incidental to
	the conduct of a banking business. Presently, we believe that we are not a party to any legal proceedings in which resolution would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, liquidity, results of operation, cash
	flows, or capital levels.



	 









	Item 1A.




	Risk Factors





	While the Company attempts to identify, manage, and mitigate risks and
	uncertainties associated with its business to the extent practical under the circumstances, some level of risk and uncertainty will always be present. Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form

	10-K

	for the
	year ended December 31, 2016 describes some of the risks and uncertainties associated with our business. These risks and uncertainties have the potential to materially affect our cash flows, results of operations, and financial condition. We do
	not believe that there have been any material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form

	10-K

	for the year ended December 31, 2016.    



	 









	Item 2.




	Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds





	On January 17, 2017,
	the Company issued 1,273 shares to members of its Board of Directors in lieu of $18,728 in cash fees. During the first quarter, PMHG issued 200 shares to officers and directors who exercised stock options and paid $2,000 upon such exercises. The
	shares were issued in accordance with the intrastate exemption from registration pursuant to Section 3(a)(11) of the Securities Act of 1933, because the Company is doing business within the State of Florida and each acquirer and offeree of
	securities resides within the State of Florida.

	(c)


	Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrants disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of

	5.


	The registrants other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrants auditors and the audit committee of the

	(a)


	All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrants ability to record,
	process, summarize and report financial information; and




	 




	 


	(b)


	Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrants internal control over financial reporting.
