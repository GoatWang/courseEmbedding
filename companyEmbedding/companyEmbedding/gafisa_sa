Gafisa: What Is The Current Situation? - Gafisa S.A. (NYSE:GFA) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Gafisa: What Is The Current Situation?Nov. 2.14 | About: Gafisa S.A. (GFA) Daniel Gilcher Value, special situations, long onlySummaryWe introduce Gafisa and discuss recent news about the company.We analyze its recent fundamental data in relation to past performance.We find that Gafisa is a stable company trading at interesting prices.This article discusses the recent situation at Gafisa SA (NYSE:GFA). It is our goal to grow the understanding of the company under the latest developments and hence to support possible investment decisions.
Introduction
Gafisa is the third largest company in Brazil, developing, constructing and selling mainly private housing projects. The company is in the business for more than 50 years and is also listed in the Indice Bovespa, Brazil's most important index.
Gafisa SA's business is generally separated in two different units a) Gafisa and b) Tenda. It also holds a 30% stake in the company Alphaville.
While the Gafisa unit is focused on more expensive (upper) middle-class buildings, Tenda is providing affordable houses. This happens within the large public program 'minha casa, minha vida' (my house, my life). Alphaville is covering the product range between these two units.
The company as a whole is currently studying the possibility of separating the two genuine parts Gafisa and Tenda into two different and independent companies.
The share price of GFR is in steady decline for years now and has recently hit new lows.

With that overview in mind we will now discuss qualitative and quantitative issues. In a first step we will briefly analyze the company's financial situation. This will enable us to estimate how healthy and stable the company is. A second step is the discussion of current or future issues of the company. We aim to create a clearer picture of the company, when we finally relate these two matters.

Fundamentals
Let us have a look at the different financial dimensions of the business. We will try to understand if a possible investment might be justified by underlying and reliable value.
Income Statement
The latest annual report (2013) stated a revenue of 982 million USD (2.48 billion BRL).
Net income before taxes reached 94 million USD (239 million BRL), which marks the first positive net income since 2011.
Earnings per share amounted to $1.61 (4.07 BRL), while the 5-year-average only indicates $0.13 (0.33 BRL) and the 10 year-average indicates $0.24. We should keep in mind, that the company went through hard times in 2011 and 2012. At that time the Gafisa was suffering from a massive drop in gross margins (8% in 2011). This margin is now stable and slightly above 25%. This is in the range of its 10 year average (26.5%). We can use that as an indication, that if gross margins stay constant in the future, the average earnings per share will increase. The data reported by the company for this year's Q1 and Q2 suggest that gross margins are stabilizing. However, the numbers for the first two quarters look slightly weaker on a year-on-year basis. The reasons for this development are found in the demanding market environment and will be discussed below.
After two troublesome years, the company is within its former range of income levels. Even as general revenue seems to still be weak, the company managed to cut costs and provide positive earnings per share. Based on the Q1/2 results, 2014 appears to be slightly weaker than 2013. This is also caused by additional but unique income in 2013 which came from discontinued operations. If we subtract this money, 2013 and 2014 look pretty much equal on the income side.
Cash flow
Last annual report stated a positive cash flow of 118 million USD (298 million BRL). This was the second year since 2009 that the company managed to achieve an overall positive inflow of money.
One important factor is the lower positive cash flow for GFA in 2013 compared to 2012. This is caused by an unusually high amount of positive 'other financing activities' in 2012. Another fact is the lower amount of sales of investments in 2013. This is especially true in relation to the 2012 purchases of these assets. One must remind here, that Gafisa mainly buys land for project development.

While the constant repayment of debt is shrinking Gafisa's cash position, the business has managed to contain a positive cash flow from its operations.
We think these two main factors drive GFA's cash flow:
a) The ratio of debt issued /debt repaid. We think it is important to notice, that this ratio is in favor of the debt repaid since four years now. This is a positive point since it means, that the business is able to bring down its overall debt level.
b) The profit made from investments mainly made in land. There is little use to observe this in quarterly reports, since it naturally takes time until purchased investment can be sold at a favourable price. The annual reports state a useful approximation here. They indicate that while the company keeps expanding its level of invested capital over the years, it has lately failed to improve its sales of investment simultaneously (year-on-year). We think that this latest problem might be associated with overall difficulties in the market and we will discuss possible reasons below. However, as long as the company is able to reduce its debt load even under these unfavourable conditions, we assume that this fluctuation should not be overvalued. Besides that, we would appreciate an increased sales of investment compared to the purchase (from year to year) in the future.
This leads us to the underlying financial background of the company as it is presented in the balance sheet.
Balance sheet
As mentioned above, the amount of cash at hand has decreased lately. But as short-term investments are also added to the overall cash position, the company has increased its position by 68% since 2010 and currently holds 801 million USD (2 billion BRL) of total cash.
The current assets amount to 2.24 billion USD (5.68 billion BRL) and are slightly below its 5 year average of 2.5 billion USD (6.3 billion BRL). Latest data suggests that company is currently decreasing its assets through the repayment of debts and the reduction of 'other currents assets'.

Total assets were reported at 3.24 billion USD (8.18 billion BRL); this marks a 14% increase over the last five years but is still slightly below the average of the same time-frame - 3.39 billion USD (8.58 billion BRL)
On the side of the current liabilities we see a 47 % increase of short-term debt since 2009 (458 million USD). At the same time the overall current liabilities have only increased 33% (1.06 billion USD). The short-term debts should also be regarded as being slightly above the average of the same five years, while current liabilities are quite below (avg. 5y short-term debt 550 million USD, avg. 5y current liabilities 2.28 billion USD).
Let us look at the non current liabilities now. Long-term debt of 754 million USD (1.9 billion BRL) rose only 6% since 2009. This is below its average (763 million USD) for the same time.
Other long-term liabilities could also be reduced 60% during the last five years.
As a consequence total liabilities remain at the same level as five years ago and well below its 5 year average. They amounted to 1.9 billion USD (4.99 billion BRL) for 2013.
Gafisa's latest quarterly reports underline the impression that the management is systematically reducing the size of the company's liabilities. As mentioned before, this is also paid with cash assets.
We know that short-term financing is a indispensable tool for Gafisa's business, but we think that a further improvement of the current/non current liabilities towards the latter would be beneficial for the company and enable the company to reduce financing costs.
Connecting the dots
From what we see in the financial data, we can conclude that Gafisa is a stable business. It went through a tough time during the last few years, but seems to be in safer waters now. We think it is clear, that current earnings per share are historically high, which might also be induced through the sale of assets in 2013 (Alphaville). Therefore, one should rather expect and base its further evaluation of the company on average past earnings than on the 2013 EPS alone. If we apply the 10-year average EPS to the current price of around $2 we understand that the company's stock is now trading at 8 times historical average earnings. This does neither indicate an uniquely cheap bargain nor a totally expensive stock, but surely represents a low price in terms of industry-average. The price-to-book ratio reveals another aspect: GFA is trading well below its book value.

It is remarkable that assets are so stable for the company and the management has successfully initiated the sustainable cut of liabilities. This will reduce the company's financial leverage and allow it to operate more flexibly. Generally increasing cash at hand would be beneficial in this respect as this position is currently decreasing rapidly.
Altogether, Gaifsa SA is a well-run business, that stands on stable financial grounds. As related to its market price we think that the company is relatively cheap.
In relation to its main index, it becomes clear, that the company has significantly underperformed during the last five or six years.

With these points in mind let us try to understand why Gafisa has performed so disappointingly for the last years and what investors can expect in the future.
Qualitative issues
Macro Situation
a) Social housing
The state-funded social housing program that started in 2009 led to a large upward movement of Gafisa's stock price. The program is continued until today and is an important part of Tenda's business. However, the market did only temporarily account for the large opportunities herein, which are based on long-term political decisions.
b) Struggling economy
During the last global economic crisis Brazil's economy suffered a lot. Its national economy has experienced serious headwinds and consumers are now worrying about increasing prices. As pointed out by the company itself, these rising uncertainties have a negative influence on the performance of the business. Many costumers tend to rethink their buying-decision under the current economic circumstances.
c) Urbanization
During the next decades more Brazilians will move towards the large urban centers of the country. This will provide a large opportunity for Gafisa as these regions are already its core business-areas today.

d) Demographics
Brazil has a large cohort of young people (now under 25). These people will need and demand decent housing in relation to their income. All statistics suggest, that with the improving educational standards and further development of the economy, the middle-class income households will keep increasing for the next decade. Gafisa as the strong 'subsidiary' of Gafisa SA is a renowned brand for providing houses for this middle-class population. Furthermore, the Gafisa branch is a very profitable part of the overall business.
The two companies
As mentioned before the management aims to split the company into its two main branches Gafisa and Tenda. Until today there are no details available about such a step in the future. The uncertainty about this matter might be a bearish factor in today's market. Apart from that, we do not have any evidence that such a procedure could happen without the participation of the shareholders. Without further details about possible scenarios and results for the shareholders, we think that long-term investments seem to be too risky here. This does not mean that the company in general is not trustworthy, it simply implies to evaluate all news with great care.
Conclusion
We think the outlook for Gafisa is only blared by the company's homemade problems. There is no doubt that there is a constant and growing need for decent housing in Brazil's urban areas. Demographics indicate a growing market for the next 10-15 years.
We are skeptical about the company's plan to separate its two main branches completely. The profitable Gafisa branch would most likely benefit from such a move.
If this matter is closed, we see positive macro-indicators for GFA's long-term business.
Summary
We presented Gafisa SA and its fundamental financials. We concluded that the company is, despite recent macro-economic headwinds, financially stable and managed well. The general environment is beneficial for the business in the long-run.
The unclear future of its branches makes the company an unattractive investment. There is currently no reliable information on the issue available. If this problem is settled and current price levels (or lower) are seen, we would consider the company a bargain opportunity. Its stable asset structure and low p/e and p/b ratios make the company worth watching.

Gafisa is a fourth largest Brazilian residential construction and real estate company, after Cyrela Brazil Realty, PDG S.A. MRV Engenharia and Brookfield Incorporações. It is based in São Paulo and present in various cities of Brazil. In the market since 1954 and specializes in projects of high standard, is also holding a number of other companies. Gafisa's predecessor company is Cimob Companhia Imobiliária (formerly known as Gafisa Participações S.A.), from whom Gafisa S.A. inherited brand name, assets, liabilities and market position.
History[edit]
Gafisa one of the leading companies in the ranking of the largest construction and real residential segment in Brazil, established in the developed markets more than 950 enterprises, among high-luxury residential condominiums, commercial buildings flats and shopping centers, representing approximately 10 million square meters of built area.
Headquartered in São Paulo and operations in other cities of the country, Gafisa was founded in 1954 in Rio de Janeiro, under the name Gomes de Almeida, Fernandes. At the end of the 80s became the Gafisa property and in 1997 from an association with GP Investments, has been called Gafisa SA In 2006 the Gafisa received a major shareholder: the Equity International Properties (EIP), a North American leader in real estate investment in Latin America, which belongs to Equity Group Investments (LLC), controlled by Samuel Zell.
Decided to expand its area of operation and become a national company, in 2004, Gafisa created the Board of New Business to care exclusively for new markets beyond the Rio-São Paulo. As a result of this strategy, the company is already present in Manaus (AM), Salvador (BA), Belém (PA), Fortaleza (CE), Maceió (AL), Goiânia (GO), Porto Alegre (RS), Cuiabá (MT ) in addition to cities in the interior of São Paulo (Itu, Campinas, Santo André) and Rio de Janeiro (Macaé).
The beginning of 2006 was marked by the entry of Gafisa in the New Market of Bovespa corporate governance, from the completion of initial public offering of shares of the company.
In 2007, the Gafisa made public offering of new shares, this time in the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), which became the first residential real Brazilian listed on NYSE. The event has consolidated its position as a company in line with global standards and global reputation in financial and operational excellence.
Also in the first quarter of 2007, following the diversification of regional and residential products, the company strengthened the commitment to serve the segment of low income through the establishment of Fit Residencial, subsidiary of Gafisa ventures that will develop a low price in urban areas . The first release, the Fit Jacana, occurred in March.
The Gafisa also signed a joint venture (JV) with Odebrecht, Brazil's largest engineering and construction, training of District New Ventures Real Estate. The new company will develop residential projects in large scale in the horizontal segment of people outside metropolitan areas.
The Gafisa consolidates its position of leadership in the segment of middle and upper middle class and is now a more geographically diversified construction company of Brazil. The conclusion of the first phase of the acquisition of Alphaville further strengthened this position, expanding its presence in 18 states and 40 cities.
Lawsuit decision details[edit]
The 4th Panel of the Superior Court of Justice ( STJ ) upheld the decision which appoints Gafisa S/A responsible for debts of over 50 million of its predecessor, Cimob Companhia Imobiliária S/A ("Cimob", current corporate name of Gafisa Imobiliária S/A). The board unanimously held that there is no way to review the understanding of First and Second level courts that implemented the "reverse piercing of the corporate veil" against Cimob Companhia Imobiliária to reach for and pawn goods from Gafisa S/A, for signs of fraud. In an attempt to defraud their creditors, the net assets of Cimob had been reduced with the incorporation of Gafisa S/A.
Gafisa S/A lacks with transparency in their Annual Financial Statement 2013 on page 98 when they state that "the Company is included as successor in enforcement actions and in which the original debtor is a former shareholder of Gafisa, Cimob Companhia Imobiliária (“Cimob”)” [...] and “cannot be held liable for the debt of a company that does not have any relationship with Gafisa. The final decision of the Company's appeal, however, cannot be predicted at this time."
The lack of transparency now pointed in the Annual Financial Statement 2013 is verifiable by examining the decision from the Supreme Court with regards to the Special Appeal 1.096.319, which can no longer be appealed against. It confirmed prior decision from the São Paulo Court according to which: "By the facts exposed, there is a very strong business relationship involving the appealing company Gafisa S/A and the other firms withheld in the present legal case, which evidence that 'Gafisa S/A was, in fact and in law, constituted as a projection of the debtors themselves', as stated by the defendant (page 836)" (Source: INFORMATION EXTRACTED FROM THE OFFICIAL WEBSITE OF THE SAO PAULO TRIBUNAL COURT, Interlocutory Appeal No. 9038558-78.2006.8.26.0000) .
Moreover, the Supreme Court, when judging the Special Appeal 109631-9, has also entered the understanding that when recognized to apply the Article 50 of the Civil Code to the decisions issued by the original court they may not be reviewed by that court, according to the prohibition imposed by Precedent 5 and 7 of that court.
On the other hand, the same Supreme Court has expressly consented to the inclusion of Gafisa S/A in the national register of defaulters, this is due to the existence of legal proceedings against them in the enforcement phase. This Judgment has acquired the authority of a final decision on 08/13/2013 ( REsp 1035060 SP ) .
Not only do the above decisions make Gafisa S/A liable for the debts of Cimob, but also serve as a precedent for many other similar cases.

Value
 Is Gafisa S.A undervalued based on future cash flows and its price relative to the stock market?

Value is all about what a company is worth versus what price it is available for. If you went into a grocery store and all the bananas were on sale at half price, they could be considered undervalued.



INTRINSIC VALUE BASED ON FUTURE CASH FLOWS

Often investors are willing to pay a premium for a company that has a high dividend or the potential for future growth.



PRICE RELATIVE TO MARKET

Value per share (BRL): BRL3.18
Exchange rate BRL/USD = 0.317
Value per share (USD): $1.01
Current discount (share price of $7.52): -647%

Estimate of Discount Rate
The discount rate, or required rate of return, is estimated by calculating the Cost of Equity.
Discount rate = Cost of Equity = Risk Free Rate + (Levered Beta * Equity Risk Premium)
Discount rate = 17.67% = 2.33% + (2 * 7.67%)

Estimate of Bottom Up Beta
The Levered Beta is the Unlevered Beta adjusted for financial leverage. It is limited to 0.8 to 2.0 (practical range for a stable firm).
Levered Beta = Unlevered beta (1 + (1- tax rate) (Debt/Equity))
3.422 = 0.789 (1 + (1- 30%) (476.68%))
Levered Beta used in calculation = 2

Equivalent number of shares
If the companies market cap is in a different currency to that of the listing the equivalent number of shares outstanding must be calculated.
Market Cap (BRL): 359
Exchange rate BRL/USD = 0.317
Market Cap (USD): $114
Equivalent shares outstanding: $114 / $7.52 = 15

Assumptions

The risk free rate of 2.33% is from the 10 year government bond rate in US.
The bottom-up beta is estimated by analysing other companies in the same industry.
The Equity Risk Premium is calculated by subtracting the risk free rate from the market return premium (10%) (source: Buffet).
The dividend discount model is automatically used for companies in the following industries: Banks, Insurance, Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), Diversified Financial Services and Capital Markets.

Nearly all companies have debt. Debt in itself isn’t bad, however if the debt is too high, or the company can’t afford to pay the interest on its debts this may have impacts in the future.

If there is any debt we look at the companies capability to repay it, and whether the level has increased over the past 5 years.


The level of debt (109%) compared to net worth is high (greater 40%).

The level of debt compared to net worth has been reduced over the past 5 years (143% vs 109% today).
