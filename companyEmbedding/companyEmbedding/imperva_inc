History[edit]
Imperva, originally named WEBcohort, was founded in 2002 by Shlomo Kramer, Amichai Shulman and Mickey Boodaei.[1] The following year the company shipped its first product, SecureSphere Web Application Database Protection, a web application firewall.[2] In 2004, the company changed its name to Imperva.[3]
In 2011 Imperva went public and was listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: IMPV).[4]
In 2014 the company acquired the remaining shares of Incapsula, a cloud security gateway startup named SkyFence, and real-time mainframe security auditing agents from Tomium Software.[5]

Defend Business-Critical Data and Stop Ransomware with Industry-Leading File Security Technology


File Firewall Specifications










Hackers know what they want and where to find it. Critical data centers such as file servers are targets for your "crown jewels," like intellectual property, financial information, deal data, or PII. Cybercriminals have become increasingly sophisticated, leveraging multiple tactics and tools, all with one goal: getting in. Imperva SecureSphere File Firewall protects sensitive unstructured data where it resides, so that you can prevent breaches, along with their resulting exposure, costs and brand damage.

Key Capabilities



DETECT AND MITIGATE RANSOMWARE IN REAL-TIME






When it comes to ransomware, time is of the essence. SecureSphere File Firewall leverages deception technology to immediately detect ransomware before it does widespread damage. The solution quarantines infected users or devices based on file access behavior, and uses a combination of real-time capabilities to help security teams detect, block, investigate, and report on ransomware infections. Learn more about how to protect your organization from ransomware.






KNOW WHEN THERE'S TROUBLE-IMMEDIATELY






SecureSphere File Firewall continuously monitors all user access to enterprise file storage systems and keeps a detailed record of file access activities across the company, including the actions of privileged users. Show that you have file security under control by using predefined reports to demonstrate tight controls and blocked attacks. 






Quickly Put a Stop to Suspicious Activity






Prevent your files from becoming an easy target for internal and external threats. With SecureSphere File Firewall, you can immediately respond to suspicious file access activity by generating notifications, or in certain situations, blocking access completely. With the industry's leading file security policy framework, you can trust that you have complete protection against unstructured data theft.






Incident Details at Your Fingertips






When it comes to incident response, the sooner the better. Begin file security investigations right away with immediate access to a record of all file activity across your organization. Uncover all the details in just a few clicks with interactive audit analytics that help you identify suspicious behavior, and document problems. 






Identify Insider Threats






SecureSphere File Firewall integrates with Imperva CounterBreach to identify users that are abusing their access or attempting to steal to enterprise files. CounterBreach analyzes granular user-centric details (such as user name, user department, client IP, and file share IP) and data-centric details (such as file operation, file path, file type and operation response time) to establish a baseline of typical user access to unstructured data and then pinpoint anomalous activity. Learn more about CounterBreach machine learning technology.

            As organizations adopt cloud computing, critical applications and data assets move to the cloud in different ways. And just as the cloud extends the concept of the data center, we have extended our leading Imperva SecureSphere platform into the industry’s most comprehensive portfolio for cloud security.
        

            For externally facing production applications many organizations are leveraging the economies of scale that Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) providers offer to realize significant cost savings. Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure are the public IaaS platforms most customers use today. For these customers, SecureSphere for Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure allows them to move their applications without sacrificing security.
        

            Finally, some organizations prefer a SaaS model for Web security (or Web application firewall delivery). Imperva Incapsula directly meets that need with an application-aware global data center network that provides cloud security as well as DDoS protection.

Agents and Big Data Security










Adaptability and Efficiency



All enterprise organizations are operating heterogeneous data environments with a mix of database types running on servers that may or may not be optimal for the load. Database administrators(DBAs) tasked with maintaining strict SLAs need to be mindful of performance sapping solutions. They also need to ensure that compliance and security requirements are met – preferably with a minimal amount of their time. With Imperva SecureSphere this is not an either-or situation. SecureSphere offers non-intrusive network monitoring appliances, lightweight agents, or a hybrid mix of the two. The solution does not require the DBA to install objects or alter the database configuration files or parameters in any way.
The SecureSphere advantages go even deeper; Imperva developed distinct agent models for Big Data and relational databases. The agent for relational databases is very lightweight with a typical overhead of 1%-3%(and can be capped). Differing significantly from native audit and legacy solutions that can impact disk I/O and server performance by 10%. SecureSphere achieves this high level of execution by a more efficient order-of-operations and the use of a flat-file audit log architecture optimized for writes. This model supports even the largest data warehouse environments and appliances.
Monitoring Big Data systems designed for extreme transaction speed and massive volumes requires a different model where the order of operations is shifted to take advantage of the Big Data environment itself. The distributed nature of the system minimizes performance overhead and ensures the audit process scales in parallel with the data lake.

Overview
Specifications







Protect Your Critical Web Applications and Data


SecureSphere WAF Specifications









Imperva SecureSphere Web Application Firewall (WAF) analyzes all user access to your business-critical web applications and protects your applications and data from cyber attacks. SecureSphere WAF dynamically learns your applications’ “normal” behavior and correlates this with the threat intelligence crowd-sourced from around the world and updated in real time to deliver superior protection.
The industry leading SecureSphere WAF identifies and acts upon dangers maliciously woven into innocent-looking website traffic; traffic that slips right through traditional defenses. This includes blocking technical attacks such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting and remote file inclusion that exploit vulnerabilities in web applications; business logic attacks such as site scraping and comment spam; botnets and DDoS attacks; and preventing account takeover attempts in real-time, before fraudulent transactions can be performed.

Key Features



Dynamic Application Profiling







SecureSphere WAF uses patented Dynamic Application Profiling to learn all aspects of web applications, including the directories, URLs, parameters, and acceptable user inputs to detect attacks with exceptional accuracy and block only bad parties, while eliminating impact to legitimate customers. SecureSphere WAF mitigates both technical attacks such as DDoS and SQL injection, as well as non-technical attacks such as comment spamming and site scraping.





Granular Correlation Policies Reduce False Positives 






SecureSphere WAF distinguishes attacks from unusual, but legitimate, behavior by correlating web requests across security layers and over time. SecureSphere Correlated Attack Validation capability examines multiple attributes such as HTTP protocol conformance, profile violations, signatures, special characters, and user reputation, to accurately alert on or block attacks with the lowest rate of false positives in the industry.






Flexible Deployment Options






SecureSphere WAF can be deployed as a physical or virtual appliance on-premises, and as a virtual image on Amazon Web Services or  Microsoft Azure. Physical appliance deployments are particularly flexible in that they allow SecureSphere WAF to run transparently, requiring virtually no changes to the customer’s network. And granular policy controls enable superior accuracy and unequaled control to match each organization’s specific protection requirements.






Deep Threat Intelligence








                                                            To protect against today’s well resourced cyber-criminals, it is vital to have an advanced warning system that is aware of and protects
                                                            against constantly evolving web-based attacks. Imperva ThreatRadar updates SecureSphere WAF with real-time threat intelligence
                                                            crowd-sourced from around the world and curated by Imperva Application Defense Center. ThreatRadar provides better protection, improves WAF accuracy,
                                                            and makes the security team more efficient by proactively filtering traffic from known bad sources so the security team can focus on what is really
                                                            important. The following ThreatRadar intelligence feeds are available:
                                                        

Reputation Services: Filters traffic based upon latest, real-time reputation of source
Community Defense: Adds unique threat intelligence crowd-sourced from Imperva users
Bot Protection: Detects botnet clients and application DDoS attacks
Account Takeover Protection: Protects website user accounts from attack and takeover
Fraud Prevention: Simplifies deployment of best-in-class partner fraud prevention solutions
Emergency Feed: Delivers latest signatures right away to mitigate against zero-day vulnerabilities instead of delivering them through periodic updates







Virtual Patching






SecureSphere WAF can perform “virtual patching” for your web applications via vulnerability scanner integration. Instead of leaving a web application exposed to attack for weeks or months while code is modified after discovering a vulnerability, virtual patching actively protects web applications from attacks to reduce the window of exposure, and decreases the costs of emergency fix cycles until you are able to patch them.






Customizable Reports for Compliance and Forensics






SecureSphere WAF rich graphical reporting capabilities enable customers to easily understand security status and meet regulatory compliance. SecureSphere WAF provides both pre-defined and fully-customizable reports. This enables you to quickly assess your security status and streamline demonstration of compliance with PCI, SOX, HIPAA and FISMA and other compliance standards.






Out-of-the-box SIEM Integration






SecureSphere WAF can easily integrates with most of the leading Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems such as Splunk, ArcSight, RSA enVision and others. SecureSphere WAF exports events as syslog messages in Common Event Format (CEF) and JSON format. SecureSphere WAF events in any SIEM are intuitively indexed and are easily searchable for quick incident response.

Scale Your Imperva SecureSphere Deployment with Centralized Management and Monitoring







                                Whether you're running on-premises or in AWS, managing a small site or multiple globally-distributed data centers,
                                and responsible for just your own infrastructure or tens of thousands of hosting customers, SecureSphere management solutions give you the visibility and control you need to protect your most important assets. Imperva SecureSphere MX Management Servers unify administration, logging, and reporting for multiple SecureSphere gateways. SecureSphere Operations Manager goes one step further, allowing you to centrally manage up to 50 MX Management Servers.
                            
SecureSphere Management Solutions enable you to cost effectively scale your deployment to every corner of the globe, on-premises and in AWS.

Key Capabilities




Unify Web, Database, and File Cyber Security Management







Deploying multiple SecureSphere gateways doesn’t require configuring each gateway separately. SecureSphere MX Management Servers consolidate administration, real-time alerting, auditing, and reporting of multiple gateways to a single, web-based console. SecureSphere MX Management not only lowers your operational costs, it also ensures that your audit policies, security policies and profiles are consistent across your entire deployment, an essential requirement for most governance and compliance policies.







Granularly Control User Access







You can ensure separation of duties and enable multi-tenant management with role-based access controls. Using these controls, you can create users and roles that define which policies, alerts, and reports administrators can view or edit. You can further segregate management responsibilities by limiting administrator access to specific web applications, sites, or database and file server groups.







Accelerate Compliance and Incident Response with Graphical Reports







Quickly assess your security status and streamline compliance with pre-defined and custom reports. Out-of-the-box reports for PCI, SOX, HIPAA and FISMA enable you to effortlessly demonstrate compliance with data protection and privacy mandates. Graphical reports can be created on-demand or scheduled for daily, weekly, or monthly distribution. MX Management Servers provide information-rich reports for instant visibility into security and compliance concerns.







Gain Unmatched Insight into Database and File Activity







By providing a consolidated view of audit data across multiple SecureSphere gateways, the MX Management Servers streamlines compliance and frees up IT resources and budget. The MX Management Servers provides sophisticated, interactive analytics, allowing you to drill down into the audit trail to understand what your database and file users are doing. With interactive audit analytics, you can view database and file activity from virtually any angle with just a few mouse clicks.







Easily Manage Large-scale Deployments with SecureSphere Operations Manager







SecureSphere Operations Manager (SOM) helps you improve efficiency, visibility, and control by centrally managing and monitoring multiple MX Management Servers. As a manager of managers, SOM also consolidates reporting and provides system-wide health metrics and statistics. With SOM, you can provision new applications and data stores quickly and cost-efficiently.







Centrally Distribute Policies to Dozens of MX Management Servers







With SecureSphere Operations Manager, you can configure and apply security and audit policies from one management console instead of logging into individual MX Management Servers. A common set of policies can be applied across multiple-domains, eliminating repetitive efforts, and ensuring security and auditing are consistent across the environment.

If your organization collects and processes data, you face two major challenges: how to meet data compliance requirements and how to effectively protect from data theft. Imperva SecureSphere data security solutions help you do both at scale in a cost-effective manner that leverages your existing infrastructure and IT staff.





10 Questions to Determine if Data Security is a Priority


Where specifically, is your private data located?
Who is accessing your data?
How do they access your data?
Should they have access to your data?
What users have access to your data, but do not use it?
Who is responsible if data is lost?
Who is responsible for monitoring that data?
How will you determine what data has been lost in a breach?
Is your process repeatable, scalable, timely and cost-effective?
What level of risk is acceptable?

Determining the best data security measures for your company can be a 
	daunting task. At the end of your research, you will find that protecting the
	 data requires a data-centric audit and protection solution that simplifies and
	  automates the deployment and maintenance processes while providing high-fidelity compliance and security results.

Data Audit and Protection

Imperva SecureSphere platform forms the foundation for SecureSphere data, file and web application solutions. The solutions are designed to work together, yet can be independently deployed. SecureSphere protects data in the cloud and on premise, providing out-of-the-box capabilities that reduce the requirement for specialized security and compliance resources and staff. Deployment is fast, enabling even the largest organizations to provide protection of critical data in days or weeks, with in-depth and full coverage across thousands of data stores in a matter of months.
 



 
Enterprises can seamlessly integrate the SecureSphere activity log with Imperva CounterBreach to protect enterprise data from theft and loss caused by compromised, careless or malicious users. CounterBreach combines Imperva expertise in monitoring and protecting data with advanced machine learning to uncover dangerous user data access activity. Based on granular inputs from SecureSphere and Skyfence, CounterBreach develops a behavioral baseline of typical user data access and then detects critical deviations from the norm.  CounterBreach proactively flags these dangerous actions for immediate investigation.

Company Overview













About Imperva



Imperva is a leading provider of data and application security solutions that protect business-critical information in the cloud and on-premises. Founded in 2002, we have enjoyed a steady history of growth and success, generating $264 million in 2016, with over 5,200 customers and more than 500 partners in 100+ countries worldwide.



We Protect What Matters Most



Cybercriminals constantly change their tactics. But what they are after, and how they ultimately make money, doesn’t change. They are after data. They make their money through extortion, via DDoS and ransomware, and through theft via data breaches. Today, data and applications are the fundamental assets of any enterprise. Data are the intellectual property and apps are what run the business. Imperva has a singular purpose: protect these critical assets from the ever-changing attacks of the cybercrime industry.








Case Study: Scott Sports Takes No Shortcuts in Security









How We Do It



Imperva protects you from cybercriminals – be they external actors or malicious insiders. Imperva protects cloud applications, websites and applications, files, SharePoint systems, databases and big data repositories from both theft and ever-evolving extortion attacks like DDoS and ransomware. Our technology provides granular visibility into how users access data and applications, and uses sophisticated user tracking and classification to detect and block cyberattacks, botnets, unauthorized users and malicious insiders. The Imperva Defense Center research team – comprised of some of the world’s leading experts in data and application security – roots out new attack methods and stops them before they reach you. So whether your critical digital assets are in the cloud or on-premises, in an application or in a database, you can be confident that Imperva will protect them from both the profit-driven cybercrime industry and nation-state actors.

Imperva to Sell Skyfence Product Line to Forcepoint




















February 08, 2017 16:10 ET

 | Source: Imperva Inc.






REDWOOD SHORES, Calif., Feb.  08, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Imperva, Inc. (NASDAQ:IMPV) today announced it has agreed to sell its Skyfence technology and service to Forcepoint. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to be complete during the first quarter of 2017. “The Skyfence solution provides an ideal complement to Forcepoint’s security solutions. We are confident that Forcepoint will continue investing in the Skyfence technology and nurture Skyfence customers as we have done,” said Anthony Bettencourt, president, chief executive officer and chairman of the board of Imperva. “This move will allow us to focus on our core business of helping customers protect critical data and applications.”  “Forcepoint is dedicated to delivering cybersecurity systems that help customers protect critical business data wherever it resides,” said Matthew P. Moynahan, chief executive officer of Forcepoint. “Since partnering with Imperva nearly two years ago, we’ve had the opportunity to see first-hand the power of the Skyfence technology – and how well it complements Forcepoint’s web security and DLP solutions. I’m confident that integrating Skyfence into Forcepoint’s portfolio will provide significant value to customers as they seek to secure IP and other data within an on‑premises infrastructure, as well as public cloud environments. We’re thrilled to welcome the Skyfence team to Team Forcepoint.” The Skyfence solution is a cloud access security broker that provides visibility and control over sanctioned and unsanctioned cloud applications. Skyfence customer support will be transitioned to Forcepoint upon close of the transaction. Imperva will continue to support integration with Skyfence via its CounterBreach and ThreatRadar solutions.  Forward Looking StatementsThis press release contains forward‑looking statements, including without limitation those regarding the expected timing of the completion of the transaction; and the ability to complete the transaction considering the various closing conditions; the anticipated benefits to Imperva and Forcepoint of the contemplated sale of the Skyfence technology and service; Imperva’s intention to focus in the future on its core business of helping customers protect critical data and applications and expectations regarding the future of Skyfence technology and customers; Forcepoint’s belief that Skyfence technology will complement its web security and DLP solutions; Forcepoint's belief that integrating Skyfence into Forcepoint’s portfolio will provide significant value to customers as they seek to secure IP and other data within on‑premise infrastructure, as well as public cloud environments; and Imperva’s intent to continue to support integration with Skyfence via its CounterBreach and ThreatRadar solutions.  These forward-looking statements are subject to material risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. Investors should consider important risk factors, which include: the risk that closing conditions may not be satisfied, including a number that are beyond either company’s control, the risk that Forcepoint will be unable to successfully integrate the Skyfence technology and service or achieve the anticipated benefits of such integration, the risk that Forcepoint will have difficulty retaining key employees of the Skyfence business; the risk that Skyfence’s development expenses are greater than anticipated; the risk that Imperva’s narrowed focus will not result in expected improvements in its business of helping customers protect critical data and applications, the risk that Imperva may not continue to support integration with Skyfence via its CounterBreach and ThreatRadar solutions due to changed market conditions, business focus or other factors; and other risks detailed under the caption “Risk Factors” in Imperva’s Quarterly Report on Form 10‑Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, on November 4, 2016, the risks detailed under the caption “Risk Factors” in Raytheon’s Annual Report on Form 10‑K filed with the SEC on February 10, 2016 and each company’s other SEC filings. You can obtain copies of either company’s SEC filings on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.  The foregoing information represents each company’s respective outlook only as of the date of this press release, and neither Imperva nor Forcepoint undertakes any obligation to update or revise any forward‑looking statements, whether as a result of new information, new developments or otherwise.
