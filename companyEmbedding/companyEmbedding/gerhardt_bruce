Bruce P. Gerhart 

Regional Director  | Cleveland

(216) 583-0812


Mr. Gerhart opened Love Funding’s Cleveland office in 2001 as a commercial loan originator. In 2007 he was promoted to regional director. In this capacity he oversees and originates multifamily, affordable and healthcare loans as well as the overall business development and support for Love Funding’s operations in the upper Midwest. He has over 35 years of experience in the real estate and banking industry.
Mr. Gerhart is charged with building upon the firm’s success in the Midwest, thus far achieved through a commitment to creative solutions, excellent service and a comprehensive understanding of the upper Midwest markets. In his current position, Mr. Gerhart focuses on maintaining existing relationships, expanding coverage of other segments of real estate finance and offering additional products to enable more tailored financing solutions for the firm’s clients. Some of those additional products have included Low Income Housing Tax Credits, Historic Credits, state and local funding and numerous tax abatements and subsidies.
Prior to joining Love Funding, Mr. Gerhart served as Midwest regional director of Capital Markets Finance for GE Capital Real Estate in Chicago and as senior vice president for Provident Bank in Cleveland, Ohio.  Earlier in his career, Mr. Gerhart served the city of Joliet, Illinois, in economic and community development. He later worked in affordable housing development for Burnham Development of Chicago and served as president of Burnham Securities.
Testimonials
“The various staff assigned to our portfolio by Love Funding were a pleasure to work with and displayed professionalism and competency at every level. I also want to thank our equity partner, Great Lakes Capital Fund, for their referral to Love. It has been a win-win transaction for everyone involved.” – Chief Financial Officer Bob Mosser, Keller Development
“I have been in the senior housing business for my entire adult life, which is now in excess of 30 years. During this time, we have put together 28 independent/assisted living projects and to accomplish this, we obviously have had to deal with many lenders. Bruce Gerhart stands out as one of the most informed, attentive, understanding and helpful representatives we have ever had. It has been a pleasure for me to have gotten to know him. He has made the business aspect go smoothly, and I have a great deal of faith in him. Something as complicated as a HUD Section 232 loan application, by its very nature, requires in depth assistance and direction from its lender’s agent. For this, we are eternally grateful.” – Bob Gillette, Founder and Chairman of American House Senior Living Communities
“Love Funding’s experienced and knowledgeable staff has been an incredible asset as we have refinanced a number of our developments over the past 10 years. They have been instrumental in helping us secure long-term, fixed-rate financing on a substantial portion of our real estate portfolio.” – Melissa Satterfield, Development Coordinator of Reenders, Inc.

Testimonials
“The various staff assigned to our portfolio by Love Funding were a pleasure to work with and displayed professionalism and competency at every level. I also want to thank our equity partner, Great Lakes Capital Fund, for their referral to Love. It has been a win-win transaction for everyone involved.” – Chief Financial Officer Bob Mosser, Keller Development
“I have been in the senior housing business for my entire adult life, which is now in excess of 30 years. During this time, we have put together 28 independent/assisted living projects and to accomplish this, we obviously have had to deal with many lenders. Bruce Gerhart stands out as one of the most informed, attentive, understanding and helpful representatives we have ever had. It has been a pleasure for me to have gotten to know him. He has made the business aspect go smoothly, and I have a great deal of faith in him. Something as complicated as a HUD Section 232 loan application, by its very nature, requires in depth assistance and direction from its lender’s agent. For this, we are eternally grateful.” – Bob Gillette, Founder and Chairman of American House Senior Living Communities
“Love Funding’s experienced and knowledgeable staff has been an incredible asset as we have refinanced a number of our developments over the past 10 years. They have been instrumental in helping us secure long-term, fixed-rate financing on a substantial portion of our real estate portfolio.” – Melissa Satterfield, Development Coordinator of Reenders, Inc.
