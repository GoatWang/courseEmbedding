Because such Class B Common Stock is convertible on a one-for-one basis into Class A Common Stock, assuming conversion of all shares of outstanding Class B Common Stock into Class A Common Stock, the percentage of the Class A Common Stock that Mr. Ergen may be deemed to own beneficially would be approximately 44.6%.  Because each share of Class B Common Stock is entitled to 10 votes per share, Mr. Ergen owns beneficially equity securities of DISH Network representing approximately 78.5% of the voting power of DISH Network (assuming no conversion of the Class B Common Stock).   2        CUSIP   No.   25470M 109           1.

Source and Amount of Funds and   Other Consideration     Item   3 is hereby amended and supplemented as follows:   The   2017 GRAT acquired beneficial ownership of 40,000,000 shares of Class B   Common Stock of DISH Network when Mr. Ergen contributed such shares of   Class B Common Stock to the 2017 GRAT on May 30, 2017.  Shares of Class B Common Stock may be   exchanged for shares of Class A Common Stock on a one-for-one basis at   any time.   The Reporting Persons may   from time to time acquire shares of Class A Common Stock for investment   purposes.  Such Class A Common   Stock may be acquired with personal funds or funds borrowed by the Reporting   Persons.           Item 4.   Purpose of Transaction.     Item   4 is hereby amended and supplemented as follows:   As   described in Item 3 above, Mr. Ergen contributed 40,000,000 shares of   Class B Common Stock to the 2017 GRAT on May 30, 2017.  Mr. Ergen established the 2017 GRAT   for estate planning purposes.  Under   the trust agreement establishing the 2017 GRAT, Mr. Ergens spouse,   Cantey M. Ergen, serves as trustee of the 2017 GRAT and holds sole voting and   investment power over the 40,000,000 shares of Class B Common Stock held   by the 2017 GRAT, except as set forth in Item 6 below.  Mr. Ergen receives an annual annuity   amount from the 2017 GRAT under the trust agreement governing the 2017   GRAT.  Members of Mr. and   Mrs. Ergens family are the beneficiaries of the 2017 GRAT.  The 2017 GRAT is scheduled to expire on   May 30, 2020.   During   the second quarter of each year, Mr. Ergen receives an annuity amount   from the 2014 GRAT under the trust agreement governing the 2014 GRAT,   assuming that the 2014 GRAT has not expired.    The number of shares of Class B Common Stock to be distributed as   an annuity payment is based in part on the price of the Class A Common   Stock on the distribution date and therefore cannot be calculated until the   date of distribution.  In addition to   shares of Class B Common Stock, the annuity payments (and their   associated timing) may include, and be based upon, amounts generated from the   holdings of the 2014 GRAT including, among other things, stock   recapitalizations or dividends paid or payable with respect to the   Class B Common Stock held by the 2014 GRAT.  On May 30, 2017, the 2014 GRAT   distributed all 17,106,320 shares of Class B Common Stock held by the   2014 GRAT to Mr. Ergen as an annuity payment, and the 2014 GRAT expired   in accordance with its terms.           Item 5.   Interest in Securities of the   Issuer.     Item   5 is amended and supplemented as follows:   (a)  This   filing is for the cumulative share holdings of an affiliated group as of the close   of business on May 30, 2017.  See Items 11 and 13 of the cover   pages to this Amendment No. 22 for the    8       aggregate   number of shares of Class A Common Stock and percentage of Class A   Common Stock beneficially owned by each of the Reporting   Persons.  The Reporting Persons beneficial ownership of shares of   Class A Common Stock excludes: (i) 8,185 shares of Class A   Common Stock held by certain trusts established by Mr. Ergen for the   benefit of his family; and (ii) 33,790,620 shares of Class A Common   Stock issuable upon conversion of shares of Class B Common Stock held by   certain trusts established by Mr. Ergen for the benefit of his family.   (b)  See   Items 7 through 10 of the cover pages to this Amendment No. 22 for   the number of shares of Class A Common Stock beneficially owned by each   of the Reporting Persons as to which there is sole power to vote or to direct   the vote, shared power to vote or to direct the vote and sole or shared power   to dispose or to direct the disposition.   (c) The   Reporting Persons have not effected any transactions in the Class A   Common Stock of DISH Network in the last sixty days other than as described   herein.   (d) Not applicable.   (e) On May 30, 2017, the 2014 GRAT distributed all   17,106,320 shares of Class B Common Stock held by the 2014 GRAT to   Mr. Ergen as an annuity payment, and the 2014 GRAT expired in accordance   with its terms.           Item 6.   Contracts, Arrangements,   Understandings or Relationships with Respect to Securities of the Issuer.   Item   6 is amended and supplemented as follows:   Except as   disclosed below and elsewhere in this Schedule 13D, none of the Reporting   Persons is party to any contracts, arrangements, understandings or   relationships, including, but not limited to, transfer or voting of any of   the securities of DISH Network, finders fees, joint ventures, loan or option   arrangements, puts or calls, guarantees of profits, division of profits or   loss, or the giving or withholding of proxies nor are any of the securities   pledged or otherwise subject to a contingency the occurrence of which would   give another person voting power or investment power over such securities.   The   trust agreements for the 2015 GRAT and the 2017 GRAT contain an irrevocable   provision that provides that the trustee will not dispose of any shares of   DISH Network held by the 2015 GRAT or the 2017 GRAT unless a Change of   Control Event occurs.  If a Change of Control Event occurs, the   trustee of the 2015 GRAT and the 2017 GRAT will have sole discretion   with respect to the disposition of any shares of DISH Network held by the   2015 GRAT and the 2017 GRAT, respectively.   A   Change of Control Event will occur if (i) as the result of a   transaction or a series of transactions any person other than Charles W.   Ergen (or a Related Party) individually owns more than fifty percent (50%) of   the total Equity Interests of either (A) DISH Network or   (B) the surviving entity in any such transaction(s) or a controlling   affiliate of such surviving entity in such transaction(s); and (ii) a   majority of the members of the Board of Directors of DISH Network are no   longer Continuing Directors; and (iii) as the result of a transaction or   a series of transactions any person other than Charles W. Ergen (or a Related   Party) individually owns more than fifty percent (50%) of the total voting   power of either (A) DISH Network or (B) the surviving entity   in any such transaction(s) or a controlling affiliate of such surviving   entity in such transaction(s); and (iv) Charles W. Ergen sells   Equity Interests of DISH Network such that he owns beneficially less than 50%   of the total Equity Interests that he owned beneficially immediately   following the grant of shares to the 2015 GRAT or the 2017 GRAT, as applicable.   For purposes of the   definition of Change of Control Event:    9       Continuing   Director means, as of any date of determination, any member of the Board of   Directors of DISH Network who:  (a) was a member of such Board of   Directors on the date on which the applicable grantor retained annuity trust   was established; or (b) was nominated for election or elected to such   Board of Directors either (x) with the affirmative vote of a majority of   the Continuing Directors who were members of such Board of Directors at the   time of such nomination or election or (y) by Charles W. Ergen and his   Related Parties.   Equity   Interest means any capital stock of DISH Network and all warrants,   options or other rights to acquire capital stock of DISH Network (but   excluding any debt security that is convertible into, or exchangeable   for, capital stock of DISH Network).   Related Party means,   (a) Charles W. Ergens spouse and each of his immediate family members;   (b) each trust, corporation, partnership or other entity of   which Charles W. Ergen beneficially holds an eighty percent (80%)   or more controlling interest or that was created for estate planning purposes   including without limitation the grantor retained annuity trusts effective   November 30, 2015 and May 30, 2017; and (c) the personal   representatives, administrators, executor, guardians, or any   person(s) or entit(ies) to which Charles W. Ergens shares of DISH   Network are transferred as a result of a transfer by will or the applicable   laws of descent and distribution.    10       Item 7.

A new Bing Ads customer is one that has not advertised on Bing Ads before. Enter promotional coupon code and spend $25 (applies to threshold and prepaid accounts) to receive $100 in Bing Ads credits.

If customer payment fails, the coupon amount will not be applied.  Ads will continue to run and accrue costs after any promotional credit has been used up. Any portion of the credit not used within ninety (90) days of credit redemption will expire and can't be carried over even if the Bing Ads Customer switches their payment method. Offer valid only to residents of the United States. In order for the offer to be valid, a form of payment must be entered into your account prior to redemption of the promotional code and prior to your account going live to take advantage of the credit. This offer may not be combined with any other offer, promotional code coupon or discount, separated, redeemed for cash, transferred, sold, or bartered. Microsoft, in its sole discretion, can close your account for any suspected coupon abuse. Refund of the $25 is not permitted.  See Bing Ads Terms and Conditions for more details at sign-up.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
