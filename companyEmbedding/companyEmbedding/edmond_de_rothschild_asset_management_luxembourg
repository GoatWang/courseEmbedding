          Edmond de Rothschild (Suisse) S.A. has chosen Clearstream as strategic partner to streamline and consolidate its third-party fund processing activities. Clearstream's investment funds processing infrastructure Vestima enables processing of all types of funds from mutual funds to hedge funds on a single platform.
        



          The current regulatory agenda has made asset safety a key concern for financial institutions and the asset management industry. The fifth Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (UCITS V) directive and the Alternative Investment Fund Manager Directive (AIFMD) are reshaping the operational landscape of the European investment funds market, leading to a growing need for transparency and efficiency in investment funds processing.
        



          Centralised solutions, such as Clearstream's Vestima platform support market participants to comply with the regulatory requirements and new rules on risk mitigation. As an international central securities depository (ICSD), Clearstream is highly regulated and publicly discloses its risk management principles. Vestima's secured transaction model is based on a delivery-versus-payment (DVP) settlement process that improves operational efficiency and reduces risks.
        



          Philippe Seyll, Co-CEO and Head of Investment Fund Services at Clearstream Banking, said: 'We are delighted that Edmond de Rothschild has chosen Vestima for the processing of fund assets. Clearstream operates according to the highest standards of safety for customer assets, including asset segregation and delivery-versus-payment settlement. Edmond de Rothschild will benefit from our focus on risk management and the operational efficiency of our streamlined one-stop-shop solution across all fund types.'

Outlook & Convictions n°1

This publication presents Edmond de Rothschild’s key convictions for macroeconomics, asset allocation strategy, and the principal asset classes.











A highly charged day for Gitana Team

At 08:30 GMT this Monday, the first oceanic trimaran designed to fly offshore was launched in Vannes, south-west Brittany, under the proud gaze of her owners, Ariane and Benjamin de Rothschild, her designers and builders, and of course the whole of Gitana Team supporting skipper Sébastien Josse. 











Sustainable development lies at the core of the Group’s commitment and the unique nature of its investment product offering

The Edmond de Rothschild Group’s 2016 Sustainable Development Report has just been released. In their introductory message, Ariane and Benjamin de Rothschild focus on the need to leverage the uniqueness of the Group which incorporates sustainable development as a central theme in its commitment, reflecting our ability to anticipate and respond in innovative ways to the changing outside world and our aspiration to make a positive contribution to society’s progress. 











Big Data: the digital revolution that is transforming businesses

What economic reality hides behind the word Big Data? Is the Big Data trend here to stay? Does Big Data really offer companies potential for creating value, and if so, which players are concerned?

          Edmond de Rothschild (Suisse) S.A. has chosen Clearstream as strategic partner to streamline and consolidate its third-party fund processing activities. Clearstream's investment funds processing infrastructure Vestima enables processing of all types of funds from mutual funds to hedge funds on a single platform.
        



          The current regulatory agenda has made asset safety a key concern for financial institutions and the asset management industry. The fifth Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (UCITS V) directive and the Alternative Investment Fund Manager Directive (AIFMD) are reshaping the operational landscape of the European investment funds market, leading to a growing need for transparency and efficiency in investment funds processing.
        



          Centralised solutions, such as Clearstream's Vestima platform support market participants to comply with the regulatory requirements and new rules on risk mitigation. As an international central securities depository (ICSD), Clearstream is highly regulated and publicly discloses its risk management principles. Vestima's secured transaction model is based on a delivery-versus-payment (DVP) settlement process that improves operational efficiency and reduces risks.
        



          Philippe Seyll, Co-CEO and Head of Investment Fund Services at Clearstream Banking, said: 'We are delighted that Edmond de Rothschild has chosen Vestima for the processing of fund assets. Clearstream operates according to the highest standards of safety for customer assets, including asset segregation and delivery-versus-payment settlement. Edmond de Rothschild will benefit from our focus on risk management and the operational efficiency of our streamlined one-stop-shop solution across all fund types.'

Edmond de Rothschild Asset Management retreats from UK retail market
























































































Fund manager Edmond de Rothschild Asset Management (EdRam) is to withdraw from the UK retail market less than a year after launching an ambitious expansion programme.
A number of roles will be shifted from London to Paris, Luxembourg and Geneva although there will be redundancies, including its UK head of wholesale Daniel Lee, who joined in September 2015 from Allianz.
The 60-year-old firm, which has €53bn (£45bn) in assets under management, opened its London office in 2012 and had been making a concerted push in the UK.
It launched 16 products in the UK in February 2016 alone, including equities, emerging market debt and convertible bond vehicles, in a move described by Guillaume Poli, deputy CEO, as a “key milestone in our expansion plans into this crucial market".
The retreat from the UK follows EdRam’s decision to close its Hong Kong office in December. Meanwhile the Geneva-based company’s new chief executive, Vincent Taupin, started work earlier this week after his predecessor Roderick Munsters resigned last month due to personal reasons, just seven months into the job.
EdRam is reportedly still committed to growing its infrastructure debt and hedge funds business in the UK.
EdRam did not respond to a request for comment.

Investment objective


The Sub-Fund follows a clearly defined strategy for the placement of assets based on controlling the portfolio's risk from annual volatility. Purchase and sale decisions are based upon quantitative systems over the medium term. The investment of assets is adjusted to the prevailing market conditions and has the objective of not exceeding a mean annual volatility of 2%. This objective does not constitute a guarantee of any sort that the mean annual volatility will never exceed 2%.

Commentary 30/06/2017



                            June saw the return of a risk-on/risk-off environment, as new numbers on the economy and central bank intervention heightened investor uncertainty. First, the US Federal Reserve announced a rate hike and outlined its plan to reduce the balance sheet. This allowed the US S&P index hit a record new high mid-way through the month. Mixed data on US employment plus ECB chief Mario Draghi's talk on possible tapering to end Europe's QE then began to impact the markets. As a result, bond yields came under heavy pressure, while equities corrected in the wake of changing oil prices. In contrast, emerging Asian economies, and China in particular, showed stronger resistance to this risk-off environment, notably thanks to a modest rebound in economic indicators. In line with recent months, Return Plus's allocation initially accompanied the market upturns well, with a diversified bond compartment. Then, the portfolio started to rotate its exposure while reducing its investment in emerging and sovereign bonds.

(1) The rating grades the funds on a scale from 1 to 7. This rating system is based on the average fluctuations of the net asset value over the past five years. It corresponds to the variation range of the portfolio upwards and downwards. If the net asset value is less than 5 years old, the rating is determined by other regulatory calculation methods. Historical data such as those used to calculate the rating may not be a reliable indication of the future risk profile. The current category is neither a guarantee nor an objective. Category 1 does not signify a risk-free investment.
