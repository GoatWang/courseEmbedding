Beware Early Reports on the TV Upfronts
Sure, there's $20 billion of commercial time in play. But the speculation that precedes real deals is practically pointless.

Women to Watch 2007 
Patricia Gottesman
Cablevision Systems Corp.


	By  

Claire Atkinson.
	

	
	
 Published on June 01, 2007. 







NEXT: Joanne Smith

Cablevision is experiencing a financial renaissance this year with digital subscribers up 19% year-on-year to 2.5 million and revenue up 12% to $1.6 billion through the first quarter. Playing her part in the Dolan family-run business is Patricia Gottesman. She's looking to push cable into fresh revenue-generating fields.





Patricia Gottesman, exec VP-digital marketing and commerce, Cablevision Systems Corp.



Ms. Gottesman has been selling her vision of what Cablevision can bring to companies looking to market their products through cable systems. Cablevision has already made a dent in the newspaper-classifieds business with its Optimum Autos service, which lists new and used cars. Ms. Gottesman, 48 and a mother of four, wants to take that digital vision a step further. 


"The amount of growth we've been able to create organically is something that we would now like to open to client business in the advertising arena," says Ms. Gottesman, adding that Cablevision Systems Corp. wants to develop an identity as a marketer, distributor and retailer of products. One idea being discussed is to sell newspaper and magazine subscriptions or even high-definition TV sets through the cable operator's digital platform. 


Emphasizing her digital mission, earlier this year Ms. Gottesman moved to exec VP-digital marketing and commerce, reporting directly to Chief Operating Officer Tom Rutledge.  


"Patricia has been the architect of Cablevision's extremely successful presentation of its products to consumers. She was instrumental in creating the Interactive Optimum suite of advanced video products," says Char Beales, president-CEO of the Cable & Telecommunications Association for Marketing.
