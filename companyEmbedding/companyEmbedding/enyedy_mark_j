ImmunoGen Appoints Mark J. Enyedy as President and Chief Executive 
      Officer




– Proven leader with deep experience building oncology businesses –






April 26, 2016 08:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



WALTHAM, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--ImmunoGen, 
      Inc. (Nasdaq: IMGN) a biotechnology company developing targeted 
      cancer therapeutics using its proprietary antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) 
      technology, today announced that Mark J. Enyedy has been appointed 
      President and CEO and elected to the Board of Directors, effective May 
      16, 2016. Mr. Enyedy succeeds Daniel Junius, who as previously announced 
      is retiring from these positions and will continue to serve on 
      ImmunoGen’s Board.
    


      “Today, ImmunoGen has a rich pipeline of wholly-owned oncology product 
      candidates, validated technology, and strong research,” said Stephen 
      McCluski, Chairman of the Board. “Mark’s proven leadership skills, 
      combined with his deep experience building science-based oncology 
      businesses, make him ideally suited to take ImmunoGen to the next level.”
    

      Mr. Enyedy, 52, brings over 25 years of combined general management, 
      business development and legal experience in the biotechnology industry. 
      He joins ImmunoGen from Shire plc, where he served as Executive Vice 
      President and Head of Corporate Development, leading the company’s 
      Strategy, M&A, and Corporate Planning functions and providing commercial 
      oversight for the company’s pre-Phase 3 portfolio. Previously, Mr. 
      Enyedy served as CEO of Proteostasis Therapeutics, Inc., following 15 
      years at Genzyme Corporation in diverse roles, most recently as 
      President of the Transplant, Oncology, and Multiple Sclerosis divisions. 
      During his tenure at Genzyme, Mr. Enyedy developed and executed the 
      company’s strategy to enter the oncology market, overseeing the launch 
      of two new products and managing a global business generating over $675 
      million in revenue with operations in more than 50 countries.
    

      Before joining Genzyme, Mr. Enyedy was an associate with the Boston law 
      firm Palmer & Dodge. He holds a J.D. from Harvard Law School and a B.S. 
      from Northeastern University. Mr. Enyedy also serves on the Board of 
      Directors of Fate Therapeutics.
    

      “I am pleased to be joining ImmunoGen at such an important time in the 
      Company’s evolution and helping to build upon its leadership position in 
      the exciting ADC field,” said Mr. Enyedy. “With a lead product in 
      later-stage testing for ovarian cancer, a strong portfolio of 
      earlier-stage candidates, and a productive technology platform, 
      ImmunoGen is well-positioned for sustainable innovation in oncology and 
      value creation for shareholders. I look forward to working with the 
      company’s outstanding leadership team, dedicated employees, and global 
      partners to develop and commercialize novel ADC therapies, which hold 
      the potential to deliver better outcomes for cancer patients across an 
      expanding range of indications.”
    

      “It has been a privilege to serve as the CEO of ImmunoGen over these 
      past seven years, and I am delighted to have Mark as my successor,” said 
      Mr. Junius. “Mark’s experience, vision, and leadership skills will 
      enable ImmunoGen to realize its full potential in developing better 
      therapies for cancer patients.”

                Our vision is to make Stuccu your first and only stop when it comes to online shopping. 
            

                And if we can make it fun for you, all the better.
            






                    What can we do for you?
                

                    We will search the web and bring you the best offers
                    from major online retailers.

                Using Stuccu will save you both money and time as you no
                longer need to search through dozens of websites.
                Instead, everything is in one place: Stuccu.
