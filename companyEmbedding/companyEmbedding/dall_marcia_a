Home : View All Brands : Marcia Teixeira Brazilian Keratin TreatmentMarcia Teixeira Brazilian Keratin TreatmentEstablished in February 2006, M & M International is a family owned and operated business with its headquarters and warehouse in Delray Beach, Florida. The owners, Marcia and Marcelo Teixeira have introduced a revolutionary product to the U.S. market and created an entirely new category of product never before seen in the salon industry.

The Brazilian Keratin Treatment is neither a traditional relaxer nor a straightener that can only be used on certain types of hair. In fact, theres nothing traditional about this new type of service. It does not involve a harsh, chemical treatment process that can over process hair and leave it in poor condition. The Brazilian Keratin Treatment is a universal product and can be used safely on just about any type of hair  dry, frizzy, over-processed, color treated, ethnic or even unprocessed virgin hair. Just about everyone can get the same great results  healthy, shiny, frizz-free, manageable hair.

About M&M International



Faced with a lifetime of struggling with harsh chemical relaxers, licensed cosmetologist Marcia Teixeira developed a passion and ambition to create a solution for herself and others who suffer from damaged and unmanageable hair. While traveling in Brazil many years ago, Marcia encountered what is known there as the “escova progressiva” – the “progressive blow dry”. She spent the next several years studying these systems and working with experts to perfect an innovative hair treatment formula that would be both safe and highly effective.





In February 2006, Marcia introduced the Marcia Teixeira® Keratin Treatment, creating an entirely new category of product never seen before in the salon industry. Consumer demand quickly grew. In 2008, through parent company M & M International, Inc., Marcia Teixeira® expanded through regional U.S. distribution. The Company has since gone on to establish users in over 50 countries world-wide.
