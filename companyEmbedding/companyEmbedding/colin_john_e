9 User Story mapping tips: forget your product – Colin J Riddell – MediumHomepageSign in / Sign upColin J RiddellBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingI am a dedicated technologist, Product Manager and startup enthusiast. Devoted to products. Aspiring entrepreneur. I build amazing teams at Joyful companies.Aug 29, 20169 User Story mapping tips: forget your productCredit: Matt Nelson. chalkthoughts.comUser Story mapping is awesome. However I have sometimes found that a story mapping session to put through a revision or improvement to a feature can be painful because it’s so easy to let the how the product currently works cloud the judgement and creative part on how it could or should work.Product Owners and Product Managers struggle with this if they have a deep knowledge of the products internals, but also I found that technical team members struggle with this in particular, as their knowledge of the innards is often more detailed. If a system is complex, it can be harder to think from the point of view of a blank slate. Some of the problems I have ran into when doing that:“But the system currently works like this”“We can’t do that because currently we do this..”“That wont work because of current limitation in how the database is structured.”What’s happening here is a conversation that’s sooo easy to fall into, but it simply shouldn’t be happening. When story mapping, even if it’s to improve a current feature in your product, you shouldn’t be thinking about the current limitations or parameters set out by the version you are trying to improve. You should be thinking about everything you want that feature to do, even if you hit on features that are already implemented.So I have jotted down my ideas to help keep you and your team on track when story mapping for improving your product features:Mapping curator. Every couple of minutes, you or someone in the group should remind the team that the goal is to forget about how the feature currently works and focus on the perfect product.Forget about the product. Forget about everything that’s currently implemented. You should encourage everyone in the session to do that, too. Think about that feature as if you were brainstorming and story mapping it for the first time.Go higher level. If you are struggling to keep things on track then try going higher level. For example, if you’re adding a new feature to the payment process of your e-commerce product — let’s say for example adding paypal integration and a couple of other things — then name the entire story map “Payment Process”; instead of “PayPal integration”. Avoid using the Epic level feature name for the entire story map — that will encourage you to think about the entire payment process, rather than just parts of it. That will help you get most out of that feature, and help you realise any missed interactions between that and other features.As a <persona>. I want <some feature>. So that <achieve something>. Back to story mapping basics. Even if you don’t write it on every card, make sure every card has been thought about from the users point of view — even better if you have a specific persona to work with.Huge user story maps? Headline the existing features. If the map is becoming huge because you are mapping existing features, that’s OK. You could maybe not fill out columns for features you know don’t need to change.Forget about the back-end. Forget about the database. This is User story mapping. Keep reminding yourself that. You are trying to build a plan on what the product should look like from the users point of view.“Quality in a service or product is not what you put into it. It is what the client or customer gets out of it.” ~Peter DruckerStick up all stories and ideas. Never don’t stick something. If you hear yourself, or someone else saying “I have an idea but I won’t put it up..” — slap yourself! It needs to go up. Whether it’s part of your MVP or if it’s realistically never going to get put into your product.. it doesn’t matter. You are User Story Mapping to brainstorm and plan your product and you want your product to be as brilliant as you and your team can build it. Once all the stories are up, and you are happy with that — then you can start to slice off versions, and negotiate what’s in your MVP, V1, V2 etc..Keep it lean. If you let the thoughts of the current implementation hold you back, you won’t be able to make progress with {Build, Measure, Learn} loop as taught in Eric Ries iconic book, The Lean Startup.Brainstorm ideas, then prioritise. Like I mentioned before, stick all stories up.. put them somewhere. Do that first — then, and only then: slice of different versions.Generally, keep in mind that even though you are working to improve a certain feature of your product, doing that with knowledge of how it currently functions doesn’t help improve the potential of your product at this stage. You want the product to be as awesome as it can be, and you want the user story mapping process to be as blue sky as possible. Knowledge on existing features can come after you have obtained all the ideas on how to improve the product — and the only way to do that is to start with a clean slate every time.I am a dedicated Product Manager and technologist working in Glasgow, Scotland.

Here are some of the most common attorneys individuals seek out when they require legal aid:Criminal Lawyer
A criminal defense lawyer is probably the attorney the average person imagines. Criminal attorneys are the men and women who defend individuals accused of a crime. The lawyer may work pro bono - for the public good - so the accused is certain to have representation, even if he or she cannot afford an attorney.Criminal lawyers are experts in the criminal justice system. They help their clients decide how to plead when first charged by the police and guide them through trial procedures.

There are several questions you should ask, but the majority will fall under three general topics:Training and Experience Questions
One of the best ways to determine quality is to examine an attorney's history. When you first step into a lawyer's office, you should check for the appropriate certifications and diplomas. You have to ask how long he or she has practiced law and request information that demonstrates the practice's success. Look for precise details such as percentage of cases settled out of court.Once you inquire about the broad details of their legal career, you should ask questions about their experience that pertains to your specific issue. You should ask how many similar cases they have handled and if they have special skills or training that applies specifically to your needs. Lawyers can't mention clients by name, but you should ask for basic details about identical past cases.Financial Questions
You need to ask about every possible fee that will come up when working with an attorney. You should request a list of all costs in advance so you won't be surprised by additional expenses like overhead. Also determine exactly when you will start being billed. You want to inspect paperwork carefully. If the attorney charges you for his or her experience, you need to make sure he or she will perform tasks personally and not hand it off to an assistant.Find out if the attorney has a flat fee or charges by the hour. Many civil lawyers work on contingency. Whatever the payment plan, make inquiries about how the lawyer plans to provide service for your money and what you can do if you start to feel unsatisfied with his or her performance.Lawyer/Client Relationship Questions
When you hire a lawyer, you're agreeing to work with someone over a certain period of time. You need to ask questions about how the attorney will communicate with you and what responsibilities you hold in the relationship. The attorney should let you know the best channel for quick communication and you need to inform him or her when you want updates.You should also ask questions to get to know the attorney as an individual in order to ensure this is a person you can trust. Ask about their legal philosophy and how he or she views the lawyer/client relationship. Great questions to start off with are ones that will make your life easier, such as how to keep fees down or what daily disruptions you should expect from a long legal battle. The more forthcoming the lawyer appears to be with individual needs, the better.Top Reasons to Hire a LawyerYou may keep a lawyer on retainer or you could turn to an attorney during specific situations. Here are some common reasons people begin seeking legal representation or advice:You Know Your Limitations
If you sign documents and you come across a word you don't recognize, you need assistance. You may need a third party to help you navigate important employment or real estate paperwork. It's essential you fully understand the terms of any legally binding documentation or activity you become a part of. If you are not an expert in a given field, you'll want to hire an attorney who is.A lawyer may find legal implications or opportunities you might miss. If you find yourself in a civil or criminal matter, a proper attorney ensures you don't receive a harsh punishment for a small mistake.You're Facing an Important Event/Decision
When making decisions critical to your financial stability or personal life, you may want a lawyer with expertise in your situation to make sure you do everything you can to arrive at the proper resolution. This is especially true when you become involved in a criminal case and your freedom is on the line.It's not just a matter of legal knowledge; lawyer's have access to numerous resources you do not. They have staff ready to work around the clock and experts in a variety of fields to give your important issues the attention they deserve.You Can't Be Impartial
During times when personal matters intersect with legal proceedings, you may need to have an advocate to prevent your emotions from getting in the way of level-headed thinking. For example, divorce lawyers can mediate a heated argument and help both partners get on with their lives.Emotional investment could be subtle. You may want to have a lawyer look over an investment opportunity that looks too good to be true or investigate the merits of a possible civil suit when you feel wronged.You're Out of Options
Many people turn to lawyers when they are in trouble. If you've been accused of a crime or are in a terrible financial situation, you can find an attorney who will work with what you have available to assist you as you deal with your problems.Personal injury lawyers find solutions for people who can no longer work under their own power and bankruptcy attorneys prevent people from giving in to debt. If you find yourself in a situation where you can't find a solution, a lawyer may be able to offer the counsel you need.How to Choose a LawyerWhen it comes time to choose a lawyer, you should start by searching close to home. While you probably don't want the conflict of interest that comes from being represented by a family member, friends and loved ones can recommend lawyers who served them well in the past. If you do have attorneys you are familiar with, ask who they believe would be best for you.After going through personal references - especially from individuals who had similar needs - you should broaden your search through public information resources. You can call your area's attorney referral service or check legal organizations like Martindale-Hubbell. There are other resources available online. You should check websites for client reviews and other third-party forms of approval.When you build a list of possible candidates, perform a background check on each one. See if you can find information on their history and success record. Once you find a possible lawyer, you should call to arrange a consultation so you can ask your important questions in person.By performing the necessary research and taking every available precaution, you can narrow your search to the attorney most suited to your needs.

If you've been accused of a crime or are in a terrible financial situation, you can find an attorney who will work with what you have available to assist you as you deal with your problems.Personal injury lawyers find solutions for people who can no longer work under their own power and bankruptcy attorneys prevent people from giving in to debt. If you find yourself in a situation where you can't find a solution, a lawyer may be able to offer the counsel you need.How to Choose a LawyerWhen it comes time to choose a lawyer, you should start by searching close to home. While you probably don't want the conflict of interest that comes from being represented by a family member, friends and loved ones can recommend lawyers who served them well in the past. If you do have attorneys you are familiar with, ask who they believe would be best for you.After going through personal references - especially from individuals who had similar needs - you should broaden your search through public information resources. You can call your area's attorney referral service or check legal organizations like Martindale-Hubbell. There are other resources available online. You should check websites for client reviews and other third-party forms of approval.When you build a list of possible candidates, perform a background check on each one. See if you can find information on their history and success record. Once you find a possible lawyer, you should call to arrange a consultation so you can ask your important questions in person.By performing the necessary research and taking every available precaution, you can narrow your search to the attorney most suited to your needs.
