Insight Communications was an American multiple system operator (MSO) which was founded in 1985 that served the states of Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio. Until its purchase by Time Warner Cable in 2011, Insight was the ninth largest cable operator in the United States with 760,000 subscribers.
Acquisition by Time Warner Cable[edit]
On August 13, 2011, Time Warner Cable (which was acquired by Charter Communications in 2016) announced its purchase of Insight Communications for $3 billion. The sale will create cost efficiencies of approximately $100 million annually through savings on programming expenses and other cost reductions, with the bulk of the savings realized within two years of the close of sale. With Insight's 2011 conversion of its television services from analog to digital, Time Warner Cable expects Insight to have lower capital requirements of 10-12% of revenues upon completion of the acquisition, which is subject to approval by the Federal Communications Commission and Insight franchisees. The merger was completed February 29, 2012.[1][2] On March 9, 2013, letters were sent to Insight customers informing them that starting in June 2013, Insight Communications will be completely absorbed, and Insight service will be replaced by Time Warner Cable. Former Insight customers continue to be able to utilize their former 'insightbb.com' email addresses through Time Warner Cable's email system.

Before: NELSON and COOK, Circuit Judges; SARGUS, District Judge.*
OPINION
COOK, Circuit Judge.


1
Defendant-Appellants Insight Communications Company, L.P., and Insight Kentucky Partners II, L.P. (collectively "Insight") appeal the district court's decision denying Insight immunity from Plaintiff-Appellee Knology, Inc.'s Sherman Act and 42 U.S.C. § 1983 claims. Because the Noerr-Pennington doctrine insulates Insight from liability for its activities here, we reverse the district court's decision.

I. Facts and Procedural History

2
Insight and Knology are cable television service providers. In 1998, the City of Louisville, Kentucky, passed Ordinance 76, granting Insight a franchise to provide cable services. The ordinance included a "level playing field" provision, which states:


3
The rights and privileges granted by this ordinance to Operator are not exclusive and nothing herein is intended to or shall be construed so as to prevent the City from granting other... franchises ... provided, however, that [they] are neither "more favorable" nor "less favorable" than those granted to Operator herein.... Any subsequent franchise shall contain a provision suspending the effective date for sixty (60) days during which time after prompt written notice is given by the City to Operator, if Operator claims to be aggrieved, parties shall seek a Declaration of Rights in a court of competent jurisdiction during which time the effective date of the subsequent franchise shall be suspended pending a final and nonappealable decision resolving the issue.


4
Two years later, Louisville enacted Ordinance 114, creating Knology's franchise, which provides:


5
The Franchise created by this Ordinance shall become effective as to any particular Franchisee sixty (60) days after the effective date of the Board of Aldermen's Resolution accepting that Franchisee's bid; provided, however, that if [Insight seeks] a Declaration of Rights ... the effective date of the Franchise ... shall be suspended pending a final and nonappealable decision resolving the issue.


6
As the ordinance anticipated, Insight then sued the City in state court, seeking a declaration that the City granted Knology a more favorable franchise. That suit triggered the ordinance provision suspending the effective date of Knology's franchise until a final, nonappealable decision resolved the issue. Some thirteen months later, the state court granted summary judgment for the City, finding that the franchises were substantially similar. The Kentucky Court of Appeals affirmed, and the Kentucky Supreme Court denied discretionary review.


7
Soon after Insight filed in state court, Knology sued Insight and the City in the district court. Knology argued, among other things, that Insight's state suit and its invocation of the provision suspending Knology's franchise violated the Sherman Act, the Cable Act, and the First Amendment, and that Knology was therefore entitled to damages under the Sherman Act and 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The district court, ruling on a motion for partial summary judgment, viewed Insight's one act — filing suit — as two acts, warranting two contrary holdings: Insight was immune under the Noerr-Pennington doctrine for its act of filing the state court action, but not immune for its invocation of the franchise suspension provision (by its act of filing the state court action). The district court also ruled Insight was not immune from Knology's § 1983 claims, because it was a "state actor" when it invoked the suspension. That reasoning led the court to enter summary judgment for Knology on its § 1983 First Amendment claim.


8
Insight appeals the district court's decision, arguing, among other things, that it is immune from the Sherman Act and § 1983 claims under Noerr-Pennington. We agree, reverse the district court's decision on that issue, and remand the case for further proceedings.

II. Noerr-Pennington Immunity

9
The Noerr-Pennington doctrine allows businesses to combine and lobby to influence the legislative, executive, or judicial branches of government or administrative agencies without antitrust or § 1983 liability, because the First Amendment's right of petition protects such activities. Eaton v. Newport Bd. of Educ., 975 F.2d 292, 298 (6th Cir.1992). The doctrine immunizes parties from liability under antitrust laws or § 1983 for actions taken when petitioning authorities to take official action, even where the petitioning activity has the intent or effect of depriving another of property interests, except under "very limited circumstances." Id.


10
Those circumstances exist where parties use the petitioning process, rather than the outcome of that process, as an anticompetitive weapon. City of Columbia v. Omni Outdoor Advertising, Inc., 499 U.S. 365, 380, 111 S. Ct. 1344, 113 L. Ed. 2d 382 (1991). Such a "`sham' situation involves a defendant whose activities are not genuinely aimed at procuring favorable government action at all, not one who genuinely seeks to achieve his governmental result, but does so through improper means." Id. (citations, emphasis, and internal quotation marks omitted).


11
Here, the district court appraised Insight's activities — lobbying for including the suspension provisions in Knology's franchise ordinance and filing its state court suit — as legitimate petitioning, protected by the First Amendment and therefore entitled to Noerr-Pennington immunity. But the district court went on to decide that:


12
the suspension of Knology's franchise, although triggered by Insight's lawsuit, was a product of contract not sought through litigation. The stay was not subject to governmental review, nor was it intended to persuade the government of anything. Instead, it was automatic.


13
We analyze the issue differently; we see filing the lawsuit and invoking the suspension provision as a single petitioning activity protected by the First Amendment and Noerr-Pennington. That this petitioning caused an anticompetitive result is irrelevant to Noerr-Pennington analysis. Insight did not stay anything — only the government prevented Knology from moving forward in the face of Insight's suit. Insight simply spurred the City to comply with its own ordinances, by filing its complaint — action immunized by Noerr-Pennington and the First Amendment.


14
The district court noted that the ordinance Insight's suit invoked was "a byproduct of Insight's prior petitioning." This, however, is irrelevant. As the district court acknowledged, the prior petitioning was protected. So was Insight's lawsuit. Considered separately or together, they cannot give rise to liability.


15
We conclude, therefore, that Insight engaged in nothing more than legitimate petitioning. As a result, Noerr-Pennington bars all of Knology's claims for damages against Insight arising out of the stay, foreclosing relief on the other issues raised on appeal.

III. Conclusion

16
We reverse the district court's decision denying Insight Noerr-Pennington immunity and granting Knology summary judgment on its First Amendment § 1983 claim, and we remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

Schnuerle v Insight Communications Company, L.P.

Case No. 2008-SC-000789-DG (KY S.Ct., Dec. 16, 2010)


		  		    Appellants, Michael Schnuerle, Amy Gilbert, Lance Gilbert, and Robin Wolff, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, appeal from an opinion of the Court of Appeals which affirmed an order of the Jefferson Circuit Court dismissing their class action complaint against Appellees, Insight Communications Company, L.P., and Insight Communications Midwest, LLC (collectively, Insight). The circuit court then determined, and the Court of Appeals agreed, that a provision contained in Insight's Broadband High Speed Internet Service Agreement (Service Agreement) barring class action litigation against Insight by its customers was enforceable. The Appellants' complaint was accordingly dismissed. Because of that disposition, the circuit court and the Court of Appeals did not address other issues, including Appellants' challenge to the enforceability of the Service Agreement's general arbitration clause and other specific provisions contained therein.   

We granted discretionary review to consider Appellants' challenges to the enforceability of the arbitration agreement and to the class action ban and confidentiality clauses contained therein. We granted Appellees' cross-petition for discretionary review to enable a more complete resolution of the whole controversy, including the disputed choice of law provisions of the agreement and the effect of severability of the challenged provisions from the remaining portion of the arbitration agreement.   

For the reasons stated below, we reverse the Court of Appeals, and conclude that, under the circumstances present herein, the contractual ban on class action litigation is void and unenforceable. We also determine as follows: 1) the Service Agreement's choice of law provision is not enforceable, and that Kentucky law, rather than New York law, is applicable to our review; 2) that the Service Agreement's general arbitration provision is not unconscionable, that it comports with Kentucky's public policy preference favoring arbitration, that it is severable from the provisions banning class actions and imposing confidentiality, and is therefore enforceable; and 3) that the provision imposing a confidentiality requirement upon the litigants to arbitration proceedings is void. I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND Appellants are Kentucky residents who entered into the Service Agreement with Insight for broadband Internet service. In order to receive service, the customers were required to either sign the Service Agreement or manifest their assent to the Service Agreement via the Internet.

Schnuerle v Insight Communications, Company, L.P.

Case No. 2008-SC-000789-DG (KY S.Ct., Aug. 23, 2012)


		  		    Appellants Michael Schnuerle, Amy Gilbert, Lance Gilbert, and Robin Wolff, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, filed a class action complaint in the Jefferson Circuit Court against their Internet service providers, Appellees Insight Communications Company, L.P., and Insight Communications Midwest, LLC (collectively, Insight). Insight's Broadband High Speed Internet Service Agreement (Service Agreement) contained an arbitration clause that required customers to submit damage claims against Insight to arbitration, and it also barred class action litigation against Insight by its customers. The circuit court determined that the class action ban was enforceable, and therefore it dismissed Appellants' complaint. The Court of Appeals affirmed. Because of that disposition, neither the circuit court nor the Court of Appeals addressed other issues, including Appellants' challenge to the enforceability of the Service Agreement's general arbitration clause. We granted discretionary review to consider the challenges to the enforceability of the arbitration agreement, as well as the class action waiver and confidentiality clauses contained therein. We granted Appellees' cross-petition for discretionary review to enable a more complete resolution of the whole controversy, including the disputed choice of law provisions of the agreement and the effect of severability of the challenged provisions from the remaining portion of the arbitration agreement.   

For the reasons stated below, we conclude that in cases governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, the decision of the United States Supreme Court in AT&T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion, U.S. , 131 S.Ct. 1740 (2011) precludes enforcement of a state policy invalidating upon grounds of unconscionability, a contractual waiver of class action participation, where the unconscionability is based solely upon the fact that the dispute involves a large number of de minimis claims which are unlikely to be individually litigated. Consequently, in the dispute before this Court, the contractual provision under which Appellants waived their right to participate in class action litigation is now enforceable under federal law. We also determine as follows: 1) that the Service Agreement's choice of law provision is not enforceable, and that Kentucky law, rather than New York law, is applicable to our review; 2) that the Service Agreement's general arbitration provision is not unconscionable, that it comports with Kentucky's public policy preference favoring arbitration, and is therefore enforceable; and 3) that the provision imposing a confidentiality requirement upon the litigants to arbitration proceedings is void and is severable from the remaining portions of the agreement. As such, we affirm in part, reverse in part and remand to the Jefferson Circuit Court for entry of a final judgment consistent with this opinion.   

I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND 

Appellants are all Kentucky residents who entered into the Service Agreement with Insight for broadband Internet service in the area of Jefferson County, Kentucky. In order to receive service, the customers were required to either sign the Service Agreement or manifest their assent to the Service Agreement via the Internet.
