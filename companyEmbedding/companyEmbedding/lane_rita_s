	Ms. Rita S. Lane
Vice President Operations, IPad/Mac Desktop/Mac Accessories, Apple Inc.




"The ability to think logically, work complex issues and articulate the alternatives enables good decisions. The principles and discipline of engineering seeks clarity. Clarity of thought and purpose helps leaders achieve nearly impossible goals. My engineering education has defined my career path and shaped me as an individual. From my early working years through my current role, I have continued to rely upon the fundamentals of my engineering education. I did not realize what a crucial choice I was making those many years ago when I decided to become an engineer; I am thankful for my choice."

		 

		A former officer in the U.S. Air Force, Rita Lane (MSEE ’91) is currently vice president of operations, iPad/Mac Desktop/Mac Accessories at Apple Inc.

		Before joining Apple, Ms. Lane was at Motorola where she served as senior vice president, supply chain. In that capacity she was responsible for all supply chain operations, strategic supply chain planning and, as a direct report to the CEO, was a member of the company’s senior leadership team. Prior to this role, she served as the chief procurement officer.

		Prior to Motorola, Ms. Lane was vice president and brand advocate for the System X and Storage supply chain operations at IBM. In that capacity, she was  responsible for driving end-to-end supply chain operational excellence in support of these lines of business, which included brand sourcing decisions, fulfillment management, information-technology transformation, new product introduction, supply-demand balancing and overall cost management. She has expertise in a wide array of critical supply-chain functional areas, including procurement, operations engineering, quality, logistics, manufacturing operations and product development. In addition, she has global geographic exposure to Asia, Europe and the Americas, and is known as a leader in supply-chain.

	The  new 147,000-square-foot Seng-Liang Wang Hall, located just north of the Northwestern Avenue Parking Garage, provides laboratories, offices, conference rooms, and support facilities for the College of Engineering. The  School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, the primary tenant, occupies 40 percent of the innovative, multipurpose building.

	To help provide new facilities for Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE), Patrick Wang, (BSEE ’72, MSEE, ’72, HDR ’04) and his wife, Lucy, both of Hong Kong, contributed the lead gift to the building, naming it in honor of Patrick’s late father. “My father did not have the opportunity to finish high school, let alone college, but he toiled tirelessly so I and other members of my family could go to college in America,” said Patrick. What Seng-Liang may have lacked in formal education, he made up for in ingenuity, character, dedication, entrepreneurship, and a strong belief in the value of education. In 1959, he founded Johnson Electric in Hong Kong, which today is a growing multinational company for which Patrick now serves as chairman and chief executive officer.

	Under Patrick’s leadership, Johnson Electric has evolved from a $2 million company best known for producing motors for high-end model racing cars, to a leader in motion subsystems, serving many industries including automotive, building automation, business machines, home technologies, health care, and power tools. 

	Patrick said he hopes that the building will afford students opportunities to flourish in ways that will contribute to a brighter future. “I was fortunate to be born to parents who were entrepreneurs. Their unwavering belief in me, and their mentorship, imbued in me a ‘can do’ attitude and a resilience to setbacks,” he said. “It is my wish that this building will be the place to nurture talents for professional excellence as well as entrepreneurship — so these things can make our world a better place for future generations.”

2016 Electrical & Computer Engineering Awards


I am delighted to recognize the 2016 Outstanding Electrical and Computer Engineers as we celebrate not only the successes of our OECEs, but the successes of our on-campus ECE family as well. Our OECE honorees join a distinguished group of alumni who have previously received this honor, engineers who represent the finest in their fields, and who embody the spirit of Purdue Engineering, applying a world view to work that has a universal impact.
            


We are proud to count each of our honorees among the Purdue ECE family of extraordinary people who are making a global impact. Please join me in congratulating our ECE honorees and our 2016 OECE honorees as they receive the School of Electrical and Computer Engineeringâs top accolade for professional achievement.
 
- Leah Jamieson, John A. Edwardson Dean of Engineering and Ransburg Distinguished Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering

The Outstanding Electrical and Computer Engineering (OECE) awards celebration â recognizing the achievements of alumni and faculty â is a highlight event each year. This year marks the first time in our 128-year-old history when our faculty size exceeds the 100 mark. And many of our performance metrics are at record or near-record levels. As we near the end of the planned engineering expansion, we are well-positioned to achieve even greater levels of excellence.


This evening I am pleased to congratulate a special group - the newest class of Outstanding Electrical and Computer Engineering alumni. We are proud of their achievements and Iâm honored to welcome them to an elite group. Their accomplishments along with those of our faculty serve as an inspiration to all of us, and especially to our students as they set out to make a difference in the world. 
- V. "Ragu" Balakrishnan, Michael and Katherine Birck Head and Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering

	Rita S. Lane

	Vice President of Operations for iPad/Mac Desktop/Mac Accessories, Apple Inc.
	MSEE '91

	For her leadership in technology operations and her ongoing support for underrepresented groups in the field of engineering

	As one of two sisters with two older brothers, Rita Lane credits her father with being a strong influence in her career decisions, which led her to places women didn't commonly go — including engineering.

	Her father, who was in civil engineering in the U.S. Air Force, spurred Lane's enthusiasm for both the military and numbers. "I remember playing long division games with him and my brothers," she says.

	The Air Force beckoned, especially since its academy had just opened enrollment to women. After graduating with her bachelor's degree in electrical engineering, she spent five years in the Air Force in various leadership positions before obtaining her master's in engineering from Purdue, where she attended on a NSF graduate fellowship.

	After graduating, she hired on with IBM in an entry level engineering position and began working in the high-tech industry. Since then, she has held senior level positions at IBM and Motorola. Today, she is Vice President of Operations for iPad/Mac Desktop/Mac Accessories with Apple Inc.

	She credits Purdue with making her strive harder for answers. "Undergraduate education teaches a lot of rote memorization," she says. "But I started to realize that history is written by the people who win, and these 'facts' are not necessarily the complete data. Purdue taught me to think and to question. That's fundamental. Purdue professors don't just want you to learn it, they want you to prove it."

	In addition to her outstanding career success, Lane dedicates time to support underrepresented groups within the industry, particularly gay and lesbian professionals, women, ethnic minorities, and veterans.

	Lane, whose mother is Japanese, has encountered stereotypes and prejudice. But she never really thought of herself as a "minority." "I just thought of myself as Rita," she says. "I was half Asian, a woman, and in the military, but I never thought about that. My father had always told me I could be or do anything I wanted." But after a while, Lane realized that often, minorities — particularly women — were naturally quieter, which could unfairly hurt their opportunities. "You can get some incredible ideas from the quietest person in the room."

	So, when asked, Lane was delighted to be able to serve on the Purdue electrical and computer engineering advisory board. "I've talked on campus, met with students, and met with the Women in Engineering organization. We have hired some incredible interns and full time employees to work at Apple.

	"I realized that out of all my supplier meetings in the past five years, I had met with only one technical woman senior executive in the supplier's company. After 30 years of working in technology, that's shocking. If I can possibly be a role model and encourage more women and minorities to be in the engineering field, I would like to try. "

	Career Highlights




				2008-present

				Vice President of Operations: iPad/Mac Desktop/Mac Accessories, Apple Inc.



				2006–2008

				Senior Vice President of Integrated Supply Chain, Motorola



				1991–2006
