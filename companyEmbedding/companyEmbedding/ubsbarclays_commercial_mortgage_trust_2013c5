      Fitch Affirms UBS-BB 2013-C5
    





February 06, 2015 11:58 AM Eastern Standard Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has affirmed 14 classes of UBS-Barclays Commercial 
      Mortgage Trust (UBS-BB) commercial mortgage pass-through certificates 
      series 2013-C5. A detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of 
      this press release.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      The affirmations are the result of stable performance of the underlying 
      pool since issuance. As of the January 2015 distribution date, the 
      pool's aggregate principal balance has been reduced by 17.1% to $1.46 
      billion from $1.76 billion at issuance. There have been no specially 
      serviced loans since issuance and no loans are defeased. Interest 
      shortfalls are currently affecting class G.
    

      The largest loan in the pool, Santa Anita Mall (14.7% of the pool), is 
      secured by 793,133 sf of a 1.2 million sf regional mall located in 
      Arcadia, CA. The property rent roll is diverse, with over 200 tenants in 
      occupancy. Forever 21 is the largest collateral tenant at 12.3%. As of 
      third quarter 2014 (3Q'14), occupancy was reported at 91.8%, compared to 
      95.0% at year-end (YE) 2013 and 98.1% at issuance. The net operating 
      income (NOI) debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) was a reported 3.21x for 
      year-to-date (YTD) 3Q'14, compared to 2.93x at YE 2013 and 3.19x at 
      issuance.
    

      The second largest loan in the pool, Valencia Town Center (13.4% of the 
      pool), is secured by a 647,803 sf of a 1.1 million sf regional mall 
      located in Valencia, CA. Edwards Theatres is the largest collateral 
      tenant at 6.2%. As of 3Q'14, occupancy was slightly down at a reported 
      at 88.8%, compared to 94.5% at YE 2013 and 96.7% at issuance. The NOI 
      DSCR was a reported 2.97x for YTD 3Q'14, compared to 3.14x at YE 2013 
      and 3.19x at issuance.
    

      Of the Top 15 loans, three have significant tenant rollover risk in 2014 
      and 2015. The Starwood Office Portfolio (8.9% of the pool) has 31.3% of 
      the leases expiring in 2016 spread over the six properties in the 
      portfolio. 155 Fifth Avenue (1.9% of the pool) has 41.2% and 28.1% of 
      its leases expiring in 2015 and 2016 respectively, and Tisch Tower (1.9% 
      of the pool) has 26.4% and 16.1% of its leases expiring in 2015 and 
      2016, respectively. Cash management trigger has been activated for the 
      Starwood Office Portfolio and 155 Fifth Avenue. Fitch will monitor the 
      performance of each loan as leasing status updates are received.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      All classes maintain Stable Outlooks. Due to the recent issuance of the 
      transaction and stable performance, Fitch does not foresee positive or 
      negative ratings migration until a material economic or asset level 
      event changes the transaction's portfolio-level metrics. Additional 
      information on rating sensitivity is available in the report ' UBS- 
      Barclays Commercial Mortgage Trust 2013-C5' (May 10, 2013), available at www.fitchratings.com.
    

      Fitch affirms the following classes as indicated:
    

      --$55.6 million class A-1 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$17 million class A-2 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$200 million class A-3 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$629.5 million class A-4 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$110.5 million class A-AB at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$120.7 million class A-S* at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$96.5 million class B* at 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$0 class EC at 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$57.5 million class C* at 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$70.5 million class D at 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$27.8 million class E at 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$27.8 million class F at 'Bsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      --$1,160.2 million** class X-A at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$96.5 million** class X-B at 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      *Class A-S, class B and class C certificates may be exchanged for class 
      EC certificates, and class EC certificates may be exchanged for Class 
      A-S, class B and class C certificates.
    

      **Notional amount and interest-only
    

      Fitch does not rate the class G certificates.
    

      A comparison of the transaction's Representations, Warranties, and 
      Enforcement (RW&E) mechanisms to those of typical RW&Es for the asset 
      class is available in the following report:
    

      --'UBS- Barclays Commercial Mortgage Trust 2013-C5 -- Appendix' (May 10, 
      2013).
    

      Additional information on Fitch's criteria for analyzing U.S. CMBS 
      transactions is available in the Dec. 10, 2014 report, 'U.S. Fixed-Rate 
      Multiborrower CMBS Surveillance and Re-REMIC Criteria', which is

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
