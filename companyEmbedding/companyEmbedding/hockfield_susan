Education and early career[edit]
She attended Horace Greeley High School in Chappaqua, New York and graduated in 1969. She received her bachelor's degree in biology from the University of Rochester in 1973 and her Ph.D in Anatomy and Neuroscience from the Georgetown University School of Medicine in 1979. Her doctoral dissertation centered on the subject of pathways in the nervous system through which pain is perceived and processed. Her advisor during her doctoral work was Steven Gobel.
Following a postdoctoral fellowship at the University of California, San Francisco, Hockfield in 1980 joined the staff of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory: she was hired by James Watson, who with Francis Crick had discovered the structure of DNA.
In 1985, Hockfield joined the faculty of Yale University. She received tenure in 1991 and became a full professor of neurobiology in 1994; soon thereafter she began to take on positions of administrative leadership. From 1998 to 2002, she served as Dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, with oversight of 70 graduate programs. Over the course of her deanship, the number of applicants to the graduate school doubled while graduate student support expanded in many dimensions, including healthcare, career counseling, fellowships, and opportunities to interact with faculty.
In December 2002, she was named Yale’s Provost, the university’s second-highest officer, with oversight of the university’s 12 schools. As Provost, she led major initiatives in science, medicine, and engineering, including a $500 million investment in scientific facilities.
During her time as dean and provost, Hockfield was at the center of the imbroglio surrounding the Graduate Employees and Students Organization and its unionization efforts. While Yale opposed the student union, Hockfield made healthcare for PhD students free and increased stipends for graduate students.[3]
In August 2004, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology named Hockfield its next president.
Scientific research[edit]
Hockfield pioneered the use of monoclonal antibody technology in brain research and discovered a gene that plays a critical role in the spread of cancer in the brain. Hockfield’s early work involved the application of monoclonal antibody technology to questions within neurobiology. She and her colleagues identified a family of cell surface proteins whose expression is regulated by neuronal activity early in an animal’s life and reflect the effect of early experience on brain structure and function. A link between her research and human health was made when it was suggested that one of these proteins played a role in the progression of brain tumors. Hockfield’s work on one type of brain tumor called glioma identified molecules that allow glioma cells to move through normal brain tissue, the feature that makes glioma particularly deadly.[4]
MIT presidency[edit]
Hockfield’s presidency saw the most successful period of fundraising in MIT history, during which MIT raised nearly $3 billion. However, the global financial crisis put great pressure on the Institute’s endowment, which was valued at $5.9 billion upon Hockfield’s arrival. It peaked at $9.9 billion in June 2008, then fell to $7.9 billion. By June 2011, it was valued at $9.7 billion. Through the financial ups and downs, Hockfield made affordability a priority: annual undergraduate financial aid increased by about 75 percent during her presidency.[5]
In her inaugural address, Hockfield called for MIT to cultivate the convergence of engineering and the life sciences to develop new approaches to address global challenges. Toward that end, she led, among other efforts, the establishment of the David H. Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research and the Ragon Institute of Massachusetts General Hospital, MIT, and Harvard University. She encouraged work that crossed disciplines, departments, and schools within MIT and that fostered collaborations among the Boston region’s academic medical centers and educational institutions. She catalyzed the development of the Massachusetts Green High Performance Computing Center in Holyoke, Massachusetts, an unprecedented collaboration of 5 universities, 2 private companies, and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to provide state-of-the art computation tools for research advances.[6]
Hockfield also announced her intention to develop a multidisciplinary, Institute-wide center around energy. That effort spawned the MIT Energy Initiative, which raised more than $350 million during Hockfield’s tenure and accelerated research on technologies and policies for a sustainable energy future. In 2009, U.S. President Barack Obama give a major address on U.S. energy policy at MIT, where Hockfield gave him the first tour of an MIT laboratory by a sitting U.S. president.
Hockfield encouraged concerted faculty research in an area she considered vital to the national interest: manufacturing. She launched “Production in the Innovation Economy,” a campus-wide project to provide a blueprint for 21st century manufacturing in America. During her presidency, she served as the inaugural co-chair of the White House–led Advanced Manufacturing Partnership (AMP), a task force of government, industry, and academic leaders. In an August 2011 New York Times op-ed, Hockfield wrote, “To make our economy grow, sell more goods to the world and replenish the work force, we need to restore manufacturing — not the assembly-line jobs of the past, but the high-tech advanced manufacturing of the future.”
During Hockfield’s presidency, the numbers of underrepresented minorities and women increased in the undergraduate, graduate, and faculty populations. The graduating Class of 2015 will be composed of 45 percent women and 24 percent underrepresented minorities. To address the growing interest in attending MIT (applications more than doubled during her tenure), Hockfield initiated an expansion of the undergraduate population. She also guided enhancements to student life and learning, including the construction of a new residence for graduate students and a restoration of MIT’s oldest building into an undergraduate residence with expanded space and amenities to foster student collaboration.
In December 2011, MIT launched MITx, a not-for-profit online learning platform that offers online versions of MIT courses free of charge. In May 2012, Hockfield and Harvard president Drew Gilpin Faust announced edX, an MIT-Harvard partnership in online education. EdX, Hockfield said, “represents a unique opportunity to improve education on our own campuses through online learning, while simultaneously creating a bold new educational path for millions of learners worldwide.”
During Hockfield’s presidency, the east side of MIT’s campus was enhanced by an extension to the Media Lab complex and a new building for the MIT Sloan School of Management. Hockfield led a comprehensive strategic planning process for campus development and also worked to foster the innovation cluster around Kendall Square, which at the end of her presidency was home to more biotech and life sciences companies per square mile than anywhere in the world.[7]
Personal life[edit]
Hockfield is married to Thomas N. Byrne, M.D (Clinical Professor of Neurology at the Harvard–MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology). They were married on March 2, 1991 at Yale's Battell Chapel.[8] They have a daughter, Elizabeth.

To address the growing interest in attending MIT (applications more than doubled during her tenure), Hockfield initiated an expansion of the undergraduate population. She also guided enhancements to student life and learning, including the construction of a new residence for graduate students and a restoration of MIT’s oldest building into an undergraduate residence with expanded space and amenities to foster student collaboration.
In December 2011, MIT launched MITx, a not-for-profit online learning platform that offers online versions of MIT courses free of charge. In May 2012, Hockfield and Harvard president Drew Gilpin Faust announced edX, an MIT-Harvard partnership in online education. EdX, Hockfield said, “represents a unique opportunity to improve education on our own campuses through online learning, while simultaneously creating a bold new educational path for millions of learners worldwide.”
During Hockfield’s presidency, the east side of MIT’s campus was enhanced by an extension to the Media Lab complex and a new building for the MIT Sloan School of Management. Hockfield led a comprehensive strategic planning process for campus development and also worked to foster the innovation cluster around Kendall Square, which at the end of her presidency was home to more biotech and life sciences companies per square mile than anywhere in the world.[7]
Personal life[edit]
Hockfield is married to Thomas N. Byrne, M.D (Clinical Professor of Neurology at the Harvard–MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology). They were married on March 2, 1991 at Yale's Battell Chapel.[8] They have a daughter, Elizabeth.

Education and early career[edit]
She attended Horace Greeley High School in Chappaqua, New York and graduated in 1969. She received her bachelor's degree in biology from the University of Rochester in 1973 and her Ph.D in Anatomy and Neuroscience from the Georgetown University School of Medicine in 1979. Her doctoral dissertation centered on the subject of pathways in the nervous system through which pain is perceived and processed. Her advisor during her doctoral work was Steven Gobel.
Following a postdoctoral fellowship at the University of California, San Francisco, Hockfield in 1980 joined the staff of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory: she was hired by James Watson, who with Francis Crick had discovered the structure of DNA.
In 1985, Hockfield joined the faculty of Yale University. She received tenure in 1991 and became a full professor of neurobiology in 1994; soon thereafter she began to take on positions of administrative leadership. From 1998 to 2002, she served as Dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, with oversight of 70 graduate programs. Over the course of her deanship, the number of applicants to the graduate school doubled while graduate student support expanded in many dimensions, including healthcare, career counseling, fellowships, and opportunities to interact with faculty.
In December 2002, she was named Yale’s Provost, the university’s second-highest officer, with oversight of the university’s 12 schools. As Provost, she led major initiatives in science, medicine, and engineering, including a $500 million investment in scientific facilities.
During her time as dean and provost, Hockfield was at the center of the imbroglio surrounding the Graduate Employees and Students Organization and its unionization efforts. While Yale opposed the student union, Hockfield made healthcare for PhD students free and increased stipends for graduate students.[3]
In August 2004, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology named Hockfield its next president.
Scientific research[edit]
Hockfield pioneered the use of monoclonal antibody technology in brain research and discovered a gene that plays a critical role in the spread of cancer in the brain. Hockfield’s early work involved the application of monoclonal antibody technology to questions within neurobiology. She and her colleagues identified a family of cell surface proteins whose expression is regulated by neuronal activity early in an animal’s life and reflect the effect of early experience on brain structure and function. A link between her research and human health was made when it was suggested that one of these proteins played a role in the progression of brain tumors. Hockfield’s work on one type of brain tumor called glioma identified molecules that allow glioma cells to move through normal brain tissue, the feature that makes glioma particularly deadly.[4]
MIT presidency[edit]
Hockfield’s presidency saw the most successful period of fundraising in MIT history, during which MIT raised nearly $3 billion. However, the global financial crisis put great pressure on the Institute’s endowment, which was valued at $5.9 billion upon Hockfield’s arrival. It peaked at $9.9 billion in June 2008, then fell to $7.9 billion. By June 2011, it was valued at $9.7 billion. Through the financial ups and downs, Hockfield made affordability a priority: annual undergraduate financial aid increased by about 75 percent during her presidency.[5]
In her inaugural address, Hockfield called for MIT to cultivate the convergence of engineering and the life sciences to develop new approaches to address global challenges. Toward that end, she led, among other efforts, the establishment of the David H. Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research and the Ragon Institute of Massachusetts General Hospital, MIT, and Harvard University. She encouraged work that crossed disciplines, departments, and schools within MIT and that fostered collaborations among the Boston region’s academic medical centers and educational institutions. She catalyzed the development of the Massachusetts Green High Performance Computing Center in Holyoke, Massachusetts, an unprecedented collaboration of 5 universities, 2 private companies, and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to provide state-of-the art computation tools for research advances.[6]
Hockfield also announced her intention to develop a multidisciplinary, Institute-wide center around energy. That effort spawned the MIT Energy Initiative, which raised more than $350 million during Hockfield’s tenure and accelerated research on technologies and policies for a sustainable energy future. In 2009, U.S. President Barack Obama give a major address on U.S. energy policy at MIT, where Hockfield gave him the first tour of an MIT laboratory by a sitting U.S. president.
Hockfield encouraged concerted faculty research in an area she considered vital to the national interest: manufacturing. She launched “Production in the Innovation Economy,” a campus-wide project to provide a blueprint for 21st century manufacturing in America. During her presidency, she served as the inaugural co-chair of the White House–led Advanced Manufacturing Partnership (AMP), a task force of government, industry, and academic leaders. In an August 2011 New York Times op-ed, Hockfield wrote, “To make our economy grow, sell more goods to the world and replenish the work force, we need to restore manufacturing — not the assembly-line jobs of the past, but the high-tech advanced manufacturing of the future.”
During Hockfield’s presidency, the numbers of underrepresented minorities and women increased in the undergraduate, graduate, and faculty populations. The graduating Class of 2015 will be composed of 45 percent women and 24 percent underrepresented minorities. To address the growing interest in attending MIT (applications more than doubled during her tenure), Hockfield initiated an expansion of the undergraduate population. She also guided enhancements to student life and learning, including the construction of a new residence for graduate students and a restoration of MIT’s oldest building into an undergraduate residence with expanded space and amenities to foster student collaboration.
In December 2011, MIT launched MITx, a not-for-profit online learning platform that offers online versions of MIT courses free of charge. In May 2012, Hockfield and Harvard president Drew Gilpin Faust announced edX, an MIT-Harvard partnership in online education. EdX, Hockfield said, “represents a unique opportunity to improve education on our own campuses through online learning, while simultaneously creating a bold new educational path for millions of learners worldwide.”
During Hockfield’s presidency, the east side of MIT’s campus was enhanced by an extension to the Media Lab complex and a new building for the MIT Sloan School of Management. Hockfield led a comprehensive strategic planning process for campus development and also worked to foster the innovation cluster around Kendall Square, which at the end of her presidency was home to more biotech and life sciences companies per square mile than anywhere in the world.[7]
Personal life[edit]
Hockfield is married to Thomas N. Byrne, M.D (Clinical Professor of Neurology at the Harvard–MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology). They were married on March 2, 1991 at Yale's Battell Chapel.[8] They have a daughter, Elizabeth.

About President Hockfield
“I want MIT to be the dream of every child who wants to grow up to make the world a better place. We need to reach those young explorers and bring them with us on the great adventure of discovery and innovation.”                                                                                              - Susan Hockfield


 

















 
Susan Hockfield has distinguished herself in a career that has spanned advanced scientific research and the presidency of one of the premier institutions of science and engineering in the world.
After earning a B.A. in biology from the University of Rochester and a Ph.D. from Georgetown University at the School of Medicine, carrying out her doctoral research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Dr. Hockfield was an NIH postdoctoral fellow at the University of California at San Francisco. She then joined the scientific staff at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York. Joining the faculty of Yale University in 1985, Dr. Hockfield focused her research on the development of the brain and on glioma, a deadly form of brain cancer.  She pioneered the use of monoclonal antibody technology demonstrating that early experience results in lasting changes in the molecular structure of the brain.  She gained tenure in 1994 and was named the William Edward Gilbert Professor of Neurobiology.
At Yale, Dr. Hockfield emerged as a strong, innovative university leader, first as dean of its Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, with oversight of more than 70 graduate programs, and then as provost, Yale’s chief academic and administrative officer.
From December 2004 through June 2012, Dr. Hockfield served as the sixteenth president of MIT, where she continues to hold a faculty appointment as professor of neuroscience and as a member of the Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research.
Under her leadership, in 2006 MIT launched the MIT Energy Initiative (MITEI), raising more than $350 million to accelerate research, policy and education towards a sustainable energy future.  In recognition of MITEI’s momentum, in October 2009 U.S. President Barack Obama delivered a major energy address at MIT and visited its research laboratories, the first American President ever to do so.  In 2015, she served as a member of a Congressional Commission evaluating the U.S. Department of Energy laboratories.

As the first life scientist to lead MIT, she championed the breakthroughs emerging from the historic convergence of the life sciences with the engineering and physical sciences, in fields from clean energy to cancer, including the founding of MIT’s David H. Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, the Institute for Medical Engineering and Science, and the Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard.

Long an advocate for the research university as an engine of innovation and economic growth, Dr. Hockfield also helped shape national policy on energy technology and next-generation manufacturing.  In June 2011, President Obama appointed her co-chair of the steering committee of the Advanced Manufacturing Partnership, a working coalition of academic, government and industry leaders.

In keeping with MIT’s entrepreneurial spirit and signature strength in working with industry, she actively fostered the burgeoning Kendall Square innovation cluster, populated by global giants and startups in the emerging frontiers of biotech, IT and energy, with many tracing their roots to MIT.

Dr. Hockfield argued forcefully for the value of MIT’s global engagement.  She actively expanded the Institute’s international education and research activities.  Building on the success of MIT OpenCourseWare in bringing high quality educational materials to learners the world over, in early 2012, Dr. Hockfield accelerated the conversation around cost, quality and access in higher education with the launch of MITx.  This online learning initiative offers a laboratory for experimenting with the use of new learning technologies and provides a portfolio of MIT courses to a virtual community of learners around the planet.  Further amplifying its impact, in May 2012, MIT joined forces with Harvard University to launch edX, a partnership in online education with the ambition to revolutionize learning on campus, to offer first-rate teaching to learners around the globe, and to open unprecedented paths to learning about learning itself.
	 
International research collaborations also grew under Dr. Hockfield's leadership, through new and expanded partnerships around the globe, from Abu Dhabi to Portugal, and from Singapore to Colombia.  MIT partnered to found several wholly new institutions, including the Singapore University of Technology and Design and the Masdar Institute of Science and Technology.

Dr. Hockfield was the first woman to lead MIT, a development welcome at an Institute where nearly half the undergraduates are now women. A signature of her presidency was her vocal commitment to making MIT a leader in building diversity all along the pipeline of talent.  In November 2008, she convened MIT’s first-ever Diversity Leadership Congress, a gathering of 300 leaders from across the Institute committed to cultivating a culture of inclusion that allows everyone to contribute at the peak of their ability.  These efforts led to a marked increase in women and minority scholars joining the MIT faculty.
 
Before returning to MIT following her presidency, Dr. Hockfield held the Marie Curie Visiting Professorship at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government, and the Carnegie Corporation/Vartan Gregorian Affiliated Fellowship at the American Academy of Rome.  She is an elected member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and an elected fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, where she is the president.  She also serves as a director of the General Electric Company, Council on Foreign Relations, Partners HealthCare System, and the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, and as a member of the board of trustees of the Boston Symphony Orchestra.  She has served as a U.S. Science Envoy to Turkey with the U.S. Department of State.
Dr. Hockfield holds honorary degrees from many institutions, including Brown University, Duke University, Mt. Sinai School of Medicine, Northeastern University, Tsinghua University (Beijing), Université Pierre et Marie Curie, University of Edinburgh, University of Massachusetts Medical School, University of Rochester, and the Watson School of Biological Sciences at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.  Her accomplishments have also been recognized by the Charles Judson Herrick Award from the American Association of Anatomists, the Wilbur Lucius Cross Award from the Yale University Graduate School, the Meliora Citation from the University of Rochester, the Golden Plate Award from the Academy of Achievement, the Amelia Earhart Award from the Women’s Union, the Edison Achievement Award, and the Pinnacle Award for Lifetime Achievement from the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce.
Dr. Hockfield lives in Cambridge with her husband, Thomas N. Byrne, M.D.  They have an adult daughter, Elizabeth.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

Education and early career[edit]
She attended Horace Greeley High School in Chappaqua, New York and graduated in 1969. She received her bachelor's degree in biology from the University of Rochester in 1973 and her Ph.D in Anatomy and Neuroscience from the Georgetown University School of Medicine in 1979. Her doctoral dissertation centered on the subject of pathways in the nervous system through which pain is perceived and processed. Her advisor during her doctoral work was Steven Gobel.
Following a postdoctoral fellowship at the University of California, San Francisco, Hockfield in 1980 joined the staff of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory: she was hired by James Watson, who with Francis Crick had discovered the structure of DNA.
In 1985, Hockfield joined the faculty of Yale University. She received tenure in 1991 and became a full professor of neurobiology in 1994; soon thereafter she began to take on positions of administrative leadership. From 1998 to 2002, she served as Dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, with oversight of 70 graduate programs. Over the course of her deanship, the number of applicants to the graduate school doubled while graduate student support expanded in many dimensions, including healthcare, career counseling, fellowships, and opportunities to interact with faculty.
In December 2002, she was named Yale’s Provost, the university’s second-highest officer, with oversight of the university’s 12 schools. As Provost, she led major initiatives in science, medicine, and engineering, including a $500 million investment in scientific facilities.
During her time as dean and provost, Hockfield was at the center of the imbroglio surrounding the Graduate Employees and Students Organization and its unionization efforts. While Yale opposed the student union, Hockfield made healthcare for PhD students free and increased stipends for graduate students.[3]
In August 2004, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology named Hockfield its next president.
Scientific research[edit]
Hockfield pioneered the use of monoclonal antibody technology in brain research and discovered a gene that plays a critical role in the spread of cancer in the brain. Hockfield’s early work involved the application of monoclonal antibody technology to questions within neurobiology. She and her colleagues identified a family of cell surface proteins whose expression is regulated by neuronal activity early in an animal’s life and reflect the effect of early experience on brain structure and function. A link between her research and human health was made when it was suggested that one of these proteins played a role in the progression of brain tumors. Hockfield’s work on one type of brain tumor called glioma identified molecules that allow glioma cells to move through normal brain tissue, the feature that makes glioma particularly deadly.[4]
MIT presidency[edit]
Hockfield’s presidency saw the most successful period of fundraising in MIT history, during which MIT raised nearly $3 billion. However, the global financial crisis put great pressure on the Institute’s endowment, which was valued at $5.9 billion upon Hockfield’s arrival. It peaked at $9.9 billion in June 2008, then fell to $7.9 billion. By June 2011, it was valued at $9.7 billion. Through the financial ups and downs, Hockfield made affordability a priority: annual undergraduate financial aid increased by about 75 percent during her presidency.[5]
In her inaugural address, Hockfield called for MIT to cultivate the convergence of engineering and the life sciences to develop new approaches to address global challenges. Toward that end, she led, among other efforts, the establishment of the David H. Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research and the Ragon Institute of Massachusetts General Hospital, MIT, and Harvard University. She encouraged work that crossed disciplines, departments, and schools within MIT and that fostered collaborations among the Boston region’s academic medical centers and educational institutions. She catalyzed the development of the Massachusetts Green High Performance Computing Center in Holyoke, Massachusetts, an unprecedented collaboration of 5 universities, 2 private companies, and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to provide state-of-the art computation tools for research advances.[6]
Hockfield also announced her intention to develop a multidisciplinary, Institute-wide center around energy. That effort spawned the MIT Energy Initiative, which raised more than $350 million during Hockfield’s tenure and accelerated research on technologies and policies for a sustainable energy future. In 2009, U.S. President Barack Obama give a major address on U.S. energy policy at MIT, where Hockfield gave him the first tour of an MIT laboratory by a sitting U.S. president.
Hockfield encouraged concerted faculty research in an area she considered vital to the national interest: manufacturing. She launched “Production in the Innovation Economy,” a campus-wide project to provide a blueprint for 21st century manufacturing in America. During her presidency, she served as the inaugural co-chair of the White House–led Advanced Manufacturing Partnership (AMP), a task force of government, industry, and academic leaders. In an August 2011 New York Times op-ed, Hockfield wrote, “To make our economy grow, sell more goods to the world and replenish the work force, we need to restore manufacturing — not the assembly-line jobs of the past, but the high-tech advanced manufacturing of the future.”
During Hockfield’s presidency, the numbers of underrepresented minorities and women increased in the undergraduate, graduate, and faculty populations. The graduating Class of 2015 will be composed of 45 percent women and 24 percent underrepresented minorities. To address the growing interest in attending MIT (applications more than doubled during her tenure), Hockfield initiated an expansion of the undergraduate population. She also guided enhancements to student life and learning, including the construction of a new residence for graduate students and a restoration of MIT’s oldest building into an undergraduate residence with expanded space and amenities to foster student collaboration.
In December 2011, MIT launched MITx, a not-for-profit online learning platform that offers online versions of MIT courses free of charge. In May 2012, Hockfield and Harvard president Drew Gilpin Faust announced edX, an MIT-Harvard partnership in online education. EdX, Hockfield said, “represents a unique opportunity to improve education on our own campuses through online learning, while simultaneously creating a bold new educational path for millions of learners worldwide.”
During Hockfield’s presidency, the east side of MIT’s campus was enhanced by an extension to the Media Lab complex and a new building for the MIT Sloan School of Management. Hockfield led a comprehensive strategic planning process for campus development and also worked to foster the innovation cluster around Kendall Square, which at the end of her presidency was home to more biotech and life sciences companies per square mile than anywhere in the world.[7]
Personal life[edit]
Hockfield is married to Thomas N. Byrne, M.D (Clinical Professor of Neurology at the Harvard–MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology). They were married on March 2, 1991 at Yale's Battell Chapel.[8] They have a daughter, Elizabeth.

Manufacturing a Recovery






Monday, August 29, 2011The New York TimesThe United States became the world's largest economy because we invented products and then made them with new processes. With design and fabrication side by side, insights from the factory floor flowed back to the drawing board. Today, our most important task is to restart this virtuous cycle of invention and manufacturing.
Rebuilding our manufacturing capacity requires the demolition of the idea that the United States can thrive on its service sector alone. We need to create at least 20 million jobs in the next decade to offset the effects of the recession and to address our $500 billion trade deficit in manufactured goods. These problems are related, given that the service sector accounts for only 20 percent of world trade.
To make our economy grow, sell more goods to the world and replenish the work force, we need to restore manufacturing – not the assembly-line jobs of the past, but the high-tech advanced manufacturing of the future.
Advanced manufacturing relies on the marriage of science and engineering in cutting-edge fields. Cepheid, a company in Sunnyvale, Calif., with a market capitalization of more than $2 billion, designs and manufactures sophisticated instruments that use DNA analysis to detect infectious disease and cancer; its products are used by hospitals for diagnoses and by the Postal Service to screen mail for anthrax.
A young company called Lilliputian Systems has developed handheld chargers for mobile devices. The chargers use a recyclable high-energy butane cartridge to replenish cellphones and laptops more efficiently than wall chargers. The company has a pilot manufacturing plant in Wilmington, Mass., plans to expand its production capacity and uses an Intel component that is also made in Massachusetts.
A decade ago, with help from an Energy Department grant, Yet-Ming Chiang, an M.I.T. professor, made a nanotechnology breakthrough by manipulating lithium battery electrodes. He helped start a company, A123 Systems, that now makes millions of batteries each year for hybrid-electric cars and buses and large-scale energy storage systems. The company recently hired its 1,000th employee. About half the workers at its plant in suburban Detroit were unemployed before A123 Systems came to town.
Like the jet aircraft made by Boeing, one of the country's largest exporters, products like these require sophisticated manufacturing equipment, operated by skilled workers, and benefit from the tight integration of design and production. With goods like these, the United States can reassert an economic advantage. If we can find ways for companies of every size to exploit the possibilities of nanofabrication, advanced materials, robotics and energy efficiency, we can create networks of innovation, joining lab research to new production processes and business models.
The United States remains a top producer of advanced technology products. But our dominance has eroded. Ten years ago, we enjoyed a trade surplus in advanced technology manufactured goods; today, that category accounts for an $81 billion annual trade deficit. Countries that used to make inexpensive goods at low cost have developed the capacity to produce high-value goods, making it ever more tempting for American companies to design at home but manufacture abroad.
This not only destroys manufacturing jobs, but also saps our inventive advantage. Manufacturers conduct 70 percent of private-sector research and development and employ 64 percent of the nation's scientists and engineers. But factories abroad attract design and engineering talent; over time, manufacturing off shore leads to innovation off shore. To make matters worse, as the President's Council of Advisers on Science and Technology recently reported, other nations are investing heavily in manufacturing, while our investments lag.
President Obama asked me and Andrew N. Liveris, the chief executive of Dow Chemical, to lead the Advanced Manufacturing Partnership, a group of industry, academic and government representatives that will find ways to speed up research in advanced materials and processes and increase our pool of skilled labor.
The private sector cannot do this alone. Since World War II, federal investments in scientific research have set off waves of job-creating innovation in aviation, electronics, computing, the Internet and biotechnology.
We need major innovation investment if we are to achieve similar breakthroughs today. But the recent debt-ceiling compromise could compel some 10 percent in cuts to federal research and development money in 2013. That could lead to a decade of stagnation. We must recommit to innovation if we want to re-energize our economy.
A new era of advanced manufacturing also requires more graduates with greater proficiency in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. The National Association of Manufacturers, together with community colleges, recently announced a program to certify a half-million skilled workers in five years and to connect them with manufacturing jobs. We need more initiatives like this.
The prospect of good manufacturing jobs in the United States is not a fantasy. Germany and Japan enjoy high wages and run major surpluses in manufactured goods; so can we. Our economy will thrive only when we make what we invent.

Background

		Dr. Susan J. Hockfield, Ph.D. served as the President Emeritus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) since July 2012 and Professor of Neuroscience at MIT since 2004. Dr. Hockfield served as the President of Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) from December 2004 to July 2012. A strong advocate of the vital role that science, technology and the research university play in the world, Dr. Hockfield believes that MIT can best advance its historic mission ... of teaching, research and service by providing robust and sustained support for the ideas and energies of its faculty and students. She is the first life scientist to lead MIT and a faculty appointment as professor of neuroscience in the Institute's Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences. She encourages collaborative work among MIT's schools, departments and interdisciplinary laboratories and centers to keep the Institute at the forefront of innovation. She believes that MIT's strengths in engineering and science uniquely position the Institute to pioneer newly evolving, interdisciplinary areas and to translate them into practice. Together with MIT's traditions of excellence in architecture and planning, management and the humanities, arts and social sciences, these strengths allows the Institute to continue to develop powerful solutions to era's greatest challenges. Her career spans more than 30 years as a leader in biomedical science research. Under her leadership, MIT has launched a major Institute-wide initiative in energy research and education and continues to expand its activities at the intersection of the life sciences and engineering, with a particular focus on cancer research. The Institute has also embarked on a sustained effort to strengthen support for student life and learning, including undergraduate curriculum renewal and is undertaking major campus construction and renovation projects with a combined value of approximately three-quarters of a billion dollars. Believing that MIT has a responsibility to help develop new models of teaching and research for a global age, Dr. Hockfield also served to extend the university's long tradition of international engagement through initiatives in education and scholarship with partners around the world. Before assuming the presidency of MIT, Dr. Hockfield was the William Edward Gilbert Professor of Neurobiology and provost at Yale University from 2002 to 2004. She joined the Yale faculty in 1985 and was named full professor in 1994. While at Yale, she played a central role in the university's leadership, first as dean of its Graduate School of Arts and Sciences from 1998 to 2002, with oversight of over 70 graduate programs and then as provost, the university's chief academic and administrative officer. Dr. Hockfield's research has focused on the development of the brain and on glioma, a deadly kind of brain cancer. She pioneered the use of monoclonal antibody technology in brain research, leading to her discovery of a protein that regulates changes in neuronal structure as a result of an animal's experience in early life. She discovered a gene and its family of protein products that play a critical role in the spread of cancer in the brain and may represent new therapeutic targets for glioma. Dr. Hockfield serves as Director of Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. She has been an Independent Director of General Electric Company since December 15, 2006. She serves as a Member of Board of Overseers at Boston Symphony Orchestra Inc. She serves as Director of National Geographic and the World Economic Forum Foundation She served as Director of the Laboratory's Summer Neurobiology Program from 1985 to 1997, concurrent with her teaching post at Yale and as a trustee of the laboratory. She served as a Director of QUALCOMM Incorporated from July 11, 2012 to March 8, 2016. She served on the National Advisory Neurological Disorders and Stroke Council of the NIH, as well as a number of other advisory boards. Her memberships in professional societies include the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the Society for Neuroscience. She is an elected member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. She was an NIH postdoctoral fellow at the University of California at San Francisco in 1979 to 1980 and then joined the scientific staff at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York from 1980 to 1985. Dr. Hockfield joined the faculty of Yale University in 1985. She has been a Trustee of the Carnegie Corporation of New York since September 2006.

Education and early career[edit]
She attended Horace Greeley High School in Chappaqua, New York and graduated in 1969. She received her bachelor's degree in biology from the University of Rochester in 1973 and her Ph.D in Anatomy and Neuroscience from the Georgetown University School of Medicine in 1979. Her doctoral dissertation centered on the subject of pathways in the nervous system through which pain is perceived and processed. Her advisor during her doctoral work was Steven Gobel.
Following a postdoctoral fellowship at the University of California, San Francisco, Hockfield in 1980 joined the staff of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory: she was hired by James Watson, who with Francis Crick had discovered the structure of DNA.
In 1985, Hockfield joined the faculty of Yale University. She received tenure in 1991 and became a full professor of neurobiology in 1994; soon thereafter she began to take on positions of administrative leadership. From 1998 to 2002, she served as Dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, with oversight of 70 graduate programs. Over the course of her deanship, the number of applicants to the graduate school doubled while graduate student support expanded in many dimensions, including healthcare, career counseling, fellowships, and opportunities to interact with faculty.
In December 2002, she was named Yale’s Provost, the university’s second-highest officer, with oversight of the university’s 12 schools. As Provost, she led major initiatives in science, medicine, and engineering, including a $500 million investment in scientific facilities.
During her time as dean and provost, Hockfield was at the center of the imbroglio surrounding the Graduate Employees and Students Organization and its unionization efforts. While Yale opposed the student union, Hockfield made healthcare for PhD students free and increased stipends for graduate students.[3]
In August 2004, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology named Hockfield its next president.
Scientific research[edit]
Hockfield pioneered the use of monoclonal antibody technology in brain research and discovered a gene that plays a critical role in the spread of cancer in the brain. Hockfield’s early work involved the application of monoclonal antibody technology to questions within neurobiology. She and her colleagues identified a family of cell surface proteins whose expression is regulated by neuronal activity early in an animal’s life and reflect the effect of early experience on brain structure and function. A link between her research and human health was made when it was suggested that one of these proteins played a role in the progression of brain tumors. Hockfield’s work on one type of brain tumor called glioma identified molecules that allow glioma cells to move through normal brain tissue, the feature that makes glioma particularly deadly.[4]
MIT presidency[edit]
Hockfield’s presidency saw the most successful period of fundraising in MIT history, during which MIT raised nearly $3 billion. However, the global financial crisis put great pressure on the Institute’s endowment, which was valued at $5.9 billion upon Hockfield’s arrival. It peaked at $9.9 billion in June 2008, then fell to $7.9 billion. By June 2011, it was valued at $9.7 billion. Through the financial ups and downs, Hockfield made affordability a priority: annual undergraduate financial aid increased by about 75 percent during her presidency.[5]
In her inaugural address, Hockfield called for MIT to cultivate the convergence of engineering and the life sciences to develop new approaches to address global challenges. Toward that end, she led, among other efforts, the establishment of the David H. Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research and the Ragon Institute of Massachusetts General Hospital, MIT, and Harvard University. She encouraged work that crossed disciplines, departments, and schools within MIT and that fostered collaborations among the Boston region’s academic medical centers and educational institutions. She catalyzed the development of the Massachusetts Green High Performance Computing Center in Holyoke, Massachusetts, an unprecedented collaboration of 5 universities, 2 private companies, and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to provide state-of-the art computation tools for research advances.[6]
Hockfield also announced her intention to develop a multidisciplinary, Institute-wide center around energy. That effort spawned the MIT Energy Initiative, which raised more than $350 million during Hockfield’s tenure and accelerated research on technologies and policies for a sustainable energy future. In 2009, U.S. President Barack Obama give a major address on U.S. energy policy at MIT, where Hockfield gave him the first tour of an MIT laboratory by a sitting U.S. president.
Hockfield encouraged concerted faculty research in an area she considered vital to the national interest: manufacturing. She launched “Production in the Innovation Economy,” a campus-wide project to provide a blueprint for 21st century manufacturing in America. During her presidency, she served as the inaugural co-chair of the White House–led Advanced Manufacturing Partnership (AMP), a task force of government, industry, and academic leaders. In an August 2011 New York Times op-ed, Hockfield wrote, “To make our economy grow, sell more goods to the world and replenish the work force, we need to restore manufacturing — not the assembly-line jobs of the past, but the high-tech advanced manufacturing of the future.”
During Hockfield’s presidency, the numbers of underrepresented minorities and women increased in the undergraduate, graduate, and faculty populations. The graduating Class of 2015 will be composed of 45 percent women and 24 percent underrepresented minorities. To address the growing interest in attending MIT (applications more than doubled during her tenure), Hockfield initiated an expansion of the undergraduate population. She also guided enhancements to student life and learning, including the construction of a new residence for graduate students and a restoration of MIT’s oldest building into an undergraduate residence with expanded space and amenities to foster student collaboration.
In December 2011, MIT launched MITx, a not-for-profit online learning platform that offers online versions of MIT courses free of charge. In May 2012, Hockfield and Harvard president Drew Gilpin Faust announced edX, an MIT-Harvard partnership in online education. EdX, Hockfield said, “represents a unique opportunity to improve education on our own campuses through online learning, while simultaneously creating a bold new educational path for millions of learners worldwide.”
During Hockfield’s presidency, the east side of MIT’s campus was enhanced by an extension to the Media Lab complex and a new building for the MIT Sloan School of Management. Hockfield led a comprehensive strategic planning process for campus development and also worked to foster the innovation cluster around Kendall Square, which at the end of her presidency was home to more biotech and life sciences companies per square mile than anywhere in the world.[7]
Personal life[edit]
Hockfield is married to Thomas N. Byrne, M.D (Clinical Professor of Neurology at the Harvard–MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology). They were married on March 2, 1991 at Yale's Battell Chapel.[8] They have a daughter, Elizabeth.

She also guided enhancements to student life and learning, including the construction of a new residence for graduate students and a restoration of MIT’s oldest building into an undergraduate residence with expanded space and amenities to foster student collaboration.
In December 2011, MIT launched MITx, a not-for-profit online learning platform that offers online versions of MIT courses free of charge. In May 2012, Hockfield and Harvard president Drew Gilpin Faust announced edX, an MIT-Harvard partnership in online education. EdX, Hockfield said, “represents a unique opportunity to improve education on our own campuses through online learning, while simultaneously creating a bold new educational path for millions of learners worldwide.”
During Hockfield’s presidency, the east side of MIT’s campus was enhanced by an extension to the Media Lab complex and a new building for the MIT Sloan School of Management. Hockfield led a comprehensive strategic planning process for campus development and also worked to foster the innovation cluster around Kendall Square, which at the end of her presidency was home to more biotech and life sciences companies per square mile than anywhere in the world.[7]
Personal life[edit]
Hockfield is married to Thomas N. Byrne, M.D (Clinical Professor of Neurology at the Harvard–MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology). They were married on March 2, 1991 at Yale's Battell Chapel.[8] They have a daughter, Elizabeth.

In an address to the National Governors Association, Hockfield described the conditions necessary for innovation to thrive. Using the case study of Yet-Ming Chiang, an MIT alumnus and professor who also founded A123 Systems, a battery manufacturer for electric vehicles, Hockfield spelled out the roles that academia, industry, and government have to play in stimulating innovation:

Rule One: Attract brilliant strivers and help them get all the education and hands-on experience they can handle.
Rule Two: Scientists and engineers can make great entrepreneurs – but an entrepreneurial culture helps them flourish.
Rule Three: Growing new ideas takes money – from the right source at the right time.
Rule Four: Innovation clusters are powerful – and they get stronger as they grow.
Rule Five: If we want to make US jobs, we can’t just make ideas here – we have to make the products here.

Hockfield also identified some of the challenges ahead, including making higher education more affordable, reforming immigration, advocating for federally funded research, and building dense research communities supported by universities, business and government.

Susan Hockfield, a distinguished neuroscientist and current Provost at Yale University, has been selected the 16th president of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, succeeding Charles M. Vest, who has led one of the world's foremost research universities for the past 14 years.   
Dr. Hockfield was elected by the MIT Corporation during a special meeting of that governing body on August 26.  She is expected to take office in early December.
In making the announcement, Corporation Chairman Dana G. Mead said, "As a strong advocate of the vital role that science, technology, and the research university play in the world, and with an exceptional record of achievement in serving faculty and student interests, Dr. Hockfield is clearly the best person to lead MIT in the years ahead.  She brings to MIT an outstanding record as teacher, scientist and inspirational leader with a reputation for bringing out the best in all the people with whom she works."
The William Edward Gilbert Professor of Neurobiology, Hockfield joined the Yale faculty in 1985. She was promoted to full professor in 1994 and quickly rose to the center of leadership at Yale, first as Dean of Yale's Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1998-2002), with oversight of over 70 graduate programs, and then as Provost, the university's chief academic and administrative officer, with oversight of the University's 12 schools.  
Richard C. Levin, President of Yale University, said, "Susan Hockfield has been an outstanding dean and provost.  She has the intelligence, judgment, and interpersonal skills to be a superb president.  She has a broad understanding of the future direction of science and technology, and is well prepared to assume the leadership of MIT and to take a leading role in shaping national science policy."
James A. Champy, who chaired the presidential search committee for the MIT Corporation, said, "Dr. Hockfield emerged from a stellar field of candidates as the best person to lead MIT to new frontiers of innovation and leadership in research and education.  She possesses a rare combination of scientific achievement, outstanding managerial talent, and an extremely engaging personal style that will serve MIT's faculty, students and staff very well." 
Institute Professor Jerome Friedman, who chaired the faculty advisory committee on the presidential search, commented,  "Professor Hockfield has made significant scientific contributions in her career, and she is highly appreciative of the creative blending of basic and applied research to address some of the most important problems of our time.  This and her commitment to the social sciences, humanities and the arts point to her interest in facilitating new intellectual interactions among faculty and students in all five Schools of the Institute. She is a superb choice to lead MIT."
Among other priorities, Hockfield says she intends to use her new position to encourage collaborative work among MIT's outstanding schools, departments, and interdisciplinary laboratories and centers to keep the Institute at the forefront of innovation. She sees MIT's strength in engineering uniquely positioning the Institute to pioneer newly evolving, interdisciplinary areas and to translate them into practice. She also hopes to accelerate the national discussion on improving K-12 science and math education.  She believes strongly in the value that international students and scholars bring to the educational and research programs of American universities, and in the importance of American universities working closely with leading academic centers around the world.   
Commenting on her election, Dr. Hockfield said, "Around the world, MIT stands as an emblem of discovery and innovation, produced through the scholarship of its outstanding faculty, students and graduates.  From my first conversations in the search process, the Institute's central themes - the pursuit of truth, integrity, and the great meritocracy - have resonated with my own core values.  This remarkable community's curiosity, intellectual commitment and passionate determination to solve problems have brought immeasurable benefit to humankind.  It is an enormous honor and a very great privilege to have been selected to join this effort as MIT's next president."
In her work as a neuroscientist, Hockfield pioneered the use of monoclonal antibody technology in brain research, leading to her discovery of a protein that regulates changes in neuronal structure as a result of an animal's experience in early life. More recently, she discovered a gene and its family of protein products that play a critical role in the spread of cancer in the brain and may represent new therapeutic targets for brain cancer. 
As Dean of Yale's Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, Professor Hockfield had responsibility for 73 doctoral and masters degree programs that enrolled approximately 2,300 students.  In addition, she had oversight for faculty appointments and promotions in all of the science and engineering departments and in several social science departments in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.  She played a key role in recruiting exceptional scholars and teachers and in increasing the number of women faculty.
During her tenure as Graduate School Dean, she effectively and creatively revitalized the administration of the school and addressed longstanding problems in academic, extracurricular and financial support for graduate students.  She worked with student, faculty and alumni groups to build a much stronger sense of community and to improve the integration of the Graduate School into the rest of the university.  The number of applicants to the Graduate School doubled to over 9,000 during her tenure and, through the establishment of an Office for Diversity and Equal Opportunity, the number of students enrolling from under-represented minority groups increased dramatically.    
As Provost, she has advanced Yale's major initiatives in science, medicine and engineering, which include a $500 million investment in new and renovated facilities for the sciences.  She has encouraged collaborative work throughout the university, bringing the humanities and the arts into new relationships and encouraging interactions between the humanities and the sciences. She has also worked to enhance administrative services for the entire university. 
Susan Hockfield received her bachelor's degree in biology from the University of Rochester in 1973, and earned a Ph.D. in anatomy and neuroscience from Georgetown University School of Medicine in 1979.  She carried out postdoctoral research at the University of California, San Francisco.  Prior to joining the Yale faculty, she was a Senior Staff Investigator at the Cold Spring Harbor laboratory, a research and educational institution focusing on cancer, neurobiology, plant genetics, genomics and bioinformatics.
Her husband, Thomas N. Byrne, is Clinical Professor of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Internal Medicine at Yale's School of Medicine. They have one daughter.

A New Century’s New Technologies










DAVOS – This year’s World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland, addresses threats to geopolitical stability and human life, and seeks ways to accelerate the design of more effective political, economic, and technological tools to address them. Among this generation’s most daunting challenges are food, water, and energy shortages; climate change and rising sea levels; and the spread of new, drug-resistant diseases. Humanity has faced threats to its existence and the health of the planet before, yet we have managed to avoid the apocalypse, or at least postpone it, through ingenuity and invention. This year’s Davos meeting will offer a glimpse of where the next life-, planet- and economy-saving discoveries and products will come from, and where we should invest our talents and treasure to fuel the next generation of transformative technologies.



An accelerating convergence of the biological, physical, and engineering sciences promises a stunning array of new technological solutions. Imagine a coal-fueled power plant that emits only water and clean air. Inside the plant, designer yeast cells transform the carbon dioxide released during the coal’s combustion into raw materials for floor tiles and other construction supplies.Or imagine a simple and inexpensive urine test that can diagnose cancer, eliminating the need for a surgical biopsy. And, when cancer treatment is needed, its toxic punch hits cancer cells selectively, with far fewer damaging side effects.Or imagine a future with plentiful food and fuel crops. Through improved seed stocks and more efficient water management, we can have crops that require less water, grow at higher density, and thrive in wider temperature ranges. And data-driven agriculture supply chains will move them more effectively to the market. These advances will enable us to feed and provide power – at a lower economic and environmental cost – to the anticipated 2050 population of nine billion people.These and other innovations are emerging from the convergence of biology and engineering that is now upon us. A new generation of scientists, engineers, and clinicians, educated more broadly than their predecessors, speak the languages of both and are working together in unprecedented ways. They are conversing across disciplines – not only engineering and biology, but also chemistry, physics, mathematics, and computation – and setting new paths for innovation, from initial discovery to the launch of advanced applications in the marketplace.The technologies on which many of us depend today arose from a parallel convergence of discoveries in physics and engineering in the early twentieth century. In 1900, the world did not have ready access to electricity, automobiles and aviation, or telecommunications. In much of the world, we now take these conveniences for granted; indeed, we regard them as necessities.What began as esoteric explorations of the workings of the physical world – the nature of electromagnetism and the atomic structure of matter, for example – became, in the hands of inventors and innovators, telecommunications, new drugs, medical imaging and devices, nuclear power, the computer chip, and the Internet. There are now more connected mobile devices than there are people on the planet.The products of electronic and digital industries will continue to expand their impact, with “big data,” the “Internet of things,” and the “industrial Internet” becoming increasingly prevalent. Beyond the extension of these twentieth-century technologies, we can also anticipate a new set of transformational industries – as yet nameless – as we advance into the new millennium.At the same time, just as the twentieth century’s convergence of physics and engineering transformed our lives, the accelerating convergence of biology and engineering is driving unprecedented discoveries that promise to create another platform for innovation, the rise of new industries, and economic growth. The manufacture of fuels and pharmaceuticals already relies on purpose-developed microbes that create sophisticated biological products. New manufacturing processes will incorporate specially designed microbes and computer-characterized compounds into an array of products.
