       NUTS & BOLTS INTERNATIONAL, INC. 100 Europa Drive, Suite 455 Chapel Hill, NC 28517 (919) 633-2488 (Ticker) NTBT (Share Structure) Dec.15,2015 A/S 100,000,000 O/S 6,537,500       Experience the ultimate in high speed eBook learning   Save time learning the nuts and bolts of interesting topics   Nuts and Bolts Press publishes eBooks on topics not found anywhere else. The Company was established on August 21, 2013 to publish eBooks under the Nuts and Bolts brand name. Earlier in 2013, the Company’s founder began developing the concept for an eBook publisher that would produce products that would appeal to tablet and Smartphone users who were eager to learn more about their hobbies and interests. The family of our founder, President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer, and Director, Michael Hillerbrand, includes numerous published authors and professional educators. Mr. Hillerbrand, our sole officer, believes the increased popularity of eBooks in the United States is due to certain industry and social trends that should continue for at least the next few years. The Company believes that the principal changes that have contributed to growth in the eBook market are (1) the emergence of eBook readers, tablet computers and Smartphones that make reading eBooks more convenient than a traditional print book, (2) the low cost of production and distribution of eBooks, and (3) the continued consumer interest in consuming media electronically rather than in the traditional print format. The Company conducts its business through its wholly-owned operating subsidiary Nuts and Bolts Publishing, LLC (“NABP”) which conducts its business worldwide by delivering eBooks through the Internet. As of March 25, 2015, NABP, using the marketing name Nuts and Bolts Press, has published two eBooks – one was published in October 2014 and one was published in November 2014. The Company has also recently published the first series of online courses on the online publishing platform www.udemy.com. The Company’s strategy is to publish new titles on a regular basis, increasing output each year of operation. As the eBook catalog increases in size, brand awareness and profit margins are projected to increase. Titles will be carefully researched based on consumer search engine topic queries and eBook content will be specifically tailored to match high consumer interests. Formats will be tested to ensure learning effectiveness and positive consumer reception. The eBook electronic format will facilitate easy, low-cost updates and format changes. The eBook creation process starts with market research. This research consists of identifying the categories of current “best sellers” published by other companies and identifying topics in market niches that have a high number of Google and Bing searches, but where such searches result in limited competitive advertising for books. Both of these market research methods are good indicators of potentially profitable eBook titles. The next step in developing eBook titles is to rank this list of potential titles/topics by potential profitability. The ranking order of titles is dynamic and is revised as new topics are identified. Periodically the top titles are moved off the potential title list and put on the production list. Even when a title is published, development is ongoing. Because the eBooks are published electronically, they can be easily modified. If an existing eBook title is not meeting sales expectations, it can be edited, combined with other titles, or re-titled. Edits can be made to enhance the quality of the titles or to add new material. The creation of new titles can range in the time required, depending on familiarity the author has with the subject matter and whether the title is derived from a print book in the public domain or is an original work of the author. Original works on topics unfamiliar to the author take the longest amount of time to produce. The shortest time frame from conception to publication would be about four weeks and the longest could be six months to a year or more. The Company is focused on the titles that have the highest sales potential and the shortest turnaround time to publication.   In August 2015, the Company published its first digital multimedia “self-help” course on how to start a freelancing business. The course teaches anyone how to start their own freelancing business. Using the digital publishing platform, www.udemy.com , the course uses 15 audio/video lectures, totaling 75 minutes of content, to teach enrolled students. In addition, 10 worksheets and quizzes are also included. The course currently has over 1,900 students enrolled from 7 countries has received 100% positive reviews from enrolled students. While the student enrollment and response has been very positive, sales have been negligible. According to the Udemy Terms of Service, sales revenues are held in reserve for 1-3 months to offset any refunds before being distributed to the publisher (the Company). In addition, Udemy has the right to advertise courses for sale prices well below the sales price set by the publisher and collects a sales commission of 50% for all sales Udemy generates from its promotional efforts. Also, the majority of students registered for the course redeemed “try it free” promotional coupons. Sales revenues are expected to be earned in the first fiscal quarter of 2016. Management is currently conducting tests on the impact of course title and description copy on increasing sales conversions. Management is carefully evaluating whether publishing additional multimedia courses makes economic sense. http://nutsandboltspress.com/
