                Improve the quality of electricity and the availability of electrical supplies
            








The Schaffner Group is the only global company to provide EMC, power quality and power magnetics solutions from a single source, helping to improve the quality of electricity and the availability of electrical supplies.  Better power quality supports savings in electricity consumption and costs, a higher efficiency of electrical equipment and an extended life expectancy of sensitive electronics. Schaffner solutions enable the widespread use of energy-efficient technologies like motor drives or photovoltaic inverters by eliminating their “side-effects” and therefore contribute to a sustainable use of natural resources. Schaffner has the expertise for the early identification of potential sources of interference, both in the development of new products and in subsequent system optimization. It offers a broad range of standard components, an efficient measurement service, expert technical advisors and the skills to develop and produce customer-specific solutions quickly and deliver them to all key markets throughout the world.Schaffner operates four modern, high-capacity production sites worldwide: in Kecskemét (Hungary), Lamphun (Thailand), Shanghai (China) and in Wytheville (USA). Specialists in 18 customer service and application centers around the globe maintain close contact with the development and application engineers of our regional and international customers.

        Power quality

    

    





            One major aspect of electrical power is its quality and stability or so called power quality. A high level of power quality is needed to enable the reliable function of equipment and systems and can only be guaranteed with reliable partners such as the Schaffner Group.

        Power Magnetics

    

    





            Magnetic components are an important element of power electronics engineering. Inductors and transformers are often key for optimizing a system for highest energy yield (e.g. in photovoltaic inverters) or low energy consumption (e.g. for plant-wide optimization).
