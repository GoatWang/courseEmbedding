ARIKAYCE is being investigated for treatment of serious lung infections such as those caused by NTM, through delivery of antibiotic directly to the site of the lung infection.An Investigational Treatment for Serious Chronic Lung InfectionsThe active ingredient, amikacin, is an antibiotic used to treat a broad range of gram-negative infections. Amikacin is in the aminoglycoside class of antibiotics and is currently delivered intravenously or intramuscularly.1What Are Liposomes?Liposomes are microscopic membrane shells that contain water. In a liposome drug delivery system, water-soluble drugs, like amikacin, are located in the liposome’s water core. The goal of a liposome delivery system, which is currently investigational, is to deliver medicine directly to the site of the lung infection. Proprietary Liposomal TechnologyInsmed’s proprietary liposomal technology is designed specifically for delivery of pharmaceuticals to the lung.Proprietary Liposomal TechnologyInsmed’s liposomal technology aims to both retain amikacin in the lung, enabling once-daily dosing, and may allow for LAI to gain close access to bacteria within infected alveolar macrophages (immune cells in the lung), as in the case of NTM lung infections. LAI liposomes are readily taken up by macrophages whose normal function is to “swallow” inhaled particles.2,3 In so doing, amikacin is delivered where it is needed most.2The inhalation technology of LAI provides for delivery of amikacin directly to the site of infection in the lungs, minimizing systemic exposure to other organs.2,3The Role of the LiposomeIn NTM lung infections, the infecting bacteria invade and multiply chiefly within macrophages.4 When amikacin (non-liposomal)—which is currently only approved for intravenous or intramuscular use—is delivered via inhalation, it does not achieve the same level of intracellular delivery to the lung’s macrophages as does LAI (animal data on file). Moreover, the materials found in a patient’s mucus and biofilms that are produced by bacteria to protect themselves have negative charges.5-7 Because opposite charges attract each other, positively charged antibiotics like amikacin, bind to the negatively charged compounds.8-10 This prevents effective penetration of positively charged antibiotic drugs into the spaces in which the bacteria are located.9-11With LAI, amikacin is packaged into liposomes at a high concentration and consequently uptake of these structures by macrophages results in efficient delivery of drug at what are expected to be locally high levels.3 Therefore, the particle nature of the liposomes is key to the effect of ARIKAYCE.References1Amikacin 250 mg/ml Injection [summary of product characteristics], Hospira UK Ltd, Maidenhead, UK; 2015.2 Malinin V, Neville ME, Eagle G, Perkins W, Gupta R.

They were four guys who kept each other’s kind of negative tendencies in check. They balanced each other and the total was greater than the sum of the parts.
