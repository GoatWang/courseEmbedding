Product ComplianceThe diverse product fields of application also require regular checks and confirmation of various requirements.
These requirements may, for example, be confirmation of indirect food contact, both at a national and a European level, but also outside the EU, including information on the biodegradability or the proportion of renewable raw materials and on the other hand, containing other listings in different inventories.
Our team for product safety and regulations is constantly reviewing these requirements and is always available for any customer queries.
