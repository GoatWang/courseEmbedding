Every single day of the year. Regardless of how much you make.Great work/life balance. This is like a post office/government job. Working hard doesn't get you rewards.Cons- Low Pay- Low Motivation- Very few advancement opportunities. Most people just come in for a year or two, or until they find another job. Only few departments, which all consist of "directors" are worth being in.. but most likely, you are better off working at a larger firm in Atlanta.- Company peddling same products. Even the investment/trading team has been turned into marketing (apologies... "product development") team. 100s of stocks, and only 10 people to keep track of all of them (actually, some "employees" are just listed on the website, very few people have actually seen them)? The company doesn't foresee what is going to happen to your investments in the future, it 'acts' after your investment have dropped. Which doesn't help customers.Advice to ManagementExpand! Offering same products for ever, while trying to cut costs, rarely helps companies grow. At some point, your clients will catch on that you're charging them the yearly .75% for stocks you've held for 10 years...Treat your employees right. The firm is small enough to be able to do 'team building' activities more often than once a year.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (4) EARNEST Partners Response seconds agoEdit • Delete EARNEST Partners 2013-02-07 08:55 PST Jan 11, 2016"EP"StarStarStarStarStarFormer Employee - Anonymous EmployeeFormer Employee - Anonymous EmployeeProsEarnest partners is in a great location by Piedmont Park, and the provided parking is a great perk on weekends.

Benefits are very fair. For the most part everyone there's a good person.ConsAgree with most of the above negative comments. Probably an ok place to start right out of college, but past a certain point you're going to have to leave if you want any kind of career development. Poor management of expectations sometimes masquerades as "entrepreneurial," so you'd better be sure you have a realistic idea what you're going to achieve. Flat structure often confuses who is responsible when something goes wrong, which happens far too often given the firm's AUM. I was always amazed how out of touch managers, directors, and partners could be, especially since they normally sit a cubicle or two away.Advice to ManagementInvest in employees, we can't all be temp-to-perm.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (0) EARNEST Partners Response seconds agoEdit • Delete EARNEST Partners 2014-12-16 17:52 PST Dec 27, 2014 Helpful (5)"Never so glad to leave a job..."StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementFormer Employee - Anonymous EmployeeFormer Employee - Anonymous EmployeeDoesn't RecommendNeutral OutlookNo opinion of CEOProsSome of the people were nice. Beyond that, I have no positive experiences from working here.ConsDespite what one or two other reviews say, neither the pay nor the work/life balance were great, particularly given the level of work. I have never felt quite so undervalued in a job, particularly where I was working 12+ hour days.Levels of management vary from group-to-group - some groups had very little guidance from their manager (as another review says, this is labelled at the firm as "entrepreneurial", while others were micro-managed to the most ridiculous extent.Management protected certain employees for reasons little more than nepotism, and allowed them to get away with just about anything, while other employees were treated very poorly by those who were protected.Another former employee I still talk to recently described the atmosphere as "brutal". I don't disagree with that - expectations are unrealistically high of some people.Advice to ManagementInvest in your junior employees, and develop their skills. Don't practice nepotism in the workplace. More PTO would be nice, too.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (5) EARNEST Partners Response seconds agoEdit • Delete EARNEST Partners 2014-12-27 23:54 PST Oct 18, 2013"If you are willing to learn and go above and beyond, which we all should ....game on"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Anonymous EmployeeCurrent Employee - Anonymous EmployeeRecommendsPositive OutlookApproves of CEOI have been working at EARNEST Partners full-time (More than 8 years)ProsCo. is small, entrepreneurial and dynamic.

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for MUELLER WATER PRODUCTS (NYSE:MWA) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 1 Hold Rating, 6 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 2.86)Consensus Price Target: $13.83 (20.29% upside)

EARNEST Partners LLC is a fundamental, bottom-up investment manager, overseeing assets for municipalities, states, corporations, endowments, eleemosynary groups and universities. The Firm's investment objective is to outperform the benchmark while controlling volatility and risk. The Atlanta, Georgia-based firm was founded in 1998.
