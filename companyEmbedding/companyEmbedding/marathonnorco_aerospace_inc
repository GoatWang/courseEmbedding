Micro Maintenance Batteries
MarathonNorco's Micro Maintenance () batteries are improved low-maintenance Nickel-Cadmium batteries that supply reliable power for large commercial aircraft, regional aircraft, military aircraft, corporate aircraft and helicopters.  batteries are  FAA-PMA approved for many aircraft models offered in sizes from 17 to 75 ampere-hours are interchangeable with existing batteries. Therefore, you can easily make the change to a low-maintenance battery without aircraft modifications and can service the product with your existing battery shop equipment. 
SuperPower Batteries
The rechargeable vented Nickel-Cadmium batteries are widely used for engine starting and emergency power in commercial, corporate and military aircraft - fixed wing and rotary. They also supply power for military weapons, ground vehicles, medical and telecommunications equipment. The SuperPower Battery product line has been designed to provide maximum power for engine and APU starting applications.

Company History

MarathonNorco Aerospace traces its origin to Marathon  Battery Company (Marathon), which was incorporated in 1923. Marathon began  producing carbon-zinc dry batteries and cells. During World War II and the  Korean War, the company was an important supplier of military batteries and won  the coveted Army and Navy “E” award for its excellence. Marathon was given the  “E” award for its continued effort in the development of new or improved  battery products.   
      In 1948, the company initiated development of a  rechargeable, sintered plate nickel-cadmium battery. In 1949, Marathon became  the first company in the United States to manufacture sealed nickel-cadmium  batteries.
In 1952, Marathon began to produce nickel-cadmium batteries  for the Atomic Energy Commission and for the United States Army Nike Missile  program. After producing millions of ampere-hours of batteries for missiles,  the company began to design batteries to meet stringent aircraft applications. 
After testing and acceptance by the United States Air Force  Strategic Air Command, nickel-cadmium batteries were adopted for the B-47  bomber fleet. The introduction of other models for military, commercial, and  corporate aircraft rapidly made Marathon's batteries the industry leader. 
Marathon lead the way with sealed batteries that became the  first to power satellites and were used on such projects as Explorer, Pioneer,  Midas, Tiros, Transit, Courier, Greb, Oso, Relay, Syncom, Nimbus, Alouette and  Isis. Marathon powered spacecraft have set longevity records for continuous,  successful operation. 
During the mid-1960’s a great deal of research and  development work was done to develop batteries with greater capacity per unit  of volume and weight than the traditional carbon-zinc battery. After testing,  the United States Army Signal Corps had indicated that the magnesium-manganese  dioxide dry battery had excellent shelf life characteristics at an  elevated-temperature. A contract was negotiated with the government to produce  BA-4386 batteries. In 1968 Marathon began the production of the BA-4386 for use  as the power source in the PRC-25 and PRC-77 transceiver sets. 
Marathon Battery continued to manufacture carbon-zinc  batteries at Wausau, Wisconsin, magnesium batteries in St. Paul, Minnesota,  vented and sealed nickel-cadmium batteries at Cold Spring and Roe Park, New  York. But Marathon was rapidly outgrowing its production facilities as new  markets developed. 
In 1971, the company had consolidated all of its operations  in a modern 200,000 square foot (18,000 square meters) manufacturing plant in  Waco, Texas, where the company continued manufacturing nickel-cadmium  batteries, magnesium batteries and carbon-zinc batteries. 
In 1981, Marathon acquired Flite-Tronics, a California based  inverter manufacturer, and move the entire electronics manufacturing operation  to Waco, TX. Flite-Tronics offered more than 75 models of static inverters and  power conversion devices. With the combined operations, Marathon's name changed  from Marathon Battery Company to Marathon Power Technologies Company. 
In 2000 Marathon Power Technologies Company acquired  Christie Electric Corp. Christie designs and manufactures equipment to support  the direct current (DC) power market. This includes battery chargers/analyzers  as well as industrial AC to DC power supplies. 
The charger/analyzer product line consists of the CASP® and  RF80 designs. The CASP (charger-analyzer-sequencer-power supply) is a  versatile, user-friendly, microprocessor-based, precision instrument for  supporting rechargeable batteries of all types. CASP is sold to military,  medical, aviation, professional video, industrial and OEM customers. Christie's  RF80 charger/analyzer supports vented nickel-cadmium and sealed or vented lead-acid  aircraft batteries. The RF80-K is the industry standard, used by the US Air  Force as well as many major airlines around the world. As an aid to effective  aircraft battery maintenance, the RF80-K is without peer. 
In 2003 Marathon Power Technologies Company acquired Norco,  Inc., a manufacturer of mechanical apparatus products. Norco, Inc. designed and  developed a wide range of custom engineered hold open rods and specialty  mechanical devices. Additionally, it maintains a line of specialty power  transmission products. The consolidation brought the two companies together in  Waco, TX., with the new name of MarathonNorco Aerospace, Inc.
In 2006,  Flite-Tronics joined Avionic Instruments, LLC in Avenel, New Jersey. Avionic  Instruments is now manufacturing and supporting the Flite-Tronics power  conversion product line.
Today, MarathonNorco Aerospace, Inc. continues to manufacture the Micro Maintenance () and Superpower batteries, Christie charger/analyzers, mechanical and coupling devices from its Waco facility.
MarathonNorco  Aerospace is part of TransDigm's family of companies. TransDigm Inc., is a  leading global designer, producer and supplier of highly engineered aircraft  components for use on nearly all commercial and military aircraft in service  today.
