Laura R. Walker —The Power of the Personal Narrative

 













Laura R. Walker —The Power of the Personal Narrative
WNYC CEO Laura Walker shares the story of her son's battle with cancer and why she believes that sharing personal stories is so important. "How do you take the tough challenges and make something that's not just better for yourself but for the world?" It’s through our stories that we’re able to unlock insights and make sense of larger issues. WNYC acts as today’s modern public square, where difficult topics such as the housing crisis or genetic testing are shared through a personal narrative, allowing listeners to empathize and connect to the issues explored and ultimately join a larger community discussion that often leads to reform.

      WQXR:  Serving Westchester!

          Laura R. Walker           : President & CEO, New York Public Radio      

July 29, 2013
 
Dear Listeners,
 
In 2009, New York Public Radio acquired WQXR from The New York Times Company, preserving one of the city’s finest cultural institutions and New York’s only all-classical music station.  As a public radio station, WQXR has thrived by offering the best in classical music programming on the radio, on digital devices and through exclusive live events.
Today, it gives me great pleasure to announce that New York Public Radio has acquired a Westchester station that will extend the reach of WQXR in Central and Northern Westchester.  As a consequence of the frequency change to 105.9 FM that came with the 2009 acquisition, we could no longer serve parts of Westchester.  We’ve been looking for opportunities to restore that service ever since.  This acquisition enables us to do just that and to expand even farther.

      Keep The Dialogue Going

          Laura R. Walker           : President & CEO, New York Public Radio      

In recent weeks as our nation watched the George Zimmerman trial unfold and the Supreme Court rule on the Voting Rights Act, issues of race in modern American society and stark reminders of what it means to be black in America have come to the forefront.  A continued dialogue about race is essential to fostering understanding, perspective and change.  Through the study of history, through difficult discussions about current events and even through cultural exploration, we need to keep the dialogue going any way we can.

          Laura R. Walker           : President & CEO, New York Public Radio      

Everyone has a story to tell about Bach.  Here’s mine.
Bach brought me back after 9/11.  It was Sunday, September 23, 2001,  just twelve days after the terrorist attacks brought down the World  Trade Center, killed thousands of people and obliterated all sense of  reason and order in our city.   I was in my kitchen preparing the first  “normal” meal my family would eat together since the tragedy hit.  I had  been working round-the-clock navigating a city in chaos and filled with  raw emotion.

On Monday night, millions of people in the New York region were left in the dark as Superstorm Sandy showed us the full force of her fury.  For many of these people, their only lifeline to the world outside their homes and their own experience was a radio -- underscoring the medium’s enduring value in a digital world.  It's been our privilege and honor at WNYC, WQXR and New Jersey Public Radio (NJPR) to be on the other side of that radio.
