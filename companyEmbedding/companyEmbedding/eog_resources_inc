Of these proved reserves, 97% were located in the United States and 3% were located in Trinidad.[1]
In 2016, the company's production averaged 560 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (3,400,000 GJ) per day, of which 88% was in the United States (including 40% in the Eagle Ford shale and 15% in the Delaware Basin), 10% was in Trinidad, and 1% was in other areas.[1]

In 2014, the company realized a 39% increase in well productivity on certain wells in the Eagle Ford as a result of a new technology that it developed that "involves stimulating the rock more evenly along the wellbore".[3]
In 2015, the company cited technology and cost reductions as reasons for improved production.[4]
Delaware Basin[edit]
In 2016, production by the company in the Delaware Basin averaged 85 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (520,000 GJ) per day. The company also owns properties in other areas of the Permian Basin, including the Leonard, Wolfcamp, and Second Bone Spring Sand shale plays.[1]

North Sea[edit]
In 2007, EOG was awarded a license for two blocks in the East Irish Sea and, in 2009, the company drilled a successful test well. First production from the Conwy field is anticipated in March 2016.[1]

History[edit]
1998-2000[edit]
In 1998, the board of directors of the company elected Mark G. Papa Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.[6] Its predecessor company, Enron Oil and Gas Company became independent from Enron Corp. in 1999, and changed its named to EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG).[7] In 2000, the company swapped properties with Occidental Petroleum. EOG received properties in East Texas and the Oklahoma Panhandle in exchange for properties in California and the Gulf of Mexico.[8]
In 2000, the company also swapped properties with Burlington Resources. EOG received properties in West Texas and the New Mexico, specifically in the Permian Basin, in exchange for properties in Texas and Oklahoma.[9] Also in 2000, the company was added to the S&P 500 index.[10]
2003-2005[edit]
In 2003, the company acquired properties in Canada from Husky Energy for $320 million.[11]
2006-2008[edit]
In 2006, the company signed a 225,648 square feet (20,963.4 m2) lease for office space in the Heritage Plaza building in Houston, Texas.[12] In 2008, EOG acquired assets in the Chuan Zhong Block exploration area in the Sichuan Basin, Sichuan Province, China from ConocoPhillips.[5]

2012-2014[edit]
In 2014, EOG sold its assets in Canada.[14] In 2014, founder Mark G. Papa resigned from the board of directors.[15]
2015-2017[edit]
In 2015, the company spent $368 million to acquire additional acreage in the Delaware Basin.[16] In 2015, as a result of a decline in commodity prices, the company reduced its capital expenditure budget by over 40%.[17]
In September 2016, EOG Resources and Yates Petroleum agreed to combine assets under the terms of a private, negotiated transaction in which EOG agreed to issue 26 million shares of common stock valued at $2.3 billion and pay $37 million in cash. The acquisition increased EOG's holdings by 176,000 net acres in the Delaware Basin, 200,000 net acres in the Powder River Basin, and 138,000 net acres on the Northwest Shelf in New Mexico. The acquisition adds 1,740 "premium wells" (defined as those which produce an after-tax rate of return of 30% or greater at $40/bbl oil) within the Powder River and Delaware Basins alone. Closing is anticipated to occur in early October 2016.[18]

Opinion by ALMA L. LÓPEZ, Justice.
Appellant EOG Resources, Inc. ("EOG") appeals from the trial court's judgment after a non-jury trial. On appeal, EOG contends the evidence was legally insufficient to support the trial court's findings that Hanson Production Company's ("Hanson") overriding royalty interest was defined by the terms of a mineral lease assignment and that this overriding royalty interest was enforceable upon extensions or renewals of the assigned mineral lease. We overrule EOG's two issues and affirm the judgment of the trial court.

Background
This is a dispute surrounding EOG's alleged failure to pay Hanson overriding royalties pursuant to an assignment which assigned Hanson's lease interest to EOG. The essential facts of the case are undisputed by the parties. On June 6, 1997, EOG sent a letter to Hanson offering to acquire Hanson's leasehold position in six mineral leases located in Jefferson County, Texas. The letter provided the "general terms" of the assignment. EOG offered to pay $55,110.44, or $100 per net mineral acre, to Hanson upon a mutually acceptable form of assignment conveying the interest to EOG. Hanson would deliver a net revenue interest of 75% reserving the difference between 25% and any other lease burden (i.e. landowner royalty). This reservation constituted the "overriding royalty." *700 The letter was signed by Steve Himes, senior landman for EOG. Hanson noted its agreement by signing the letter. Richard Lucas, landman, signed on behalf of Hanson.
The parties executed an "Assignment of Oil, Gas and Mineral Leases" (the "Assignment") on August 20, 1997. The operative section regarding Hanson's overriding royalty specifically provides the following:
Assignor [Hanson] reserves unto itself... an overriding royalty equal to the difference between the aggregate of the basic royalties, overriding royalties and similar burdens chargeable to Assignor's leases existing on the effective date of this Assignment and twenty-five percent (25.00%). The overriding royalty reserved herein shall burden any extensions or renewals taken within one (1) year of termination of the subject leases;....
While in draft form, EOG made revisions to the Assignment which were ultimately incorporated into the final draft. The most important of these revisions was EOG's insertion of a paragraph referencing the June 6, 1997 letter and which came after the paragraph which created Hanson's overriding royalty interest. That paragraph states, "This Assignment of Oil, Gas and Mineral Leases is subject to that certain unrecorded letter agreement dated June 6, 1997, by and between Assignor and Assignee." No other revisions were made to the Assignment by EOG.
Prior to EOG commencing production, two of the six leases expired. Without Hanson's participation, EOG negotiated with the landowners for two new leases. Where the landowners had previously agreed with Hanson for a 1/6 royalty interest, they only agreed to a 1/4 royalty interest with EOG. After the renewal, EOG drilled and successfully completed a well in the area. The division order sent by EOG to Hanson reflected a total overriding royalty in an amount less than the overriding royalty based upon the formula established under the Assignment. On August 3, 1999, by letter, Hanson informed EOG of the discrepancy.[1] In a letter dated August 20, 1999, EOG informed Hanson that the higher royalty demanded by the landowners under the two new leases it had negotiated effectively nullified Hanson's overriding royalty.
Hanson subsequently filed suit against EOG, alleging a claim for breach of contract and seeking a declaratory judgment. The parties stipulated to the amount of damages owed to Hanson based upon the Assignment, approximately $151,756.00. A bench trial was held. Both parties agreed the terms of their agreement were not ambiguous. On this basis, no witnesses were heard and the trial court considered the arguments of counsel and evidence stipulated to by the parties. The trial court subsequently entered a final judgment in Hanson's favor. Findings of fact and conclusions of law were timely requested by EOG and entered by the trial court. The trial court specifically found that Hanson's overriding royalty was based upon the terms of the Assignment. Specifically, the trial court found that Hanson's overriding royalty was fixed and determined on the date the Assignment was made. The trial court also found that Hanson's overriding royalty was enforceable on extensions or renewals. The court also found that the leases listed in the Assignment contained a 1/6 landowner royalty *701 burden effective on the date of the Assignment. Accordingly, the overriding royalty reserved by Hanson was the difference between 25% and 16.666% or 8.33334%. EOG appeals the trial court's judgment.

Standard of Review
Neither EOG nor Hanson contend the contract in question is ambiguous. The interpretation of an unambiguous contract is a question of law and we are not required to defer to any interpretation afforded by the trial court. MCI Telecommunications Corp. v. Texas Utilities Elec. Co., 995 S.W.2d 647, 650 (Tex.1999); Birnbaum v. Swepi LP, 48 S.W.3d 254, 257 (Tex.App.-San Antonio 2001, pet. denied). Accordingly, we review the trial court's construction of an unambiguous contract by a de novo standard.

Analysis
An overriding royalty is a benefit an assignor receives when he or she assigns a leasehold interest. It is an interest which is carved out of, and constitutes part of, the working interest created by an oil and gas lease. Gruss v. Cummins, 329 S.W.2d 496, 501(Tex.Civ.App.-El Paso 1959, writ ref'd n.r.e.). Specifically, it is the share of the oil or gas produced reserved in assignment, part assignment, or sublease of an oil and gas lease payable to the assignor by the assignee over and above the royalty reserved in the lease payable to the lessor. See 3 W.L. Summers, The Law of Oil & Gas § 554 (2nd ed.1958). An overriding royalty is an interest in real property regarded as a covenant running with the land between the assignor and the assignee, and is enforceable by the assignor against the assignee. Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Taylor, 116 F.2d 994, 995 (5th Cir.1941). At issue in this case is the scope of Hanson's overriding royalty interest as defined by the contract between Hanson and EOG.
EOG contends that the Assignment is not determinative of Hanson's overriding royalty interest. Rather, EOG contends the June 6, 1997, letter defines the scope of Hanson's overriding royalty interest. For this reason, EOG contends that it inserted the "subject to" language in the Assignment. By inserting this language, it was EOG's intent to correct two problems it had with Hanson's initial draft of the Assignment: (1) its failure to expressly state that EOG had a 75% revenue interest and (2) providing that Hanson's overriding interest would be effective in the case of renewals or extensions on the leases.
Where a written contract is clear and certain, the instrument will be deemed to express the intention of the parties and will be enforced as written, no matter what their actual intention may have been. Lopez v. Muñoz, Hockema & Reed, L.L.P., 22 S.W.3d 857, 861 (Tex. 2000); Elliott-Williams Co., Inc. v. Diaz, 9 S.W.3d 801, 803 (Tex.1999). In pursuit of this goal, a court examines the entire agreement in an effort to harmonize and give effect to all provisions of the contract so that none will be rendered meaningless. MCI Telecommunications Corp., 995 S.W.2d at 652. We presume that the parties to a contract intend every clause to have some effect. Birnbaum, 48 S.W.3d at 257. We enforce an unambiguous contract as written. Id. Where the meaning of the contract is plain and unambiguous, a party's construction is immaterial. Ussery Inv. v. Canon & Carpenter, Inc., 663 S.W.2d 591, 593 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 1983, writ dism'd). Finally, when two or more instruments make up a single transaction, all of them must be construed together as one contract. Ikon Office Solutions, Inc. v. Eifert, 2 S.W.3d 688, 693 *702 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 1999, no pet.).
In light of these principles, contrary to EOG's contention, the agreement of the parties is embodied in both the letter and the Assignment. The Assignment expressly states that the assignment is "subject to" the parties' letter agreement. Therefore, the plain language of the assignment, at a minimum, incorporates by reference the June 6, 1997 letter. See Eland Energy, Inc. v. Rowden Oil & Gas, Inc., 914 S.W.2d 179, 185 (Tex.App.-San Antonio 1995, writ denied). Even if we were to assume that the terms "subject to" made the Assignment subservient to the June 6, 1997 letter agreement,[2] EOG's argument would fail because the letter is silent on whether Hanson's overriding royalty would apply to lease extensions or renewals.
EOG relies on this court's opinion in Eland Energy, Inc. for the proposition that the "subject to" language in the Assignment makes the June 6, 1997 letter determinative of Hanson's overriding interest. In Eland Energy, Inc., Rowden and Cox entered into a letter agreement regarding a "farmout" on the Perez Lease. Under that agreement, Rowden would assign 40 acres in the form of a square around each producing well Cox completed upon the condition that Cox would commence drilling within 10 days and drilled to a specific depth. If Cox gave notice that he was ready to plug and abandon a well, Rowden had the right to take over the well. An assignment which was subsequently executed assigned Rowden's entire interest in the Perez Lease to Cox. The assignment, however, provided that it was "subject to the terms and provision of that certain [l]etter [a]greement ... and in particular to the continuous drilling obligation imposed by such [a]greement." Id. at 182. Eland, a subsequent assignee of Cox, contended that Rowden had assigned his entire interest in the Perez Lease and therefore Eland has equitable title in the Perez Lease. The court held the "subject to" language in the Assignment negated this argument. The reasoning of the court was that the "subject to" clause made the acquisition of equitable title dependent upon the continuous drilling obligation as encompassed under the letter agreement. By reading the letter agreement and assignment together, this court concluded that Rowden had reserved equitable title to all lands not affected by producing wells completed by Cox. Id. at 185. The court reached that conclusion on the basis that the "subject to" language in the assignment specifically referenced the continuous drilling obligation language in the letter agreement that defined Cox's interest. These facts, however, are distinguishable from the instant matter. Contrasting, the June 6, 1997, letter is silent on whether or not Hanson's overriding royalty would apply to lease extensions or renewals. Given this important factual distinction, we are not inclined to hold that the June 6, 1997 letter, alone, defined Hanson's overriding royalty interest.
Our conclusion that the parties' contract is encompassed in both the June 6, 1997 letter and Assignment is further supported by the general rule in oil and gas law that controversies regarding assignors and assignees are governed by the construction and interpretation of the provisions of the assignment itself and the collateral contracts of the parties. See, *703 e.g., Sunac Petroleum Corp. v. Parkes, 416 S.W.2d 798, 805 (Tex.1967); H.G. Sledge Inc. v. The Prospective Inv. & Trading Co., Ltd., 36 S.W.3d 597, 606 (Tex.App.-Austin 2000, pet. denied); Phillips v. Inexco Oil Co. Inc., 540 S.W.2d 546, 548 (Tex. Civ.App.-Tyler 1976, writ ref'd n.r.e.) (looking to assignment and letter agreement to determine rights of assignor and assignee).[3] For these reasons, we overrule EOG's first issue.
In their second issue, EOG contends the trial court erred in finding that Hanson's overriding royalty is enforceable upon any extensions or renewals of mineral leases. An overriding interest created by assignment does not survive the termination of the assigned lease unless the instrument creating the overriding interest provides an express provision to the contrary. See Fain & McGaha v. Biesel, 331 S.W.2d 346, 348 (Tex.Civ.App.-Fort Worth 1960, writ ref'd n.r.e.). Here, the Assignment expressly provides that Hanson's overriding royalty "shall burden any extensions or renewals taken within one (1) year of termination of the subject leases...." Therefore, the express language of the parties' agreement indicates Hanson's overriding royalty interest would apply to extensions and renewals taken within a year. If we solely considered the June 6, 1997 letter, which is silent on the issue, we would be contradicting established contract interpretation principles to examine the entire agreement, give effect to every clause, and not render any clause meaningless. Under EOG's interpretation, the clause providing that Hanson's overriding interest would burden any extensions or renewals taken within one year would be rendered meaningless. We refuse to render a portion of the contract meaningless. Therefore, we overrule EOG's second issue.

Conclusion
Having overruled EOG's two issues on appeal, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.
NOTES
[1]  This letter, admitted as evidence and considered by the trial court, reflected that the landowner's royalty interest on the effective date of the Assignment was 1/6th and that based upon the Assignment, Hanson would receive an overriding royalty equal to the difference between 25% and 16.6666% or 8.3334%.
[2]  "Subject to" as used in conveyances is a term of qualification and not of contract. Kokernot v. Caldwell, 231 S.W.2d 528, 531 (Tex.Civ.App.-Dallas 1950, writ ref'd). Used in its ordinary sense, the term "subject to" means "subservient to" or "subordinate to" or "limited by." Id.
[3]  EOG also relies on H.G. Sledge Inc. for the proposition that this court should only focus on the June 6, 1997 letter as determinative of the rights of the parties. Notably, in that case, there was only one document determinative of the parties' rights, a farmout agreement. In this case, we are dealing with the agreement of the parties as encompassed in two documents. For this reason, we conclude H.G. Sledge Inc., is dispositive of this case.

In 2014, the company realized a 39% increase in well productivity on certain wells in the Eagle Ford as a result of a new technology that it developed that "involves stimulating the rock more evenly along the wellbore".[3]
In 2015, the company cited technology and cost reductions as reasons for improved production.[4]
Delaware Basin[edit]
In 2016, production by the company in the Delaware Basin averaged 85 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (520,000 GJ) per day. The company also owns properties in other areas of the Permian Basin, including the Leonard, Wolfcamp, and Second Bone Spring Sand shale plays.[1]

History[edit]
1998-2000[edit]
In 1998, the board of directors of the company elected Mark G. Papa Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.[6] Its predecessor company, Enron Oil and Gas Company became independent from Enron Corp. in 1999, and changed its named to EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG).[7] In 2000, the company swapped properties with Occidental Petroleum. EOG received properties in East Texas and the Oklahoma Panhandle in exchange for properties in California and the Gulf of Mexico.[8]
In 2000, the company also swapped properties with Burlington Resources. EOG received properties in West Texas and the New Mexico, specifically in the Permian Basin, in exchange for properties in Texas and Oklahoma.[9] Also in 2000, the company was added to the S&P 500 index.[10]
2003-2005[edit]
In 2003, the company acquired properties in Canada from Husky Energy for $320 million.[11]
2006-2008[edit]

2015-2017[edit]
In 2015, the company spent $368 million to acquire additional acreage in the Delaware Basin.[16] In 2015, as a result of a decline in commodity prices, the company reduced its capital expenditure budget by over 40%.[17]
In September 2016, EOG Resources and Yates Petroleum agreed to combine assets under the terms of a private, negotiated transaction in which EOG agreed to issue 26 million shares of common stock valued at $2.3 billion and pay $37 million in cash. The acquisition increased EOG's holdings by 176,000 net acres in the Delaware Basin, 200,000 net acres in the Powder River Basin, and 138,000 net acres on the Northwest Shelf in New Mexico. The acquisition adds 1,740 "premium wells" (defined as those which produce an after-tax rate of return of 30% or greater at $40/bbl oil) within the Powder River and Delaware Basins alone. Closing is anticipated to occur in early October 2016.[18]

Current operations[edit]
The company is ranked #322 on the Fortune 500.[2]
The company has reserves in the United States, Canada, Trinidad, the United Kingdom, and China.[1]
As of December 31, 2016, the company had 2.118 billion barrels of oil equivalent (1.296×1010 GJ) of estimated proved reserves, of which 52% was petroleum, 18% was natural gas liquids, and 30% was natural gas. Of these proved reserves, 97% were located in the United States and 3% were located in Trinidad.[1]
In 2016, the company's production averaged 560 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (3,400,000 GJ) per day, of which 88% was in the United States (including 40% in the Eagle Ford shale and 15% in the Delaware Basin), 10% was in Trinidad, and 1% was in other areas.[1]
United States[edit]
As of December 31, 2016, of the company's total proved reserves in the United States, 56% was petroleum, 20% was natural gas liquids, and 24% was natural gas.[1]
Eagle Ford Shale[edit]
As of December 31, 2016, EOG is the largest petroleum producer in the Eagle Ford. In 2016, production by the company in the Eagle Ford averaged 220 million barrels of oil equivalent (1.3×109 GJ) per day.[1]
In 2014, the company realized a 39% increase in well productivity on certain wells in the Eagle Ford as a result of a new technology that it developed that "involves stimulating the rock more evenly along the wellbore".[3]
In 2015, the company cited technology and cost reductions as reasons for improved production.[4]
Delaware Basin[edit]
In 2016, production by the company in the Delaware Basin averaged 85 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (520,000 GJ) per day. The company also owns properties in other areas of the Permian Basin, including the Leonard, Wolfcamp, and Second Bone Spring Sand shale plays.[1]
Rocky Mountains[edit]
In the Rocky Mountains, the company owns properties in the Williston Basin Bakken Formation and the Turner, Parkman and Niobrara Formations in the Powder River Basin.[1]
Other areas[edit]
EOG also owns properties in the Anadarko Basin, Haynesville Shale, the Fort Worth Basin, and the Marcellus Shale.
North Sea[edit]
In 2007, EOG was awarded a license for two blocks in the East Irish Sea and, in 2009, the company drilled a successful test well. First production from the Conwy field is anticipated in March 2016.[1]
Trinidad[edit]
As of December 31, 2016, EOG held approximately 40,000 net undeveloped acres in Trinidad.[1]
China[edit]
In 2008, EOG acquired assets in the Chuan Zhong Block exploration area in the Sichuan Basin, Sichuan Province, China from ConocoPhillips.[1][5]
In 2017, EOG plans to drill four wells in China.[1]
History[edit]
1998-2000[edit]
In 1998, the board of directors of the company elected Mark G. Papa Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.[6] Its predecessor company, Enron Oil and Gas Company became independent from Enron Corp. in 1999, and changed its named to EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG).[7] In 2000, the company swapped properties with Occidental Petroleum. EOG received properties in East Texas and the Oklahoma Panhandle in exchange for properties in California and the Gulf of Mexico.[8]
In 2000, the company also swapped properties with Burlington Resources. EOG received properties in West Texas and the New Mexico, specifically in the Permian Basin, in exchange for properties in Texas and Oklahoma.[9] Also in 2000, the company was added to the S&P 500 index.[10]
2003-2005[edit]
In 2003, the company acquired properties in Canada from Husky Energy for $320 million.[11]
2006-2008[edit]
In 2006, the company signed a 225,648 square feet (20,963.4 m2) lease for office space in the Heritage Plaza building in Houston, Texas.[12] In 2008, EOG acquired assets in the Chuan Zhong Block exploration area in the Sichuan Basin, Sichuan Province, China from ConocoPhillips.[5]
2009-2011[edit]
In 2010, the company announced major discoveries in the Eagle Ford shale.[13]
2012-2014[edit]
In 2014, EOG sold its assets in Canada.[14] In 2014, founder Mark G. Papa resigned from the board of directors.[15]
2015-2017[edit]
In 2015, the company spent $368 million to acquire additional acreage in the Delaware Basin.[16] In 2015, as a result of a decline in commodity prices, the company reduced its capital expenditure budget by over 40%.[17]
In September 2016, EOG Resources and Yates Petroleum agreed to combine assets under the terms of a private, negotiated transaction in which EOG agreed to issue 26 million shares of common stock valued at $2.3 billion and pay $37 million in cash. The acquisition increased EOG's holdings by 176,000 net acres in the Delaware Basin, 200,000 net acres in the Powder River Basin, and 138,000 net acres on the Northwest Shelf in New Mexico. The acquisition adds 1,740 "premium wells" (defined as those which produce an after-tax rate of return of 30% or greater at $40/bbl oil) within the Powder River and Delaware Basins alone. Closing is anticipated to occur in early October 2016.[18]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

(EOG).[7] In 2000, the company swapped properties with Occidental Petroleum. EOG received properties in East Texas and the Oklahoma Panhandle in exchange for properties in California and the Gulf of Mexico.[8]
In 2000, the company also swapped properties with Burlington Resources. EOG received properties in West Texas and the New Mexico, specifically in the Permian Basin, in exchange for properties in Texas and Oklahoma.[9] Also in 2000, the company was added to the S&P 500 index.[10]
2003-2005[edit]
In 2003, the company acquired properties in Canada from Husky Energy for $320 million.[11]
2006-2008[edit]

In September 2016, EOG Resources and Yates Petroleum agreed to combine assets under the terms of a private, negotiated transaction in which EOG agreed to issue 26 million shares of common stock valued at $2.3 billion and pay $37 million in cash. The acquisition increased EOG's holdings by 176,000 net acres in the Delaware Basin, 200,000 net acres in the Powder River Basin, and 138,000 net acres on the Northwest Shelf in New Mexico. The acquisition adds 1,740 "premium wells" (defined as those which produce an after-tax rate of return of 30% or greater at $40/bbl oil) within the Powder River and Delaware Basins alone. Closing is anticipated to occur in early October 2016.[18]

You assume all risk in using the information. In no event shall EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG) or its representatives be liable for any special, indirect or consequential damages resulting from use of the information.
Forward-Looking StatementsThis website includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, including, among others, statements and projections regarding EOG's future financial position, operations, performance, business strategy, returns, budgets, reserves, levels of production, costs and asset sales, statements regarding future commodity prices and statements regarding the plans and objectives of EOG's management for future operations, are forward-looking statements. EOG typically uses words such as "expect," "anticipate," "estimate," "project," "strategy," "intend," "plan," "target," "goal," "may," "will," "should" and "believe" or the negative of those terms or other variations or comparable terminology to identify its forward-looking statements. In particular, statements, express or implied, concerning EOG's future operating results and returns or EOG's ability to replace or increase reserves, increase production, reduce or otherwise control operating and capital costs, generate income or cash flows or pay dividends are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance.  Although EOG believes the expectations reflected in its forward-looking statements are reasonable and are based on reasonable assumptions, no assurance can be given that these assumptions are accurate or that any of these expectations will be achieved (in full or at all) or will prove to have been correct. Moreover, EOG's forward-looking statements may be affected by known, unknown or currently unforeseen risks, events or circumstances that may be outside EOG's control. Important factors that could cause EOG's actual results to differ materially from the expectations reflected in EOG's forward-looking statements include, among others: the timing, extent and duration of changes in prices for, supplies of, and demand for, crude oil and condensate, natural gas liquids, natural gas and related commodities; the extent to which EOG is successful in its efforts to acquire or discover additional reserves; the extent to which EOG is successful in its efforts to economically develop its acreage in, produce reserves and achieve anticipated production levels from, and maximize reserve recovery from, its existing and future crude oil and natural gas exploration and development projects; the extent to which EOG is successful in its efforts to market its crude oil and condensate, natural gas liquids, natural gas and related commodity production; the availability, proximity and capacity of, and costs associated with, appropriate gathering, processing, compression, transportation and refining facilities; the availability, cost, terms and timing of issuance or execution of, and competition for, mineral licenses and leases and governmental and other permits and rights-of-way, and EOG’s ability to retain mineral licenses and leases; the impact of, and changes in, government policies, laws and regulations, including tax laws and regulations; environmental, health and safety laws and regulations relating to air emissions, disposal of produced water, drilling fluids and other wastes, hydraulic fracturing and access to and use of water; laws and regulations imposing conditions or restrictions on drilling and completion operations and on the transportation of crude oil and natural gas; laws and regulations with respect to derivatives and hedging activities; and laws and regulations with respect to the import and export of crude oil, natural gas and related commodities; EOG's ability to effectively integrate acquired crude oil and natural gas properties into its operations, fully identify existing and potential problems with respect to such properties and accurately estimate reserves, production and costs with respect to such properties; the extent to which EOG's third-party-operated crude oil and natural gas properties are operated successfully and economically; competition in the oil and gas exploration and production industry for the acquisition of licenses, leases and properties, employees and other personnel, facilities, equipment, materials and services; the availability and cost of employees and other personnel, facilities, equipment, materials (such as water) and services; the accuracy of reserve estimates, which by their nature involve the exercise of professional judgment and may therefore be imprecise; weather, including its impact on crude oil and natural gas demand, and weather-related delays in drilling and in the installation and operation (by EOG or third parties) of production, gathering, processing, refining, compression and transportation facilities; the ability of EOG's customers and other contractual counterparties to satisfy their obligations to EOG and, related thereto, to access the credit and capital markets to obtain financing needed to satisfy their obligations to EOG; EOG's ability to access the commercial paper market and other credit and capital markets to obtain financing on terms it deems acceptable, if at all, and to otherwise satisfy its capital expenditure requirements; the extent to which EOG is successful in its completion of planned asset dispositions; the extent and effect of any hedging activities engaged in by EOG; the timing and extent of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, inflation rates, global and domestic financial market conditions and global and domestic general economic conditions; political conditions and developments around the world (such as political instability and armed conflict), including in the areas in which EOG operates; the use of competing energy sources and the development of alternative energy sources; the extent to which EOG incurs uninsured losses and liabilities or losses and liabilities in excess of its insurance coverage; acts of war and terrorism and responses to these acts; physical, electronic and cyber security breaches; and the other factors described under ITEM 1A, Risk Factors, on pages 13 through 22 of EOG’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, and any updates to those factors set forth in EOG's subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q or Current Reports on Form 8-K.
In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the events anticipated by EOG's forward-looking statements may not occur, and, if any of such events do, we may not have anticipated the timing of their occurrence or the duration and extent of their impact on our actual results. Accordingly, you should not place any undue reliance on any of EOG's forward-looking statements. EOG's forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made, and EOG undertakes no obligation, other than as required by applicable law, to update or revise its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, subsequent events, anticipated or unanticipated circumstances or otherwise.
Cautionary Note to U.S. InvestorsThe United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) permits oil and gas companies, in their filings with the SEC, to disclose not only “proved” reserves (i.e., quantities of oil and gas that are estimated to be recoverable with a high degree of confidence), but also “probable” reserves (i.e., quantities of oil and gas that are as likely as not to be recovered) as well as “possible” reserves (i.e., additional quantities of oil and gas that might be recovered, but with a lower probability than probable reserves). Statements of reserves are only estimates and may not correspond to the ultimate quantities of oil and gas recovered. Any reserve estimates provided on this website that are not specifically designated as being estimates of proved reserves may include "potential" reserves and/or other estimated reserves not necessarily calculated in accordance with, or contemplated by, the SEC’s latest reserve reporting guidelines. Investors are urged to consider closely the disclosure in EOG’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, available from EOG at P.O. Box 4362, Houston, Texas 77210-4362 (Attn: Investor Relations). You can also obtain this report from the SEC by calling 1-800-SEC-0330 or from the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. In addition, reconciliation and calculation schedules for non-GAAP financial measures can be found on the EOG website at www.eogresources.com.

Information on this website is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind, either express or implied, including but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and the timeliness of the information. You assume all risk in using the information. In no event shall EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG) or its representatives be liable for any special, indirect or consequential damages resulting from use of the information.
Forward-Looking StatementsThis website includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, including, among others, statements and projections regarding EOG's future financial position, operations, performance, business strategy, returns, budgets, reserves, levels of production, costs and asset sales, statements regarding future commodity prices and statements regarding the plans and objectives of EOG's management for future operations, are forward-looking statements. EOG typically uses words such as "expect," "anticipate," "estimate," "project," "strategy," "intend," "plan," "target," "goal," "may," "will," "should" and "believe" or the negative of those terms or other variations or comparable terminology to identify its forward-looking statements. In particular, statements, express or implied, concerning EOG's future operating results and returns or EOG's ability to replace or increase reserves, increase production, reduce or otherwise control operating and capital costs, generate income or cash flows or pay dividends are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance.  Although EOG believes the expectations reflected in its forward-looking statements are reasonable and are based on reasonable assumptions, no assurance can be given that these assumptions are accurate or that any of these expectations will be achieved (in full or at all) or will prove to have been correct. Moreover, EOG's forward-looking statements may be affected by known, unknown or currently unforeseen risks, events or circumstances that may be outside EOG's control. Important factors that could cause EOG's actual results to differ materially from the expectations reflected in EOG's forward-looking statements include, among others: the timing, extent and duration of changes in prices for, supplies of, and demand for, crude oil and condensate, natural gas liquids, natural gas and related commodities; the extent to which EOG is successful in its efforts to acquire or discover additional reserves; the extent to which EOG is successful in its efforts to economically develop its acreage in, produce reserves and achieve anticipated production levels from, and maximize reserve recovery from, its existing and future crude oil and natural gas exploration and development projects; the extent to which EOG is successful in its efforts to market its crude oil and condensate, natural gas liquids, natural gas and related commodity production; the availability, proximity and capacity of, and costs associated with, appropriate gathering, processing, compression, transportation and refining facilities; the availability, cost, terms and timing of issuance or execution of, and competition for, mineral licenses and leases and governmental and other permits and rights-of-way, and EOG’s ability to retain mineral licenses and leases; the impact of, and changes in, government policies, laws and regulations, including tax laws and regulations; environmental, health and safety laws and regulations relating to air emissions, disposal of produced water, drilling fluids and other wastes, hydraulic fracturing and access to and use of water; laws and regulations imposing conditions or restrictions on drilling and completion operations and on the transportation of crude oil and natural gas; laws and regulations with respect to derivatives and hedging activities; and laws and regulations with respect to the import and export of crude oil, natural gas and related commodities; EOG's ability to effectively integrate acquired crude oil and natural gas properties into its operations, fully identify existing and potential problems with respect to such properties and accurately estimate reserves, production and costs with respect to such properties; the extent to which EOG's third-party-operated crude oil and natural gas properties are operated successfully and economically; competition in the oil and gas exploration and production industry for the acquisition of licenses, leases and properties, employees and other personnel, facilities, equipment, materials and services; the availability and cost of employees and other personnel, facilities, equipment, materials (such as water) and services; the accuracy of reserve estimates, which by their nature involve the exercise of professional judgment and may therefore be imprecise; weather, including its impact on crude oil and natural gas demand, and weather-related delays in drilling and in the installation and operation (by EOG or third parties) of production, gathering, processing, refining, compression and transportation facilities; the ability of EOG's customers and other contractual counterparties to satisfy their obligations to EOG and, related thereto, to access the credit and capital markets to obtain financing needed to satisfy their obligations to EOG; EOG's ability to access the commercial paper market and other credit and capital markets to obtain financing on terms it deems acceptable, if at all, and to otherwise satisfy its capital expenditure requirements; the extent to which EOG is successful in its completion of planned asset dispositions; the extent and effect of any hedging activities engaged in by EOG; the timing and extent of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, inflation rates, global and domestic financial market conditions and global and domestic general economic conditions; political conditions and developments around the world (such as political instability and armed conflict), including in the areas in which EOG operates; the use of competing energy sources and the development of alternative energy sources; the extent to which EOG incurs uninsured losses and liabilities or losses and liabilities in excess of its insurance coverage; acts of war and terrorism and responses to these acts; physical, electronic and cyber security breaches; and the other factors described under ITEM 1A, Risk Factors, on pages 13 through 22 of EOG’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, and any updates to those factors set forth in EOG's subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q or Current Reports on Form 8-K.
In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the events anticipated by EOG's forward-looking statements may not occur, and, if any of such events do, we may not have anticipated the timing of their occurrence or the duration and extent of their impact on our actual results. Accordingly, you should not place any undue reliance on any of EOG's forward-looking statements. EOG's forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made, and EOG undertakes no obligation, other than as required by applicable law, to update or revise its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, subsequent events, anticipated or unanticipated circumstances or otherwise.
Cautionary Note to U.S. InvestorsThe United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) permits oil and gas companies, in their filings with the SEC, to disclose not only “proved” reserves (i.e., quantities of oil and gas that are estimated to be recoverable with a high degree of confidence), but also “probable” reserves (i.e., quantities of oil and gas that are as likely as not to be recovered) as well as “possible” reserves (i.e., additional quantities of oil and gas that might be recovered, but with a lower probability than probable reserves). Statements of reserves are only estimates and may not correspond to the ultimate quantities of oil and gas recovered. Any reserve estimates provided on this website that are not specifically designated as being estimates of proved reserves may include "potential" reserves and/or other estimated reserves not necessarily calculated in accordance with, or contemplated by, the SEC’s latest reserve reporting guidelines. Investors are urged to consider closely the disclosure in EOG’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, available from EOG at P.O. Box 4362, Houston, Texas 77210-4362 (Attn: Investor Relations). You can also obtain this report from the SEC by calling 1-800-SEC-0330 or from the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. In addition, reconciliation and calculation schedules for non-GAAP financial measures can be found on the EOG website at www.eogresources.com.

EOG Resources Becomes #247 Most Shorted S&P 500 Component, Replacing Michael Kors Holdings
The most recent short interest data has been released for the 04/28/2017 settlement date, and we here at Dividend Channel like to sift through this fresh data and order the underlying components of the S&P 500 by "days to cover." There are a number of ways to look at short data, for example the total number of shares short; but one metric that we find particularly useful is the "days to cover" metric because it considers both the total shares short and the average daily volume of shares typically traded. The number of shares short is then compared to the average daily volume, in order to calculate the total number of trading days it would take to close out all of the open short positions if every share traded represented a short position being closed.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.

The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Important factors that could cause EOG's actual results to differ materially from the expectations reflected in EOG's forward-looking statements include, among others: the timing, extent and duration of changes in prices for, supplies of, and demand for, crude oil and condensate, natural gas liquids, natural gas and related commodities; the extent to which EOG is successful in its efforts to acquire or discover additional reserves; the extent to which EOG is successful in its efforts to economically develop its acreage in, produce reserves and achieve anticipated production levels from, and maximize reserve recovery from, its existing and future crude oil and natural gas exploration and development projects; the extent to which EOG is successful in its efforts to market its crude oil and condensate, natural gas liquids, natural gas and related commodity production; the availability, proximity and capacity of, and costs associated with, appropriate gathering, processing, compression, transportation and refining facilities; the availability, cost, terms and timing of issuance or execution of, and competition for, mineral licenses and leases and governmental and other permits and rights-of-way, and EOG’s ability to retain mineral licenses and leases; the impact of, and changes in, government policies, laws and regulations, including tax laws and regulations; environmental, health and safety laws and regulations relating to air emissions, disposal of produced water, drilling fluids and other wastes, hydraulic fracturing and access to and use of water; laws and regulations imposing conditions or restrictions on drilling and completion operations and on the transportation of crude oil and natural gas; laws and regulations with respect to derivatives and hedging activities; and laws and regulations with respect to the import and export of crude oil, natural gas and related commodities; EOG's ability to effectively integrate acquired crude oil and natural gas properties into its operations, fully identify existing and potential problems with respect to such properties and accurately estimate reserves, production and costs with respect to such properties; the extent to which EOG's third-party-operated crude oil and natural gas properties are operated successfully and economically; competition in the oil and gas exploration and production industry for the acquisition of licenses, leases and properties, employees and other personnel, facilities, equipment, materials and services; the availability and cost of employees and other personnel, facilities, equipment, materials (such as water) and services; the accuracy of reserve estimates, which by their nature involve the exercise of professional judgment and may therefore be imprecise; weather, including its impact on crude oil and natural gas demand, and weather-related delays in drilling and in the installation and operation (by EOG or third parties) of production, gathering, processing, refining, compression and transportation facilities; the ability of EOG's customers and other contractual counterparties to satisfy their obligations to EOG and, related thereto, to access the credit and capital markets to obtain financing needed to satisfy their obligations to EOG; EOG's ability to access the commercial paper market and other credit and capital markets to obtain financing on terms it deems acceptable, if at all, and to otherwise satisfy its capital expenditure requirements; the extent to which EOG is successful in its completion of planned asset dispositions; the extent and effect of any hedging activities engaged in by EOG; the timing and extent of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, inflation rates, global and domestic financial market conditions and global and domestic general economic conditions; political conditions and developments around the world (such as political instability and armed conflict), including in the areas in which EOG operates; the use of competing energy sources and the development of alternative energy sources; the extent to which EOG incurs uninsured losses and liabilities or losses and liabilities in excess of its insurance coverage; acts of war and terrorism and responses to these acts; physical, electronic and cyber security breaches; and the other factors described under ITEM 1A, Risk Factors, on pages 13 through 22 of EOG’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, and any updates to those factors set forth in EOG's subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q or Current Reports on Form 8-K.
In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the events anticipated by EOG's forward-looking statements may not occur, and, if any of such events do, we may not have anticipated the timing of their occurrence or the duration and extent of their impact on our actual results. Accordingly, you should not place any undue reliance on any of EOG's forward-looking statements. EOG's forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made, and EOG undertakes no obligation, other than as required by applicable law, to update or revise its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, subsequent events, anticipated or unanticipated circumstances or otherwise.
Cautionary Note to U.S. InvestorsThe United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) permits oil and gas companies, in their filings with the SEC, to disclose not only “proved” reserves (i.e., quantities of oil and gas that are estimated to be recoverable with a high degree of confidence), but also “probable” reserves (i.e., quantities of oil and gas that are as likely as not to be recovered) as well as “possible” reserves (i.e., additional quantities of oil and gas that might be recovered, but with a lower probability than probable reserves). Statements of reserves are only estimates and may not correspond to the ultimate quantities of oil and gas recovered. Any reserve estimates provided on this website that are not specifically designated as being estimates of proved reserves may include "potential" reserves and/or other estimated reserves not necessarily calculated in accordance with, or contemplated by, the SEC’s latest reserve reporting guidelines. Investors are urged to consider closely the disclosure in EOG’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, available from EOG at P.O. Box 4362, Houston, Texas 77210-4362 (Attn: Investor Relations). You can also obtain this report from the SEC by calling 1-800-SEC-0330 or from the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. In addition, reconciliation and calculation schedules for non-GAAP financial measures can be found on the EOG website at www.eogresources.com.
