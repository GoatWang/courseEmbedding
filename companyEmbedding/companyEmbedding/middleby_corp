Company history[edit]
The company was founded by Joseph Middleby and John Marshall in 1888 as a bakery supplier. The company made custom portable ovens for the bakery industry. Middleby sold the company to Marshall in the early 1900s.[4] The company was privately held by descendents of Marshall until it was purchased by a private company in 1976.[4] The company was purchased by TMC Industries Ltd. in 1983 and changed its name to The Middleby Corporation in 1985 and moved its headquarters to Elgin, Illinois in the late 1980s.[4]
By 1996, the company had expanded its manufacturing base overseas and had opened a manufacturing and training facility employing 190 in Santa Rosa, Laguna, the Philippines.[6]
By 2006, the company had successfully streamlined operations to an extent allowing them to close two of its seven manufacturing facilities in the United States with no loss of product lines or capacity; this was in addition to three facilities shut down in 2001 and 2002.[7] Also in the 2001 to 2006 period, the company's income yield from sales increased from about 3% to just over 10%, while it's stock valuation increased by over 15-fold,[7][note 1] performance gains which were attributed to CEO Bassoul.[2]
The Middleby Corporation was originally available for purchase on the NASDAQ over-the-counter market, and became listed on the American Stock Exchange in 1988. Its first public offering came in September 1997 with a share price offering of $10 on the NASDAQ. Selim Bassoul became the CEO of Middleby in January 2001.[2]
Notable acquisitions[edit]
Middleby has acquired numerous businesses in the US and internationally.[4] In 1990, Middleby acquired a majority stake in Asbury Associates Inc., a Filipino manufacturer of food service equipment.[8] It increased its interest to 80% by 1991 and became the company's main export distributor internationally with the exception of Canada where Middleby already owned a distributor.[9] The same year, it established Fab-Asia, Inc., a separate unit in Manila for manufacturing of kitchen equipment for markets in Asia and the United States.[4]
Middleby acquired the commercial cooking business of the Maytag Corporation in 2001 for $95 million.[10] The purchase added the G.S. Blodgett, Pitco Frialator, and MagiKitch'n brands to Middleby's commercial appliance line[11]
Middleby purchased TurboChef in 2008 in a deal reported to be worth $200 million.[12] It was reported by Bassoul that the purchase would strengthen the company's position as a leader in the food service equipment industry.[12] Both companies were previously competitors in food service equipment for speed cooking pizza ovens.[13]
In 2013, The Middleby Corporation purchased Viking Range for $380 million from investors Warren Stephens and Fred Carl, Jr..[14] Middleby announced that it would incorporate its technology into Viking equipment and increase residential sales, which were approximately 1% to 2% of the company's overall sales prior to the purchase.[14] The acquisition was said to be the largest in the company's history.[2]
In July 2015, Aga Rangemaster Group, the British manufacturer of cast-iron cooking ranges was acquired for £129m million.[15]

The award was given to a total of 11 firms in the United States for recognition of their success in exporting.[25] It was recognized again for its exporting in 2001 as a recipient of the Governor's Export Award presented by then Illinois Governor George Ryan.[26]
Middleby made the Crain's Chicago Business Fast 50 list in 2013,[27] also being recognized on the list in 2007[28] and 2009.[29] It received a NRA Kitchen Innovations Award in 2013 for its WOW! Ovens, currently in use by the top nine pizza chains.[30] It was also featured in the 2011 book Innovating...Chicago-style: How Local Innovators Are Building the National Economy.[31]

Company history[edit]
The company was founded by Joseph Middleby and John Marshall in 1888 as a bakery supplier. The company made custom portable ovens for the bakery industry. Middleby sold the company to Marshall in the early 1900s.[4] The company was privately held by descendents of Marshall until it was purchased by a private company in 1976.[4] The company was purchased by TMC Industries Ltd. in 1983 and changed its name to The Middleby Corporation in 1985 and moved its headquarters to Elgin, Illinois in the late 1980s.[4]
By 1996, the company had expanded its manufacturing base overseas and had opened a manufacturing and training facility employing 190 in Santa Rosa, Laguna, the Philippines.[6]
By 2006, the company had successfully streamlined operations to an extent allowing them to close two of its seven manufacturing facilities in the United States with no loss of product lines or capacity; this was in addition to three facilities shut down in 2001 and 2002.[7] Also in the 2001 to 2006 period, the company's income yield from sales increased from about 3% to just over 10%, while it's stock valuation increased by over 15-fold,[7][note 1] performance gains which were attributed to CEO Bassoul.[2]
The Middleby Corporation was originally available for purchase on the NASDAQ over-the-counter market, and became listed on the American Stock Exchange in 1988. Its first public offering came in September 1997 with a share price offering of $10 on the NASDAQ. Selim Bassoul became the CEO of Middleby in January 2001.[2]
Notable acquisitions[edit]
Middleby has acquired numerous businesses in the US and internationally.[4] In 1990, Middleby acquired a majority stake in Asbury Associates Inc., a Filipino manufacturer of food service equipment.[8] It increased its interest to 80% by 1991 and became the company's main export distributor internationally with the exception of Canada where Middleby already owned a distributor.[9] The same year, it established Fab-Asia, Inc., a separate unit in Manila for manufacturing of kitchen equipment for markets in Asia and the United States.[4]
Middleby acquired the commercial cooking business of the Maytag Corporation in 2001 for $95 million.[10] The purchase added the G.S. Blodgett, Pitco Frialator, and MagiKitch'n brands to Middleby's commercial appliance line[11]
Middleby purchased TurboChef in 2008 in a deal reported to be worth $200 million.[12] It was reported by Bassoul that the purchase would strengthen the company's position as a leader in the food service equipment industry.[12] Both companies were previously competitors in food service equipment for speed cooking pizza ovens.[13]
In 2013, The Middleby Corporation purchased Viking Range for $380 million from investors Warren Stephens and Fred Carl, Jr..[14] Middleby announced that it would incorporate its technology into Viking equipment and increase residential sales, which were approximately 1% to 2% of the company's overall sales prior to the purchase.[14] The acquisition was said to be the largest in the company's history.[2]
In July 2015, Aga Rangemaster Group, the British manufacturer of cast-iron cooking ranges was acquired for £129m million.[15]

The award was given to a total of 11 firms in the United States for recognition of their success in exporting.[25] It was recognized again for its exporting in 2001 as a recipient of the Governor's Export Award presented by then Illinois Governor George Ryan.[26]

As previously stated, Commercial Foodservice has averaged 21.8% growth internationally since 2010. It is estimated that going out to eat in emerging markets will outpace the US within five years. Middleby has positioned themselves well for this trend with Significant investments in Brazil, China, Russia, India, and others.

Middleby Connect digitally handles diagnostics, notifications, maintenance, and menu management, all in one place. An example is shown in Figure 5.

I see them performing well for the next forty years. In some future 'Jetsons' world, it will be Middleby products automatically cooking the perfect meals for us.

Company history[edit]
The company was founded by Joseph Middleby and John Marshall in 1888 as a bakery supplier. The company made custom portable ovens for the bakery industry. Middleby sold the company to Marshall in the early 1900s.[4] The company was privately held by descendents of Marshall until it was purchased by a private company in 1976.[4] The company was purchased by TMC Industries Ltd. in 1983 and changed its name to The Middleby Corporation in 1985 and moved its headquarters to Elgin, Illinois in the late 1980s.[4]
By 1996, the company had expanded its manufacturing base overseas and had opened a manufacturing and training facility employing 190 in Santa Rosa, Laguna, the Philippines.[6]
By 2006, the company had successfully streamlined operations to an extent allowing them to close two of its seven manufacturing facilities in the United States with no loss of product lines or capacity; this was in addition to three facilities shut down in 2001 and 2002.[7] Also in the 2001 to 2006 period, the company's income yield from sales increased from about 3% to just over 10%, while it's stock valuation increased by over 15-fold,[7][note 1] performance gains which were attributed to CEO Bassoul.[2]
The Middleby Corporation was originally available for purchase on the NASDAQ over-the-counter market, and became listed on the American Stock Exchange in 1988. Its first public offering came in September 1997 with a share price offering of $10 on the NASDAQ. Selim Bassoul became the CEO of Middleby in January 2001.[2]
Notable acquisitions[edit]
Middleby has acquired numerous businesses in the US and internationally.[4] In 1990, Middleby acquired a majority stake in Asbury Associates Inc., a Filipino manufacturer of food service equipment.[8] It increased its interest to 80% by 1991 and became the company's main export distributor internationally with the exception of Canada where Middleby already owned a distributor.[9] The same year, it established Fab-Asia, Inc., a separate unit in Manila for manufacturing of kitchen equipment for markets in Asia and the United States.[4]
Middleby acquired the commercial cooking business of the Maytag Corporation in 2001 for $95 million.[10] The purchase added the G.S. Blodgett, Pitco Frialator, and MagiKitch'n brands to Middleby's commercial appliance line[11]
Middleby purchased TurboChef in 2008 in a deal reported to be worth $200 million.[12] It was reported by Bassoul that the purchase would strengthen the company's position as a leader in the food service equipment industry.[12] Both companies were previously competitors in food service equipment for speed cooking pizza ovens.[13]
In 2013, The Middleby Corporation purchased Viking Range for $380 million from investors Warren Stephens and Fred Carl, Jr..[14] Middleby announced that it would incorporate its technology into Viking equipment and increase residential sales, which were approximately 1% to 2% of the company's overall sales prior to the purchase.[14] The acquisition was said to be the largest in the company's history.[2]
In July 2015, Aga Rangemaster Group, the British manufacturer of cast-iron cooking ranges was acquired for £129m million.[15]

Company history[edit]
The company was founded by Joseph Middleby and John Marshall in 1888 as a bakery supplier. The company made custom portable ovens for the bakery industry. Middleby sold the company to Marshall in the early 1900s.[4] The company was privately held by descendents of Marshall until it was purchased by a private company in 1976.[4] The company was purchased by TMC Industries Ltd. in 1983 and changed its name to The Middleby Corporation in 1985 and moved its headquarters to Elgin, Illinois in the late 1980s.[4]
By 1996, the company had expanded its manufacturing base overseas and had opened a manufacturing and training facility employing 190 in Santa Rosa, Laguna, the Philippines.[6]
By 2006, the company had successfully streamlined operations to an extent allowing them to close two of its seven manufacturing facilities in the United States with no loss of product lines or capacity; this was in addition to three facilities shut down in 2001 and 2002.[7] Also in the 2001 to 2006 period, the company's income yield from sales increased from about 3% to just over 10%, while it's stock valuation increased by over 15-fold,[7][note 1] performance gains which were attributed to CEO Bassoul.[2]
The Middleby Corporation was originally available for purchase on the NASDAQ over-the-counter market, and became listed on the American Stock Exchange in 1988. Its first public offering came in September 1997 with a share price offering of $10 on the NASDAQ. Selim Bassoul became the CEO of Middleby in January 2001.[2]
Notable acquisitions[edit]
Middleby has acquired numerous businesses in the US and internationally.[4] In 1990, Middleby acquired a majority stake in Asbury Associates Inc., a Filipino manufacturer of food service equipment.[8] It increased its interest to 80% by 1991 and became the company's main export distributor internationally with the exception of Canada where Middleby already owned a distributor.[9] The same year, it established Fab-Asia, Inc., a separate unit in Manila for manufacturing of kitchen equipment for markets in Asia and the United States.[4]
Middleby acquired the commercial cooking business of the Maytag Corporation in 2001 for $95 million.[10] The purchase added the G.S. Blodgett, Pitco Frialator, and MagiKitch'n brands to Middleby's commercial appliance line[11]
Middleby purchased TurboChef in 2008 in a deal reported to be worth $200 million.[12] It was reported by Bassoul that the purchase would strengthen the company's position as a leader in the food service equipment industry.[12] Both companies were previously competitors in food service equipment for speed cooking pizza ovens.[13]
In 2013, The Middleby Corporation purchased Viking Range for $380 million from investors Warren Stephens and Fred Carl, Jr..[14] Middleby announced that it would incorporate its technology into Viking equipment and increase residential sales, which were approximately 1% to 2% of the company's overall sales prior to the purchase.[14] The acquisition was said to be the largest in the company's history.[2]
In July 2015, Aga Rangemaster Group, the British manufacturer of cast-iron cooking ranges was acquired for £129m million.[15]
