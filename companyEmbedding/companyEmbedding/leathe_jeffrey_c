Lantos Technologies Appoints Jeffrey C. Leathe as Chairman and CEO 
      and Closes $4.1 Million Financing




-Global Life Sciences Veteran to Lead Commercialization of 3D Ear 
      Canal Scanning Technology-








August 29, 2011 09:30 AM Eastern Daylight Time



CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Lantos Technologies, a company developing the world’s first intra-aural 
      3D scanner, today announced the appointment of Jeffrey C. Leathe as 
      Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Company’s Board of 
      Directors. The founding CEO of Lantos, Shahid Azim, becomes Senior Vice 
      President, New Market Development, primarily focusing on consumer 
      applications.
    


      The company also announced the closing of a $4.1 million Series B 
      financing by existing investors Catalyst Health Ventures, Excel Venture 
      Management and Mass Medical Angels. Excel Venture Management led the 
      round. The funding will support the continued development of the world’s 
      first real-time 3D ear canal scanning technology which will enable 
      custom fit audio devices such as hearing aids, earphones and 
      noise-canceling devices. The novel technology provides fast, accurate 
      and minimally invasive digital mapping of the human ear canal.
    

      “We are delighted to have Jeff join the Lantos team at such an exciting 
      time in the Company’s development,” said Darshana Zaveri, Partner, 
      Catalyst Health Ventures. “Jeff brings to Lantos tremendous knowledge 
      and experience in building successful companies and is uniquely 
      qualified to lead Lantos as it prepares to commercialize its proprietary 
      technology.”
    

      Before joining Lantos, Mr. Leathe was Chairman and CEO of Biocius Life 
      Sciences, a privately held instrument and contract research organization 
      focused on drug discovery research and clinical diagnostic testing. 
      Prior to Biocius, Jeff was a senior executive at BioTrove, a privately 
      held genomics products company. From 1990-2003, Jeff was the EVP of 
      Apogent Technologies, a $1.2 billion public company which manufactured 
      products for life science research and clinical diagnostics.
    

      “Jeff is a distinguished executive in the life sciences field and Lantos 
      is his third venture backed company founded on MIT technology,” noted 
      Rick Blume, Managing Director at Excel Venture Management. “We are 
      excited to work with Jeff again as he and the MIT team at Lantos bring 
      this transformative technology to the audiology market.”
    

      “I am excited to be joining the Lantos team as the company prepares for 
      clinical trials and regulatory filings in advance of its first product 
      launch expected in 2012,” commented Jeff Leathe. “Intra-aural scanning 
      is seen as the holy grail of audiology and with the Lantos technology, 
      team and additional funding, this dream is becoming closer to reality 
      for the industry.”
    

      About Lantos Technologies
    

      Lantos Technologies is developing the world’s first intra-aural 3D 
      scanner providing fast, highly accurate and minimally invasive mapping 
      of the human ear canal. Discovered and developed in the lab of MIT 
      professor Douglas Hart, this unique imaging technology presents the 
      opportunity to significantly enhance consumers’ experience with custom 
      ear devices. In addition, the first ever image capture of dynamic ear 
      canal data is expected to drive product innovation in the audiology 
      field for years to come. www.lantostechnologies.com

Lantos 3D ear mapping: much cooler than you think

Meghan Kelly August 29, 2011 4:10 PM







A technology originally invented for scanning the inside of your mouth might lead to better-fitting earbuds and hearing aids, thanks to Lantos, which just announced a new chief executive, Jeffrey C. Leathe, along with a $4.1 million second round of funding.
Traditionally, if you need an image of your ear canal a doctor pours silicon gel into your ear, which expands and hardens to create a model of your inner ear. The process is uncomfortable, cannot safely reach the entire length of the canal, and can sometimes be inaccurate. (Not to mention that it might make you think disturbing thoughts of the Star Trek Wrath of Kahn ear-eel scene.) Lantos’ product, however, minimizes the invasive nature of ear-mapping.
Lantos’ 3D scanner is like putting a thin pencil in your ear, according to new chief executive and chairman of the board, Jeffrey Leathe. The probe has a “sophisticated balloon,” or membrane, at the end that can be inflated and then safely travels all the way down the ear canal. A liquid travels along the membrane and allows a camera, aided by a light at the end of the probe, to record thousands of data points along the canal. This forms the 3D image, without much disturbance to the patient.
The idea was born in the MIT lab of Doug Hart, who created 3D oral scanning technology later bought by 3M. This technology also replaced a molded impression technique, but for teeth. Now Leathe has been brought on board to lead the ear-focused technology down the path of testing for not one, but three markets: audiology (hearing aids), military and consumer use.
“We are just entering clinical trials, our major clinical trial will be held with the U.S. Army,” Leathe told VentureBeat in an interview.
The military has shown significant interest in this technology, according to Leathe, particularly for hearing protection and two way communications devices. Leathe was limited in what he could discuss surrounding the products themselves. He did mention, however, current impression-taking technology doesn’t make for a comfortable fitting device. Thus, some soldiers opt to not wear protective ear pieces, so as not to hinder their performance. If that practice is widespread, it’s no wonder the military is reaching out for a better way to protect its soldiers.
Other studies will be done in audiologists’ private practices and institutions for hearing aid development, along with a branch in the consumer direction.
“We’ve been taking to a lot of folks in the consumer industry, but it’s early,” said Leathe.
Currently, a few companies, such as Etymotics , will make a personal set of earbuds for your headphones, but it’s pricey. This is where Lantos would step in with a more accurate picture of your ear and subsequent ear bud.
“[Look at] Dr. Dre. That’s $300 for a pair of Dr. Dre headphones,” said Leathe. “People are willing to pay a large amount of money for better audio quality.”
Lantos will be using its funding to move the device out of prototype stage and into production next year. The device will officially be launched at the AAA conference, an audiology event based in Boston, in mid-2012.
The company is headquartered near Boston in Cambridge, Mass. and was founded in 2010. Lantos has 9 employees strong and has raised $5.7 million total in venture funding to date. Investors include Excel Venture Management, Catalyst Health Ventures, and Mass Medical Angels.
