 John D. Larkin and the Larkin Company
Excerpted (without footnotes)
from the Nomination for The Hydraulics/Larkin Neighborhood, Section E, pp. 12-17

By Jennifer Walkowski

2.1 John D. Larkin and the Larkin Company

Of
all the businesses and industries which found a home in the Hydraulics
neighborhood, by far the largest and most successful was the Larkin
Company, makers of soaps, toiletries and a wide variety of household
products. In the age befor2.1 e the industrial revolution of the
mid-nineteenth-century, soap making originally was a small, cottage
industry in the United States. Soap making became one of many
industries which benefited from mass-production, thanks to new
machinery and technologies. Like many of the companies in the
neighborhood, the Larkin Company took advantage of the Hydraulics
area’s proximity to regional and national transportation routes, raw
materials and ample labor force. Rising from humble origins in the
late-nineteenth-century, by the early twentieth-century the Larkin
Company grew to become one of the largest companies in the city of
Buffalo and also the country.

John Durrant Larkin was born in Buffalo in 1845 at 13 Clinton Street
(where the NRE Lafayette Hotel now stands), the middle child of seven
born to Mary Ann (Durrant) and Levi Larkin, founder of the Clinton Iron
Works.53 John D. Larkin became involved in the soap industry in 1862,
when he began working as a clerk in the office of the Buffalo soap
works of his brother-in-law, Justus Weller. By 1865, Larkin was made a
partial partner in the company, and when Weller decided to relocate the
company to Chicago in 1870, Larkin was invited to relocate with the
firm, becoming a full partner. Larkin spent five years in Chicago,
forming personal connections and learning much about the business end
of the company. His time in the growing metropolis laid the foundation
for his later individual career in the soap industry.

Sometime in 1871 Larkin was introduced to Weller’s uncle, Dr. Silas
Hubbard, who lived in Bloomington, Illinois. The relationship between
the Hubbard family and John Larkin became a significant association,
and the two families would become intertwined following this initial
meeting. Dr. Hubbard’s teenage son, Elbert, was encouraged to join the
soap company of Larkin & Weller as a salesman, and John Larkin
would marry Elbert’s older sister, Frances (or Frank as she was
nicknamed), in 1874. The happy times of the Weller, Hubbard and Larkin
families would not last for long, and by 1875 Justus Weller’s marriage
to Mary Larkin ended in divorce, forcing John D. Larkin to leave the
Larkin and Weller company to establish a soap works of his own.

After travelling to Boston, Larkin eventually returned to his hometown
of Buffalo, which provided the transportation and animal fats needed to
grow a successful soap industry, especially the Hydraulics
neighborhood. Larkin’s first factory was located at 196-198 Chicago
Street in Buffalo’s Old First Ward area, and by 1877 the company had
grown so rapidly that Larkin purchased property at 667 Seneca Street in
the Hydraulics neighborhood in order to build a larger factory,
adjacent to rail lines and the needed raw materials.54 Larkin employed
his brother-in-law, Elbert Hubbard, as his first salesman and a
one-third partner. Hubbard travelled widely for the company in his
years as a salesman or “slinger” as they were known, spending the years
between 1875 and 1878 travelling between Buffalo, Chicago and
Milwaukee. In 1875, Hubbard’s role in the company grew, and he hired
Frank Martin from Dayton, Ohio to lead a crew of door-to-door
“slingers” for the company. In 1879, Frank’s young thirteen-year-old
brother Darwin D. Martin was brought to Buffalo as one of the “slinger”
crew. By the late 1870s, the “J.D. Larkin & Co.” firm was well
established.

During the height of its activities, the Larkin Company was a sales and
marketing pioneer. The company’s initial sales strategy was a typical,
door-to-door campaign which brought the soap and toiletry products
direct to the consumer. In the early 1880s the company began including
a small premium item, such as a handkerchief or a small
chromolithograph, in each box of soap to entice customers to purchase
larger quantities. The idea of including a premium was not invented by
the Larkin Company, but the company was highly successful at the
combination of direct-mail solicitation to the customer (rather than a
shopkeeper or middle-man), and the enticement of premiums allowed the
company to sell directly to the customer. By 1885 the Larkin Company
was able to completely eliminate the middle-men from its business
dealings. In 1886, Larkin marketing mastermind, Elbert Hubbard, created
the successful “Combination Box,” an assortment of soaps and toiletry
items which was shipped on thirty-days approval, allowing customers to
try and use the products or return them for a refund. The company’s
selection of premium items also expanded during the 1890s to include
products such as the popular “Chautauqua Lamp” first offered in 1892
and the “Chautauqua Desk” which was offered in 1893. These high-quality
premium products encouraged bulk purchases of soap and other products.
The “Larkin Idea” marketing strategy embodied the spirit of the Larkin
Company’s direct-to-the-consumer approach; if a customer was willing to
commit ten dollars (about one week’s pay for most people at the time)
to a direct purchase of a year’s supply of soap then the Larkin Company
agreed to share the advantage in the form of an attractive premium
item. This strategy promoted a sense of “quasi-familial” intimacy
between the consumer – or “Larkinite” - and the company and is the root
of much of modern marketing strategies today.

The Larkin Company also pioneered the concept of getting the average
consumer involved in the sales process. Called “Larkin Clubs of Ten,”
which began in the early 1890s, these clubs consisted of ten families,
generally under the guidance of the females of the family, who pooled
their financial resources in order to buy the expensive combination
boxes and to share the premium offerings. While members drew straws to
win the premium prize, by the tenth month all members obtained a
premium. Some enterprising people purchased the boxes and sold them to
their friends, family and neighbors, keeping the premiums for
themselves. In this way, the Larkin Company replaced the typical sales
force with primarily housewives and women, effectively reducing
packaging, shipping and administrative costs, and because the women who
ran the club acted in the place of the more typical corporate-sponsored
sales staff, the Larkin Company saved on labor and other related
costs.56 These clubs were the forerunner of Avon, Tupperware parties
and other types of female consumer-sold product.

As early as 1881 the Larkin company employed nearly one hundred factory
workers, and had organized into four departments of shipping clerks,
mail-advertising helpers, bookkeeper and a “miscellaneous” group.
Borrowing the card- ledger system of the local YMCA library, Darwin
Martin created a unique bookkeeping and tracking system for the Larkin
Company in 1885, recently promoted from his sales position. By
September of 1885, Martin noted over 35,000 accounts in the ledger, and
as business continued to prosper, he soon created and supervised both
the Order and Bookkeeping Departments and hired a staff of assistants.

The combination of the business sense of John D. Larkin, the
administrative skills of Darwin D. Martin and the salesmanship of
Elbert Hubbard turned the Larkin Company into one of the most
successful companies in Buffalo in the late nineteenth-century, as the
company expanded its business into selling toiletries, furniture,
lamps, home products and a myriad of other items. As the quantity and
variety of the products produced by the company increased, the size and
scale of the production factory also grew. 
The small brick factory at 667 Seneca Street was quickly outgrown, and
the Larkin Company constructed a series of simple, utilitarian
buildings near the intersection of Swan and Seneca Streets between the
1880s and 1912. Beginning in 1895, the company constructed twelve new
factory buildings ranging from eight to ten stories in height on an
entire block of land at Seneca Street between Larkin (formerly Heacock)
and Van Rensselaer Streets (fig C-4). While appearing to be one
enormous building, the large bulk was actually divided in several
smaller facilities for specialized production ranging from soap making,
wrapping, storing, lumber storage, perfumes and a myriad of other
functions. 

A large Power House building (1902) and a railroad terminal warehouse
building (1912) were among other specialized building added to the
growing Larkin Company complex. Designed by the R.J. Reidpath Company
of Buffalo, these steel framed brick-clad buildings were ideally suited
for the needs of industrial manufacturing, but were unsuitable for the
office and corporate needs of the ever-growing company. In 1903 alone
the Larkin Company was receiving over 5,000 letters per day, and new
members of the office staff were hired weekly to accommodate the
rapidly growing administrative needs of the thriving company. Housed in
the E and F Buildings of the factory, the increasing administrative
aspects of the company, coupled with the constant demand for new
production spaces within the factory itself, soon created the need for
a new separate administration building.

Although the factory site in the Hydraulics was selected based on the
area’s proximity to several major railroad routes, the noisy, dirty and
polluted industrial neighborhood was not ideal for a significant office
building to be constructed. The typical office worker at the time was
female, and the Larkin Company felt they would not be enticed to work
in this area of the city. The new administrative building was also seen
as a sort of figurehead for the company as well. John D. Larkin
selected Frank Lloyd Wright as the architect for the new building on
the recommendation of Darwin Martin (who by this time had become
Treasurer) and Larkin’s brother-in-law, William Heath, who was the
company’s head of the legal department.61 Designed and constructed
between 1903 and 1904, the new Larkin Administration Building at 680
Seneca Street, just north of the company’s largest factory building. 

In response to the industrial atmosphere around it, the building was
the height of modern technology, creating a sealed, healthy indoor
environment, and pioneered several hygienic features in large office
buildings. Clean, fresh air was circulated in the sealed building
through a rudimentary type of air conditioning system which turned the
blocky corner piers of the building into a massive circulation system.
A large interior courtyard infused the interior with natural light and
allowed for additional air circulation. In order to prevent the clutter
common in large offices, Wright custom designed built-in metal office
furniture, file cabinets, desks and even wall-hung toilets. The
Administration Building also featured an elegant restaurant and
conservatory where the female office workers could unwind and be
entertained. Everything about the building was designed to be clean,
efficient, pristine and modern in order to accommodate a staff of over
1800 people. 
Upon its completion in 1906, the Larkin Administration Building was
hailed as a triumph of modern architecture and office building design
by European and American architects, critics and historians alike.

The Larkin Administration Building also was notable for its removal of
the administrative and management functions from its previous location
in the midst of the production floor. Previous to this era, management
staff and facilities of a majority of American factories and industrial
buildings were typically located right in the heart of the production
floor, keeping management in touch with the labor force and the
manufacturing process. The Larkin Administration Building created a
separated building designated solely to the management and office tasks
of the business, perhaps spurred by the labor strikes and turmoil of
this period in American history. While the result created an emblematic
building which was specifically designed to house and economize the
clerical functions of the company, the construction of the Larkin
Administration Building effectively severed the deep-rooted connection
between management and the labor force.

The Larkin Company continued to be successful well into the 1920s. By
1925 the company manufactured a majority of the over nine-hundred
catalog items in its expansive factory complex which covered over
sixteen-and-a-half acres on Seneca Street in the Hydraulics. In
addition to their own soaps, cleansers, cosmetics, perfume,
pharmaceuticals and food, they offered consumers everything from
clothing and furniture to utensils and radios. With its primary
corporate headquarters centered in Buffalo, the company had branches
across the East Coast in Boston, Chicago, Peoria, Cleveland, Pittsburgh
and New York City. The company had expanded into many aspects of daily
consumer life, including the 154 Larkin chain stores in Western New
York and Peoria, Illinois and the Larkin-branded fuel stations which
pumped gas in Buffalo, Rochester and Erie, Pennsylvania. Over 4,000
employees proudly called themselves “Larkinites.” By the 1920s, the
Larkin Company had expanded their range of products to cover nearly
every aspect of daily life.

2.2    The Decline of the Larkin Company and the Demolition of the Administration Building

The Larkin Company was once one of the largest and most recognizable
companies in the country. Soon after the company reached its largest
and most influential phase in the 1920s, the company began suffering
from both internal and external pressures. Many of the issues and
obstacles faced by Buffalo, and specifically the Hydraulics
neighborhood, in the mid-twentieth-century also led to the demise of
the Larkin Company empire by the 1950s.

During the late 1920s and early 1930s, Buffalo’s position as one of the
most vital Great Lakes port and railroad city began to weaken. This was
due in part to the increasing number of cross-country highways being
constructed in the period and the rise of the trucking industry. Also,
the creation of new shipping lanes including the Welland Canal through
Ontario, Canada (significantly expanded between 1912 and 1932) also
helped traffic circumvent the Buffalo and Niagara Falls area. Both of
these conditions helped to undermine Buffalo’s historic geographical
advantage at the confluence of the Great Lakes and the East Coast.

Consumer culture also began to change during the interwar period as
well. The popularity of mail-order catalog business, which had been the
backbone of the Larkin Company’s sales strategy from its inception in
the 1870s, began to wane as chain stores proliferated across the
nation’s small towns, allowing the consumer to view, sample and
directly purchase their goods. The increasing popularity of the
automobile allowed for greater mobility of small town residents, who
could come into the urban centers to visit stores which offered
cut-price items with which the fixed-price Larkin products could not
compete. In addition to these factors, women, who had been the primary
Larkin sales force through the turn of the century, now had increasing
opportunities in business and industry after World War I and were no
longer drawn by the additional meager incomes which the Larkin “Clubs
of Ten” could bring.

The Larkin Company attempted to change with the times and stay afloat
in the changing business climate of the post-war era. The first of over
several hundred “Larkin Economy Stores” opened in 1918 as a means to
compete with the chain stores. The company itself reorganized, selling
off subsidiary manufacturers and closing some of the branch offices in
the 1920s.

In additional to these external pressures, internal problems also
became more serious in this period. John D. Larkin regarded the company
as a family-run operation, to be continued by his sons and sons-in-law.
Larkin’s oldest son, Charles joined the company in the 1890s, but he
lacked a passion for his father’s company and retired in 1920. Other
family members were made executives in the early 1900s, including John
D. Larkin, Jr., who in 1915 began taking an active role in company
policy making, setting the stage for his eventual takeover in 1926.
William Heath, Larkin Office Manager since 1902, abruptly retired from
the Larkin Company in 1924, and Darwin Martin soon followed, retiring
in 1925 after butting heads with John D. Larkin, Jr. 

The loss of these critical members of the Larkin Company core lead to a
wave of other sudden retirements, including three key members of the
Secretary’s Department. The increasing prominence of John D. Larkin,
Jr. in the Larkin Company brought about the retirement of most of the
men who had built the company in its earliest mail-order days.
Following the death of Larkin Sr. in 1926, his son John D. Larkin, Jr.
controlled the fate of the struggling company.

Mirroring his disregard for the loyal and experienced executive core of
the Larkin Company, Larkin, Jr. had little regard for the stately
architecture of his father’s Administration Building. Despite the
on-site protests of Frank Lloyd Wright, the younger John Larkin
authorized the cutting of large windows into the fifth story of the
building. The Larkin Auditorium building, which had played a role
entertaining the throngs of Larkin Company employees for many years,
was demolished in the 1936 to make way for a parking lot. 

He relocated the mail-order business from the symbolic place of honor
on the main floor of the light court to the fifth floor, dryly renaming
it the “Buying Department.” Various other departments were relocated
and rearranged in the various factory buildings, often with detrimental
effects on workflow and productivity.

During John D. Larkin, Jr.’s tenure as President of the Larkin Company,
between 1926 and 1940, the company struggled with increasing
indebtedness. The younger Larkin continued to push for maintaining the
large, diverse premium catalog despite the changing marketplace and in
the face of new competition. During this period the Larkin Company
faced shrinking sales revenues and the increased strain of the Great
Depression. By 1939 the situation was so dire that the company’s Board
of Directors was forced to take action to avoid bankruptcy. 
As part of a restructuring deal, the board separated the Larkin Co.
Inc. (the company’s official name at the time) from the company’s real
estate holdings, selling off properties whenever possible in order to
help pay off the debt. In the same year Harry Larkin replaced John D.
Larkin, Jr. as president, and Larkin, Jr. soon resigned from the Board
of Directors as well. This same year saw the sale of the Larkin
Administration Building to the Larkin Co. Inc., which moved the Larkin
department store into the first three floors of the building. The much
smaller mail-order department was housed in the fourth and fifth
floors. These moves taken by the Larkin Company were unsuccessful in
preventing the collapse of the company, however, and in 1941 additional
corporations were created in order to allow stock-holders to salvage
portions of the business. By 1943, a creditor’s committee was formed,
most of the company’s assets were liquidated, and the creditors were
all paid off. As a result, the Larkin Company was left with no assets
other than the Administration Building, on which they owed $85,000 in
back taxes.

The Larkin Company and the Administration Building was purchased in
1943 by a contractor from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, under the belief
that the taxes owed would help offset large profits he was realizing
from laying a transcontinental pipeline. When the Federal Government
denied the tax break, he abandoned the building, which stood unheated
and unmaintained. In 1945 the City of Buffalo took over the
Administration Building in a $104,616 tax foreclosure proceeding. The
specificity of the design of the Administration Building with its
central court and open plan, coupled with the fact it had no in-house
heating facility, made its reuse difficult. 

The building’s location in the Hydraulics neighborhood, removed from
the downtown core, was also seen as an impediment to reuse. In 1946 an
offer of $26,000 for the decaying building was made by an anonymous
buyer, but the Common Council sought a national advertising campaign as
a way to increase the attention on the sale of the building. This plan
never materialized, however, once a potential housing project for the
building was studied and ultimately deemed unfeasible. Further attempts
to stimulate a high selling price for the Administration Building
failed, and it continued to decompose. According to accounts everything
from lighting fixtures, knobs, plumbing and even the copper roofs had
been stripped from the building. The iron fencing of the low brick wall
which surrounded the building was removed for a wartime scrap
collection.

The last attempt to reuse and save the festering Administration
Building was made by councilman Joseph F. Dudzick on April 18th, 1949.
Dudzick cried out against the treatment of such a world-renowned
building, and announced plans to include the building in the program
for city improvements. Ultimately, Dudzick’s attempts to save the
building also failed. On August 20th, 1949 the Western Trading
Corporation offered the Common Council $5,000 to demolish the Larkin
Administration Building and replace it with new developments which were
claimed to provide the city with more tax income. While the sale of the
building was met with some public outcry, the sale and impending
demolition of the building was seen as a relief to some area residents.

Demolition of the building began in February of 1950, undertaken by the
firm of Morris & Reimann. Due to the complex nature of the
building’s construction, the Administration Building was taken apart
almost by hand. In May 1951 the Western Trading Corporation had plans
to build a trucking terminal on the site, but by November they proposed
to the Common Council relocating their facility. Their relocation was
approved, thus the Larkin Administration Building was demolished to
make way for what amounted to a paved parking lot.

Frank Lloyd Wright, upon hearing of the demolition of one of his
earliest and most significant buildings, reportedly stated that the
building had “served its purpose and deserved a decent burial.”65 He
had been aware of the disfiguring alterations which the building had
suffered under John D. Larkin, Jr. as well as its final decay in the
1940s. In his autobiography he commented, “They [the Larkins] never
realized the place their building took in the thought of the world –
for they never hesitated to make senseless changes in it in after
years.”66 Today, all that remains of the once-glorious triumph of
modern office design is a portion of the brick and sandstone wall which
surrounded the site, located near the Swan Street subway.

The creation of the Larkin Administration Building and its ultimate
demise and demolition in many ways mirrored the situation of the
Hydraulics neighborhood as a whole. The building’s construction at the
dawn of the twentieth-century was an era of great prosperity and
success in the thriving industrial and commercial neighborhood. The
Larkin Company itself had been a product of all the features which had
given rise and made the Hydraulics area a successful place to do
business including its proximity to the nationwide network of rail
lines, access to raw materials and the availability of a vast immigrant
labor pool. Ultimately, the decay and demolition of the landmark
building paralleled the downturn the Hydraulics neighborhood took in
the mid-twentieth century, facing population and business loss and the
demolition of much of the urban architectural fabric of the
neighborhood. Much of the original architectural fabric of the
Hydraulics neighborhood has been either altered beyond recognition or
demolished all together. Those rare buildings which do remain intact
are remnants of the past history of the Hydraulics and survive to tell
the neighborhood’s story. Today, both the glorious Larkin
Administration Building and the thriving Hydraulics neighborhood are
faded memories, relayed solely by the few remaining buildings which
bear evidence of the past.
