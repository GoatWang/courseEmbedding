Press Release

			Shanghai, China, 
			December 16, 2015			(Newswire.com) -
	​​​​Emo Capital Corp. (OTC : NUVI), today introduces its new e-commerce sales channel on the world's largest Internet retailer Amazon.com. The launch of the Amazon.com distribution marks an important first step toward the Company’s ambitious plans for multi-channel expansion.
"Establishing a new channel for Emo Capital Corp allows us to reinvent our online environment and create a more user-friendly, reliable experience through the Amazon.com brand," said Juanming Fang, President, Emo Capital Corp. “We have a rejuvenated marketing spirit and aim to take our Google Android streaming box to market in an impactful way.”
Amazon.com is one of the most trusted brands in the world and a massive potential source of new traffic. Amazon.com is a master at building and maintaining customer relationships to get its customers to come back and buy more Amazon.com products -- two-thirds of Amazon.com orders come from repeat customers. As part of its growth strategy, the Company will leverage the Amazon.com platform to identify new niches and categories to enter which can be profitable.
The company will use analytics and the marketplace statistics provided by Amazon.com and also seek other major online retailers suitable for its product to fuel corporate growth. Emo Capital Corp plans to integrate incremental improvements to the site on an ongoing basis.
Emo Capital Corp’s Google Android streaming box will be a great fit for Amazon.com customers as our product allows any TV to be a smart TV. The Google Android streaming box is a very slim set-top-box with HDMI output, Bluetooth capabilities, Wi-Fi capabilities, as well as a built in microphone. Developed on top of the powerful Google Android operating system, consumers can access and enjoy TV entertainment from around the world, directly in their living room. Some features include Netflix, Hulu, Vudu, Youtube, PPTV, LeTV, Youku, Airtel, YuppTV, and Google Play downloads. Our product is manufactured by Cipher-TV, a reliable engineering, manufacturing company dedicated to high quality video streaming 1080P resolution. Our product comes with a wireless remote that is simple to use and allows access to all the features built in to the hardware and provides special programmable hot keys to easily access the built in software. Included in the product is a high quality HDMI cable, slim charger, batteries, and an alternate RCA audio and video cable so it is compatible with all TVs.
Our reseller agreement with the manufacture allows us to provide large quantities of these Android streaming boxes allowing us to not only providing retail sales, but will also allow us expansion into commercial channels such’s as hotels, education departments, and any other large demand applications. Many commercial locations are looking for alternative means to TV and would rather use Internet to access specialized content. This Android set-top-box allows the customer to do so easily. Partnering with Amazon.com, we believe we can build long last relationships with our customers as well as increase sales drastically.
