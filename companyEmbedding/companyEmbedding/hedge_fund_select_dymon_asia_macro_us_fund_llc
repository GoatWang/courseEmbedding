Two top traders to set up Asia hedge fund


February 10, 2014 


HONG KONG: Two former top traders at Goldman Sachs and Noble Group are planning to form a hedge fund in Asia, a source with knowledge of the matter said, in another high profile launch in the region.
The fund’s creation comes as global regulatory changes restrict banks from trading with their own money, forcing so-called proprietary desk traders to strike out on their own.
It also comes as investor interest in hedge funds in Asia makes its strongest comeback since 2007 and on the back of the industry’s strong performance in 2013.
Leland Lim, who was the co-head of macro trading for Asia Pacific ex-Japan at Goldman Sachs Group Inc, is teaming up with Allan Bedwick, the former head of macro trading in Asia for Noble Group, to launch a macro hedge fund in the second or third quarter of 2014, the source said.
Lim, who joined Goldman in New York in 1997 on the foreign exchange options desk, retired last month from the Wall Street bank, while Bedwick quit the Singaporean commodities firm in January.
Lim moved to Asia in 1999. Prior to becoming the co-head, he managed Asia Pacific ex-Japan foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives trading, according to an internal memo sent to Goldman staff announcing his retirement.
The source could not estimate the start-up capital as the plan was at an early stage and the duo has yet to register the firm in Hong Kong.




Asian hedge funds returned an average 16 percent last year, outperforming a less than 10 percent gain by global peers and attracted net inflows of US$11 billion in 2013, the highest since 2007, according to data from industry tracker Eurekahedge.
Dozens of proprietary traders globally have spun off from banks to start their own hedge fund since the financial crisis in 2008.
Some of the well-known names in Asia include former Goldman trader Morgan Sze, who started Azentus Capital, and former Credit Suisse trader Charlie Chan who runs Splendid Asia macro fund. Both launched their funds in 2011.
Lim and Bedwick will compete with Asia-based macro hedge funds such as the US$1.8 billion Fortress Asia Macro Fund run by Adam Levinson and the US$2.6 billion Dymon Asia Macro Fund managed by former Citadel LLC trader Danny Yong in Singapore.
At his new firm, Lim will lead investments. Bedwick will run the business, a change in role for the former Lehman Brothers trader who outperformed rivals when he managed his own macro hedge fund between 2009 and 2012.
Bedwick had launched his Sequence Fundamental Macro Fund, earlier known as OGI Global Macro Fund, in October 2009 in Japan with US$15 million. It earned a 9 percent annual return, nearly twice what his peers were making, and grew to manage as much as US$150 million.
But Bedwick, an American who has worked in Asia for more than half his life, shut down his hedge fund in 2012 after the fund failed to grow as investor shifted to larger hedge funds globally.
Macro hedge funds focus on major economic trends and events and bet anywhere they see value, including stocks, bonds, currencies, commodities and derivatives markets.

What is a 'Global Macro Strategy'
A global macro strategy is a hedge fund or mutual fund strategy that bases its holdings, such as long and short positions in various equity, fixed income, currency, commodities and futures markets, primarily on the overall economic and political views of various countries, or their macroeconomic principles. For example, if a manager believes the United States is headed into recession, he might short sell stocks and futures contracts on major U.S. indices or the U.S. dollar, or seeing big opportunity for growth in Singapore, might take long positions in Singapore's assets.

      
BREAKING DOWN 'Global Macro Strategy'
      Global macro funds build portfolios around predictions and projections of large-scale events on the country-wide, continental and global scale, implementing opportunistic investment strategies to capitalize on macroeconomic and geopolitical trends. Global macro funds are considered among the least restricted funds available as they generally place any type of trade they choose using almost any type of security available.General Global Macro Fund TypesThere are various generalized types of global macro funds that exist in 2016, most of which aim to profit on various systemic and market risk factors. Discretionary global macro funds construct portfolios at the asset class level based on a top-level view of the global markets. This type of global macro fund is considered the most flexible as managers can go long or short with any type of asset anywhere in the world.Commodity trading advisor (CTA) global macro funds use various investment products but instead of creating portfolios based on top-level views, these funds use price-based and trend-following algorithms to help construct portfolios and execute the fund's trades. Systematic global macro funds use fundamental analysis to build portfolios and execute trades using algorithms. This type of fund is essentially a hybrid of discretionary global macro and CTA funds.Global Macro StrategiesGlobal macro funds generally use a combination of currency-based, interest rate-based and stock index-based trading strategies. Within the context of currency strategies, the funds typically seek opportunities based on the relative strength of one currency to another. Funds monitor and project economic and monetary policies around the world and make highly leveraged currency trades using futures, forwards, options and spot transactions. Interest rate strategies usually invest in sovereign debt, making directional bets as well as relative value trades. Regarding stock index strategies, global macro funds make country-specific directional bets on market indices using futures, options and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Commodity index trades are also included in this category. Certain global macro funds employ strategies focused on only emerging market countries.

(Reuters) – Singapore-based asset manager Dymon Asia Capital has received a commitment worth $500 million from Temasek Holdings to start a hedge fund seeding venture at a time the Asian industry is starting to recover after six years of sluggish growth.
Dymon will use the capital to seed new strategies and fund managers and manage all non-investment functions to allow managers focus on their trading activities.
Asia-focused hedge funds returned nearly 16 percent to investors last year, their best annual performance since 2009, according to data from Eurekahedge.
The industry also added $20 billion in assets in 2013, its first growth in three years, according to AsiaHedge, which says the assets under management still remain about $33 billion below the industry’s 2007 peak.
Temasek will become a minority stakeholder in Dymon as a result of the arrangement, the hedge fund said in a statement.
The first investment from the venture will be in Port Meadow Fund to be managed by former SAC Capital portfolio manager Carl Vine. The long/short equity hedge fund with a strong Asian bias will be launched in the second quarter.
“With Temasek backing here, the plan is to do more of that and do it more in a systematic way,” Dymon President Jay Luo told Reuters in a telephone interview.
Luo, who joined the hedge fund in 2012 from SAC Capital, will lead the venture with Dymon’s managing director, Ben Freischmidt, who earlier co-founded GLG Partners’ Asia long/short equity business, the firm said in a statement.
Dymon, set up by Danny Yong, a former founding partner and chief investment officer of Abax Global Capital, is one of east Asia’s biggest home-grown hedge fund companies with about $4 billion worth of assets under management.
The new arrangement marks Dymon’s third venture as it looks to diversify from its main macro hedge fund business which currently makes up most of the firm’s assets under management.
The company, which also has a currency fund, branched out to private equity in 2012 with a fund backed by a unit of Singapore state investor Temasek Holdings.
Temasek spokesman Stephen Forshaw confirmed the contents of the statement.
