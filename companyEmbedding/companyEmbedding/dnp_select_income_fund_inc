Dividend & Distribution
Dividend Reinvestment Plan
The Fund has a dividend reinvestment plan (DRP) available as a benefit to all registered shareholders and also offers direct deposit service through electronic funds transfer to all registered shareholders currently receiving a monthly distribution check. These services are offered through Computershare Trust Company, N.A. For more information and/or an authorization form on automatic dividend reinvestment or direct deposit, please contact Computershare Trust Company, N.A. (1-877-381-2537 or www.computershare.com/investor).
More about the Dividend Reinvestment Plan >>
Managed Distribution Plan
A managed distribution plan is one in which common shareholders receive a consistent, but not guaranteed, periodic cash payment, regardless of when or whether income is earned or capital gains are realized.
More about the Managed Distribution Plan >>
Common Shares Dividend Distribution Information The distributions listed in the table below reflect the amount of cash payment per share.  A portion of the cash distribution may represent return of capital.  Any portion of the Fund’s distribution that is a return of capital does not necessarily reflect the Fund’s investment performance and should not be confused with “yield” or “income”. SEC 19(a) Shareholder Notices are available on this website on the page labeled “Reports & Notices”.  Each 19(a) Shareholder Notice provides an estimate of the sources of each distribution based on U.S. generally accepted accounting principles which may differ from federal income tax regulations.  On the webpage labeled “Tax Information”, we have posted the annual Tax Information Letter for each calendar year that informs shareholders of the sources of distributions for federal income tax purposes.

Fund Overview
The DNP Select Income Fund Inc. (NYSE: DNP) is a diversified, closed-end management investment company that first offered its common stock to the public in January 1987. The Fund's primary investment objectives are current income and long-term growth of income. Capital appreciation is a secondary objective. DNP has outstanding Floating Rate Mandatory Redeemable Preferred Shares (MRPS), secured borrowings and secured notes to leverage the common stockholders' investment.
The Fund seeks to achieve its investment objectives by investing primarily in a diversified portfolio of equity and fixed income securities of companies in the public utilities industry. The Fund's investment strategies have been developed to take advantage of the income and growth characteristics, and historical performances of securities of companies in the public utilities industry.
Under normal conditions, more than 65% of the Fund's total assets will be invested in securities of public utility companies engaged in the production, transmission or distribution of electric energy, gas or telephone services.
The Fund may invest in the securities of domestic and foreign issuers as well as in securities of companies of any market capitalization, including small and mid cap common and preferred stocks. The Fund may not invest more than 25% of its total assets (valued at the time of investment) in securities of companies engaged principally in any one industry other than the public utilities industry, nor have more than 20% invested in foreign issuers. The Fund will purchase a fixed income security only if, at the time of purchase, it is rated investment grade by at least two nationally recognized statistical rating organizations.
Important Risk Considerations
Equity Securities: The market price of equity securities may be adversely affected by financial market, industry, or issuer-specific events. A fund that focuses its investments in a particular industry or sector will be more sensitive to conditions that affect that industry or sector.
Credit and Interest: Debt securities are subject to various risks, the most prominent of which are credit and interest rate risk. The issuer of a debt security may fail to make interest and/or principal payments. Values of debt securities may rise or fall in response to changes in interest rates, and this risk may be enhanced with longer term maturities.
Preferred Stocks: Preferred stocks may decline in price, fail to pay dividends, or be illiquid.
MLPs: Investments in Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs) may be adversely impacted by tax law changes, regulation, or factors affecting underlying assets.
Foreign Investing: Investing internationally involves additional risks such as currency, political, accounting, economic, and market risk.
No Guarantee: There is no guarantee that the portfolio will meet its objective.
Leverage: When a fund leverages its portfolio, the value of its shares may be more volatile and all other risks may be compounded.
 
This information does not represent an offer, or the solicitation of an offer, to buy or sell securities of the Fund.
1Net Asset Value vs. Market Price: Net Asset Value (NAV) represents the total value of all assets held by the Fund (minus its total liabilities), divided by the total number of common shares outstanding. The net asset value returns reflect the performance of the manager. Market price is the price at which investors may purchase or sell shares of the Fund. Market price is determined in the open market by buyers and sellers, based on supply and demand. The Fund’s Market Price fluctuates throughout the day and may differ from its underlying NAV. Shares of the Fund may trade at a premium (higher than) or a discount (lower than) to NAV. This characteristic is a risk separate and distinct from the risk that the Fund’s net asset value could decline. The Fund has no control over the market price.2Percentages based on total investments rather than total net assets. The portfolio is actively managed and subject to change.
3The ratings issued by Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations assess the credit worthiness of a corporation’s debt issues. The ratings apply to the Fund’s holdings and not the Fund itself. The lower rating of Moody’s or Standard & Poor’s is used. Ratings are subject to change.  AAA, AA, A, and BBB are investment grade ratings; BB and below are below-investment grade ratings.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
