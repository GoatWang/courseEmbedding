Shatter Conventional Wisdom




NOSTALAB is reimagining health and wellness from the front seat of Einstein’s car traveling at the speed of light. We are envisioning the future–empowered by technology, brilliance and perseverance of digital health and the bold future of medicine. We move very fast, yet we rarely blink.

Our Heart
We know the rest mass of an electron. We also know role of calcium in the contractile process of the ventricular myocardium. NOSTALAB uniquely and intimately understands the science, technology and humanity that together weave the magic of digital health. And beyond simple understanding, we’ve actually defined some of these very trends and issues. You see, we are far from passive observers – We are digital health.


Our Mind
Thinking is what we do best. We apply our thinking to solve creative and strategic problems that seems either insurmountable or unthinkable. At times, we’ve even discovered new problems and challenges and proactively sought out solutions as preemptive strikes against second rate thinking.


Our Soul
We are digital. We are health. We are also defiant, bold and closely connected to imaginative thinkers and risk–takers who define digital health. Our philosophy is grounded in brilliance yet our methodology has often pushed us over the “practical ledge” and forced us to build wings on the way down. We like to fly.






  









  




The Hypothesis




There is no more pressing issue in today’s world than health. And for as long as most can remember, the solutions are been largely the same. The stethoscope, an iconic symbol of medicine and the physical exam is a perfect example. It has changed little from the times of inventor Rene Leannec in 1817. Yet it still hangs over the shoulders of clinicians like a prayer shawl or a badge of clinical validation.









This is changing, changing rapidly.  The advances in technology are disturbing, challenging and empowering a new “social collective” that will change medicine at its very core.  From data to people, digital health is poised to establish a new medical society driven less by the oppressive hegemony of today’s system but by the birth of the citizen scientist and the empowered patient.
Why NOSTALAB? Simply put, we are here to empower innovation with outlandish thinking. We connect the dots of genius and help drive the digital health revolution.





  









  




The Lab




NOSTALAB is a think tank with a contrarian focus. We offer the very best and brightest thinkers to analyze, establish and build markets. We like to make the competition cry foul.


  





Strategic consulting

 









Brand positioning

 









Developmental and ideation workshops

 





  





Creative development










Social media










Synergy and cognitive connections









  




Inflection Point Marketing









The life of a brand is a bit like evolution–external environmental changes combines with internal advancements and modifications. However, changes are largely unpredictable and define by punctuated equilibrium. In other words, pivotal changes happen at key points in time and not at a linear, fixed rate. The trick is finding those points in a lifecycle when insights and engagement can drive exponential growth. At NostaLab, we specialize in the type of thinking that punctuates the marketplace with exclamation marks!

His research and subsequent writings appeared in peer-reviewed journals and explored the topic of cardiovascular physiology. He would eventually return to finish his degree at Boston University. Although his initial interest and professional advice was to enter a MD / Ph.D. program, Nosta decided against it.[1]
Career[edit]
Nosta worked at Ogilvy CommonHealth for over a decade until his resignation in 2014. He held various positions including Chief Creative Officer, Chief Strategic Officer, and Agency President,[6][7] and worked with the branding, advertising, and marketing strategies for major corporations like Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, Genentech, Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer.[13] He also spoke at conferences and events like TEDMED,[9] South by Southwest,[10] and HealthXL.[4] He has lectured at institutions including the Ethical Culture Society, St. John's University, the Fashion Institute of Technology and Harvard Medical School.[14]

In 2014, he founded NostaLab, a digital health think tank that has been described as "a self-organizing neural network dedicated to the advancement of digital health."[18] In September 2014, Nosta gave a speech entitled "Genius is our birthright, and mediocrity is self-imposed" at the TEDxBedminster in New Jersey.[1][8] Additional speaking engagements have included the CES Digital Health Summit in 2015[19] and SXSW 2015.[20]

Early life and education[edit]
Nosta was born in Perth Amboy, New Jersey and is a second-generation American with Romanian and Polish ancestry. His father, John T. Nosta, was an electrical engineer, and his mother, Rose Nosta, was a homemaker. He attended high school at St. Joseph High School in Metuchen, New Jersey alongside classmates like Jon Bon Jovi. At age 16, Nosta enrolled in an advanced summer program at Harvard University. He was also the President of the Perth Amboy First Aid Squad.[1]
He attended college at Boston University where he created the concentration biophysics. Before finishing his undergraduate degree, he took a year off to research at the Harvard Medical School. His research and subsequent writings appeared in peer-reviewed journals and explored the topic of cardiovascular physiology. He would eventually return to finish his degree at Boston University. Although his initial interest and professional advice was to enter a MD / Ph.D. program, Nosta decided against it.[1]
Career[edit]
Nosta worked at Ogilvy CommonHealth for over a decade until his resignation in 2014. He held various positions including Chief Creative Officer, Chief Strategic Officer, and Agency President,[6][7] and worked with the branding, advertising, and marketing strategies for major corporations like Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, Genentech, Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer.[13] He also spoke at conferences and events like TEDMED,[9] South by Southwest,[10] and HealthXL.[4] He has lectured at institutions including the Ethical Culture Society, St. John's University, the Fashion Institute of Technology and Harvard Medical School.[14]
In 2012, he started Health Critical, a blog on Forbes that discussed the link between health, medicine, and technology.[5] In December 2012, he was listed at the top of the Pharma100 list, which measures the level of online engagement produced by those in the health industry,[15] a distinction that he duplicated in 2015.[16] He would eventually be ranked number one on the Kred Influence Measurement for health and in the top 10 of the Hit100 list.[17]
In 2014, he founded NostaLab, a digital health think tank that has been described as "a self-organizing neural network dedicated to the advancement of digital health."[18] In September 2014, Nosta gave a speech entitled "Genius is our birthright, and mediocrity is self-imposed" at the TEDxBedminster in New Jersey.[1][8] Additional speaking engagements have included the CES Digital Health Summit in 2015[19] and SXSW 2015.[20]

Interview: John Nosta on How Digital Health Is the FutureIn Digital Health|By Cox BLUE Editors

SHARES
LinkedinTwitterFacebookGoogleBufferPrint





  

A leading voice in the convergence of technology and health, John Nosta is, “maybe the world’s first DHP. DHP stands for Digital Health Philosopher, a term Nosta has called himself as the founder of NOSTALAB – a self-organizing neural network dedicated to the advancement of digital health.
Nosta sees himself as a philosopher, emphasizing the importance of being able to envision a future that might sound unrealistic in the present.When asked to expound on what a DHP is, Nosta begins by explaining our changing world.
“We live in interesting times,” he said. “We live at an inflection point of human history in that the evolution of technology – the desire to reform health care, the issues around an aging population, the issues of an empowered patient – is all coming together and things are going to change.”
The Meaning of Digital Health
Nosta says “digital health” lives on a continuum. There’s digital fitness, where a person might wear a tracker such as a Fitbit and go to the gym; digital wellness, where you use a digital scale to track your weight or log what you eat; and digital medicine, using digital data or technology to develop new drugs or processes.
Digital medicine is changing the way we provide health care. Nosta says we’ll be able to detect a heart attack two weeks before it happens and catch a cancerous cell at stage zero sooner than you might think.
“Patients will be empowered,” said Nosta. “[With digital technology] you can take control of your data, your life … and craft a plan to live to 150 [years old].”
Data is the New Black
Digital health is about longevity and how technology can help you live longer. If you don’t want to take Nosta’s word for it, he implores you to simply look where tech companies are putting their money. Nosta cites Google, 23 and Me, and Craig Ventor, the first man to sequence the human genome, as prime examples.
“Push on longevity and where do you go?” asks Nosta. His answer is simply “immortality.”
This is where the philosophy part of being a DHP comes in – imagine that as you replace body parts you could begin to live a trans-human reality, you might have a liver that was made on a 3-D Printer. These developments make it clear that as time progresses our health data will be digitally gathered and used to collectively analyze man.
“The data donor is the new organ donor,” according to Nosta.
Digital Health and Your Company
The coming advancements in digital health technology could play a huge role in your business life, whether you choose to implement them for your employees as health care options, are looking for your next investment trajectory or just want to be an early adaptor of health technology yourself. While Nosta’s idea of immortality may seem a long ways away, innovators and small business owners will no doubt play a huge role in driving our technological advancement.

            John made it to the top of #pharma100 list, top 100 influencers in pharmaceutical social media. That says it all.        



                Henry Gazay

            We thank John for serving as our moderator for several of our Great Challenges Google+ hangouts. During the one-hour events, John facilitated lively discussions around important topics such as healthcare innovation, making prevention popular, eliminating medical error and whole patient care. More than 3,000 views were captured across the four hangouts he moderated for our program.

            John is always knowledgeable about the subject matter at hand. Being a good teacher requires not only expertise in the subject, but being able to communicate the information  effectively. In addition to being a masterful communicator, he can explain complex MOAs  in a very easy to understand manner. I have always enjoyed working with John, and quite frankly, I miss those exchanges

            If you only read one recommendation about John Nosta, this is the one. There, I said it. It’s not even a recommendation; it’s a reflection; a rumination; a reaffirmation. It’s essential reading.

If this were a beer commercial, John would be The Most Interesting Man in the World.” He may very well be, but he’s almost certainly “The Most Interesting Man in Modern Advertising.” To borrow from another current consumer campaign, John seems to know what’s going to happen 30 seconds before it does. Or 30 minutes or 30 days. Because John is second to none when it comes to staying on the cutting edge of advertising, technology, social media, and health-related advancements. If I don’t run into John sometime during the day, I seek him out to get 3 minutes of insight and inspiration, all served up with the inimitable bundle of creative genius that is John. 

During creative concepting, John uses his experience, insights and scientific acumen to get inside the head of the physician or the patient. To paint a picture of not simply what a therapy does, but what makes it new, better, innovative and relevant in a crowded marketplace. And nobody helps paint this picture like John. He brings out the best in his writers and art directors to conjure up concepts that bring the “Ah ha!” moment to life again and again. It’s a process that reminds us of why you got into advertising: to create riveting communications that bring and keep brands at the agency.  

If you take one person with you on a pitch, make it John. He is a truly gifted presenter; perhaps the most natural speaker I’ve ever heard. He offers prospective clients a glimpse of the past, a snapshot of the moment, and a glimmer of the future. His intimate knowledge of science and medicine, coupled with his understanding of strategy and tactics and the market into which a product is entering, is more than impressive. It’s prescient. He’ll discuss the brand and its science, tie it to a strategy that will advance the brand in the marketplace, display the team’s spot-on creative in his own animated, compelling way, and wrap it all up with a pertinent quote from David Ogilvy, or Leonardo Da Vinci, or Winston Churchill. Brilliant. A renaissance man.

Now that you’ve seen the stars, let’s bring you back down to earth. John is respectful, team-oriented and loyal. All of the qualities you’d want in a friend or teammate, wrapped in a package of excitement, energy and wit. He makes Ogilvy CommonHealth a better place to work, to learn and to grow. 

John is the man.        



                Doug Bratman

            I have worked with John on several projects, and I hope to work with him more in the future. John is a highly creative, strategic thinker and always drives the group toward innovation. I also liked that he was very passionate about our projects, and was willing to give and take 'push back' to arrive at the best ideas.        



                Walt Danker            






SB



            John is one of those rare people with a real gift of creative expression. He lives, breathes, tweets creativity. In all my exchanges with him I have found his ideas to be exceptional. He comes from a place of deep wisdom and many years of experience. Besides, he is always helpful and very approachable. I am honored to know him.        



                Shalini Bahl Milne            






PW



            John is an inspirational creative and strategic leader.  He continues to impress and amaze me with his extraordinary intellect and energy.  John is a true thought leader in all aspects of health-care communications.  It was an honor for me to learn from John while working in his creative department at Ogilvy Commonhealth (Noesis).  Under John's leadership, I was able to do the highest-quality creative and strategic work in the business, and improve my own leadership skills.   In short, I have benefited enormously from John's vast insight, intelligence and inspiration (as have many of my brightest colleagues in pharma advertising).        



                Paul Weiss            






PZ



            “I hate quotations. Tell me what you know.”
— Ralph Waldo Emerson

John is the only person I know, who is still quoted, to this day, by client’s even years after meeting him. It happened just the other day again! John has the uncanny ability to think for himself, and manufacture — his own ideas! I still quote him myself… I think that says it all!        



                Peter Zamiska            






CC



            John brings the BIG IDEA. Creatively he affords his creative team freedom and challenges them to think outside the challenge articulated by clients and aspire to something that can build a brand. John's hunger for knowledge is contagious and fueled by a bottomless well of passion for creativity. John has a great desire, and the skills to deliver, pushing his concepts into something that resonates with audiences and clients.        



                Chris Cullmann            






AT



            Two qualities come to mind when I think of Nosta-passion for advertising and breakthrough thinking. His confidence has been well-earned and is uniquely balanced by his generous spirit. It is unusual these days to find someone who enjoys mentoring new talent. 
John constantly challenges himself and those around him to be the best that they can be.        



                Angie Tomas            






PP



            In our culture the zeitgiest has many vectors and each is an agent of change. That would describe the person of John Nosta. John reads the metamorphosis of novel media to evolve a helix of creative scientific communications. Drawing from the poles of perfection and reinvention, John defines his own domaine, that of the supra-digital, strategic sentinel, ready and eager to do business.        



                private private            






SM



            John is a brilliant strategic thinker, and yet he is very down to earth, easy going and very easy to approach. He encourages everyone around him to do their best every day, pushes for excellence in all tasks and finds teachable moments in almost any situation. His door is always open to an inquisitive mind, and he will seize any opportunity to share his knowledge with others.  Enter the brain of John Nosta at your own risk – you may learn about everything you were asking and more than you ever wanted to know!        



                Susan Masteller            






JG



            Some people perform beyond expectation. When you work with John Nosta, you just expect him to offer a strategically brilliant and creative solution. And he always delivers. 

He’s a laser focus creative leader who understands your business challenges and almost intuitively offers a program, campaign or whatever you need to solve whatever marketing problem you’re currently facing.

Working with John is also a defense against boredom. He’s full of life, fun to work with, and he treats you like a partner.        



                Jack Goldenberg            






AC



            John is a creative tour-de-force with an enthusiasm and style that is as refreshing as it is energizing. While most creatives are focused on breaking out of the box, John is busy desconstructing it and refolding it into a paper plane where his truly unique and effective ideas help products take flight. If your brand or your team need some stimulation, John Nosta can provide the wake-up call.        



                Andrew Criscuolo            






LK



            John is an amazing talent and a true strategic thinker! He is one of those brilliant individuals and the "go-to" person for any project he works on. John always makes the work better and has a great sense of humor. Working with him was a real pleasure.        



                Lori Kurn            






JM



            John is a brilliant strategic thinker, always ahead of the curve and able to see beyond the horizon. He is passionate about his profession and makes all around him better by his focus, drive and determination. He is a "visionary" in every sense of the word.        



                Joseph Mastracchio            






ST



            John takes pride in being a thinker and a visionary.  He has a strong grasp of current trends, and also of what the future can be…  but his true strength lies in making others think.  John can create change by his mere passion, ideas and ability to make people around him think bigger and better.        



                Stephen Trask, MT            






TN



            John Nosta is a rarity in the advertising/communications business, in that he's a fiercely independent and highly conceptual thinker. Now, this is not to say that he is a lone wolf, only that he's an alpha predator who's clearly at the top of his game. Ferguson is very fortunate that John moved out to the burbs, since a talent such as his rarely strays from the confines of NYC.        



                Todd Neuhaus            






PC



            I first worked with John when I was working in Marketing at Savient Pharmaceuticals. At that time he was smart, creative, intense, honest, committed and worked with a clear sense of urgency. Because of these traits I hired John again when I started working in my current position at Columbia Laboratories. Luckily for anyone who gets the opportunity to work with John, nothing has changed.

How Advances in Wearable Technology Impact Digital Health: An Interview With John Nosta












  

 Sep 5, 2014

John Nosta is a leading voice in the convergence of technology and health and an influential thinker entrenched in the world of science, medicine and innovation. He is the founder of NostaLab, an organization dedicated to the advancement of digital health.
We spoke with John Nosta to dissect how advances in technology like sensors and fitness trackers impact the world of digital health.


1. Tell us about your work at NostaLab – what are you most excited about and what is your strategy for empowering innovation in healthcare?
My background is Chief Strategic Officer and Agency President at Ogilvy, which is the largest healthcare communications company in the world. What I found is that both agencies and life science companies were disconnected from the phenomenon we call digital health. They didn’t understand the nuances of quantified self and the applications of digital technology to help in medicine.
Most client and agency people understood Fitbit and Nike Fuel as a fitness device that lived largely in the context of digital wellness. And thats part of the continuum that we are looking at now. Digital wellness has to move into digital health and digital medicine, because there are so many different applications of technology in this area.
 
So my feelings in starting NostaLab were to create a communications company that walked the walk in the context of digital health. I am an active participant in the marketing, the science, and all the thought leadership development in this area so that I can work with clients to give them a real world understanding of the changes, evolution, opportunities and pitfalls of digital health.
NostaLab is the power of innovation through a sense of communication that we don’t only participate in, but we live. That is our mission.
2. How do you see advances in wearables and sensor technology influencing the health care ecosystem?
I believe it is no longer about the device, but about the data. The devices will evolve to become less of a watch that you wear, and perhaps a dermal or a patch or an implant -- or will ultimately completely go away to be absorbed into the fabric of our lives.
I think this is the fundamental change in sensor technology. We will see sensors in the steering wheel of our car. And those sensors will become extraordinarily simple and will not be a function of us charging them or wearing them. They will exist passively in the context of our lives. This goes beyond the quantified self and enters into the quantified life.
In the future, your bathroom will become a living laboratory, and the bathroom will be sponsored by a company like Johnson & Johnson or some other company that makes bathroom fixtures. It will have a rich array of laboratory analyses that will quantify you and your family. For example the mirror will have a reflective image that looks at pulse or at skin issues. The toothbrush will be able to monitor bacterial growth in your mouth to measure for cavities.
The other room is the kitchen. Every time you open the refrigerator door it will quantify what comes in and out. Your shopping lists will be generated by a computer and sent to your smartphone. So you will never have to worry about being out of milk because it will be quantified. Similarly, that quantification can also be expressed in the context of calories and total metabolic consumption.

The point is that it won’t be you actively tracking this stuff, data will be passively tracked in the context of your daily life. Digital health will actually become nothing, just like the sensors in our car. We have no awareness of these sensors that track our brake speed or air pressure of the tires, unless something goes wrong. Here lies the fundamental reality of digital health from a consumer perspective.
From a technical, scientific and medical perspective, digital health offers extraordinary advantages that are practical applications of tools and technologies.
Ten years from now we will wonder how reckless it was to let a human drive a car. It’s that kind of pivotal change that I call exponential change, which is a drastic change in the fundamental way we see life.
3. What new technology are you most excited about in terms of its influence on digital health?
Eric Topol, one of the big leaders in the digital health movement, is actually looking at nano and micro sensors that can be used in the body to track certain chemicals that will tell you that you are having a heart attack.
Let’s take a step back and think about this -- from a patient’s perspective and a physician’s perspective, a heart attack is considered to be a major event that gets everyone nervous. We see a heart attack today as an event that requires urgent and rapid engagement. But what we understand is that a heart attack is actually a gradual process in the body, and if it can be detected early enough with nano sensors, the right procedures can be put in place to improve care. This is part of the magic of digital health and sensor technology.
Another one is Kinsa, a digital thermometer that sends data to your smartphone to create a real record of temperature readings that you can track over time, look at graphically and share with your doctor. But the amazing thing Kinsa does that gives it such potential is that it takes this depersonalized data and pushes it to the cloud. So now we can look at a weather map of fever.
Think about that in the context of a region of the US. Imagine it in a local school district where parents can look at a relative heat map of who is sick or what area is getting sick. Pushing this to the cloud is another way of taking a sensor and using that data in a way that informs people about the relevant prevalence of something like the flu.
4. What are the roadblocks fitness trackers and sensor technology will have to overcome to make a difference in healthcare?
The interesting thing about tech is that we don’t know what is going to happen. The changes are occurring so quickly in fundamental areas of science, that to try to link these profound innovations to the mundane accelerometer that defines the wearable today is a fools errand. 
We are seeing exponential changes in the rate in which innovations come to life. We are seeing the rate of change happen so quickly, similar to Moore’s Law. So it’s almost a matter of wearables and devices having to keep pace with advancing technologies.
If you ask a physician about digital health, you will probably get a funny look or a shrug of the shoulders unless that physician is wearing a device or has a unique interest in the digital health movement. We have to inform and motivate the gatekeepers about things like Kinsa, the world’s smartest thermometer.
Oftentimes we see that physicians just don’t have this stuff on their radar. And when confronted by this democratized patient who is demanding digital health, it leads to more of an impact.
5. So what do you think is the future of the fitness device?
The quantified self movement is not going to go away. We’ve started off with a fundamental issue of connectivity.
Right now, if you look at the fitness devices, they seem to appeal to people who don’t need them. The girl who wants to go to the gym to see how fast she works out or the guy who wants to see a map of his run. They are not being used by the guy who is on the couch. Many healthcare providers aren’t using them either. There’s a disconnect. The promise of it is still robust and will be revolutionary. But the simple premise of “if we build it they will come” will not work. We need to fill in the gap.
We can’t expect people to use technology that is not compatible with their fundamental lifestyle. Not only on a functional, tactical level but also a psychological level. We need to develop wearables that fit in with peoples’ behavior and style and give people an amazing incentive to use them.
