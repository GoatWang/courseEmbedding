Page ContentCommerce, Culture, & State Offices Under Glass
 Where can you find 1.2 million square feet of spectacular space under glass?
Nowhere else but the James R. Thompson Center in the heart of downtown Chicago.
If you are looking for an exciting environment in which to host your next special event, our 16-story Atrium and Concourse is the place for you. We can accommodate from 200 to 2000 people for cocktail receptions, dinner dances, or product displays. If your needs include a facility for stage presentation, our 600-seat Assembly Hall Auditorium is just the place.
Conveniently located near hotels, convention facilities, mass transit, expressways, and public parking, this extraordinary architectural setting offers your group - whether it be corporate or very private - a memorable experience.
This fascinating building is a world-wide attraction that features an art gallery, artisans shop, three floors of restaurants and shops, and 13 floors of balconies that surround the 160 foot rotunda. "Wait until you see it... It is no less than breathtaking," wrote the Chicago Tribune's Pulitzer Prize-winning architecture critic Paul Gapp about the James R.Thompson Center. Spectacular views abound from any vantage point, including the 72-foot diameter open cutout of the lobby which shows the 4,000 square foot lower Concourse level with its marble rosette center. Glass elevator shafts, glass-paneled walls and ceiling, and marble-inlay floors make this an ideal setting for impressive entertaining, elegant sit-down dinners, and perfect dance receptions. The building is one of Chicago's most popular sites for fundraisers, concerts, and other special events.
The James R. Thompson Center is a Special Event.We'd like to share it with you!

Monument with Standing Beast
Recognizing the importance of art in the lives of Illinois citizens, Governor James R. Thompson, on August 3, 1977, signed into law Public Act 80-241. This Act created the "% for Art Program", which sets aside a 1/2 a percent of the total monies appropriated for construction of state-funded public buildings to be used for the purchase of art. 
The purpose of the '% for Art Program' is to promote and support arts in our state; place artwork in accessible locations for the public during everyday activities; and humanize the architectural environment by enhancing state buildings and other areas occupied by visitors and employees.
The program also provides job opportunities for artists and is an ongoing documentation of contemporary art in Illinois. 
Since July 1, 1978, the state has obtained more than 600 works of art, varying in size, shape, and medium, for 25 projects located throughout Illinois. The James R. Thompson Center has the largest single collection of contemporary Illinois art, with more than 150 displayed works, which exhibit the exceptional talents of our state's artists and restake Chicago's claim as the cultural hub of the Midwest.

James Robert Thompson, Jr. (born May 8, 1936), also known as Big Jim Thompson, was the 37th and longest-serving Governor of the US state of Illinois,[1] serving from 1977 to 1991. A Republican, Thompson was elected to four consecutive terms and held the office for 14 years. Many years after leaving public office, he served as a member of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States (the 9/11 Commission).[2]

Early life and career[edit]
Born in Chicago, Illinois, Thompson studied at the University of Illinois at Chicago Navy Pier campus, and at Washington University in St. Louis. He received his J.D. from Northwestern University in 1959.[3]
Prior to becoming governor, he worked in the Cook County state's attorney's office, taught at Northwestern University's law school and was appointed by President Nixon to serve as U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois. As a federal prosecutor in the early 1970s, he obtained a conviction against former Governor Otto Kerner, Jr., for his use of improper influence on behalf of the racetrack industry. He also tried and convicted many of Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley's top aides, most notably Alderman Thomas E. Keane and County Clerk Matt Danaher, on various corruption charges. People like Keane and Danaher, the mayor's point man on patronage were also major figures in the Cook County Democratic Party's political machine. These high-profile cases gave Thompson the celebrity that fueled his run for governor in 1976. To the chagrin of many, Thompson was very bipartisan in his attacks on corruption in Cook County and Chicago. He not only prosecuted high-profile Democrats, but also prominent Republicans such as County Commissioner Floyd Fulle and former U.S. Senate candidate, William Rentschler. Organized crime in Chicago was harder for his unit to crack and there were few high-profile cases during his era.
Governor of Illinois[edit]





This section needs attention from an expert in Illinois, Biography or Politics. The specific problem is: For being the longest serving Illinois governor, there is little detail about his tenure. See the talk page for details. WikiProject Illinois, WikiProject Biography or WikiProject Politics may be able to help recruit an expert. (June 2015)


In the 1976 election, he won 65 percent of the vote over Democratic Secretary of State Michael Howlett, who had defeated incumbent Governor Dan Walker in the primary and who had the support of Chicago Mayor and Cook County Democratic Party chairman Richard J. Daley. Thompson was the first candidate for governor to receive over 3 million votes; his tally of 3,000,395 remains the largest number of votes ever cast for a candidate in an election for Governor of Illinois. His first term was for only two years because Illinois moved its gubernatorial election from presidential-election years to midterm-election years. Thompson was re-elected to a full four-year term in 1978 with 60 percent of the vote, defeating State Comptroller Michael Bakalis. In 1982, Thompson was very narrowly re-elected over former U.S. Senator Adlai E. Stevenson III. A rematch in 1986 was expected to be almost as close, but the Democrats were severely hamstrung when supporters of Lyndon LaRouche won the Democratic nominations for lieutenant governor and secretary of state. Stevenson refused to appear on the same ticket as the LaRouchites, and formed the Solidarity Party with the support of the regular state Democratic organization. With the Democrats badly split, Thompson skated to victory in the general election. Thompson was accused of hiding the sad shape that Illinois' economy and budget were in while campaigning, but once elected, calling for an emergency session of the Illinois legislature to address the crisis.




Governor Thompson observing a military exercise, July 1986


On November 12, 1980, Thompson, by his executive order, instituted a hiring freeze for all state agencies, boards, bureaus, and commissions under his control as governor. The order affected approximately 60,000 state positions. These positions could only be filled if the candidates were first approved by an office created by Thompson, the Governor's Office of Personnel. Suit was brought and the Supreme Court held this political patronage practice unconstitutional as a violation of the First Amendment rights of low-level public employees in Rutan v. Republican Party of Illinois, 497 U.S. 62 (1990).
In 1993, the State of Illinois Center in Chicago was renamed the James R. Thompson Center to honor the former governor.
Legal and lobbying career[edit]
After leaving public service, Thompson joined Winston & Strawn LLP, a major Chicago-based law firm. Thompson served as Chairman of the Executive Committee from 1991 to 2006, as well as chairman and CEO of the firm from 1993 to 2006. He was Senior Chairman until January 31, 2015.[4] As CEO of Winston & Strawn, he focused in the area of government relations and regulatory affairs. The firm has lobbied for American Airlines, and he has previously represented United Airlines.[1]
Winston & Strawn is the same firm that represented former Illinois Governor George Ryan pro bono against federal charges relating to the "Licenses-for-Bribes" scandal during Ryan's tenure as Illinois Governor and Secretary of State. Thompson acted as Ryan's lawyer personally.[5] On April 17, 2006, Ryan was convicted on all 18 counts, which included racketeering, misusing state resources for political gain, and fraud. He was sentenced to 6½ years in federal prison and began serving his sentence on November 7, 2007. Ryan was released from federal prison on July 3, 2013.
Thompson is also a director and head of the Audit Committee for Hollinger International, the media company founded by convicted fraudster Conrad Black (it is also now the subject of a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation).
Post-gubernatorial political activities[edit]
In 2002, he was appointed to serve on the 9/11 Commission, where he aggressively questioned Richard Clarke, the former chief counter-terrorism adviser on the United States National Security Council.[2] The report of the commission was released on July 22, 2004.
During the 2008 presidential primary campaign, Thompson announced his support for former New York City mayor Rudolph Giuliani for the 2008 Republican nomination.[citation needed] He stressed that Giuliani was the only Republican in the field who could win Illinois.[citation needed]
Awards[edit]
James R. Thompson was inducted as a Laureate of The Lincoln Academy of Illinois and awarded the Order of Lincoln (the State’s highest honor) by the Governor of Illinois in 1991 in the area of Government.[6]

James Robert Thompson, Jr. (born May 8, 1936), also known as Big Jim Thompson, was the 37th and longest-serving Governor of the US state of Illinois,[1] serving from 1977 to 1991. A Republican, Thompson was elected to four consecutive terms and held the office for 14 years. Many years after leaving public office, he served as a member of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States (the 9/11 Commission).[2]

Early life and career[edit]
Born in Chicago, Illinois, Thompson studied at the University of Illinois at Chicago Navy Pier campus, and at Washington University in St. Louis. He received his J.D. from Northwestern University in 1959.[3]
Prior to becoming governor, he worked in the Cook County state's attorney's office, taught at Northwestern University's law school and was appointed by President Nixon to serve as U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois. As a federal prosecutor in the early 1970s, he obtained a conviction against former Governor Otto Kerner, Jr., for his use of improper influence on behalf of the racetrack industry. He also tried and convicted many of Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley's top aides, most notably Alderman Thomas E. Keane and County Clerk Matt Danaher, on various corruption charges. People like Keane and Danaher, the mayor's point man on patronage were also major figures in the Cook County Democratic Party's political machine. These high-profile cases gave Thompson the celebrity that fueled his run for governor in 1976. To the chagrin of many, Thompson was very bipartisan in his attacks on corruption in Cook County and Chicago. He not only prosecuted high-profile Democrats, but also prominent Republicans such as County Commissioner Floyd Fulle and former U.S. Senate candidate, William Rentschler. Organized crime in Chicago was harder for his unit to crack and there were few high-profile cases during his era.
Governor of Illinois[edit]





This section needs attention from an expert in Illinois, Biography or Politics. The specific problem is: For being the longest serving Illinois governor, there is little detail about his tenure. See the talk page for details. WikiProject Illinois, WikiProject Biography or WikiProject Politics may be able to help recruit an expert. (June 2015)


In the 1976 election, he won 65 percent of the vote over Democratic Secretary of State Michael Howlett, who had defeated incumbent Governor Dan Walker in the primary and who had the support of Chicago Mayor and Cook County Democratic Party chairman Richard J. Daley. Thompson was the first candidate for governor to receive over 3 million votes; his tally of 3,000,395 remains the largest number of votes ever cast for a candidate in an election for Governor of Illinois. His first term was for only two years because Illinois moved its gubernatorial election from presidential-election years to midterm-election years. Thompson was re-elected to a full four-year term in 1978 with 60 percent of the vote, defeating State Comptroller Michael Bakalis. In 1982, Thompson was very narrowly re-elected over former U.S. Senator Adlai E. Stevenson III. A rematch in 1986 was expected to be almost as close, but the Democrats were severely hamstrung when supporters of Lyndon LaRouche won the Democratic nominations for lieutenant governor and secretary of state. Stevenson refused to appear on the same ticket as the LaRouchites, and formed the Solidarity Party with the support of the regular state Democratic organization. With the Democrats badly split, Thompson skated to victory in the general election. Thompson was accused of hiding the sad shape that Illinois' economy and budget were in while campaigning, but once elected, calling for an emergency session of the Illinois legislature to address the crisis.




Governor Thompson observing a military exercise, July 1986


On November 12, 1980, Thompson, by his executive order, instituted a hiring freeze for all state agencies, boards, bureaus, and commissions under his control as governor. The order affected approximately 60,000 state positions. These positions could only be filled if the candidates were first approved by an office created by Thompson, the Governor's Office of Personnel. Suit was brought and the Supreme Court held this political patronage practice unconstitutional as a violation of the First Amendment rights of low-level public employees in Rutan v. Republican Party of Illinois, 497 U.S. 62 (1990).
In 1993, the State of Illinois Center in Chicago was renamed the James R. Thompson Center to honor the former governor.
Legal and lobbying career[edit]
After leaving public service, Thompson joined Winston & Strawn LLP, a major Chicago-based law firm. Thompson served as Chairman of the Executive Committee from 1991 to 2006, as well as chairman and CEO of the firm from 1993 to 2006. He was Senior Chairman until January 31, 2015.[4] As CEO of Winston & Strawn, he focused in the area of government relations and regulatory affairs. The firm has lobbied for American Airlines, and he has previously represented United Airlines.[1]
Winston & Strawn is the same firm that represented former Illinois Governor George Ryan pro bono against federal charges relating to the "Licenses-for-Bribes" scandal during Ryan's tenure as Illinois Governor and Secretary of State. Thompson acted as Ryan's lawyer personally.[5] On April 17, 2006, Ryan was convicted on all 18 counts, which included racketeering, misusing state resources for political gain, and fraud. He was sentenced to 6½ years in federal prison and began serving his sentence on November 7, 2007. Ryan was released from federal prison on July 3, 2013.
Thompson is also a director and head of the Audit Committee for Hollinger International, the media company founded by convicted fraudster Conrad Black (it is also now the subject of a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation).
Post-gubernatorial political activities[edit]
In 2002, he was appointed to serve on the 9/11 Commission, where he aggressively questioned Richard Clarke, the former chief counter-terrorism adviser on the United States National Security Council.[2] The report of the commission was released on July 22, 2004.
During the 2008 presidential primary campaign, Thompson announced his support for former New York City mayor Rudolph Giuliani for the 2008 Republican nomination.[citation needed] He stressed that Giuliani was the only Republican in the field who could win Illinois.[citation needed]
Awards[edit]
James R. Thompson was inducted as a Laureate of The Lincoln Academy of Illinois and awarded the Order of Lincoln (the State’s highest honor) by the Governor of Illinois in 1991 in the area of Government.[6]

Faculty James (Jim) R. Thompson, Ph.D.





Location
Rochester, Minnesota
Contact
Thompson.James@mayo.edu




SUMMARY
My current research interests include:

Assembly, structure and function of lipoproteins and of other proteins involved in lipoprotein function
Structure and function of proteins involved in DNA repair mechanisms
Structure-based drug discovery

Molecular biology, biochemistry, biophysics and structural biology are all important components of my team's research.

I am the director of the Mayo Clinic X-ray Crystallography Core Facility and co-director of macromolecular crystallization and crystallography resources located in the Kahlert Structural Biology Center at the University of Minnesota.
All required crystallography infrastructure, plus a significant level of automation, is in place to support a world-class level of structural biology.  These research activities occur within a collaborative atmosphere and involve scientists both within the Mayo Clinic and at external institutions.
We are also developing a silkworm-based protein production technology for high-yield expression and co-expression of proteins that are difficult to obtain using other methods.  Our silkworm expression technology requires one-third of the effort and is one-sixth the cost of insect or mammalian cell culture methods.  The method works for the expression of recombinant cytosolic, secretory or membrane proteins.
