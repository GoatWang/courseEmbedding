New Mountain Capital LLC


                  New Mountain Capital seeks to generate exceptional returns through investor value-added and growth rather than debt. The firm's private efforts focus on intensive fundamental research, the proactive creation of proprietary investment advantages in carefully selected sectors and assisting managements in improving their businesses. New Mountain is a generalist firm but they tend to focus on investments in defensive growth industries. They target sectors that should succeed in both good and bad economies and are large enough and growing rapidly enough to achieve very high valuations and returns at exit. The firm has particular expertise in the following sectors: education, healthcare, logistics, business services, federal information technology services, media, software, insurance, consumer products, financial services, technology, infrastructure and energy.New Mountain looks for companies that are market leaders in sustainable growth niches and have high barriers to competitive entry as demonstrated by high operating margins and strong downside protection in all reasonable worst-case scenarios. They also look for companies that offer the opportunity for extraordinary value creation due to rapid growth or other special factors that exist at the time of the investment. Investments typically range from $100 million to $500 million per transaction.

The committee reviews a wide range of factors that include forecasts of corporate earnings, liquidity and an assessment of macroeconomic trends. The committee formally reviews allocation targets on a monthly basis.For active equity management they combine bottom-up stock selection based on comprehensive fundamental research with explicit sector weighting decisions and quantitative risk management.
