A Customer Writes:
To the folks at Robert Craig ~

I don't believe I've ever written to a company in praise of a product before.  However, my experience with your hair color has finally prompted me to write.

I am 47 and have been coloring my hair since age 25, when I started getting my first grays.  I've used highlights, semi-permanent, demi-permanent, and permanent hair colors and with a few exceptions, have always colored at home using "drugstore" products.

I found Robert Craig hair color online while looking for a less damaging alternative to traditional permanent hair colors.  My hair was dry and fried from using drugstore products, and I was really tired of being dissatisfied with the condition of my hair.  I began using Robert Craig hair color in November 2007 and have finally gotten to the point where my hair has grown out and been cut enough that all the previously colored (with drugstore colors) hair is gone.  My hair is softer than it has been since I started coloring 22 years ago.  The Robert Craig hair color looks so incredibly natural, my hair looks like it did in high school again.  And the way it feels to the touch is completely different now.  It is soft again, not fried.

Thank you so much -- I will never use another hair coloring product.  Never!

New Items HAVE ARRIVED in our Shopping Cart
We have added a few new products so be sure and check the shopping cart by clicking on the button above marked "Shop for Products Here".
Our new vitamin supplement called Healthy Hair is here. After years of seeing prenatal vitamins have a positive health effect on our client's hair we decided to research a vitamin and mineral suppliment that would give you the healthiest hair possible. Since healthy hair starts from the inside out and is so dependant on one's diet this is sure to give you the best looking hair ever. Combine this with our 'no damage' hair color and you can experience a whole new you. Order from the shopping cart or read more here.
You have told us that it would be nice to apply the hair color with a brush. So, we have introduced a couple hair color applicator brush choices including an exciting foam brush hair color applicator kit. We also have a professional hair color bowl. In order to apply our color with a brush the below mentioned mixer does need to be used.
The most exciting new product is a hair color mixer to make mixing of the color very easy. It thickens the color much faster and more than shaking and makes it thick enough to be applied with a brush if you so desire. These new items are from your suggestions and we hope you will be as excited about them as we are.
We have also introduced our favorite styling brush, a boar bristle and vent brush in one. To read more click here.

Producer Facts

Winery Name

Robert Craig



Web Site

http://www.robertcraigwine.com/







Perched 2,300 feet above the valley floor on the summit ridge of Howell Mountain, Robert Craig Winery produces small lots of superb Cabernet Sauvignon from some of Napa’s top mountain vineyards.
Bob Craig’s interest in the unique nature of mountain-grown fruit took hold in 1980, when he was involved in the creation of both the Spring Mountain District and Mount Veeder AVAs. With this fascination driving him, he founded his eponymous winery in 1990, releasing the first vintage in 1992. The early wines were made by Bob Egelhoff in a style that showcased the sturdy nature of the Howell Mountain fruit. According to CEO and partner, Elton Stone, the wines then went through a stylistic change, as Egelhoff tried to tame their natural tannic structure. He pushed ripening by picking late and employed various winemaking processes to create a riper, more seamless style of wine.
Stone, who describes himself as having an “Old World” palate, decided to reverse all that. His goals were twofold: 1) for the wine to better express its unique terroir, and 2) to make a very ageworthy wine. He did so by moving harvest dates back up, looking to pick at 24.5-25 brix rather than 30 as Egelhoff had done, and by working to improve the vineyard, changing to cane pruning, and revamping the winery equipment.
The work in the vineyard is key but expensive. Stone notes, “It costs us almost $15,000 per year to farm the Howell Mountain vineyard, all for an average yield of about 1.5 tons per acre.” That’s in comparison to $9,300 per acre for the gently sloping 17 acres they own in southern Napa on the slopes of Mount George.
Recently, a neighboring property was added to the original 9.5-acre vineyard surrounding the winery, bringing their total holdings on Howell Mountain to more than 100 acres, 35 of which are planted. The estate wines are made from both the Howell Mountain vineyards as well as their 17 acres on the slopes of Mount George. Winemaker Stephen Tebb also produces a mountain Cabernet from Crowley Vineyard on Spring Mountain, a Mount Veeder Cabernet from a single vineyard at about 1,800 feet, a Chardonnay from Gap’s Crown in the Sonoma Coast, and a Howell Mountain Zinfandel from Black Sears Vineyard, just down the lane from the winery.

Grape Varietals




Of the many factors that determine the characteristics of a given wine, the grape varietal is perhaps the most important. Although there are over 10,000 different documented varietals within the species Vitis Vinifera (regarded as the "true" wine grapes), the grapes listed on this page are the ones most commonly cultivated for fine wines.
Each grape varietal has differing aroma and flavor characteristics when it is made into wine. But wines made from individual varietals will also vary in character depending on where in the world the grapes are grown: for example, vineyards in New World growing regions will produce wines with different flavors and aromas than vineyards from Old World growing regions, even when the wines are made from the exact same grape varietal.
Use the links below to find top-rated wines for each of the varietals and learn about what makes each varietal unique.

About Napa Valley
Get the Full Story






Napa Valley is the most famous wine-growing area in the U.S. It begins at the base of Mount St. Helena in the north and tapers off some 30 miles to the south into the floodplain where the Napa River enters San Francisco Bay. From Mount St. Helena to the city of Napa, the valley is defined by two north-south ridgelines of the Coast Range Mountains.
The bulk of grape growing for Napa wines takes place on the valley floor and on the gentle slopes adjoining the floor, the best-known example probably being the Oakville Grade. The floor ranges from less than a mile in width in the north to about 3 to 4 miles across in the south. The hills to the west of the valley floor are part of the Mayacamas Range; they contain key appellations such as Mount Veeder, Spring Mountain, and Diamond Mountain District. With the exception of Howell Mountain, the hills on the eastern side of the valley are not nearly as important or as well known.
From its earliest days, Napa Valley has been the home of some of California's most famous wine estates. Today, the valley boasts upward of 36,000 acres planted to Napa wine grapes and some 250 wineries, most of which offer high-caliber, often expensive Napa Valley wines. With some notable exceptions, the best California Chardonnays, Cabernets, and Merlots come from Napa; these varieties make up two-thirds of the vines in the region.
Because of its huge size, Napa Valley is home to varied microclimates that support many different kinds of wine grapes. For example, the cool Carneros region by San Francisco Bay yields good Chardonnay and Pinot Noir; and at the other end of the valley, the warmer Calistoga area can produce perfectly ripe Zinfandel, Petite Sirah, and monster Cabernets, but it usually overcooks Pinot Noir and other heat-sensitive varieties. On wine labels, the term ""Napa Valley"" has included all but the most outlying and inhospitable lands of Napa County.

About California
Get the Full Story






It is remarkable that an industry essentially less than a half-century old could capture the attention of the American wine-buying public to the degree that California has. Powerful consumer interest in California wine is driven by two major factors. The more obvious reason is that California's best wines, which come from grapes grown in a benign climate featuring endless sunshine, very warm summer days, and generally dry harvests, and wonderfully fruity, full, and satisfying, and rarely too austere or tannic to be enjoyed from day one.
California is blessed with an extraordinary range of soils and microclimates, allowing for the successful cultivation of many varieties. In at least three out of four years, the best sites produce healthy, ripe fruits that are the envy of European producers in more marginal climates. The other reason Americans buy so much California wine is that California is the home team. Clearly, a high percentage of domestic wine drinkers are more comfortable buying American wines (and not just wines of California) than imports. Then, too, foreign bottles are generally identified by place name, rather than by the more familiar varieties that American wine drinkers have come to know and enjoy.
Moreover, in much of North America, outside the top 15 or 20 largest metropolitan markets, consumers have limited access to imported wines even if they wanted to buy them.
For many, Napa Valley is California wine, and Cabernet is king in Napa Valley. Meanwhile, the Burgundy varieties Chardonnay and Pinot Noir have gravitated to cooler areas, generally closer to the Pacific, such as the western stretches of Sonoma County, the Anderson Valley in Mendocino County, and the Santa Maria and Santa Ynez valleys within Santa Barbara County. Syrah vines have yielded interesting wines in a range of styles all over the state, in regions as disparate as Mendocino County, the Sonoma coast, Carneros, Paso Robles, and Santa Maria Valley. Very good Zinfandel similarly comes from multiple growing areas, although to date the age-of-vines variable has been almost as important as geography. Zinfandel, though its roots are in Europe, is a true California original and the only California wine imitated abroad. It's also a variety of which there are still significant plantings of very old vines, in some cases dating back to the end of the 19th century.
