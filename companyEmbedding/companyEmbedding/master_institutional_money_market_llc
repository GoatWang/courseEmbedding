EXPLANATORY NOTE 
This Registration Statement has been filed by Master Institutional Money Market LLC (the Master LLC) pursuant to
Section 8(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act). However, interests in the Registrant are not being registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the 1933 Act),
because such interests will be issued solely in private placement transactions that do not involve any public offering within the meaning of Section 4(a)(2) of the 1933 Act. Investments in the Registrant may be made only by a
limited number of institutional investors, including investment companies, common or commingled trust funds, group trusts and certain other accredited investors within the meaning of Regulation D under the 1933 Act. This Registration
Statement does not constitute an offer to sell, or the solicitation of an offer to buy, any interests in the Registrant.  This
Registration Statement has been prepared as a single document consisting of Parts A, B and C, none of which is to be used or distributed as a stand alone document. 
The Master LLC is part of a master-feeder structure (as described below). Part A of this Registration Statement should
be read in conjunction with Post-Effective Amendment No. 56 of the Registration Statement on Form N-1A (Securities Act File No. 33-14190 and Investment Company Act File No. 811-05149) of Funds For Institutions Series (the
Trust), as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission) on May 2, 2016, and as may be amended from time to time (the Trust Registration Statement). Part A of the Trust Registration Statement
includes the prospectus of the Trust.  The Master LLC consists of two series  Master Premier Government Institutional
Portfolio (Premier Government Institutional Portfolio) (formerly known as Master Premier Institutional Portfolio) and Master Treasury Strategies Institutional Portfolio (Treasury Strategies Institutional
Portfolio) (formerly known as Master Government Institutional Portfolio) (each, a Portfolio). 
The Trust consists of five series  BlackRock Premier Government Institutional Fund (Premier Government Institutional
Fund), BlackRock Treasury Strategies Institutional Fund (Treasury Strategies Institutional Fund), BlackRock Select Treasury Strategies Institutional Fund (Select Treasury Strategies Institutional Fund), FFI Treasury
Fund (Treasury Fund) and FFI Government Fund (Government Fund). Each of Premier Government Institutional Fund, Treasury Strategies Institutional Fund and Select Treasury Strategies Institutional Fund invests all of its assets
in a corresponding Portfolio of the Master LLC as set forth in the following chart:

 Currently, these Funds are the only feeder funds that invest in the Master LLC. Premier

Table of Contents
PART A  May 2, 2016  MASTER INSTITUTIONAL MONEY MARKET LLC 
Responses to Items 1, 2, 3, 4 and 13 have been omitted pursuant to Paragraph 2(b) of Instruction B of the general instructions to Form N-1A.
  


Item 5.
Management. 
Each Portfolios investment manager is BlackRock Advisors, LLC (BlackRock or the Manager). 
 


Item 6.
Purchase and Sales of Master LLC Interests.  Interests in the Master LLC are issued solely in private placement transactions that do not involve any public offering within the meaning of Section 4(a)(2) of the 1933 Act. Investments
in the Master LLC may only be made by a limited number of institutional investors, including investment companies, common or commingled trust funds, group trusts, and certain other accredited investors within the meaning of Regulation D
under the 1933 Act. This Registration Statement does not constitute an offer to sell, or the solicitation of an offer to buy, any security within the meaning of the 1933 Act. 
There is no minimum initial or subsequent investment in a Portfolio. However, because each Portfolio intends to be as fully invested at
all times as is reasonably consistent with its investment objectives and policies in order to enhance the return on its assets, investments by a Feeder Fund must be made in Federal funds (i.e., monies credited to the account of the Master LLCs
custodian bank by a Federal Reserve Bank).  The Master LLC may reject any investment from any Feeder Fund or reject any
investment order and suspend and resume the sale of any interest of any Portfolio at any time for any reason.   


Item 7.
Tax Information.  Each Portfolio intends to operate as a partnership for Federal income tax purposes. If a Portfolio has only one Feeder Fund, such Portfolios existence as an entity separate from its Feeder Fund is
disregarded for Federal income tax purposes. Thus, none of the Portfolios will be subject to any Federal income tax.   


Item 8.
Financial Intermediary Compensation.  Not applicable.   


Item 9.
Investment Objectives, Principal Investment Strategies, Related Risks and Disclosure of Portfolio Holdings. 
(a) Investment Objectives.  The investment objective of each of Premier Government Institutional Portfolio and Treasury Strategies Institutional Portfolio is to seek current income as is consistent with liquidity and stability of
principal.  (b) Implementation of Investment Objectives. 
Each Portfolio is a money market fund managed pursuant to Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act. 
 


 

 
 Each Portfolio seeks to maintain a net asset value of $1.00 per share. 
 


 

 
 Each Portfolio will maintain a dollar-weighted average maturity of 60 days or less and a dollar-weighted average life of all of its investments of 120
days or less. The dollar-weighted average maturity of a Portfolio is the average amount of time until the issuers of the debt securities in the Portfolios portfolio must pay off the principal amount of the debt.
Dollar-weighted means the larger the dollar value of a debt security in a Portfolio, the more weight it gets in calculating this average. To calculate the dollar-weighted average maturity, the Portfolio may treat a variable or floating
rate security under certain circumstances as having a maturity equal to the time remaining to the securitys next interest rate reset date rather than the securitys actual maturity. Dollar-weighted average life of a
Portfolios portfolio is calculated without reference to the exceptions used in calculating the dollar-weighted average maturity for variable or floating rate securities regarding the use of interest rate reset dates.
  


 

 
 Pursuant to Rule 2a-7, each Portfolio is subject to a general liquidity requirement that requires that each Portfolio hold securities that
are sufficiently liquid to meet reasonably foreseeable interestholder redemptions in light of its obligations under Section 22(e) of the Investment Company Act regarding share redemptions and any commitments the Portfolio has made to
interestholders. To comply with this general liquidity requirement, BlackRock must consider factors that could affect the Portfolios liquidity needs, including characteristics of the Portfolios investors and their likely redemptions.
Depending upon the volatility of its cash flows (particularly shareholder redemptions), this may require a Portfolio to maintain greater liquidity than would be required by the daily and weekly minimum liquidity requirements discussed below.

  A-1



Table of Contents


 

 
 Each Portfolio will not acquire any illiquid securities (i.e., securities that cannot be sold or disposed of in the ordinary course of business within
seven days at approximately the value ascribed to them by the Portfolio) if, immediately following such purchase, more than 5% of the Portfolios total assets are invested in illiquid securities. Each Portfolio will not acquire any security
other than a daily liquid asset unless, immediately following such purchase, at least 10% of its total assets would be invested in daily liquid assets, and each Portfolio will not acquire any security other than a weekly liquid asset unless,
immediately following such purchase, at least 30% of its total assets would be invested in weekly liquid assets. Daily liquid assets include (i) cash; (ii) direct obligations of the U.S. Government; (iii) securities that will mature, as
determined without reference to the maturity shortening provisions of Rule 2a-7 regarding interest rate readjustments, or are subject to a demand feature that is exercisable and payable within one business day; and (iv) amounts receivable and due
unconditionally within one business day on pending sales of portfolio securities. Weekly liquid assets include (i) and (ii) above as well as (iii) U.S. Government securities issued by a person controlled or supervised by and acting as an
instrumentality of the U.S. Government pursuant to authority granted by the U.S. Congress, that are issued at a discount to the principal amount to be repaid at maturity without provision for the payment of interest and have a remaining maturity of
60 days or less; (iv) securities that will mature, as determined without reference to the maturity shortening provisions of Rule 2a-7 regarding interest rate readjustments, or are subject to a demand feature that is exercisable and payable within
five business days; and (v) amounts receivable and due unconditionally within five business days on pending sales of portfolio securities.   


 

 
 Each Portfolio is ordinarily limited to investing so that, immediately following any such acquisition not more than 5% of its total assets will be
invested in securities issued by any one issuer (other than U.S. Government obligations, repurchase agreements collateralized by such securities and securities subject to certain guarantees or otherwise providing a right to demand payment) or, in
the event that such securities are not First Tier Securities (as defined in Rule 2a-7), not more than  1/2 of 1% of the Portfolios total assets. In addition, Rule 2a-7 requires that not more than 3% of each Portfolios
total assets be invested in Second Tier Securities (as defined in Rule 2a-7) and that Second Tier Securities may only be purchased if they have a remaining maturity of 45 days or less at the time of acquisition. 
Outlined below are the principal strategies these Portfolios use in seeking to achieve their investment objectives: 
Premier Government Institutional Portfolio  Premier Government Institutional Portfolio invests at least 99.5% of its total assets in cash, U.S. Treasury bills, notes and other obligations issued or guaranteed as to principal and interest by the
U.S. Government, its agencies or instrumentalities, and repurchase agreements secured by such obligations or cash. The Portfolio invests in a portfolio of securities maturing in 397 days (13 months) or less (with certain exceptions) that will have a
dollar-weighted average maturity of 60 days or less and a dollar-weighted average life of 120 days or less. The Portfolio may invest in variable or floating rate instruments, and transact in securities on a when-issued, delayed delivery or forward
commitment basis.  The Portfolio will invest, under normal circumstances, at least 80% of its net assets, plus the amount of
any borrowings for investment purposes, in U.S. Treasury bills, notes and other obligations issued or guaranteed as to principal and interest by the U.S. Government, its agencies or instrumentalities, and repurchase agreements secured by such
obligations or cash. This policy is a non-fundamental policy of the Portfolio and the Portfolio will not change the policy without providing interestholders with at least 60 days prior notice of any change in the policy. 
Portfolio management varies the kinds of short-term U.S. Government securities held in the Portfolios portfolio, as well as the
Portfolios average maturity. Portfolio management decides which securities to buy and sell, as well as whether to enter into repurchase agreements, based on its assessment of their relative values and future interest rates. 
The securities in which Premier Government Institutional Portfolio may invest include: 
 


 

 
 Repurchase Agreements  Repurchase agreements are transactions in which the Portfolio purchases a class of securities with the
obligation to resell the securities shortly thereafter at a specified price which reflects interest payable to the Portfolio. The Portfolio may engage in repurchase agreements secured by U.S. Treasury bills, notes and other obligations issued or
guaranteed as to principal and interest by the U.S. Government, its agencies or instrumentalities and cash.   


 

 
 U.S. Treasury Obligations  Obligations that are direct obligations of the U.S. Treasury. These also include Treasury Receipts where
the principal and interest components are traded separately under the Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal of Securities (STRIPS) Program. 
 


 

 
 U.S. Government Obligations  Obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Government or its agencies, authorities,
instrumentalities and sponsored enterprises, and related custodial receipts.   


 

 
 Variable and Floating Rate Instruments  Instruments that provide for adjustments in the interest rate on certain reset dates
(variable) or whenever a specified interest rate index changes (floating).   


 

 
 When-Issued and Delayed Settlement Transactions  The purchase or sale of securities on a when-issued basis, on a delayed delivery
basis or through a forward commitment involves the purchase or sale of securities by the Portfolio at an established price with payment and delivery taking place in the future. The Portfolio enters into these transactions to obtain what is
considered an advantageous price to the Portfolio at the time of entering into the transaction.  Treasury Strategies
Institutional Portfolio  Treasury Strategies Institutional Portfolio will invest 100% of its total assets in cash, U.S.
Treasury bills, notes and other obligations of the U.S. Treasury, and repurchase agreements with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York secured by U.S. Treasury obligations. The Portfolio invests in securities maturing in 397 days (13 months) or less
(with certain exceptions) and the portfolio will have a dollar-weighted average maturity of 60 days or less and a dollar-weighted average life of 120 days or less. The Portfolio may invest in variable or floating rate instruments, and transact in
securities on a when-issued, delayed delivery or forward commitment basis.  The Portfolio will invest, under normal
circumstances, at least 80% of its net assets, plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes, in U.S. Treasury bills, notes and other obligations of the U.S. Treasury, and repurchase agreements with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York
secured by U.S. Treasury obligations. This policy is a non-fundamental policy of the Portfolio and the Portfolio will not change the policy without providing interestholders with at least 60 days prior notice of any change in the policy.
 Portfolio management varies the kinds of U.S. Treasury securities held in the Portfolios portfolio, as well as the
Portfolios average maturity. Portfolio management decides which securities to buy and sell, as well as whether to enter into repurchase agreements, based on its assessment of their relative values and future interest rates. 
The securities in which Treasury Strategies Institutional Portfolio may invest include: 
 


 

 
 Repurchase Agreements  Repurchase agreements are transactions in which the Portfolio purchases a class of securities with the
obligation to resell the securities shortly thereafter at a specified price which reflects interest payable to the Portfolio. The Portfolio may engage in repurchase agreements only with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York secured by U.S. Treasury
obligations.   


 

 
 U.S. Treasury Obligations  Obligations that are direct obligations of the U.S. Treasury. These also include Treasury Receipts where
the principal and interest components are traded separately under the Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal of Securities (STRIPS) Program. 
 


 

 
 Variable and Floating Rate Instruments  Instruments that provide for adjustments in the interest rate on certain reset dates
(variable) or whenever a specified interest rate index changes (floating).   


 

 
 When-Issued and Delayed Settlement Transactions  The purchase or sale of securities on a when-issued basis, on a delayed delivery
basis or through a forward commitment involves the purchase or sale of securities by the Portfolio at an established price with payment and delivery taking place in the future. The Portfolio enters into these transactions to obtain what is
considered an advantageous price to the Portfolio at the time of entering into the transaction. 
  A-2



Table of Contents
Other Strategies. In addition to the principal strategies discussed above, the Portfolios
may also invest or engage in the following investments/strategies.   


 

 
 Affiliated Money Market Funds  Each Portfolio may invest uninvested cash balances in affiliated money market funds.
  


 

 
 Borrowing  Each Portfolio may borrow only to meet redemptions. 
 


 

 
 Illiquid/Restricted Securities  Each Portfolio may invest up to 5% of its total assets in illiquid securities that it
cannot sell within seven days at approximately current value. Each Portfolio may also invest in restricted securities, which are securities that cannot be offered for public resale unless registered under the applicable securities laws or that have
a contractual restriction that prohibits or limits their resale (i.e., Rule 144A securities). Restricted securities may include private placement securities that have not been registered under the applicable securities laws. Restricted securities
may not be listed on an exchange and may have no active trading market and therefore may be considered to be illiquid. Rule 144A securities are restricted securities that can be resold to qualified institutional buyers but not to the general public
and may be considered liquid securities.   


 

 
 Securities Lending  Each Portfolio may lend securities with a value up to 33 1/3% of its total assets to financial institutions that provide cash or securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Government as collateral. 
(c) Risks.  Risk is inherent in all investing. The value of an investment in a Portfolio, as well as the amount of return received on an investment, may fluctuate significantly from day to day and over time. An
investment in a Portfolio may not perform as well as other similar investments. Interestholders could lose money by investing in a Portfolio. Although each Portfolio seeks to preserve the value of an investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot
guarantee it will do so. An investment in a Portfolio is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Portfolios sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to a
Portfolio, and interestholders should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to a Portfolio at any time. The following is a description of certain risks of investing in the Portfolios. 
Set forth below are the principal risks of investing in the Portfolios. 
 


 

 
 Credit Risk  Credit risk refers to the possibility that the issuer of a security owned by the Portfolio will not be able to
make principal and interest payments when due. Changes in an issuers credit rating or the markets perception of an issuers creditworthiness may also affect the value of the Portfolios investment in that issuer. The degree of
credit risk depends on both the financial condition of the issuer and the terms of the obligation.   


 

 
 Income Risk  The Portfolios yield will vary as the short-term securities in its portfolio mature and the proceeds are
reinvested in securities with different interest rates.   


 

 
 Interest Rate Risk  Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of a debt security may fall when interest rates rise. In
general, the market price of debt securities with longer maturities will go up or down more in response to changes in interest rates than the market price of shorter-term securities. 
Additionally, securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Government, its agencies, instrumentalities and sponsored enterprises have
historically involved little risk of loss of principal if held to maturity. However, due to fluctuations in interest rates, the market value of such securities may vary during the period interestholders own interests of the Portfolio. 
 


 

 
 Market Risk and Selection Risk  Market risk is the risk that one or more markets in which the Portfolio invests will go down in
value, including the possibility that the markets will go down sharply and unpredictably. Selection risk is the risk that the securities selected by Portfolio management will underperform the markets, the relevant indices or the securities selected
by other funds with similar investment objectives and investment strategies. This means you may lose money.


 
 Regulatory Risk  On July 23, 2014, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) adopted amendments to money market
fund regulations, which structurally change the way that certain money market funds will be required to operate. The effect of these amendments on an individual money market fund will depend on the type of investors (e.g., retail or institutional)
and the principal investments of the fund. For example, institutional money market funds will be required to sell and redeem fund shares using a floating net asset value and may, at the discretion of the funds board of trustees,
impose fees on shareholder redemptions and temporarily suspend redemptions if the funds weekly liquid assets fall below a certain threshold. Retail money market funds may impose fees and suspend redemptions, but may continue to
sell and redeem shares at a constant net asset value, whereas Government money market funds are exempt from these structural changes. The compliance periods for the amendments range between July 2015 and October 2016. When implemented,
the changes may affect the Portfolios investment strategies, fees and expenses, portfolio and share liquidity and return potential.   


 

 
 Repurchase Agreement Risk  If the other party to a repurchase agreement defaults on its obligation under the agreement, the
Portfolio may suffer delays and incur costs or lose money in exercising its rights under the agreement. If the seller fails to repurchase the security and the market value of the security declines, the Portfolio may lose money.
  


 

 
 Treasury Obligations Risk  Treasury obligations may differ in their interest rates, maturities, times of issuance and other
characteristics. Direct obligations of the U.S. Treasury have historically involved little risk of loss of principal if held to maturity. However, due to fluctuations in interest rates, the market value of such securities may vary during the period
interestholders own interests in the Portfolio.   


 

 
 U.S. Government Obligations Risk  Obligations of U.S. Government agencies, authorities, instrumentalities and sponsored enterprises
have historically involved little risk of loss of principal if held to maturity. However, not all U.S. Government securities are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. Obligations of certain agencies, authorities,
instrumentalities and sponsored enterprises of the U.S. Government are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States (e.g., the Government National Mortgage Association); other obligations are backed by the right of the issuer to borrow
from the U.S. Treasury (e.g., the Federal Home Loan Banks) and others are supported by the discretionary authority of the U.S. Government to purchase an agencys obligations. Still others are backed only by the credit of the agency, authority,
instrumentality or sponsored enterprise issuing the obligation. No assurance can be given that the U.S. Government would provide financial support to any of these entities if it is not obligated to do so by law. 
 


 

 
 Variable and Floating Rate Instrument Risk  The absence of an active market for these instruments could make it difficult for the
Portfolio to dispose of them if the issuer defaults.   


 

 
 When-Issued and Delayed Delivery Securities and Forward Commitments Risk  When-issued and delayed delivery securities and forward
commitments involve the risk that the security that the Portfolio buys will lose value prior to its delivery. There also is the risk that the security will not be issued or that the other party to the transaction will not meet its obligation. If
this occurs, the Portfolio may lose both the investment opportunity for the assets it has set aside to pay for the security and any gain in the securitys price. 
Each Portfolio may also be subject to certain other risks associated with its investments and investment strategies, including:
  


 

 
 Borrowing Risk  Borrowing may exaggerate changes in the net asset value of Portfolio interests and in the yield on the
Portfolios portfolio. Borrowing will cost the Portfolio interest expense and other fees. The cost of borrowing money may reduce the Portfolios return. Borrowing may cause the Portfolio to liquidate positions when it may not be
advantageous to do so to satisfy its obligations.   


 

 
 Expense Risk  Portfolio expenses are subject to a variety of factors, including fluctuations in the Portfolios net assets.
Accordingly, actual expenses may be greater or less than those indicated. For example, to the extent that the Portfolios net assets decrease due to market declines or redemptions, the Portfolios expenses will increase as a percentage of
Portfolio net assets. During periods of high market volatility, these increases in the Portfolios expense ratio could be significant.   


 

 
 Investment in Other Investment Companies Risk  As with other investments, investments in other investment companies are subject to
market and selection risk. In addition, 
  A-4



Table of Contents


 
if the Portfolio acquires shares of investment companies, shareholders bear both their proportionate share of expenses in the Portfolio (including management and advisory fees) and,
indirectly, the expenses of the investment companies.   


 

 
 Liquidity Risk  Liquidity risk refers to the possibility that it may be difficult or impossible to sell certain positions at an
acceptable price.   


 

 
 Securities Lending Risk  Securities lending involves the risk that the borrower may fail to return the securities in a timely
manner or at all. As a result, the Portfolio may lose money and there may be a delay in recovering the loaned securities. The Portfolio could also lose money if it does not recover the securities and/or the value of the collateral falls, including
the value of investments made with cash collateral. These events could trigger adverse tax consequences for the Portfolio.  (d) Portfolio Holdings.  For a discussion of the Master LLCs policies
and procedures regarding the selective disclosure of its portfolio holdings, please see Part B of this Registration Statement.   


Item 10.
Management, Organization and Capital Structure.  (a)(1) Manager.  BlackRock, 100 Bellevue Parkway, Wilmington, Delaware
19809, manages the investments of Premier Government Institutional Portfolio and Treasury Strategies Institutional Portfolio and their business operations subject to the oversight of the Board of Directors of the Master LLC (the Board).
While the Manager is ultimately responsible for the management of these Portfolios, it is able to draw upon the research and expertise of its asset management affiliates for portfolio decisions and management with respect to certain portfolio
securities. The Manager is an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of BlackRock, Inc.  The Manager was organized in 1994 to
perform advisory services for investment companies. The Manager and its affiliates had approximately $4.737 trillion in investment company and other portfolio assets under management as of March 31, 2016. 
The Manager is responsible for the day-to-day management of each Portfolios portfolio. The Manager has the responsibility for
making all investment decisions for Premier Government Institutional Portfolio and Treasury Strategies Institutional Portfolio. 
The Master LLC, on behalf of Premier Government Institutional Portfolio and Treasury Strategies Institutional Portfolio, has entered into
a management agreement (the Management Agreement) pursuant to which the Manager receives a fee, based on each Portfolios average daily net assets, at the following annual rates: 
 






 Portfolio Name
  
Management FeeRateAs a % 
of AverageDaily Net Assets

 Premier Government Institutional Portfolio
  
0.05%

 Treasury Strategies Institutional Portfolio
  
0.05%
 Pursuant to the Management Agreement, the Manager may from time to time, in its sole discretion to
the extent permitted by applicable law, appoint one or more sub-advisers, including, without limitation, affiliates of BlackRock, Inc., to perform investment advisory services with respect to the Portfolios. In addition, the Manager may delegate
certain of its investment advisory functions under the Management Agreement to one or more of its affiliates to the 
  A-5



Table of Contents

extent permitted by applicable law. The Manager may terminate any or all sub-advisers or such delegation arrangements in its sole discretion at any time to the extent permitted by applicable law.
 A discussion of the basis for the Boards approval of the Management Agreement is included in the Master LLCs
semi-annual report for the fiscal period ended October 31, 2015.  From time to time, a manager, analyst, or other
employee of BlackRock or its affiliates may express views regarding a particular asset class, company, security, industry, or market sector. The views expressed by any such person are the views of only that individual as of the time expressed and do
not necessarily represent the views of BlackRock or any other person within the BlackRock organization. Any such views are subject to change at any time based upon market or other conditions and BlackRock disclaims any responsibility to update such
views. These views may not be relied on as investment advice and, because investment decisions for the Portfolios are based on numerous factors, may not be relied on as an indication of trading intent on behalf of the Portfolios. 
Legal Proceedings. On May 27, 2014, certain purported investors in the BlackRock Global Allocation Fund, Inc. (Global
Allocation) and the BlackRock Equity Dividend Fund (Equity Dividend) filed a consolidated complaint (the Consolidated Complaint) in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey against BlackRock,
BlackRock Investment Management, LLC and BlackRock International Limited (collectively, the Defendants) under the caption In re BlackRock Mutual Funds Advisory Fee Litigation. The Consolidated Complaint, which purports to be
brought derivatively on behalf of Global Allocation and Equity Dividend, alleges that the Defendants violated Section 36(b) of the Investment Company Act by receiving allegedly excessive investment advisory fees from Global Allocation and
Equity Dividend. The Consolidated Complaint seeks, among other things, to recover on behalf of Global Allocation and Equity Dividend all allegedly excessive advisory fees from one year prior to the filing of the lawsuit and purported lost investment
returns on those amounts, plus interest. The Defendants believe the claims in the Consolidated Complaint are without merit and intend to vigorously defend the action.  Conflicts of Interest  The investment activities of BlackRock and its
affiliates (including BlackRock, Inc. and The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. and their affiliates, directors, partners, trustees, managing members, officers and employees (collectively, the Affiliates)) in the management of, or their
interest in, their own accounts and other accounts they manage, may present conflicts of interest that could disadvantage the Portfolios and their shareholders.  BlackRock and its Affiliates provide investment management services to other funds and discretionary managed accounts that follow investment programs similar to those of the Portfolios. BlackRock and its
Affiliates are involved worldwide with a broad spectrum of financial services and asset management activities and may engage in the ordinary course of business in activities in which their interests or the interests of their clients may conflict
with those of the Portfolios. One or more Affiliates act or may act as an investor, investment banker, research provider, investment manager, financier, adviser, market maker, trader, prime broker, lender, agent and principal, and have other direct
and indirect interests in securities, currencies and other instruments in which the Portfolios directly and indirectly invest. Thus, it is likely that the Portfolios will have multiple business relationships with and will invest in, engage in
transactions with, make voting decisions with respect to, or obtain services from entities for which an Affiliate performs or seeks to perform investment banking or other services. One or more Affiliates may engage in proprietary trading and advise
accounts and funds that have investment objectives similar to those of the Portfolios and/or that engage in and compete for transactions in the same types of securities, currencies and other instruments as the Portfolios. The trading activities of
these Affiliates are carried out without reference to positions held directly or indirectly by the Portfolios and may result in an Affiliate having positions that are adverse to those of the Portfolios. No Affiliate is under any obligation to share
any investment opportunity, idea or strategy with the Portfolios. As a result, an Affiliate may compete with the Portfolios for appropriate investment opportunities. The results of the Portfolios investment activities, therefore, may differ
from those of an Affiliate and of other accounts managed by an Affiliate, and it is possible that the Portfolios could sustain losses during periods in which one or more Affiliates and other accounts achieve profits on their trading for proprietary
or other accounts. The opposite result is also possible.  In addition, the Portfolios may, from time to time, enter into
transactions in which an Affiliate or its other clients have an adverse interest. Furthermore, transactions undertaken by Affiliate-advised clients may adversely impact the Portfolios. Transactions by one or more Affiliate-advised clients or
BlackRock may have the effect of diluting or otherwise disadvantaging the values, prices or investment strategies of the Portfolios. The Portfolios activities may be limited because of regulatory restrictions applicable to one or more
Affiliates and/or their internal policies designed to comply with such restrictions.  In addition, the Portfolios may invest
in securities of companies with which an Affiliate has or is trying to develop investment banking relationships or in which an Affiliate has significant debt or equity investments. The Portfolios also may invest in securities of companies for which
an Affiliate provides or may someday provide research coverage. An Affiliate may have business relationships with and purchase or distribute or sell services or products from or to distributors,

consultants or others who recommend the Portfolios or who engage in transactions with or for the Portfolios,
and may receive compensation for such services. The Portfolios may also make brokerage and other payments to Affiliates in connection with the Portfolios portfolio investment transactions. 
Under a securities lending program approved by the Board with respect to Premier Government Institutional Portfolio and Treasury
Strategies Institutional Portfolio, the Portfolios have retained an Affiliate of the Manager to serve as the securities lending agent for the Portfolios to the extent that the Portfolios engage in the securities lending program. For these services,
the lending agent will receive a fee from a Portfolio, including a fee based on the returns earned on that Portfolios investment of the cash received as collateral for the loaned securities. In addition, one or more Affiliates may be among the
entities to which a Portfolio may lend its portfolio securities under the securities lending program.  The activities of
Affiliates may give rise to other conflicts of interest that could disadvantage a Portfolio and its interestholders. BlackRock has adopted policies and procedures designed to address these potential conflicts of interest. See Part B of this
Registration Statement for further information.  (a)(2) Portfolio Manager. 
Not applicable. 
(b) Capital Stock.  Investors in the Master LLC have no preemptive or conversion rights, and interests in the Master LLC are fully paid and non-assessable. The Master LLC has no current intention to hold annual meetings of
investors, except to the extent required by the Investment Company Act, but will hold special meetings of investors when, in the judgment of the Directors of the Master LLC, it is necessary or desirable to submit matters for an investor vote. Upon
liquidation of a Portfolio, Feeder Funds would be entitled to their pro rata share of the assets of such Portfolio that are available for distribution.  Smaller Feeder Funds may be harmed by the actions of larger Feeder Funds. For example, a larger Feeder Fund could have more voting power than a smaller Feeder Fund over the operations of a Portfolio. A
Feeder Fund may withdraw from the Portfolio at any time and may invest all of its assets in another pooled investment vehicle or retain an investment adviser to manage the Feeder Funds assets directly. Each Feeder Fund is entitled to a vote in
proportion to its investment in the corresponding Portfolio. Each Feeder Fund generally will participate in the earnings, dividends and assets of the corresponding Portfolio in accordance with its pro rata interest in the corresponding Portfolio.
 Investments in the Master LLC may not be transferred except with the prior written consent of all the Directors and all
remaining interest holders. A Feeder Fund may withdraw all or any portion of its investment in the corresponding Portfolio at net asset value on any day on which both the New York Stock Exchange (the Exchange) and the Federal Reserve
banks are open and the bond market is open for trading, subject to certain exceptions. For more information about the ability of a Feeder Fund to withdraw all or any portion of its investment in the corresponding Portfolio, please see Item 11
herein.   


Item 11.
Shareholder Information.  (a) Pricing of Interests in the Master LLC.  The
amortized cost method is used in calculating each Portfolios net asset value, meaning that the calculation is based on a valuation of the assets held by each Portfolio at cost, with adjustments for any discounts or premiums on a security at
the time of purchase. The net asset value of each Portfolio is the offering price. Interests are also redeemed at their net asset value. The net asset value per interest for purposes of pricing orders for both the purchase and the redemption of
Portfolio interests is determined daily on days that both the Exchange and the Federal Reserve are open for business, and the bond markets are open for trading (business day). Currently, the only scheduled days on which the Exchange is
open and the Federal Reserve banks are closed are Columbus Day and Veterans Day. The only scheduled day on which the Federal Reserve banks are open and the Exchange is closed is Good Friday. On any business day that the Exchange does not close
early and/or the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) does not recommend that the securities markets close early, net asset value is determined as of 5:00 p.m. (Eastern time) for Premier Government Institutional
Portfolio and Treasury Strategies Institutional Portfolio. On any day the Exchange closes early and/or SIFMA recommends an early close, the time for determination of net asset value of the Portfolio will be 15 minutes following the time that each
Portfolio determines, in its discretion, to cease accepting orders for purchases and redemptions of
interests.1 
 The Portfolios reserve the right to
advance the time for accepting purchase or redemption orders for same business day credit on any day when the Exchange, bond markets (as recommended by SIFMA) or the Federal Reserve banks close early1, trading on the Exchange is restricted, an emergency arises or as
otherwise permitted by the Commission.     


1 
 For calendar years 2015-2016, SIFMA currently recommends an early close for the bond markets on the following dates: April 3, May 22, November 27,
December 24 and December 31, 2015 and March 24, May 27, July 1, November 25, December 23 and December 30, 2016. For calendar years 2015-2016, the Exchange will close early on November 27 and December 24, 2015 and November 25, 2016.

  A-7



Table of Contents
In addition, the Board may, for any business day, decide to change the time as of which a
Portfolios net asset value is calculated in response to new developments such as altered trading hours, or as otherwise permitted by the Commission.  In the event the Exchange does not open for business because of an emergency or other unanticipated event, the Portfolios may, but are not required to, open for purchase or redemption transactions if the
Federal Reserve wire payment system is open. To learn whether a Portfolio is open for business during an emergency or an unanticipated Exchange closing, please call (800) 225-1576. 
Expenses, including the fee payable to the Manager, are accrued daily. Each investor in a Portfolio may add to or reduce its investment
in the Portfolio on every business day. The value of each investors interest in a Portfolio will be determined by multiplying the net asset value of the Portfolio by the percentage, effective for that day, that represents the investors
share of the aggregate interests in the Portfolio. Any additions or withdrawals to be effected on that day will then be effected. The investors percentage of the aggregate interests in the Portfolio will then be recomputed as the percentage
equal to the fraction (i) the numerator of which is the value of such investors investment in the Portfolio as of the time of determination on such day plus or minus, as the case may be, the amount of any additions to or withdrawals from
the investors investment in the Portfolio effected on such day, and (ii) the denominator of which is the aggregate net asset value of the Portfolio as of such time on such day plus or minus, as the case may be, the amount of the net
additions to or withdrawals from the aggregate investments in the Portfolio by all investors in the Portfolio. The percentage so determined will then be applied to determine the value of the investors interest in the Portfolio on the next
determination of net asset value of the Portfolio.  (b) Purchase of Interests in the Master LLC. 
Interests in the Master LLC are issued solely in private placement transactions that do not involve any public offering within
the meaning of Section 4(a)(2) of the 1933 Act. Investments in the Master LLC may only be made by a limited number of institutional investors, including investment companies, common or commingled trust funds, group trusts, and certain other
accredited investors within the meaning of Regulation D under the 1933 Act. This Registration Statement does not constitute an offer to sell, or the solicitation of an offer to buy, any security within the meaning of the 1933
Act.  There is no minimum initial or subsequent investment in a Portfolio. However, because each Portfolio intends to be as
fully invested at all times as is reasonably consistent with its investment objectives and policies in order to enhance the return on its assets, investments by a Feeder Fund must be made in Federal funds (i.e., monies credited to the account of the
Master LLCs custodian bank by a Federal Reserve Bank).  The Master LLC may reject any investment from any Feeder Fund or
reject any investment order and suspend and resume the sale of any interest of any Portfolio at any time for any reason. 
(c) Redemption of Interests in the Master LLC.  A Feeder Fund may withdraw all or any portion of its investment in the corresponding Portfolio on any business day at the net asset value next determined after a withdrawal request in proper form is
furnished by the investor to the Master LLC. When a request is received in proper form, the Master LLC will redeem a Feeder Funds interests at the next determined net asset value. The Master LLC will make payment for all interests redeemed
within seven days after receipt by the Master LLC of a redemption request in proper form, except as provided by the rules of the Commission. The right of a Feeder Fund to receive payment with respect to any withdrawal may be suspended or the payment
of the withdrawal proceeds postponed during any period in which the Exchange is closed (other than weekends or holidays) or trading on the Exchange is restricted, or, to the extent otherwise permitted by the Investment Company Act, if an emergency
exists. Investments in the Master LLC may not be transferred without the prior written consent of all Directors of the Master LLC and all remaining interestholders.  (d) Dividends and Distributions.  Not applicable. 
(e) Frequent Purchase and Redemption of the Master LLC Interests. 
The Master LLC does not offer its interests for sale to the general public, nor does it offer an exchange privilege. In addition, because
of the nature of the Feeder Funds and their shareholders no Portfolio should be adversely affected 
  A-8



Table of Contents

by short-term trading in shares of a Feeder Fund. For this reason, the Board has not adopted specific policies for the Master LLC to prevent short-term trading. See Account Information
 Short-Term Trading Policy in Part A of the Trust Registration Statement for more information.  (f) Tax
Consequences.  The Master LLC is organized as a Delaware limited liability company. Under the anticipated method of
operation of the series, each Portfolio will be treated for Federal income tax purposes as a separate entity that will have the status of a partnership pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 301.7701-3(b)(1), or if it has only one Feeder Fund,
as an entity the existence of which separate from its Feeder Fund is disregarded for Federal income tax purposes. Thus, none of the Portfolios will be subject to any Federal income tax. Based on the status of each Portfolio as a partnership or
disregarded entity, each investor in a Portfolio will include in its gross income its share (as determined in accordance with the governing instruments of the Portfolio) of such Portfolios ordinary income, capital gains, losses, deductions and
credits in determining its Federal income tax liability. The determination of such share will be made in accordance with the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and U.S. Treasury Department regulations promulgated thereunder. 
 


Item 12.
Distribution Arrangements.  (a) Sales Loads.  Not applicable. 
(b) 12b-1 Fees.  Not applicable.  (c) Multiple Class and Master/Feeder Funds. 
The Master LLC is part of a master/feeder structure. Members of the general public may not purchase beneficial interests in the Master
LLC. However, the Master LLC may sell beneficial interests to other affiliated and non-affiliated investment companies and/or institutional investors. Each Feeder Fund acquires an indirect interest in the securities owned by the corresponding
Portfolio and will pay a proportionate share of the Portfolios expenses. A Feeder Fund is not required to sell its shares to the public at the same price as another Feeder Fund. Feeder Funds may have different sales commissions and operating
expenses. These different sales commissions and operating expenses may result in differences in returns among the Feeder Funds. 
The Directors of the Master LLC believe that the master/feeder fund structure may enable the Master LLC to reduce costs
through economies of scale. A larger investment portfolio for each Portfolio may reduce certain transaction costs to the extent that contributions to and redemptions from the Portfolios portfolio by the various Feeder Funds may offset each
other and produce a lower net cash flow.  A Feeder Funds investment in the corresponding Portfolio may, however, be
adversely affected by the actions of other Feeder Funds. For example, if a large Feeder Fund reduces its investment in a Portfolio or withdraws from a Portfolio, the remaining Feeder Funds may bear higher pro rata operating expenses. However, this
possibility also exists for traditionally structured funds with large investors. A Feeder Fund might also withdraw from the corresponding Portfolio if the Portfolio voted to change its investment objective, policies or limitations in a manner not
acceptable to the Board of that Feeder Fund. The withdrawal of all of a Feeder Funds assets from the corresponding Portfolio may affect the investment performance of the Feeder Fund and the Portfolio. 
The Master LLC normally will not hold meetings of investors except as required by the Investment Company Act. Each Feeder Fund will be
entitled to vote in proportion to its interest in the corresponding Portfolio. When a Feeder Fund is requested to vote on matters pertaining to the corresponding Portfolio, the Feeder Fund will hold a meeting of its shareholders and will vote its
interest in the Portfolio proportionately to the voting instructions received from the shareholders of the Feeder Fund. For more information about the master/feeder structure, please see Part A of the Trust Registration Statement under
Account Information  Master/Feeder Structure.

Item 15.
Master LLC History.  The Master LLC is registered as an open-end management investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act) and is organized as a Delaware
limited liability company. Between October 12, 2001 (the date of first organization) and June 15, 2007, the Master LLC was organized as a statutory business trust under the laws of the State of Delaware. Interests in the Master LLC are
issued solely in private placement transactions that do not involve any public offering within the meaning of Regulation D under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the 1933 Act). Investments in the Master LLC may be made
only by investment companies or certain other entities that are accredited investors within the meaning of Regulation D under the 1933 Act.  On January 4, 2016, Master Premier Institutional Portfolio changed its name to Master Premier Government Institutional Portfolio and Master Institutional Portfolio changed its name to
Master Government Institutional Portfolio. On May 2, 2016, Master Government Institutional Portfolio changed its name to Master Treasury Strategies Institutional Portfolio. 
 


Item 16.
Description of the Master LLC and Its Investments and Risks. 
The following information supplements and should be read in conjunction with Item 9 of the Master LLCs Part A. 
Information relating to the fundamental investment restrictions and the non-fundamental investment policies and restrictions of each
Portfolio, the types of securities purchased by each Portfolio, the investment techniques used by each Portfolio, and certain risks relating thereto, as well as other information relating to each Portfolios investment programs, is incorporated
herein by reference to the section entitled Investment Objectives and Policies in Part B of the Trust Registration Statement.  Information on the Master LLCs policies and procedures with respect to the selective disclosure of the Portfolios portfolio holdings is incorporated herein by reference to the section entitled
Investment Advisory Arrangements  Disclosure of Portfolio Holdings in Part B of the Trust Registration Statement.   


Item 17.
Management of the Master LLC.  (a) Management Information.  The Board of Directors of the Master LLC (the
Board) consists of fifteen individuals (each, a Director), thirteen of whom are not interested persons of the Master LLC as defined in the Investment Company Act (the Independent Directors). The same
individuals also serve as trustees of the Trust. The registered investment companies advised by the Manager or its affiliates (the BlackRock-advised Funds) are organized into one complex of closed-end funds (the Closed-End
Complex), two complexes of open-end funds (the Equity-Liquidity Complex and the Equity-Bond Complex) and one complex of exchange-traded funds (each, a BlackRock Fund Complex). The Master LLC is included in
the BlackRock Fund Complex referred to as the Equity-Liquidity Complex. The Directors also oversee as board members the operations of the other open-end registered investment companies included in the Equity-Liquidity Complex. 
The Board has overall responsibility for the oversight of the Master LLC and the Portfolios. The Chair of the Board is an Independent
Director, and the Chair of each Board committee (each, a Committee) is an Independent Director. The Board has five standing Committees: an Audit Committee, a Governance and Nominating Committee, a Compliance Committee, a Performance
Oversight and Contract Committee and an Executive Committee. The role of the Chair of the Board is to preside at all meetings of the Board, and to act as a liaison with service providers, officers, attorneys, and other Directors generally between
meetings. The Chair of each Committee performs a similar role with respect to the Committee. The Chair of the Board or the Chair of a Committee may also perform such other functions as may be delegated by the Board or the Committee from time to
time. The Independent Directors meet regularly outside the presence of Portfolio management, in executive session or with other service providers to the Master LLC and the Portfolios. The Board has regular meetings five times a year, and may hold
special meetings if required before its next regular meeting. Each Committee meets regularly to conduct the oversight functions delegated to that Committee by the Board and reports its findings to the Board. The Board and each standing Committee
conduct annual assessments of their oversight function and structure. The Board has determined that the Boards leadership structure is appropriate because it allows the Board to exercise independent judgment over management and to allocate
areas of responsibility among Committees and the full Board to enhance effective oversight.  The Board has engaged the Manager
to manage each Portfolio on a day-to-day basis. The Board is responsible for overseeing the Manager, other service providers, the operations of each Portfolio and associated risks in accordance with the provisions of the Investment Company Act,
state law, other applicable laws, the Master LLCs charter, and each Portfolios investment objectives and strategies. The Board reviews, on an ongoing basis, each Portfolios performance, operations, and investment strategies and
techniques. The Board also conducts reviews of the Manager and its role in running the operations of each Portfolio. 
Day-to-day risk management with respect to each Portfolio is the responsibility of the Manager or of sub-advisers or other service
providers (depending on the nature of the risk), subject to the supervision of the Manager. Each Portfolio is subject to a number of risks, including investment, compliance, operational and valuation risks, among others. While

there are a number of risk management functions performed by the Manager and the sub-advisers or other service providers, as applicable, it is not possible to eliminate all of the risks
applicable to the Portfolios. Risk oversight forms part of the Boards general oversight of each Portfolio and is addressed as part of various Board and Committee activities. The Board, directly or through a Committee, also reviews reports
from, among others, management, the independent registered public accounting firm for each Portfolio, sub-advisers, and internal auditors for the investment adviser or its affiliates, as appropriate, regarding risks faced by each Portfolio and
managements or the service providers risk functions. The Committee system facilitates the timely and efficient consideration of matters by the Directors, and facilitates effective oversight of compliance with legal and regulatory
requirements and of each Portfolios activities and associated risks. The Board has appointed a Chief Compliance Officer, who oversees the implementation and testing of each Portfolios compliance program and reports to the Board regarding
compliance matters for the Portfolios and their service providers. The Independent Directors have engaged independent legal counsel to assist them in performing their oversight responsibilities. 
The members of the Audit Committee (the Audit Committee) are Kenneth L. Urish (Chair), Neil A. Cotty, Mark Stalnecker,
Claire A. Walton and Frederick W. Winter, all of whom are Independent Directors. The principal responsibilities of the Audit Committee are to approve, and recommend to the full Board for approval, the selection, retention, termination and
compensation of the Master LLCs independent registered public accounting firm (the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm) and to oversee the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firms work. The Audit
Committees responsibilities include, without limitation, to (1) evaluate the qualifications and independence of the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm; (2) approve all audit engagement terms and fees for each Portfolio;
(3) review the conduct and results of each independent audit of each Portfolios annual financial statements; (4) review any issues raised by the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm or Portfolio management regarding the
accounting or financial reporting policies and practices of each Portfolio and the internal controls of each Portfolio and certain service providers; (5) oversee the performance of each Portfolios Independent Registered Public Accounting
Firm; (6) review and discuss with management and each Portfolios Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm the performance and findings of each Portfolios internal auditors; (7) discuss with Portfolio management its
policies regarding risk assessment and risk management as such matters relate to the Portfolios financial reporting and controls; (8) resolve any disagreements between Portfolio management and the Independent Registered Public Accounting
Firm regarding financial reporting; and (9) undertake such other duties and responsibilities as may from time to time be delegated by the Board to the Audit Committee. The Board has adopted a written charter for the Audit Committee. During the
fiscal year ended April 30, 2016, the Audit Committee met four times.  The members of the Governance and Nominating
Committee (the Governance Committee) are Dr. Matina S. Horner (Chair), Susan J. Carter, Collette Chilton, Cynthia A. Montgomery and Robert C. Robb, Jr., all of whom are Independent Directors. The principal responsibilities of
the Governance Committee are to (1) identify individuals qualified to serve as Independent Directors of the Master LLC and recommend Independent Director nominees for election by shareholders or appointment by the Board; (2) advise the
Board with respect to Board composition, procedures and committees (other than the Audit Committee); (3) oversee periodic self-assessments of the Board and committees of the Board (other than the Audit Committee); (4) review and make
recommendations regarding Independent Director compensation; (5) monitor corporate governance matters and develop appropriate recommendations to the Board; (6) act as the administrative committee with respect to Board policies and
procedures, committee policies and procedures (other than the Audit Committee) and codes of ethics as they relate to Independent Directors; and (7) undertake such other duties and responsibilities as may from time to time be delegated by the
Board to the Governance Committee. The Governance Committee may consider nominations for the office of Director made by Portfolio shareholders as it deems appropriate. Portfolio shareholders who wish to recommend a nominee should send nominations to
the Secretary of the Master LLC that include biographical information and set forth the qualifications of the proposed nominee. The Board has adopted a written charter for the Governance Committee. During the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016,
the Governance Committee met four times.  The members of the Compliance Committee (the Compliance Committee) are
Joseph P. Platt (Chair), Neil A. Cotty, Cynthia A. Montgomery, Robert C. Robb, Jr., and Claire A. Walton, all of whom are Independent Directors. The Compliance Committees purpose is to assist the Board in fulfilling its
responsibility to oversee regulatory and fiduciary compliance matters involving the Master LLC, the fund-related activities of BlackRock and any sub-adviser and the Master LLCs third-party service providers. The Compliance Committees
responsibilities include, without limitation, to (1) oversee the compliance policies and procedures of the Master LLC and its service providers and recommend changes or additions to such policies and procedures; (2) review information on
and, where appropriate, recommend policies concerning each Funds compliance with applicable law; (3) review reports from, oversee the annual performance review of, and make certain recommendations and determinations regarding the Master
LLCs Chief Compliance Officer (the CCO), including determining the amount and structure of the CCOs compensation and recommending such amount and structure to the full Board for approval and ratification; and
(4) undertake such other duties and responsibilities as may from time to time be delegated by the Board to the Compliance Committee. The Board has adopted a written charter for the Compliance Committee. During the fiscal year ended
April 30, 2016, the Compliance Committee met four times.

The members of the Performance Oversight and Contract Committee (the Performance
Oversight Committee) are David O. Beim (Chair), Susan J. Carter, Collette Chilton, Mark Stalnecker and Frederick W. Winter, all of whom are Independent Directors. The Performance Oversight Committees purpose is to assist the
Board in fulfilling its responsibility to oversee each Portfolios investment performance relative to its agreed-upon performance objectives and to assist the Independent Directors in their consideration of investment advisory agreements. The
Performance Oversight Committees responsibilities include, without limitation, to (1) review information on, and make recommendations to the full Board in respect of, each Portfolios investment objectives, policies and practices;
(2) review information on each Portfolios investment performance; (3) review information on appropriate benchmarks and competitive universes and unusual or exceptional investment matters; (4) review personnel and other resources
devoted to management of each Portfolio and evaluate the nature and quality of information furnished to the Performance Oversight Committee; (5) recommend any required action regarding changes in fundamental and non-fundamental investment
policies and restrictions, portfolio mergers or liquidations; (6) request and review information on the nature, extent and quality of services provided to the shareholders; (7) make recommendations to the Board concerning the approval or
renewal of investment advisory agreements; and (8) undertake such other duties and responsibilities as may from time to time be delegated by the Board to the Performance Oversight Committee. The Board has adopted a written charter for the
Performance Oversight Committee. During the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016, the Performance Oversight Committee met four times.  The members of the Executive Committee (the Executive Committee) are Rodney D. Johnson (Chair) and Dr. Matina S. Horner, both of whom are Independent Directors, and Barbara G.
Novick, who serves as an interested Director. The principal responsibilities of the Executive Committee are to (1) act on routine matters between meetings of the Board; (2) act on such matters as may require urgent action between meetings
of the Board; and (3) exercise such other authority as may from time to time be delegated to the Executive Committee by the Board. The Board has adopted a written charter for the Executive Committee. During the fiscal year ended April 30,
2016, the Executive Committee held no formal meetings. The Executive Committee met informally numerous times throughout the fiscal year.  The Governance Committee has adopted a statement of policy that describes the experience, qualifications, skills and attributes that are necessary and desirable for potential Independent Director
candidates (the Statement of Policy). The Board believes that each Independent Director satisfied, at the time he or she was initially elected or appointed a Director, and continues to satisfy, the standards contemplated by the Statement
of Policy. Furthermore, in determining that a particular Independent Director was and continues to be qualified to serve as a Director, the Board has considered a variety of criteria, none of which, in isolation, was controlling. The Board believes
that, collectively, the Independent Directors have balanced and diverse experience, skills, attributes and qualifications, which allow the Board to operate effectively in governing the Master LLC and protecting the interests of shareholders. Among
the attributes common to all Independent Directors are their ability to review critically, evaluate, question and discuss information provided to them, to interact effectively with the Portfolios investment adviser, sub-advisers, other service
providers, counsel and the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm, and to exercise effective business judgment in the performance of their duties as Directors.  Each Directors ability to perform his or her duties effectively is evidenced by his or her educational background or professional training; business, consulting, public service or academic
positions; experience from service as a board member of the Master LLC and the other funds in the BlackRock Fund Complexes (and any predecessor funds), other investment funds, public companies, non-profit entities or other organizations; ongoing
commitment to and participation in Board and Committee meetings, as well as his or her leadership of standing and ad hoc committees throughout the years; or other relevant life experiences. 
The table below discusses some of the experiences, qualifications and skills of each of the Directors that support the conclusion that
each Director should serve (or continue to serve) on the Board.

 Independent Directors serve until their resignation, retirement, removal or death, or until December 31 of the year in which they turn 75. The
Board has determined to extend the terms of Independent Directors on a case-by-case basis, as appropriate. The Board has unanimously approved extending the mandatory retirement age for David O. Beim and Matina S. Horner until December 31, 2016,
which the Board believes is in the best interests of interestholders of the Portfolios.

Item 21.

Item 22.
Capital Stock and Other Securities.  The following information supplements and should be read in conjunction with Item 10(b) and Item 11 in the Master LLCs Part A. Under the limited liability company agreement, the Directors
are authorized to issue interests in the Master LLC. Upon liquidation of a Portfolio, Feeder Funds would be entitled to share in the assets of such Portfolio that are available for distribution in proportion to their investment in such Portfolio.
 Effective June 15, 2007, the Master LLC was organized as a Delaware limited liability company. Prior to June 15,
2007, the Master LLC was organized as a Delaware statutory business trust. Each Feeder Fund is entitled to a vote in proportion to its investment in the corresponding Portfolio. Each Feeder Fund will participate in the earnings, dividends and assets
of the corresponding Portfolio in accordance with its pro rata interest in the corresponding Portfolio. The Master LLC will not issue share certificates.  Each investor is entitled to a vote, with respect to matters affecting the Master LLC, in proportion to the amount of its investment in the Master LLC. Investors in the Master LLC do not have cumulative
voting rights, and investors holding more than 50% of the aggregate interests in the Master LLC may elect all of the Directors of the Master LLC if they choose to do so and in such event the other investors in the Master LLC would not be able to
elect any Directors. The Master LLC is not required to hold annual meetings of investors but the Master LLC will hold special meetings of investors when in the judgment of the Master LLCs Directors it is necessary or desirable to submit
matters for an investor vote. The Directors may elect to terminate the Master LLC without a vote of the interest holders.   


Item 23.
Purchase, Redemption and Pricing of Securities.  The following information supplements and should be read in conjunction with Item 11 and Item 12 in the Master LLCs Part A. 
(a) Purchase of Interests in the Master LLC. 
The principal asset of each of Premier Government Institutional Fund, Treasury Strategies Institutional Fund and
Select Treasury Strategies Institutional Fund is its interest in its corresponding Portfolio, which will be valued at its net asset value. The net asset value per share for purposes of pricing orders for both the purchase and the redemption of
Portfolio interests is determined daily on days that both the New York Stock Exchange (the Exchange) and the Federal Reserve banks are open for business, and the bond market is open for trading (business day). Currently, the
only scheduled days on which the Exchange is open and the Federal Reserve banks are closed are Columbus Day and Veterans Day. The only scheduled day on which the Federal Reserve banks are open and the Exchange is closed is Good Friday. On any
business day that the Exchange does not close early and/or the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) does not recommend that the securities markets close early, net asset value is determined as of 5:00 p.m.
(Eastern time) for Premier Government Institutional Portfolio and Treasury Strategies Institutional Portfolio. On any business day the Exchange closes early and/or SIFMA recommends an early close, the time for determination of net asset value of the
Portfolios will be 15 minutes following the time that each Portfolio determines, in its discretion, to cease accepting orders for purchases and redemptions of shares.1  The Portfolios reserve the right to advance the time for accepting purchase or redemption orders for same business day credit on any day when the Exchange, bond markets (as recommended by SIFMA) or the
Federal Reserve banks close early1, trading on the
Exchange is restricted, an emergency arises or as otherwise permitted by the Commission.   
 


1 
 For calendar years 2015-2016, SIFMA currently recommends an early close for the bond markets on the following dates: April 3, May 22,
November 27, December 24 and December 30, 2015 and March 24, May 27, July 1, November 25, December 23 and December 30, 2016. For calendar years 2015-2016, the Exchange will close early on November 27 and December 24, 2015 and
November 25, 2016. 
  B-16



Table of Contents
In addition, the Board may, for any business day, decide to change the time as of which a
Portfolios net asset value is calculated in response to new developments such as altered trading hours, or as otherwise permitted by the Commission.  In the event the Exchange does not open for business because of an emergency or other unanticipated event, the Portfolios may, but are not required to, open for purchase or redemption transactions if the
Federal Reserve wire payment system is open. To learn whether a Portfolio is open for business during an emergency or an unanticipated Exchange closing, please call (800) 225-1576. 
The net asset value of each Portfolio is determined pursuant to the amortized cost method, meaning that the calculation of the
Portfolios net asset value is based on a valuation of the portfolio securities held by the Portfolio at cost, and thereafter assuming a constant amortization to maturity of any discount or premium, regardless of the impact of fluctuating
interest rates on the market value of the security.  Interests in the Master LLC are issued solely in private placement
transactions that do not involve any public offering within the meaning of Section 4(a)(2) of the 1933 Act. Investments in the Master LLC may only be made by a limited number of institutional investors, including investment
companies, common or commingled trust funds, group trusts, and certain other accredited investors within the meaning of Regulation D under the 1933 Act. This Registration Statement does not constitute an offer to sell, or the
solicitation of an offer to buy, any security within the meaning of the 1933 Act.  There is no minimum initial or
subsequent investment in the Master LLC. However, because each Portfolio intends to be as fully invested at all times as is reasonably consistent with its investment objectives and policies in order to enhance the return on its assets, investments
by a Feeder Fund must be made in Federal funds (i.e., monies credited to the account of the Master LLCs custodian bank by a Federal Reserve Bank).  The Master LLC may reject any investment from any Feeder Fund or reject any investment order and suspend and resume the sale of any interest of any Portfolio at any time for any reason. 
A Feeder Fund may withdraw all or a portion of its investment in the corresponding Portfolio on any business day at the net asset value
next determined after a withdrawal request in proper form is furnished by the Feeder Fund to the Master LLC. Interests will normally be redeemed for cash upon receipt of a request in proper form, although the Master LLC retains the right to redeem
some or all of its interests in-kind under unusual circumstances, in order to protect the interests of remaining interestholders or to accommodate a request by a particular interestholder that does not adversely affect the interest of the remaining
interestholders, by delivery of securities selected from the Master LLCs assets at its discretion. In-kind payment means payment will be made in portfolio securities rather than cash. If this occurs, the redeeming interestholder might incur
brokerage or other transaction costs to convert the securities to cash. The Master LLC has elected, however, to be governed by Rule 18f-1 under the Investment Company Act so that the Master LLC is obligated to redeem its interests solely in cash up
to the lesser of $250,000 or 1% of its net asset value during any 90-day period for any interestholder of the Master LLC. The redemption price is the net asset value per share next determined after the initial receipt of proper notice of redemption.
 The Master LLC will make payment for all interests redeemed within seven days after receipt by the Master LLC of a redemption
request in proper form, except as provided by the rules of the Commission. The right of a Feeder Fund to receive payment with respect to any withdrawal may be suspended or the payment of the withdrawal proceeds may be delayed during any period in
which both the Exchange and the Federal Reserve are closed (other than weekends or holidays) or trading on the Exchange is restricted, or, to the extent otherwise permitted by the Investment Company Act, if an emergency exists. Investments in the
Master LLC may not be transferred without the prior written consent of all Directors and all remaining interestholders.

Item 24.
Taxation of the Master LLC.  The Master LLC is organized as a Delaware limited liability company. Under the anticipated method of operation of the series, each Portfolio will be treated for Federal income tax purposes as a separate
entity that will have the status of a partnership pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 301.7701-3(b)(1), or if it has only one Feeder Fund, as an entity the existence of which separate from its Feeder Fund is disregarded for Federal income
tax purposes. Thus, none of the Portfolios will be subject to any Federal income tax. Based on the status of each Portfolio as a partnership or disregarded entity, each investor in a Portfolio will include in its gross income its share (as
determined in accordance with the governing instruments of the Portfolio) of such Portfolios ordinary income, capital gains, losses, deductions and credits in determining its Federal income tax liability. The determination of such share will
be made in accordance with the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code) and Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder.  The Master LLCs taxable year-end is April 30. Although the Portfolios will not be subject to Federal income tax, they will file appropriate Federal income tax returns. 
It is intended that each Portfolios assets, income and distributions will be managed in such a way that an investor in the
Portfolio will be able to satisfy the requirements of Subchapter M of the Code for qualification as a regulated investment company (RIC), assuming that the investor invested all of its investable assets in the Portfolio. Any prospective
Feeder Fund which is a RIC agrees that, for purposes of determining its required distribution under Code Section 4982(a), it will account for its share of items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit of the corresponding Portfolio as they
are taken into account by the Portfolio.  Each Portfolio is to be managed in compliance with the provisions of the Code
applicable to RICs as though such requirements were applied at the Portfolio level. Thus, consistent with its investment objectives, each Portfolio will meet the income and diversification of assets tests of the Code applicable to RICs. 
Certain transactions and investments of a Portfolio are subject to special tax rules of the Code that may, among other consequences
(a) affect the character of realized gains and losses, (b) disallow, suspend or otherwise limit the allowance of certain losses or deductions, or (c) accelerate the recognition of income without a corresponding receipt of cash with
which to make distributions necessary to satisfy the distribution requirements applicable to RICs. Operation of these rules could affect the character, amount and timing of income and of distributions to the Feeder Funds. Special tax rules also
require a Portfolio to mark to market certain types of positions in its portfolio (i.e., treat them as sold on the last day of the taxable year) and may result in the recognition of income without a corresponding receipt of cash. Each Portfolio
intends to monitor transactions, make appropriate tax elections and make appropriate entries in its books and records to reduce the effect of these tax rules and avoid disqualifying the Feeder Fund as a RIC under the Code. 
A Portfolio that invests in obligations of non-U.S. issuers, such as Premier Institutional Portfolio and Institutional Portfolio, may be
subject to taxes imposed on interest income paid by non-U.S. issuers and withheld at the source. The United States has entered into tax treaties with many foreign countries that may entitle a Portfolio to a reduced rate of tax or an exemption from
tax on such income. It is impossible to determine in advance the effective rate of foreign tax because the amount of assets to be invested in foreign countries is not known.  The Code requires a RIC to pay a nondeductible 4% excise tax to the extent that the RIC does not distribute during each calendar year 98% of its ordinary income, determined on a calendar year basis, and
98.2% of its net capital gain, determined, in general, on an October 31 year-end basis plus certain undistributed amounts from previous years. Each Portfolio intends to distribute its income and capital gains to its RIC investors so as to
enable such RICs to minimize imposition of the 4% excise tax. There can be no assurance that sufficient amounts of a Portfolios taxable income and capital gains will be distributed to avoid entirely the imposition of the tax on RIC investors.
In such event, a RIC investor will be liable for the tax only on the amount by which it does not meet the foregoing distribution requirements.  A 30% withholding tax is currently imposed on U.S.-source dividends, interest and other income items, and will be imposed on proceeds from the sale, redemption or other disposition of property producing
U.S.-source dividends and interest paid after December 31, 2018, to (i) foreign financial institutions, including non-U.S. investment funds, unless they agree to collect and disclose to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. account holders and (ii) certain other foreign entities, unless they certify certain information regarding their direct and indirect U.S. owners. To avoid withholding, foreign financial
institutions will need to (i) enter into agreements with the IRS that state that they will provide the IRS information, including the names, addresses and taxpayer identification numbers of direct and indirect U.S. account holders, comply with
due diligence procedures with respect to the identification of U.S. accounts, report to the IRS certain information with respect to U.S. accounts, agree to withhold tax on certain payments made to non-compliant foreign financial institutions or to
account holders that fail to provide the required information, and determine certain other information concerning their account holders, or (ii) in the event that an

applicable intergovernmental agreement and implementing legislation are adopted, provide local revenue authorities with similar account holder information. Other foreign entities will need to
either provide the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of each substantial U.S. owner or certifications of no substantial U.S. ownership unless certain exceptions apply.  Investors are advised to consult their own tax advisers as to the tax consequences of an investment in the Master LLC.

Item 29.
Persons Controlled by or Under Common Control with The Master LLC. 
Other than as described in Item 18, the Registrant does not control and is not under common control with any other person.
  


Item 30.
Indemnification.  Reference is made to Sections 17(h) and (i) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act) and pursuant to Sections 8.2, 8.3 and 8.4, of Article VIII of
the Registrants Limited Liability Agreement (the LLC Agreement) (Exhibit 1(b) to this Registration Statement), Directors, officers, employees and agents of the Master LLC will be indemnified to the maximum extent permitted by
Delaware law and the Investment Company Act.  Article VIII, Section 8.1 provides, inter alia, that no Director, officer,
employee or agent of the Registrant shall be liable to the Registrant, its Holders, or to any other Director, officer, employee or agent thereof for any action or failure to act (including, without limitation, the failure to compel in any way any
former or acting Director to redress any breach of trust) except for his own bad faith, willful misfeasance, gross negligence or reckless disregard of his duties.  Article VIII, Section 8.2 of the Registrants LLC Agreement provides: 
The Company shall indemnify each of its Directors, officers, employees and agents (including persons who serve at its request as
directors, officers or trustees of another organization in which it has any interest, as a shareholder, creditor or otherwise) against all liabilities and expenses (including amounts paid in satisfaction of judgments, in compromise, as fines and
penalties, and as counsel fees) reasonably incurred by him in connection with the defense or disposition of any action, suit or other proceeding, whether civil or criminal, in which he may be involved or with which he may be threatened, while in
office or thereafter, by reason of his being or having been such a Director, officer, employee or agent, except with respect to any matter as to which he shall have been adjudicated to have acted in bad faith, willful misfeasance, gross negligence
or reckless disregard of his duties; provided, however, that as to any matter disposed of by a compromise payment by such Person, pursuant to a consent decree or otherwise, no indemnification either for said payment or for any other expenses shall
be provided unless there has been a determination that such Person did not engage in willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of his office by the court or other body approving the
settlement or other disposition or, in the absence of a judicial determination, by a reasonable determination, based upon a review of readily available facts (as opposed to a full trial-type inquiry), that he did not engage in such conduct, which
determination shall be made by a majority of a quorum of Directors who are neither Interested Persons of the Company nor parties to the action, suit or proceeding, or by written opinion from independent legal counsel approved by the Directors. The
rights accruing to any Person under these provisions shall not exclude any other right to which he may be lawfully entitled; provided that no Person may satisfy any right of indemnity or reimbursement granted herein or to which he may be otherwise
entitled except out of the Company Property. The Directors may make advance payments in connection with indemnification under this Section 8.2; provided that any advance payment of expenses by the Company to any Director, officer, employee or
agent shall be made only upon the undertaking by such Director, officer, employee or agent to repay the advance unless it is ultimately determined that he is entitled to indemnification as above provided, and only if one of the following conditions
is met:  (a) the Director, officer, employee or agent to be indemnified provides a security for his
undertaking; or 
  C-2

(b) the Company shall be insured against losses arising by reason of any
lawful advances; or  (c) there is a determination, based on a review of readily available facts, that there is
reason to believe that the Director, officer, employee or agent to be indemnified ultimately will be entitled to indemnification, which determination shall be made by: 
(i) a majority of a quorum of Directors who are neither Interested Persons of the Company nor parties to the Proceedings;
or  (ii) an independent legal counsel in a written opinion. 
Article VIII, Section 8.3 of the Registrants LLC Agreement further provides: 
Nothing contained in Sections 8.1 or 8.2 hereof shall protect any Director or officer of the Company from any liability to the Company or
its Holders to which he would otherwise be subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of his office. Nothing contained in Sections 8.1 or 8.2 hereof or in any
agreement of the character described in Section 4.1 or 4.2 hereof shall protect any Investment Adviser to the Company against any liability to the Company to which he would otherwise be subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith or
gross negligence in the performance of his or its duties to the Company, or by reason of his or its reckless disregard to his or its obligations and duties under the agreement pursuant to which he serves as Investment Adviser to the Company.
 As permitted by Article VIII, Section 8.6, the Registrant may insure its Directors and officers against certain
liabilities, and certain costs of defending claims against such Directors and officers, to the extent such Directors and officers are not found to have committed conduct constituting conflict of interest, intentional non-compliance with statutes or
regulations or dishonest, fraudulent or criminal acts or omissions. The Registrant will purchase an insurance policy to cover such indemnification obligation. The insurance policy also will insure the Registrant against the cost of indemnification
payments to Directors and officers under certain circumstances. Insurance will not be purchased that protects, or purports to protect, any Director or officer from liability to which he would otherwise be subject by reason of willful misfeasance,
bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of duty.  The Registrant hereby undertakes that it will apply the
indemnification provisions of its LLC Agreement and By-Laws in a manner consistent with Release No. 11330 of the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Investment Company Act so long as the interpretation of Sections 17(h) and 17(i) of
such Act remain in effect and are consistently applied.   


Item 31.
