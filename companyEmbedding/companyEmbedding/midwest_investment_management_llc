Our approach

Leaders of small and mid-sized businesses have multiple roles and competing priorities. You want a best-in-class retirement plan but may be unsure about all the complexities and requirements. You may be uncertain about the costs and fees involved. You need a provider focused solely on retirement and aligned with your needs and goals—and fully committed to you, your participants, and the ongoing improvement of retirement investing.

Vanguard is committed to the retirement business and is a leader in the retirement plan industry. Best of all, you can benefit from Vanguard's unique ownership structure: We're owned by our clients and not by outside investors or stockholders. That means you never need to question whose interests come first for us. This approach serves as a foundation for all that we do with Vanguard Retirement Plan Access™, our 401(k) offer for small and mid-sized plans. You can count on our expertise to remove the uncertainties from managing your plan and our leadership to help you offer a strong plan for your participants. 



Key benefits




You can:

Have confidence in your plan.
Understand your costs.
Focus on your business.





Cost-conscious?
As a business owner and plan fiduciary, you want to eliminate ambiguity in retirement plan costs. Research has shown that plan costs for the smaller end of the market tend to be higher, and you need a retirement plan provider that not only provides transparent pricing but has a fair and reasonable cost structure.1
With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access:

You receive an All-in Fee Report that shows the total cost of your plan.
You have access to low-cost Vanguard index funds, plus the opportunity to choose from among more than 12,000 non-Vanguard funds.
Your annual recordkeeping price is based on a per-participant fee—a fee that doesn't jump as your assets grow, as with many small to mid-sized retirement plans.
You have flexibility in how you cover your plan costs—including a recordkeeping credit depending on the share class selected.




Too busy?
 As a business owner, you're pressed for time and focused on many aspects of business. With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access, you can rely on high-quality recordkeeping and administration to ease your administrative burden and help your employees stay on track for retirement.

Midwest Investment Management | 401(k) Asset Management | Financial Advisor | Cleveland, Ohio - Home



























































Your Financial Advisor...



Midwest Investment Management is an independent, registered investment advisory firm based in Cleveland Ohio, serving individuals, 
            company retirement plans and 401(k) plans.
We believe that your financial advisor should be objective and 
            unbiased. Since we are not affiliated with any bank, brokerage firm 
            or insurance company, our firm provides independent 
            investment management services meeting your financial goals. 

The Partners of Midwest Investment Management
Seated (L-R) Norman F. Klopp, CFA, Meg E. Halloran, Keith A. Vargo, CFA
Standing (L-R) Elmer L. (Al) Meszaros, CFA, Robert J. Yaroma
Because every client’s investment management and asset management 
            goals are unique, our financial advisors do not offer off the shelf 
            “solutions” for your personal portfolio, 401(k) plan, trust, estate or 
            charitable account; instead we will meet with you, your accountant 
            and/or attorney to develop and implement a portfolio management and 
            asset management strategy suited to your individual needs, goals and 
            tax structure.
We will develop a portfolio that may include equities, fixed 
            income investments, mutual funds or perhaps all of those 
            vehicles—all under the watchful guidance of our experienced 
            portfolio managers.
As a client of Midwest Investment Management, we will work with you to develop an investment plan tailored to your specific needs. Your 
            financial advisor will maintain ongoing direct contact with you and 
            work toward establishing a trusted and long lasting relationship 
            with you.
Our portfolio management professionals have over 150 combined years of experience working with individuals, 401(k) plans, trust, estate and charitable trusts, throughout various investment and economic cycles. They are experienced professionals.


We invite you to learn about all the advantages a professional investment manager offers, by reviewing the information and data presented in this site. Then if you feel we are right for you, respond to any of our partners via e-mail or telephone.
Thank you

Managing Director



Peter A. Vanden Broeck Managing Director

Peter A. Vanden Broeck joined Midwest Investment Management LLC as Managing Director in May 2013. His career spans more than 30 years and includes investment and portfolio management roles with several major Wall Street investment advisory and brokerage firms.   


He is an experienced portfolio manager, known for his strong commitment to intensive equity research on behalf of his clients. 


“At Midwest Investment Management,” said Mr. Vanden Broeck, “I collaborate with like-minded people who view fundamental security analysis as the foundation for stock selection.   We also share the view that owning stocks represents the partial ownership of a business.”

“In fact,” Mr. Vanden Broeck added, “we pride ourselves on owning the same investments as our clients.  It raises the threshold of examination.”

“We generate new investment ideas by spending countless hours reading periodicals, company filings, and other materials, resulting in detailed analysis and disciplined valuations,” Mr. Vanden Broeck noted.  “We identify facts that we really need to know, and stick to companies whose economics we understand.”

Mr. Vanden Broeck holds a BA in Economics from Macalaster College in St. Paul, Minnesota and has completed additional course work at The University of Paris-Sorbonne.  He is a trustee of the Ratner School in Pepper Pike and past treasurer of the Shaker Lakes Nature Center. He resides with his family in Shaker Heights.

Midwest Investment Management - Cleveland, Ohio - Portfolio Management and Investment Advice - Strategy



























































Investment Strategy



A choice of investment strategies for long-term results
At Midwest Investment Management, we know that everyone�s investment needs are different.  And so, we consider the client’s age, investment objectives, income requirements, tolerance for risk, and other factors.
Also, unlike some investment advisors, we never recommend commission-based, “off the shelf,” or pre-packaged investment products.   Instead, our portfolio managers and research analysts use their extensive experience to develop a client portfolio that is positioned for long-term growth of capital through a process of careful evaluation and selection of individual stocks, bonds, mutual funds, or other securities.


Elmer L. Meszaros
Partner

Our proprietary Large-Cap Core Portfolio™ serves as the foundation for most client portfolios.  This portfolio contains carefully selected, high quality, dividend-paying stocks of profitable “blue-chip” corporations, most of which are based in the U.S.  This portfolio, which offers a conservative and tax-efficient approach to equity investing, periodically includes a position in bonds, when prudent.
All equity holdings in the Large-Cap Core Portfolio™  meet our stringent standards for quality and are subject to time-consuming analysis before they are purchased for our clients.  Our disciplined equity research process includes discussions with corporate CEOs, CFOs, or other senior-level managers of companies whose stocks are held in client portfolios.
Our approach generates a portfolio of stocks that, on average, usually have the following characteristics compared to the Standard and Poors 500 and Russell Top 200 Indices:

Higher historic earnings growth, as measured by 5-year-earnings-per-share growth rates.
									Provide a comparable level of dividend yield;
									Are more profitable than the aggregate S&P 500 Index, as measured by return on equity.
									A lower price/earnings ratio.

Welcome to Midwest Family Wealth Management
Focused on providing premiere financial service, Midwest Family Wealth Management was founded on two guiding principles:
Deliver trusted advice with exceptional serviceConfirm our clients understand what they own and why they own it 
By partnering with LPL Financial, the nation�s largest independent broker dealer, (as reported by Financial Planning magazine, June 1996-2011, based on total revenue.), we are able to provide unbiased advice and a wide array of products and services to meet our client�s financial needs and avoid the questions and complications of proprietary products often found at many of the large brokerage firms.


Retirement Planning

Through our process we help our clients plan for a lifetime income stream that they will need in order to live the life they desire during retirement. This analysis involves clarifying an optimal retirement age and addressing strategies to overcome shortages, as well as planning for the proper distribution and management of surpluses.



Investment Management

At Midwest Family Wealth Management we provide a disciplined investment management process that delivers an institutional approach and process to retail investors. By increasing diversification to non-traditional and alternative asset classes, which are negatively correlated to the broader US markets, we are able to help you mitigate risk and decrease market volatility for your portfolio.No strategy assures success or protects against loss

Our approach

Leaders of small and mid-sized businesses have multiple roles and competing priorities. You want a best-in-class retirement plan but may be unsure about all the complexities and requirements. You may be uncertain about the costs and fees involved. You need a provider focused solely on retirement and aligned with your needs and goals—and fully committed to you, your participants, and the ongoing improvement of retirement investing.

Vanguard is committed to the retirement business and is a leader in the retirement plan industry. Best of all, you can benefit from Vanguard's unique ownership structure: We're owned by our clients and not by outside investors or stockholders. That means you never need to question whose interests come first for us. This approach serves as a foundation for all that we do with Vanguard Retirement Plan Access™, our 401(k) offer for small and mid-sized plans. You can count on our expertise to remove the uncertainties from managing your plan and our leadership to help you offer a strong plan for your participants. 



Key benefits




You can:

Have confidence in your plan.
Understand your costs.
Focus on your business.





Cost-conscious?
As a business owner and plan fiduciary, you want to eliminate ambiguity in retirement plan costs. Research has shown that plan costs for the smaller end of the market tend to be higher, and you need a retirement plan provider that not only provides transparent pricing but has a fair and reasonable cost structure.1
With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access:

You receive an All-in Fee Report that shows the total cost of your plan.
You have access to low-cost Vanguard index funds, plus the opportunity to choose from among more than 12,000 non-Vanguard funds.
Your annual recordkeeping price is based on a per-participant fee—a fee that doesn't jump as your assets grow, as with many small to mid-sized retirement plans.
You have flexibility in how you cover your plan costs—including a recordkeeping credit depending on the share class selected.




Too busy?
 As a business owner, you're pressed for time and focused on many aspects of business. With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access, you can rely on high-quality recordkeeping and administration to ease your administrative burden and help your employees stay on track for retirement.

Investment Management
Insights, Strategies and Solutions
Our experienced professionals have expertise in a broad spectrum of traditional, alternative and non-financial assets.  We can work with you to develop and manage a portfolio tailored to your needs.






Portfolio Consulting
A collaborative dialogue with your portfolio manager
Your portfolio manager is a key member of your U.S. Trust relationship team and serves as your personal "chief investment officer." He or she will work with you to create an Investment Policy Statement, which serves as a blueprint for your portfolio by documenting your:

Objectives
Risk tolerance
Cash flow needs
 Tax situation
Wealth aspirations

Your portfolio manager's ongoing role is to incorporate our best strategic and tactical thinking, most relevant research analysis, current market insights and appropriate investment solutions into your portfolio. He or she will regularly monitor your portfolio to make sure it conforms to your Investment Policy Statement, which will be updated whenever there are significant changes in your life or goals.
Asset management
A more complete approach to asset allocation1
We analyze a wide range of asset classes, including hedge and private equity funds2 and global investment opportunities, as potential components of an asset allocation. In addition, we believe that true diversification requires managing for cash flows across and within asset classes in various market environments — not simply allocating according to a grid.
Your asset allocation will be based on the long-term expectations established for each asset class by our most senior investment professionals. Over the shorter term, however, your portfolio manager can adjust your portfolio tactically in response to emerging opportunities and risks, and reflecting U.S. Trust insights about trends and themes relevant to you.
How you own your assets — personally or in trusts; in taxable or tax-exempt solutions — can have a material impact on the overall performance of your portfolio. At U.S. Trust we focus on this wealth structuring aspect of your portfolio in conjunction with managing the assets themselves.
Alternative Investments
SOPHISTICATED SOLUTIONS TO MEET YOUR NEEDS2
Alternative investments at U.S. Trust focus on non-traditional assets such as:

Hedge funds
Private equity
Real estate and tangible assets

Because performance is often differentiated from equity and fixed income markets, alternative investments may be an ideal complement to traditional investments. 
Through our access to the industry's premier managers, we are able to offer solutions that provide options for all client segments. And we support you every step of the way with knowledge built on our experience in alternatives, including industry-leading research, rigorous due diligence, and cutting-edge portfolio construction.
Drawing from the experience, resources and expertise of the firm, you and your portfolio manager can explore alternative investments that can help you pursue what matters most to you.
Specialty asset management
Expertise in nonfinancial assets3
Specialty asset management at U.S. Trust focuses on nonfinancial assets such as:

Farm and ranch land
Timberland
Oil and gas properties
Private businesses
Real estate

Our Specialty Asset Management team can work with your portfolio manager and wealth strategist, as appropriate, to integrate these real assets into your overall plan and portfolio.
We can help you realize your objectives with assets you already own, or help you acquire specific assets to take advantage of their capital growth and diversification potential — whether you own these assets outright or they are held in trust.
Our team of specialists can provide complete turnkey services including identifying and purchasing real property and providing ongoing management.
Capital markets
Sophisticated market-linked solutions4
Through our access to the resources of Merrill Lynch, one of the world's leading capital markets participants, we can tailor approaches to risks and opportunities in the foreign exchange, interest rate, commodity and equity markets. Derivative-based transactions target the risks you seek to hedge, and are designed to dovetail with your overall portfolio and wealth management strategies.

1 Asset allocation and diversification do not ensure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets.
2 Alternative Investments such as derivatives, hedge funds, private equity funds, and funds of funds can result in higher return potential but also higher loss potential. Changes in economic conditions or other circumstances may adversely affect your investments. Before you invest in alternative investments, you should consider your overall financial situation, how much money you have to invest, your need for liquidity, and your tolerance for risk. Alternative investments are speculative and involve a high degree of risk.
3 Nonfinancial assets, such as closely-held businesses, real estate, oil, gas and mineral properties, and timber, farm and ranch land, are complex in nature and involve risks including total loss of value.  Special risk considerations include natural events (for example, earthquakes or fires), complex tax considerations, and lack of liquidity.  Nonfinancial assets are not suitable for all investors.  Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager, and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax, or estate planning strategy.
4 Brokerage services are provided by Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, a registered broker-dealer, Member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation.
Certain U.S. Trust associates are registered representatives with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated ("MLPF&S") and may assist you with investment products and services provided through MLPF&S and other nonbank investment affiliates. MLPF&S is a registered broker-dealer, member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation ("BofA Corp.").

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
