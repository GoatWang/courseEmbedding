Features


Power









Powered by a rugged Kubota 23HP engine, renowned worldwide for their exceptional reliability and durability.
Features 2 range hydrostatic transmission as standard. Equipped with twin operating pedals to offer exceptional handling with frequent changes of speed and direction.
Hydraulic power steering offers effortless control to reduce operator fatigue.






Design









With an overall length similar to a standard garden tractor, the BX25D is easy to drive and offers smooth operation even in the tightest spaces. Due to it’s compact size, the BX25D is also incredibly gentle on turf.
Rugged and sturdy 4-wheel drive (4WD) provides powerful traction for heavy duty front loader work and operating other implements.
Choice of turf, bar or industrial tyres.






Versatility









A front 4-position valve lets you quickly and easily attach a front loader and other front-mounted implements. The valve is easy to access but won’t obstruct or impair the tractor’s clean and sleek look.
Optional sturdy, hydraulically controlled category I 3-point hitch that allows you to attach a wide array of rear implements.
Towing hitch as standard.
Features folding ROPS frame and seat belt as standard.
Halogen headlights provide clear and bright illumination when working and traveling at night.






Comfort









Operator comfort has been enhanced by a new, fully flat deck layout with the brake on the left side, providing more room for the feet. The new design also improves operability.
High back seat comes as standard providing soft cushioning and superior thigh support for exceptional comfort during operation. Includes a luxurious reclining feature that can be adjusted to suit your natural posture.
New control panel design enhances operability by placing all vital indicators on a single, easy to read panel. The new panel features a tachometer on the left and an LCD display for fuel level and coolant temperature on the right. Warning indicators for battery, headlights, turn signal, and low fuel are in the middle. With just a single glance, you get a complete picture of the tractor’s functions.
Cruise Control automatically maintains a constant speed, letting you take your foot off the forward pedal. It’s the easy way to mow large areas or travel long distances.
Features large angled lever guides for hassle free shifting, fast control lever recognition and easy operation.
All controls and indicators are neatly placed for quick, easy and user-friendly access.






Mower Deck









3-blade mower offers a wide cutting area, allowing you to cut more grass in a single pass. The 54”or 60″ Kubota deck is ideal for the BX25D.
The BX25D shaft drive delivers power smoothly from the mid-PTO to the mid-mount mower. Unlike belt drives, there is no slippage and maintenance is minimal.
A simple twist of the dial adjusts the mower height in ¼” increments to your desired cutting level.

Infinite mechanical cruise control lever keeps speed constant and controlled.
Sleek and slanted hood provides a greater field of vision. Visibility is also enhanced with new multiple headlamps when in dark and inclement weather conditions. The one-piece front hood can be fully opened for easier access to the engine to make routine inspections and maintenance a breeze.

Productivity









4-wheel drive models come equipped with a smooth, easy-turn, integral power steering.
An ample 38-litre fuel tank lets you fill up with more fuel so you can operate for longer.






Front End Loader









LA524 Front Loader with curved boom design is specially designed to handle the big tasks, providing improved lifting power and height as well as exceptional durability.Optional with this model.
Single-lever joystick provides easier operation. A regenerative dump circuit allows for fast bucket dumping, and the series circuit provides simultaneous operation of the boom and bucket. The valve stays with the tractor when the loader is detached, so that the valve can be used for other implement operations.
This feature allows the operator to raise or lower the loader boom while keeping the bucket level to the ground. This will help prevent spills when carrying soil or sand and will make pallet handling smooth and easy.
Thanks to Kubota’s innovative attaching/detaching system, you can attach and detach mounting pins and As a result, you can move from job to job with greater efficiency. Boom-mounted loader stands make access easy and allow the loader to stand alone when detached.






Backhoe








BH77 Backhoe is performance-matched with the L3800 to deliver more power and greater capacity. And, thanks to the full-flat deck, the backhoe delivers optimal legroom for maximum operator comfort.
The new curved boom offers greater digging capacity as well as easier operation and better visibility.
All of the hoses are tucked away in the backhoe arm for enhanced protection and a streamlined design.
BH77’s quick attach/ detach mounting system makes attaching and detaching the backhoe a snap so you can quickly move on to your next job.
