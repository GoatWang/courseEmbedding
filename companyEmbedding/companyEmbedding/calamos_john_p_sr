Good day and welcome to the Calamos Asset Management, Inc. Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Call. Today’s conference is being recorded. Please now listen to the following disclosure.
Jennifer McGuffin
Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and may differ materially from actual performance and results. Please see the forward-looking information and Risk Factors sections in our periodic report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Non-GAAP financial measures help enhance an overall understanding of our financial results and facilitate comparisons of historical results. Please see the appendix for a reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures.
I would now like to turn over the call to John Calamos, Sr.
John P. Calamos, Sr.
Good afternoon and thank you for joining us on the Calamos Asset Management third quarter 2013 earnings call. Joining me today’s call is Nimish Bhatt, our Chief Financial Officer; also in the room is Christian Helmetag, our Corporate Controller. I will start the presentation with a business update, financial highlights and asset flows. Nimish will provide additional detail with respect to our financial results. And I will then conclude the formal part of the presentation and we’ll open the call to questions.
On Slide 4, we begin with the snapshot of our total assets, which were $27.5 billion as of September 30. The charts here show the total asset mix by strategy and by product category. As you can see on the left, equity represents 35%, lower-volatility equity is 22%, followed by enhanced fixed income at 12%. The next largest allocation is in our alternative strategies at 11%, followed by total return, convertible, high yield and fixed income. By product category, 50% of our total asset mix is in the open-ended funds followed by 22% in closed-end funds, 14% in our institutional strategies and 7% in managed accounts.
On Slide 5, we breakdown the some of the important developments for the quarter. Total assets increased from $20.6 billion to $27.5 billion, driven by market appreciation, offset by slower outflows. We experienced net outflows of $980 million for the quarter versus $2.3 billion last quarter. Flows are moving in the right direction and we are encouraged by this positive trend. We also saw positive flows of $264 million into our alternative strategies. We view these strategies as contributors to our growth going forward, as investors look to alternatives to invest in instead of bonds.
Our investment performance continues to improve in our growth strategies due to a number of factors including our more optimistic top down view, sector repositioning and significant additions to the talent within our Investment Team. We regularly evaluate our products to meet the evolving needs of our clients. We launched two new funds this quarter; the Calamos Dividend Growth Fund and the Calamos Mid Cap Growth Fund. We also reopened our flagship Calamos Convertible Fund, and the Calamos Evolving World Growth Fund marked its five-year anniversary.
This quarter, we enhanced our existing Investment Team resources, including two additional co-portfolio managers for fixed income and high yield. The company continues its commitment to maintain a strong balance sheet. Also Calamos Investments LLC repurchased 904,350 shares of Class A common stock for a total of $9.7 million during the first nine months of the year as part of our corporate share repurchase program. The repurchase program primarily allows the company to offset the dilution from the share issuance under our incentive comp program.

On Slide 6, you’ll see further detail regarding our asset flows. Our total assets increased by 3% during the quarter, driven by $1.8 billion in market appreciation, primarily from equity and lower-volatility equity strategies. That appreciation was partially offset by the $980 million in outflows as we detailed in the previous slide. The company’s funds experienced net outflows of $612 million, compared to $1.3 billion from the second quarter, while separate accounts had $368 million in net outflows for the quarter, compared to $981 million from the second quarter.
The net outflows stem primarily from our U.S. growth strategy, lower-volatility equity strategies, while net inflows were seen in our alternative strategies this quarter. Overall, the rate of outflows for the quarter has slowed significantly from the previous quarter. Again, we are very pleased to see the positive trends as we focus our attention on investment performance.
On Slide 7, I’d like to share some of the financial highlights for the quarter. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.20 for the third quarter, compared to $0.22 in the second quarter and $0.31 in the third quarter of 2012. Revenues for the period were $65 million, with $15.4 million in operating income and an operating margin of 23.7%.
Included in the third quarter operating expenses is a one-time employee related charge of approximately $900,000. Operating margin would have been 25.1% for the third quarter excluding this one-time item. The decrease in average total assets was primary driver of the decrease in total revenues, our margin and our non-GAAP earnings per share.
With that, I’d like to turn it over to Nimish now, who will provide greater detail on the financials including our non-GAAP results. Nimish?
Nimish S. Bhatt
Thank you, John. On Slide 9, we present GAAP and non-GAAP results, which provide additional transparency in evaluating the core operations of our asset management business. As John previously mentioned, for the third quarter, non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.20, compared to $0.22 from the second quarter and $0.31 from the same period last year. The decrease in non-GAAP earnings per share is attributable to the decrease in management fee revenues, as we have experienced a decline in average assets under management during the last year.
GAAP earnings per share was $0.13 for the quarter, compared to $0.09 from the second quarter and $0.23 from the same period last year. As noted on our second quarter earnings call, GAAP earnings per share was negatively impacted by two items, an increase in tax valuation allowance and a non-operating charge for other-than-temporary impairment, which had combined $0.07 per share negative impact on GAAP earnings in the second quarter. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share is included in the appendix to this presentation.
Slide 10 provides a graphical presentation of our revenues and operating income. Total revenues for the third quarter were $65 million, compared to $66.7 million from the second quarter, and $81.8 million from the same quarter year ago. Management fee revenues were $51.3 million for the quarter. The decrease in management fee revenues was principally driven by declines in average total assets.
For the third quarter, operating income of $15.4 million was down $3 million from the second quarter, due to lower revenues and an increase in operating expenses. Operating margin of 23.7% also decreased due to combination of lower revenues and higher operating expenses. We may continue to see pressure on the operating margin as we complete the build-out of our Investment Team. However, at the same time, we are focused on improving investment performance and flows, which we believe will ultimately increase management fee revenue for the company.

On Slide 11, we show operating expenses presented by expense type. Compensation expense for the third quarter was $23.5 million, compared to $21.4 million for the second quarter, and $19.8 million for the same quarter a year ago. As John mentioned, included in the third quarter compensation expense is a one-time employee related expense of approximately $900,000.
Excluding this item, the remaining increase in compensation expense compared to the same quarter a year ago is largely attributable to the costs associated with resource additions we have made to the Investment Team. Distribution expenses were lower compared to the previous periods presented mainly due to lower open-end fund assets. Marketing and sales promotion expenses were slightly higher than last quarter mainly due to increased seminar and broker sales expenses. However, they are slightly lower than the same quarter a year ago.
G&A expenses were lower than the second quarter and the same quarter a year ago, as we continue to look for opportunities to reduce overhead expenses. Primary drivers for the lower G&A expenses include lower outsourcing expenses as well as lower legal and other professional fees.
Slide 12 summarizes the company’s non-operating activities. We recorded net investment income of $6.8 million for the third quarter, compared to $2.1 million in the second quarter and $4.2 million from the same quarter last year. As noted on last quarter’s earnings call, we recorded an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $4.4 million or $0.03 per share in the second quarter, which negatively impacted investment income.
On Slide 13, you will see our liquid investments consist of cash and investments totaling $513 million, compared to $92 million of outstanding debt as of September 30, 2013. These balances represent the consolidated strength of our organization. We feel these levels of liquidity support our ongoing business operations, allows to provide seed capital for new funds, provide conservative levels of capital for the company’s regulated subsidiaries, fund the company’s share repurchase program and invest in other corporate strategic initiatives.
Slide 14 shows our dividends, payout ratio and yield for the three years and trailing 12 months. The $0.49 per share we have paid during last 12 months represent an 81% payout ratio on our trailing 12 months GAAP earnings. Our dividend yield of 4.9% is comparable to our peers. The company’s dividend policy is an important component to the overall objective of creating long-term shareholder value.
Now, I would like to turn it over to John for his concluding remarks. John?
John P. Calamos, Sr.
Thank you, Nimish. In summary, we are encouraged by the improved investment performance in our growth strategies. Delivering sustainable outperformance for our client remains the highest priority of the firm. We remain focused on investing back into our business and as a result, we continue to increase our product breadth to better serve our clients.
In the third quarter, we launched the Calamos Dividend Growth Fund and the Calamos Mid Cap Growth Fund. We reopened the Calamos Convertible Fund and our Calamos Evolving World Growth Fund marked its five-year anniversary. Also as part of our commitment to our clients in demonstrating our long-term confidence in the firm, we continue to add talent and senior resources to our Investment Team. Management is committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet to support our product expansion and future growth.
During the first nine months of the year, Calamos Investments repurchased 9.7 million shares of Class A common stock. We are maintaining the regular quarterly dividend of $0.125 per share. Our competitive dividend yields and the recent share repurchase program are examples of our initiative we have undertaken to enhance shareholder value.

With that, I’d like to open it up to questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator

(Operator Instructions) And we will first go to the site of Adam Beatty with Bank of America. Your line is now open.
Adam Q. Beatty – Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Thank you and good afternoon. First, just a question on the net flows and maybe if you could, a little bit of color on gross sales and gross redemptions, it looks like the flow trend is improving. Was that the result of sort of fewer redemptions or have the sales increased? And anything you could comment on the low-volatility equity and growth strategies in particular would be great? Thanks.
Nimish S. Bhatt
As you saw, Adam, on the Growth Fund, obviously, we had a significant slowdown in the net outflows there. Net outflows for the Growth Fund were about $400 million and which is significantly less than the prior quarter, and same thing with the Growth and Income Fund as well.
Adam Q. Beatty – Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Any color on gross to net, have sales improved?
Nimish S. Bhatt
Marginally.
Adam Q. Beatty – Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Okay, all right. That’s helpful. And then if you could maybe, a little bit of commentary on the institutional pipeline? How that looks at present and what kind of activity you’re seeing?
Nimish S. Bhatt
Well, as you know that, we do not comment too much on the pipeline itself, but the trend itself is extremely positive for us. We are pleased with this trend. I think going down from $2.3 billion in net outflows to $980 million is definitely a positive improvement for us. But more importantly, improving performance is our top priority right now and we are – while we are also delivering a broader product mix to our investor needs.
Adam Q. Beatty – Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Got it. Thank you, and just one more, thanks for taking all my questions. In terms of the different personnel changes in the quarter, you had a couple of additions, maybe a couple of subtractions. Just trying to get a sense around the run rate on that, you mentioned completing the build-out of your Investment Team, so it sounds like maybe there’s a little bit more to come. What was the timing of the rolling on of the new senior folks in the quarter and also how much more would you look to add there?
John P. Calamos, Sr.
We’re continuing to look, but it’s – right now, it’s more around the edges. We’ve made some significant contribution this past year, but we will continue to look at the building out the Investment Team going forward, but it’s more so around the edges.
Adam Q. Beatty – Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Got it, that’s helpful. Thanks very much, John. I appreciate it.
John P. Calamos, Sr.

Thanks, Adam.

And we will next go to the site of Robert Lee with KBW. Your line is now open.
Andrew N. Donnantuono – Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Hi, guys. This is actually Andrew Donnantuono filling in for Rob Lee. Thanks for taking my questions. Firstly, it looks like – it looks like the last question sort of addressed what I had planned to ask, but just was wondering if you could kind of give us a sense of kind of a time horizon surrounding kind of your elevated comp of late associated with kind of the buildup of the Investment Team? Will that be – maybe a bit more lumpy or could we expect to see kind of a similar comp ratio for the next couple of quarters or it’s a little bit difficult to tell? Thanks.
John P. Calamos, Sr.
Well, it’s – Andrew, as you know, it’s a little bit difficult to tell. We continue to look, but as I mentioned before, it’s more of the – more significant hires have been made.
Andrew N. Donnantuono – Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Yes.
John P. Calamos, Sr.
So it’s really more around the edges at this point, but I don’t have any really perspective on the timing of this going forward.

Andrew N. Donnantuono – Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay, thanks. And then just to kind of shift gears a little bit to your balance sheet, which is kind of looking at your different notes, different pieces of debt and it doesn’t look anything is expiring till third quarter of next year. I just was wondering if you guys were comfortable with where you stood from a debt perspective?
John P. Calamos
No. I think you have that right. I think it’s [indiscernible] or so?
Nimish S. Bhatt
That is correct. About $42 million of that is coming up due in 2014 third quarter.
Andrew N. Donnantuono – Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Yes.
John P. Calamos
Yes, so that’s correct.
Andrew N. Donnantuono – Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.
Okay. All right. Thanks for taking my questions.
Nimish S. Bhatt
Okay.

And we will next go to the site of John Dunn with Sidoti & Co. Your line is now open.
John J. Dunn – Sidoti & Co. LLC
Good afternoon. It seems like you guys benefited from a change in your – you said the top down approach and the sector repositioning. Looking forward, how active do you think that’s going to be part of the investment success of you guys. Is that something that you’re going to look at often or?
John P. Calamos, Sr.
Yes, we’ve always done both a top down and a bottom up. I guess, our remarks there is we didn’t get – last year, we didn’t get the top down as correct as we would have liked, and as we changed the top down view, we did see performance improve. Obviously, the – our bottom up work has also improved performance as well. So we always attempt to add value both with our top down view as well as our bottom up selection process and we’re seeing both of those have worked well the past quarter or so here.
John J. Dunn – Sidoti & Co. LLC
Gotcha. And then, do you have sort of a view of what – during a typical year, what you would view as a good number for new fund launches. I mean, you had two this quarter, but just looking forward?
John P. Calamos, Sr.

We are looking, as Nimish mentioned, increasing our product breadth. We did file an Active ETF, which we will hopefully launch sometime next year. and within the capability of our Investment Team here, we do have an emerging – a Evolving World Fund, which really reflects the emerging market, but it’s a low-volatility fund and we are launching an emerging market equity fund. So we have filed for that.
John J. Dunn – Sidoti & Co. LLC
Thank you. Much appreciated.
John P. Calamos, Sr.
Okay. Thanks, John.

Calamos reworks leadership structure, expands through acquisition

Robert Behan named Calamos presidentPrivacy Policy





Calamos Investments has a global reach but for the past 10 years it has called Naperville home.And now the investment management firm, founded by Chicago area native John P. Calamos Sr. in 1977, has made major moves regarding its leadership structure and an expansion of offered products.The firm has appointed Robert Behan as president, and it has also recently acquired Phineus Partners LP in San Francisco and opened an office in Miami, Fla.In addition the company also recently appointed four members of its current investment team, John Hillenbrand, David Kails, Nick Niziolek and Eli Pars, as co-chief investment officers,

"During our expansion, these four investment team members emerged as strong leaders and have demonstrated exceptional capabilities as they have taken on more responsibilities," Calamos said. "We want each of the team to be really focused in those particular areas of responsibilities. Again, this is what we've been working for a number of years. We felt very comfortable that we got to this place where we can announce this."In an earlier statement Calamos said the leadership team will give clients "a more focused approach and the staff better bench strength."The move brings investment executives with decades of experience in their respective fields to the table, according to Calamos. The four will lead different types of investment classes — global equities, U.S. growth equities, convertible securities and closed-end funds.Appointing Behan, formerly head of global distribution, as president further shows the firm's evolution and expansion plans both in the country as well as globally, Calamos said.

"In recent years, Bob has taken on significant responsibilities beyond his role as head of global distribution and has been integral to many of our strategic growth initiatives across our organization," Calamos said.Behan, who was part of opening the London office last year and is over-seeing the opening of a Florida office and acquisition deals with hedge fund firm Phineaus LP, adds: "We've worked together for years, and we are in some ways still a family run business.""We actually think it's a little bit of the future of the business to put the decision-making power at a multiple level, which is closer to potentially the process and the people. And we looked at a lot of companies our size and bigger and we determined that we have the right people in the right spots that have really emerged over the years handling additional responsibilities," Behan said in explaining the shift in leadership roles.Both Calamos and Behan say they are excited to announce the upcoming acquisition of Phineus Partners LP, a global long/short hedge fund started by Michael D. Grant in 2002 in California, to further expand the firm's product suite."We are pleased to welcome Michael and his team to Calamos Investments," Calamos says. "As one of the first entrants into the liquid alternative space more than 20 years ago, we continue to expand our presence in the space. Michael's strategy will be a welcome addition to our lineup."Identifying strategies and staying on top of the global current is what Calamos Investment is all about, Behan says, adding that John Calamos just gave an interview on his market outlook on CNBC this past August. "John has been watching and anticipating the market for 40 plus years, and especially when things get a little crazy, advisers are always looking to John to see what he's thinking on this," Behan emphasizes.Calamos is happy to share his thoughts: "We are still positive on growth, although it's slow growth. We don't think we are in a recession. We are in a slow growth area and at this part of the investment cycle we will continue to see more volatility. From an investor point of view what I've learned over the years is you should not get whip sawed out of the market. I do think we have to think globally, we are in a global economy. And we look at that very carefully."Calamos Investment, which employs about 350 mostly local residents in its headquarters, built up the Calamos Campus, including Hotel Arista, on the northeast corner of Interstate 88 and Route 59 in 2005, has both feet firmly planted in Naperville. Calamos said he is actually looking into expanding the campus to both sides of Route 59.."John Calamos takes the role as a corporate citizen in the Naperville community very seriously, having a presence in the Naperville Area Chamber of Commerce and Choose DuPage, and a number of community organizations, and we do extensible charity giving in the area," adds Jennifer McGuffin, VP and director of corporate communications.An apprentice program and an internship program have both grown in reputation attracting talent from near and far."It has gotten highly competitive," Behan says. Calamos added that it's exciting to see so much talent available.Daina Saleh is a freelance reporter for the Naperville Sun.

John and Mae Calamos Donate $10 Million to Illinois Institute of Technology




Gift Establishes Chairs in Business and PhilosophyChicago, IL — December 5, 2011 — John P. Calamos, Sr., chairman, chief executive officer and co-chief investment officer of Calamos Investments LLC, and his wife Mae have committed $10 million to Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT), part of which will establish two new endowed chairs at the university. The gift is the largest alumni contribution in IIT's comprehensive fundraising campaign, currently in its leadership phase. The gift, made through the John P. Calamos Sr. Foundation, establishes a chair for the dean of the IIT Stuart School of Business, from which Calamos received his B.S. in economics in 1963 and his M.B.A. in finance in 1970. The gift also establishes a philosophy chair in the College of Science and Letters, reflecting Calamos' belief that philosophy is the foundation for critical thinking.
A chair is an endowed faculty position that supports the research, teaching and leadership efforts of a dean or faculty member. Endowed chairs serve the dual purpose of enhancing the learning experience of students while also raising the visibility of the university through the research and scholarship of top faculty. The chairs endowed by John and Mae Calamos will be filled following searches by university selection committees.
"This gift from Mr. and Mrs. Calamos will have a major impact on the future of IIT. It is the kind of gift that has a noticeable, tangible effect on the lives of students and faculty that will continue for generations. We are especially proud that this gift comes from an alumnus," said IIT Vice President of Institutional Advancement Betsy Hughes.
Calamos is the founder of Calamos Investments, a global asset management firm based in Naperville, Illinois. The firm manages more than $34 billion for institutional and individual clients around the world. Founded in 1977, the firm developed an early reputation as a pioneer in investment techniques to control risk, preserve capital and build wealth for clients over the long term. Mr. Calamos credits his success to his education at IIT and his experience as a pilot in the Air Force, which he joined after completing his degrees, serving in the Vietnam War and achieving the rank of Major.
Repeatedly named one of the “Most Trustworthy Companies” by Forbes Magazine, Calamos Investments has also received accolades for the performance of its investment products by Kiplinger, Morningstar, and Lipper. John Calamos won the Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year award for the financial services sector, Lake Michigan Area in 2006. He is a member of the Investment Analysts Society of Chicago. A frequent speaker at investment seminars and conferences, he is often quoted as an authority on risk-managed strategies in Barron’s, Fortune, Forbes, Pensions & Investments, Money andThe Wall Street Journal. He is also interviewed regularly on CNBC, Bloomberg TV, and Fox Business Channel.
Calamos is active as a philanthropist in the Greek community and is a member of the Board of Directors for the National Hellenic Museum in Chicago. He has been honored for his lifetime contributions by the Hellenic Bar Association.
Calamos is a member of the IIT Board of Trustees and the Board of Overseers for the IIT Stuart School of Business, and has served on the Board of Overseers for the IIT Rice Campus. He was honored by the university with a Professional Achievement Alumni Award in 2006. He and Mae are members of IIT’s Philip Danforth Armour Society, which recognizes philanthropic families who have given transformational gifts of $1 million or more in support of the university’s mission.
Founded in 1890, IIT is a Ph.D.-granting university with more than 7,700 students in engineering, sciences, architecture, psychology, design, humanities, business and law. IIT's interprofessional, technology-focused curriculum is designed to advance knowledge through research and scholarship, to cultivate invention improving the human condition, and to prepare students from throughout the world for a life of professional achievement, service to society, and individual fulfillment.

It was during his time in the Air Force that Mr. Calamos became intrigued by the risk management aspects of convertible bonds. By applying option price theory to the valuation of convertibles he was able to demonstrate the benefit of convertibles as part of an of investment strategy and began to attract institutional investors who remain clients today.

			  The author of a chapter on convertibles for the Pension Investment Handbook by Ibbotson Associates, he has also written articles for publications such as Personal Financial Planning, Pension World, Pensions & Investments, Journal of Investing and Financial Executive. Mr. Calamos' latest press interviews include appearances on Kudlow & Company, Bloomberg's Market Week, Open Exchange with Suzy Asaad, CNNfn's Halftime Report, and Nightly Business Report.
