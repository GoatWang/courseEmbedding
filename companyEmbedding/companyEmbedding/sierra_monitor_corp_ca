Sierra Monitor
Protect: Sentry IT Gas and Fire Detection Solutions








Sentry IT Gas and Fire Detection Solutions







Facilities ranging from small CNG filling stations to fleet maintenance buildings, wastewater lift stations to wastewater plants, compressors, pipelines, refineries and even data rooms and cell tower huts present a common set of risks of hazard gas. Combustible gases such as natural gas (Methane) or Hydrogen represent a risk for facilities due to fire or explosion. Toxic gases including Carbon Monoxide, Hydrogen Sulfide, Chlorine and many others represent a risk to personnel, while inert gases such as Nitrogen can cause Oxygen displacement leading to asphyxiation. Facility managers must identify hazardous gas risks, mitigate the possible causes and design continuous monitoring systems to warn of dangerous conditions. Many facilities also need to protect themselves from flame hazards.Protection from gas hazards is not a one-size-fits-all proposition. Systems must be designed to provide the appropriate level of protection and response commensurate with the risk level and the resources available to install and manage the system. Sierra Monitor’s Sentry IT fire and gas detection solution includes standalone sensor modules that can be integrated into the user’s safety and control system, controller based systems with extremely flexible logic for customized response, and enterprise wide systems that incorporate Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) functions such as network connectivity, web-server graphics capabilities, and cloud data analytics.



Selecting the Right Partner
As a top-tier supplier with 35 years of experience in a highly regulated industry, Sierra Monitor’s products carry numerous third party approvals including Underwriters Labs, Factory Mutual, and Safety Integrity Level ratings; and comply with most relevant international standards. Sierra Monitor has deep technical experience and the resources to advise, develop and integrate the correct facility safety solution. While selecting a fire and gas detection solution from a short list of top-tier suppliers, facilities safety managers should ask the following questions to compare the Return on Investment (ROI) between the alternatives:

How long will it take to install the solution at my facility?  Facilities are complex constructions, and installing and wiring gas and flame sensor modules across the facility can be time consuming and therefore expensive. Sierra Monitor offers a range of wiring connectivity options on each sensor module, thereby simplifying and speeding up the installation process. The installer can choose the option that is right for a particular construction type or zone. The options include traditional analog 4-20 mA connectivity and various digital wiring options that can be configured in daisy chain, hub, or star topologies as required, minimizing wiring complexity.
 How long will it take to commission the entire system?  Sierra Monitor’s Sentry IT solution includes a unique AutoDiscovery capability that enables the controller to automatically discover all the sensor modules connected to the controller, thereby saving time and preventing errors from manual commissioning. A very simple programmable logic environment enables the facility manager to quickly implement closed loop detection and response workflow that is appropriate for their facility. A “one-button” test feature rapidly tests the logic and health of all the actuator devices like lights, horns and strobes that participate in the response workflow. A “one-step” upgrade capability allows the USB port to be used to rapidly update the operating system, firmware, application logic, and user programs; making it equally easy to re-commission a system.
 Over the life of the solution, how much time will be spent calibrating and recalibrating the sensor modules?     Sensor modules are often located in hard-to-reach places. Accessing and calibrating each sensor module individually is time consuming and requires multiple people. Sierra Monitor’s unique GlobalCal™ technology enables a single-person, non-intrusive, all-at-once based approach to calibrating all sensor modules at one time from the controller. There is no need for personnel to go the each sensor module to calibrate it. Another factor that adds to the cost associated with calibration is the frequency of re-calibration. Many of Sierra Monitor’s modules are approved by the various agencies for recalibration every six months versus the more standard three month re-calibration cycle required by most other vendors. The longer recalibration cycles are enabled by Sierra Monitor’s use of advanced Digital Signal Processing (DSP) based filtering algorithms. The combination of GlobalCal and less frequent re-calibration results in labor cost savings of up to 75% for Sierra Monitor’s customers.
 How can ongoing maintenance and replacement costs be lowered?  Predictive maintenance and replacement or re-calibration of sensor modules is superior compared to reactive maintenance  or schedule-based maintenance. With Sierra Monitor’s SenseSafe™ technology, the controllers use raw voltage information from the sensor modules to assess drift, along with statistical process control algorithms to determine when re-calibration would be required for a particular sensor, or when a module might require replacement. The facilities safety manager can use this information to potentially further extend the re-calibration interval, or use this information to make a more informed decision on when to replace individual sensor modules.
Does the solution support advanced analytics that could proactively highlight a safety issue well before it becomes critical?  The Sentry IT controllers have a very large amount of memory to log alarm and events. By defining different alarm levels, large amounts of time series data can be collected at the individual sensor module or zone level, and that data can be analyzed to identify low-level safety anomalies that can be addressed proactively.
How long will it take to integrate the system with an existing building management system or Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) or to the cloud for remote monitoring and analytics?  The Sentry IT solution from Sierra Monitor incorporates a FieldServer gateway, the industry’s leading multi-protocol gateway product. The FieldServer gateway makes it very easy for the installer or integrator to complete the integration step in minutes or hours rather than days or weeks. From Navy ships to data centers and from pipelines to CNG facilities, Sierra Monitor’s gas and fire detection solutions are the preferred choice for the diligent and ROI-oriented facility management professional.

Landfill Methane Mitigation



A landfill site (also known as a rubbish dump) is a site for the disposal of waste materials by burial and is the oldest form of waste treatment. Historically, landfills have been the most common method of organized waste disposal and remain so in many places around the world. Decomposition of waste produces combustible and toxic gases that move from higher pressure areas (areas deep within the landfill) to lower pressure areas (areas such as ground surface and off-site areas). These gases easily move through loose sand or gravel soils and are released into the air through any available crack or opening. While wind dilutes the gas with fresh air, it can also move hazardous gas into neighboring communities. Many people find the odors emitted from a landfill to be unpleasant and may suffer temporary symptoms such as nausea and headache. Many landfill sites are also subsequently repurposed and used as sites to construct large residential, commercial, or industrial facilities. When buildings are constructed on top of a closed landfill or situated next to a closed or open landfill, a buildup of toxic and combustible gases is possible. It is therefore essential that all buildings in the vicinity of an active or repurposed landfill implement continuous and accurate gas monitoring to ensure the health and safety of the occupants.

Gas and Fire Detection

	Hazardous gases that emit from landfill sites include:

Combustible gases such as Methane
Hydrogen Sulfide
Carbon Dioxide

	Gas must be monitored in the subsurface, near the surface, and above the surface (in the air) of a landfill. Gas detection may take place in monitoring wells, ventilation systems, and/or buildings on or off-site. Gas sample locations and sampling methods vary from landfill to landfill, depending on monitoring concerns or regulatory requirements.

	In extreme circumstances, a landfill fire can occur if methane was not properly detected. Therefore fire detectors must be placed near sources of ignition.

	Placing industrial-grade gas detectors within the buildings that are proximal to the landfills is also common.

	The gas and flame detectors provide their measurements to a controller that can trigger the appropriate alarming or mitigation response. The controller also stores the data for subsequent diligence analysis. 

Automation and Integration Strategies

	Buildup of combustible gases can cause a hazard to a building built on a landfill site, particularly in enclosed areas such as basements and crawlspaces that might contain heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) or electrical equipment. Smaller buildings without a centralized Building Automation System (BAS) should program the controller in the gas detection system to trigger a series of visual or audio alarms, to turn off any ignition source near the location of the discharge of gas, and to remotely notify a central monitoring center. The controller could also implement strategies such as texting or e-mailing notifications to appropriate health and safety responders. In the case of a large facility with a centralized BAS, the gas detection system should integrate with the BAS and fit within its management and workflow framework. 


	Automated safety systems such as those described in this section should be “performance approved” and checked on a periodic basis.

















Products for Landfill Methane Mitigation




	A gas and fire detection system includes gas and fire detection modules, a method to communicate to a controller, an ability to collect large amounts of data for subsequent analysis, and flexible alarm handling with a method for communicating data to higher-level systems.

	Sierra Monitor’s Nationally Recognized Testing Lab (NRTL) approved Sentry IT fire and gas system can ensure the safety and protection of assets and personnel at risk from landfills. Our systems can also be configured in a special outside enclosure for residential housing. Sierra Monitor’s detectors and controllers offer the industry’s best Return on Investment (ROI) to the facility manager through innovations that minimize installation, commissioning, calibration, and life cycle maintenance costs. Sierra Monitor’s Sentry IT solution is the preferred choice for the diligent and ROI-oriented facility management professional.

Wastewater Treatment




	Wastewater is used water that has been adversely affected in quality by substances like human waste, food scraps, oils, and chemicals. Wastewater treatment, also known as sewage treatment, is the process of removing contaminants from wastewater through physical, chemical, and biological procedures. Wastewater treatment facilities clean used water for the benefit of our environment and personal health. However, the treatment process is chemically intensive and can pose a threat to the safety of personnel working at the facility. Consequently, the wastewater treatment facility manager must ensure that the facility's safety is not compromised by instrumenting the plant with a comprehensive gas detection, alarming, and mitigation system.


Gas Detection and Alarming

	The process of treating wastewater creates many toxic and combustible gases. Moreover, there are many enclosed spaces in a wastewater treatment plant where toxic gases can build up, or inert gases can deplete oxygen to endanger plant personnel. To ensure maximum wastewater treatment safety, these hazardous gases may be encountered:

Combustible Gases

Methane
Pentane
Hydrogen


Hydrogen Sulfide
Oxygen Deficiency
Carbon Monoxide
Chlorine
Sulfur Dioxide

	Processes within a wastewater treatment facility include pumping and lifting stations, influent screening, sludge processing, digestion, and final disinfection. Different processes within a wastewater treatment facility require different gas sensors. Areas with potential hazardous levels of gases include:

Pumping station and wet well – Combustible Gases, Oxygen Deficiency, Hydrogen Sulfide
Influent and barscreen room – Combustible Gases, Hydrogen Sulfide, Oxygen Deficiency
Barscreen and conveyor room – Combustible Gases, Hydrogen Sulfide
Barscreen container and grit screen room – Combustible Gases, Hydrogen
Primary Clarifier – Combustible Gases, Oxygen Deficiency, Hydrogen Sulfide
Primary wet wall – Combustible Gases, Oxygen Deficiency, Hydrogen Sulfide
Grit chamber and wet wall – Combustible Gases, Oxygen Deficiency, Hydrogen Sulfide
Sludge treatment – Combustible Gases, Oxygen Deficiency, Hydrogen Sulfide
Sludge incineration – Carbon Monoxide
Basement-generator area – Combustible Gases
Digester-basement – Combustible Gases, Hydrogen Sulfide
Digester-first floor – Combustible Gases, Hydrogen Sulfide
Odor removal equipment – Chlorine, Hydrogen Sulfide, Ammonia
Furnace room – Combustible Gases, Carbon Monoxide
Filtration room – Chlorine, Hydrogen Sulfide
Final disinfection – Chlorine, Ammonia, Sulfur Dioxide

Automation and Integration Strategies

	Detecting hazardous gases and issuing alarms are important steps, but it is equally important to take remediation actions. This can be done through integrating the gas detection and alarm system with the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA), the Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) or the Building Management System (BMS) responsible for automating the larger facility. For example, a common integration would be a Modbus RTU gas sensor with a BACnet/IP BMS. Other automation processes may include providing notifications as a local alarm to an employee's phone, tablet, and/or PC.


	As these systems are automated, the regulatory agencies require that the systems be “performance approved" and checked on a periodic basis.


















Products for Wastewater Treatment




	Wastewater treatment facilities require a gas detection system that includes gas detection modules, a method to communicate to a controller, flexible alarm handling, and a method for communicating data to higher-level systems to take facility-wide remediation actions. The ability to collect large amounts of data for subsequent analysis is also key. 


	Sierra Monitor's Nationally Recognized Testing Lab (NRTL) approved Sentry IT fire and gas solutions can ensure the safety and protection of assets and personnel in wastewater treatment facilities. Sierra Monitor's detectors and controllers offer the industry's best Return on Investment (ROI) to the facility manager through innovations that minimize installation, commissioning, calibration, and life cycle maintenance costs. Sierra Monitor's Sentry IT solution is the preferred choice for the diligent and ROI-oriented facility management professional.
