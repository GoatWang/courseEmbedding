Buggy Whips are manufactured from rugged wound fiberglass and come equipped with a pre-wired light socket and a brilliant red flag. The original Buggy Whip is an off-road essential. Don't go off-road without it because most areas require the use of a flag pole for daytime off-road use, and safety dictates the use of a lighted pole after sunset. Buggy Whips are available in five-foot lengths to fit motorcycles and eight-foot lengths to fit four wheel vehicles. Whips are supplied with mounting hardware and an electrical connector.

An aerial-photographic assessment of reenacted handcart treks on a section of the Mormon Pioneer National Historic Trail, Fremont County, WyomingProduct Type: Scientific Investigations ReportYear: 2008Author(s): McDougal, R.R., R.G. Waltermire, C.L. Aldridge, S.S. Germaine, S.E. Nielsen, C.C. Nielsen, L. Hanson, and Z.H. BowenSuggested Citation: McDougal, R.R., R.G. Waltermire, C.L. Aldridge, S.S. Germaine, S.E. Nielsen, C.C. Nielsen, L. Hanson, and Z.H. Bowen. 2008. An aerial-photographic assessment of reenacted handcart treks on a section of the Mormon Pioneer National Historic Trail, Fremont County, Wyoming. Scientific Investigations Report 2008-5115. U.S. Geological Survey. 70 p. Reenactments of historical pioneer emigrations have increased in popularity since the celebration of these events during the United States bicentennial in 1976. From 1999 to 2006, approximately 70,000 Mormon trekkers traveled the Mormon Pioneer National Historic Trail (hereinafter referred to as the Trail) segment between Sixth Crossing and Rock Creek Hollow in Fremont County, Wyoming. Recent elevated levels of use have raised concerns over potential recreation-related damage to this particularly scenic segment of the Trail. In 2006, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) contracted the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) to conduct an aerial-photographic assessment of the condition of the Trail between Sixth Crossing and Rock Creek Hollow. Specifically, the USGS was to assess trail conditions for this segment as influenced by handcart use (low, medium, and high intensity of use) and concentrated activities associated with trekking (toilet, rest, and camp sites). Based on these results, there are identifiable management considerations. Toilet and rest sites need to be carefully located relative to where sensitive vegetation or soils occur. The analyses presented here indicate that limiting motorized vehicle use needs to be a priority over that of adjusting the number of trekkers. Additionally, monitoring of the Trail from Sixth Crossing to Rock Creek Hollow segment needs to consider explicit management targets, such as minimum acceptable levels of bare ground or trail width, and the establishment of permanent monitoring plots to evaluate targets and measure responses to altered management activities.
