Our History
During the summer of 1922, a young Franklin, North Carolina attorney, Gilmer A. Jones, had the idea of organizing a building and loan association. It was to have a long-term impact on the progress in Macon County. He recognized an urgent need for an institution offering citizens an opportunity to become homeowners, and a depository that would pay a good rate of interest on individual savings in Macon County. The Franklin Press dated August 25, 1922, stated: “An organization that is destined to do more for the upbuilding of our town than anything that has ever been attempted here was formed last Saturday night.” Mr. Jones’ idea became reality on October 6, 1922, when the Macon County Building and Loan Association opened its office upstairs above the Bank of Franklin Building.
The association remained small for several years. Even during the real estate “bust” and the Great Depression of the early 1930’s, not a penny was lost on a loan. By 1963, assets had grown to $2.6 million. The original small office had become inadequate and a full time manager was needed. In 1964 the Association moved to a building at the corner of West Main and Maple Street. That same year they signed up for insurance of deposits provided by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. The rate of growth increased sharply thereafter.
In October of 1972, Macon Building and Loan Association changed its name to Macon Savings and Loan Association. Macon Savings continued to grow and as the bank approached its 60th year opened its first branch office in downtown Murphy in 1981.
In 1985, Franklin’s main branch moved into the new colonial-style building located in the heart of downtown Franklin. On June 25, 1988, during a severe electrical storm, the building was struck by lightning and completely destroyed. Although disaster had struck, Macon Savings never missed an hour of service. The drive-thru lanes were kept open and other operations were moved to the Maple Street location until reconstruction was completed a year later.
Macon Savings and Loan Association became Macon Savings Bank in 1989 and continued to enjoy record growth. Since 1993, now known as simply Macon Bank, nine more branches have been opened, including another in Franklin at Holly Springs Plaza, one in Highlands, Brevard, Sylva, Cashiers, Columbus, Saluda and two in Hendersonville.
In September 2014, Macon Bank converted to a stock form of organization. Entegra Financial Corp. became the new holding company of Macon Bank. With the sale of stock completed and capital raised, Macon Bank began to offer enhanced products and services to customers in the bank’s traditional “home” communities and to expand into new markets. The Board of Directors decided the move into new markets and in February 2015 realized they would be more successful if the bank’s name were changed to Entegra Bank. This change became effective October 1, 2015. 
In 2014, the bank opened a Loan Production office in Greenville, SC. By the end of 2015, that office had become a full-service branch located at 501 Roper Mountain Road. The Greenville branch was soon followed by branches in Anderson and Chesnee, SC. In 2016, Entegra Bank acquired Oldtown Bank in Waynesville, NC which included a loan production office in Asheville, NC, and another loan production office was opened in Clemson, SC. Entegra Bank has agreed to purchase two Stearns Bank branches in Jasper, GA. The transaction is slated to be finalized in late February, 2017.
Entegra Bank is a wholly owned subsidiary of Entegra Financial Corp, headquartered in Franklin, NC. The Company’s shares began trading on the NASDAQ Global Market on October 1, 2014 under the symbol “ENFC.” In December 2014, Entegra’s stock was added to the Russell Microcap Index and the ABA NASDAQ Community Bank Index.

Gainesville’s Chattahoochee Bank of Georgia has been purchased by North Carolina-based Entegra Financial Corp., the holding company of Entegra Bank.
The purchase of Chattahoochee with a mix of stock and cash was announced on Tuesday. Entegra paid $34.9 million — 70 percent cash and 30 percent stock — for the commercial bank on E.E. Butler Parkway, according to the announcement. The value per share is $14.75. 
The purchase is expected to close in October.
The North Carolina bank has 17 branches and, after buying Chattahoochee Bank, $1.6 billion in assets, $950 million in loans and $1.2 billion in deposits.
Chattahoochee Bank has $197 million in assets, $155 million in loans and $166 million in deposits, according to the announcement, as well as a loan production office in Duluth. Both of its locations will carry the Entegra name after the purchase.
Entegra CEO Roger Plemens said his company set its sights on Chattahoochee Bank of Georgia because of its location.
“With an unemployment rate of (3.9 percent), Gainesville is among the 50 fastest growing metro areas in the U.S. and home to more than 300 manufacturing and processing companies,” Plemens said. “Chattahoochee is one of the premier commercial banks in Gainesville and brings Entegra a talented team of six lenders with deep commercial experience.”
The purchase has been approved by boards of both banks but still needs regulatory approval, said Jody Lail, CEO of Chattahoochee Bank of Georgia.
Chattahoochee Bank’s current lending limit is $5 million, Lail told The Times, and that will rise to $14 million once the Entegra purchase is complete.
“We currently bank some local manufacturing companies, professionals like dentists and orthodontists, some restaurant franchise owners, a fair amount of office and warehouse — we have a pretty diverse customer base,” he said. “This will just allow us to continue to grow with our customers.”
Chattahoochee Bank has almost two dozen employees. Its front-line customer service staff and its six commercial lenders will stay with the company, Lail said.
Some back-office, supportive duties will be taken over by existing Entegra employees, Lail said, noting he didn’t want to get into details about whether that would mean layoffs at the Gainesville bank.
Chattahoochee Bank of Georgia opened in 2008 catering to commercial clients in Gainesville, but with its sale to Entegra, the bank will begin offering consumer products — residential mortgage and investments, according to the announcement.

Entegra provides additional capital strength to allow our commercial banking team to greatly expand lending and cash management services to both our existing customer base and our rapidly expanding business community. We are also pleased that Entegra will bring additional services for our consumer customers, including residential mortgage and  investments.” 
The transaction, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2017, has been unanimously approved by the Board of Directors of both companies and is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals, and approval by the shareholders of Chattahoochee.
Excluding estimated transaction expenses, the acquisition is expected to be more than 15% accretive to 2018 earnings and to have a tangible book value earn-back period of approximately 4.50 years. Upon completion of this transaction, Entegra will have approximately $1.6 billion in assets, $950 million in loans, and $1.2 billion in deposits.

Roger D. Plemens, President and CEO of the Company reported, “Our second quarter results reflect another successful quarter for the Company as we continue to deploy our capital and position the Company for long-term independence. We are particularly pleased with the growth in our margin and fee income, both of which have increased significantly from the comparable periods in the prior year. Our focus on growing return on equity is evident in the significant quarter over quarter increase from the prior year. The recently completed acquisition of Old Town Bank has already provided accretion to our core earnings and is providing important access to the Haywood and Buncombe County markets. As previously disclosed, we have also recently invested in our mortgage banking business with the addition of a seasoned mortgage executive to lead this business.”
Old Town Bank Acquisition
The Company completed the acquisition of Old Town Bank on April 1, 2016. This transaction added approximately $111.4 million in assets, including $65.0 million in loans, $88.7 million in deposits and $1.7 million in goodwill and core deposit intangible. The purchase price of $13.5 million resulted in dilution of approximately $0.55 per share.
