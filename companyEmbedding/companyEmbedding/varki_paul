SAMPLE LEGAL CASES



Working with Web Hosts & Designers

                    No matter how averse you are to "techie" projects like web development and site management, you must be involved enough to ensure your rights are protected--and that no one else's are being violated.  This reference discusses how.
                




Estate Planning Proceedures

                    Proper estate planning can be more involved than you might imagine, but is essential to the proper management of your affairs.  This reference provides a list of the various tasks involved in doing just that.

The Company has two approved products: OXAYDO (oxycodone HCI, USP) tablets for oral use only CII and SPRIX® (ketorolac tromethamine) Nasal Spray. In addition, using Egalet's proprietary Guardian Technology, the Company is developing a pipeline of clinical-stage, opioid-based product candidates that are specifically designed to deter abuse by physical and chemical manipulation. The lead programs, ARYMO®, formerly known as Egalet-001, an abuse-deterrent, extended-release, oral morphine formulation, and Egalet-002, an abuse-deterrent, extended-release, oral oxycodone formulation, are in late-stage clinical development for the management of pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock opioid treatment and for which alternative treatments are inadequate. Egalet's Guardian Technology can be applied broadly across different classes of pharmaceutical products and can be used to develop combination products that include multiple active pharmaceutical ingredients with similar or different release profiles.

WAYNE, Pa., Nov. 16 , 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Egalet Corporation (Nasdaq:   EGLT) ("Egalet"), a fully integrated specialty pharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing and commercializing innovative treatments for pain and other conditions, announced that Paul C. Varki, J.D., M.P.H, joins Egalet as senior vice president and general counsel effective immediately. Mr. Varki will report to Bob Radie, president and chief executive officer.
"We are excited to have Paul join our leadership team," said Bob Radie, president and chief executive officer of Egalet. "His relevant legal, commercial, and regulatory experience will be invaluable as we continue to develop our Guardian™ Technology pipeline, commercialize our products and grow our business."
Mr. Varki joins Egalet from GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) where he had been assistant general counsel since 2011, providing global legal support for research and development. Prior to that role he served as senior counsel for the vaccines business unit within North America and counsel for marketed products within the U.S. pharmaceuticals business. Before GSK Mr. Varki practiced food and drug law at a Washington, D.C. law firm, and served as regulatory counsel for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER). He earned his J.D. from Temple University Law School, earned his master of public health (M.P.H.) from George Washington University School of Public Health and received his bachelor's degree from the College of William and Mary.
About Egalet
Egalet, a fully integrated specialty pharmaceutical company, is focused on developing, manufacturing and commercializing innovative treatments for pain and other conditions. The Company has two approved products: OXAYDO™ (oxycodone HCI, USP) tablets for oral use only –CII and SPRIX® (ketorolac tromethamine) Nasal Spray. In addition, using Egalet's proprietary Guardian™ Technology, the Company is developing a pipeline of clinical-stage, opioid-based product candidates that are specifically designed to deter abuse by physical and chemical manipulation. The lead programs, ARYMO®, formerly known as Egalet-001, an abuse-deterrent, extended-release, oral morphine formulation, and Egalet-002, an abuse-deterrent, extended-release, oral oxycodone formulation, are in late-stage clinical development for the management of pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock opioid treatment and for which alternative treatments are inadequate. Egalet's Guardian Technology can be applied broadly across different classes of pharmaceutical products and can be used to develop combination products that include multiple active pharmaceutical ingredients with similar or different release profiles. Full additional information on Egalet, please visit egalet.com. For full prescribing information on SPRIX, please visit sprix.com and for Oxaydo please visit oxaydo.com. For full prescribing information on SPRIX, including the black box warning, please visit sprix.com. For full prescribing information on OXAYDO, please visit oxaydo.com.

By Automic BlogWith continuous delivery (CD) almost always in the spotlight, continuous integration (CI) is often left out in the cold. Indeed, it's been in use for so long and so widely, we often take the model for granted. So what is CI and how can you make the most of it? This blog is intended to answer those questions.

 All the World’s a Cloud
        All of Cloud Is at Cloud Expo!

 Cloud Computing - Big Data | Analytics - Internet of Things 
          Containers - Microservices - WebRTC - DevOps 


Join Us at the Javits Center in New York, NY, June 6-8 

          Cloud computing software is eating the world, and each day is bringing new developments in this world. 

          Yesterday's debate about public vs. private has transformed into the reality of hybrid cloud: a recent survey shows that 74% of enterprises have a hybrid cloud strategy. 

          Meanwhile, 94% of enterprises are using some form of XaaS – software, platform, and Infrastructure as a Service.

          Big Data | Analytics and the emerging Internet of Things (IoT) are driving exponentially increased demands on datacenters and developers alike, as we cross the zettabyte horizon this year.

          Containers and microservices are now part of every PaaS conversation, and IaaS providers are increasingly competing for platform customers. 

          WebRTC continues to reform web communications, and DevOps is pushing its way into an enterprise IT world that is increasingly agile, lean, and continuous.

          Through all this, Cloud Expo remains the single independent event where delegates and technology vendors can meet to experience and discuss the entire world of the cloud.

        Only Cloud Expo brings together all this in a single location: 
        
          •	Cloud Computing
            •	Big Data | Analytics
            •	Internet of Things
            •	Containers | Microservices
            •	WebRTC
            •	DevOps


        Cloud computing budgets worldwide are reaching into the hundreds of billions of dollars, and no organization can survive long without some sort of cloud migration strategy. Each month brings new announcements, use cases, and success stories. 

          Cloud Expo offers the world's most comprehensive selection of technical and strategic Industry Keynotes, General Sessions, Breakout Sessions, and signature Power Panels. The exhibition floor features 100+ exhibitors offering specific solutions and comprehensive strategies. 

          The floor also features a Demo Theater that give delegates the opportunity to get even closer to the technology they want to see and the people who offer it. 

          Attend Cloud Expo. Create your own custom experience. Learn the latest from the world's best technologists. Talk to the vendors you are considering, and put them to the test.

Egalet Hires Paul Varki as Senior Vice President and General Counsel






Nov 16, 2015, 6:00am EST














WAYNE, Pa., Nov. 16 , 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Egalet Corporation (Nasdaq: EGLT) ("Egalet"), a fully integrated specialty pharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing and commercializing innovative treatments for pain and other conditions, announced that Paul C. Varki, J.D., M.P.H, joins Egalet as senior vice president and general counsel effective immediately. Mr. Varki will report to Bob Radie, president and chief executive officer.

"We are excited to have Paul join our leadership team," said Bob Radie, president and chief executive officer of Egalet. "His relevant legal, commercial, and regulatory experience will be invaluable as we continue to develop our Guardian™ Technology pipeline, commercialize our products and grow our business."
Mr. Varki joins Egalet from GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) where he had been assistant general counsel since 2011, providing global legal support for research and development. Prior to that role he served as senior counsel for the vaccines business unit within North America and counsel for marketed products within the U.S. pharmaceuticals business. Before GSK Mr. Varki practiced food and drug law at a Washington, D.C. law firm, and served as regulatory counsel for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER). He earned his J.D. from Temple University Law School, earned his master of public health (M.P.H.) from George Washington University School of Public Health and received his bachelor's degree from the College of William and Mary.
About EgaletEgalet, a fully integrated specialty pharmaceutical company, is focused on developing, manufacturing and commercializing innovative treatments for pain and other conditions. The Company has two approved products: OXAYDO™ (oxycodone HCI, USP) tablets for oral use only –CII and SPRIX® (ketorolac tromethamine) Nasal Spray. In addition, using Egalet's proprietary Guardian™ Technology, the Company is developing a pipeline of clinical-stage, opioid-based product candidates that are specifically designed to deter abuse by physical and chemical manipulation. The lead programs, ARYMO®, formerly known as Egalet-001, an abuse-deterrent, extended-release, oral morphine formulation, and Egalet-002, an abuse-deterrent, extended-release, oral oxycodone formulation, are in late-stage clinical development for the management of pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock opioid treatment and for which alternative treatments are inadequate. Egalet's Guardian Technology can be applied broadly across different classes of pharmaceutical products and can be used to develop combination products that include multiple active pharmaceutical ingredients with similar or different release profiles. Full additional information on Egalet, please visit egalet.com. For full prescribing information on SPRIX, please visit sprix.com and for Oxaydo please visit oxaydo.com. For full prescribing information on SPRIX, including the black box warning, please visit sprix.com. For full prescribing information on OXAYDO, please visit oxaydo.com.
Safe HarborStatements included in this press release (including but not limited to upcoming milestones) that are not historical in nature are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations, and are subject to known and unknown uncertainties and risks. Actual results could differ materially from those discussed due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to: the success of Egalet's clinical trials, including the timely recruitment of trial subjects and meeting the timelines therefor; Egalet's ability to obtain regulatory approval of Egalet's product candidates; Egalet's ability to maintain the intellectual property position of Egalet's products and product candidates; Egalet's ability to identify and reliance upon qualified third parties to manufacture its products; Egalet's ability to service its debt obligations; Egalet's ability to find and hire qualified sales professionals; the receptivity in the marketplace and among physicians to Egalet's products; the success of products which compete with Egalet's that are or become available; general market conditions; and other risk factors described in Egalet's filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. Egalet assumes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking-statements contained in this press release whether as a result of new information or future events, except as may be required by law.
