His father was a management consultant at Arthur D. Little. James attended The Choate School (now Choate Rosemary Hall) in Wallingford, Connecticut.[3]
James attended Harvard College, where he was a John Harvard Scholar and from which he graduated magna cum laude in 1973. He received his MBA with high distinction from Harvard Business School in 1975, where he was a Baker Scholar.
Career[edit]
In 1975, James joined investment bank Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette and became head of the firm's global M&A group in 1982. He founded DLJ Merchant Banking, Inc. in 1985. In 1995, James was appointed chairman of the firm's banking group, a position he held when DLJ was acquired in 2000 by Credit Suisse First Boston, and was a member of its board of directors. At CSFB, James served on the executive board and as chairman of global investment banking and private equity. A 2007 Wall Street Journal article credited James with leading the acquisition process, on behalf of DLJ.[4]
In 2002, James joined global alternative asset manager The Blackstone Group, where he serves as president and chief operating officer. He also serves on the firm's executive and management committees, and its board of directors.
James is well-known within the financial industry for his effective management style. He has been credited with reorganizing Blackstone's management and creating its executive committee.[5]

James has supported the arts with endowments including the Amie and Tony James Gallery at CUNY Graduate Center in New York City, the Hamilton R. James Sculpture Acquisition Fund at the de Cordova Museum and Sculpture Park in Lincoln, Massachusetts, and the Waleska Evans James Gallery for the Karolik Collection of 19th Century American Landscapes at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston.
In 2013, James announced Blackstone LaunchPad's expansion into Montana. The Blackstone LaunchPad program is a $50 million initiative that aims to foster entrepreneurship across the country. Senator Jon Tester, who helped bring the program to Montana said, "It's about how you build an economy, how you better a state like Montana, how you keep this country on the cutting edge."[7]
Senator Tester credited James with helping to bring the Blackstone LaunchPad program to Montana. An Associated Press article reported, "Tester said he has been working to bring the program to Montana since last year, when James spoke about it during a small business workshop in Bozeman."[8]
In 2017, The New York Times reported that The Metropolitan Museum of Art's finance committee is led by James, who is also one of the board members at the Met.[9]
Politics[edit]
In May 2012, James, a Democrat, hosted a fundraiser at his home in New York for President Barack Obama, raised more than $2 million for the President's reelection campaign.[10] Under President George W. Bush, James served as a member of the President's Export Council's Subcommittee on Technology and Competitiveness.[citation needed]
James also serves on the board of the Center for American Progress (CAP), a progressive public policy research and advocacy organization.[11]

Early life and education[edit]
James was born in Wyandotte, Michigan to Hamilton and Waleska James. He grew up as the oldest of four boys in Lincoln, Massachusetts, a suburb of Boston. His father was a management consultant at Arthur D. Little. James attended The Choate School (now Choate Rosemary Hall) in Wallingford, Connecticut.[3]
James attended Harvard College, where he was a John Harvard Scholar and from which he graduated magna cum laude in 1973. He received his MBA with high distinction from Harvard Business School in 1975, where he was a Baker Scholar.
Career[edit]
In 1975, James joined investment bank Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette and became head of the firm's global M&A group in 1982. He founded DLJ Merchant Banking, Inc. in 1985. In 1995, James was appointed chairman of the firm's banking group, a position he held when DLJ was acquired in 2000 by Credit Suisse First Boston, and was a member of its board of directors. At CSFB, James served on the executive board and as chairman of global investment banking and private equity. A 2007 Wall Street Journal article credited James with leading the acquisition process, on behalf of DLJ.[4]
In 2002, James joined global alternative asset manager The Blackstone Group, where he serves as president and chief operating officer. He also serves on the firm's executive and management committees, and its board of directors.
James is well-known within the financial industry for his effective management style. He has been credited with reorganizing Blackstone's management and creating its executive committee.[5]
He was the mastermind behind Blackstone's acquisition of GSO Capital Partners, now Blackstone's credit division. He has also been keen on jumpstarting entrepreneurship across the country.[6] James is a director of Costco Wholesale Corporation and has served on a number of other corporate boards.
As of October 2015, he had a net worth of US$1.93 billion.[1]
Philanthropy[edit]
James is a philanthropist with a history of supporting conservation efforts and the arts.[citation needed]
James is a trustee of The Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and the Wildlife Conservation Society, a trustee and a member of the Executive Committee of The Second Stage Theatre, an Advisory Board member of the Montana Land Reliance, Vice Chairman of Trout Unlimited's Coldwater Conservation Fund, and Chairman Emeritus of the Board of Trustees of American Ballet Theatre, and has served on a number of other charitable boards.
James has supported the arts with endowments including the Amie and Tony James Gallery at CUNY Graduate Center in New York City, the Hamilton R. James Sculpture Acquisition Fund at the de Cordova Museum and Sculpture Park in Lincoln, Massachusetts, and the Waleska Evans James Gallery for the Karolik Collection of 19th Century American Landscapes at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston.
In 2013, James announced Blackstone LaunchPad's expansion into Montana. The Blackstone LaunchPad program is a $50 million initiative that aims to foster entrepreneurship across the country. Senator Jon Tester, who helped bring the program to Montana said, "It's about how you build an economy, how you better a state like Montana, how you keep this country on the cutting edge."[7]
Senator Tester credited James with helping to bring the Blackstone LaunchPad program to Montana. An Associated Press article reported, "Tester said he has been working to bring the program to Montana since last year, when James spoke about it during a small business workshop in Bozeman."[8]
In 2017, The New York Times reported that The Metropolitan Museum of Art's finance committee is led by James, who is also one of the board members at the Met.[9]
Politics[edit]
In May 2012, James, a Democrat, hosted a fundraiser at his home in New York for President Barack Obama, raised more than $2 million for the President's reelection campaign.[10] Under President George W. Bush, James served as a member of the President's Export Council's Subcommittee on Technology and Competitiveness.[citation needed]
James also serves on the board of the Center for American Progress (CAP), a progressive public policy research and advocacy organization.[11]
Personal life[edit]
James lives in Manhattan with his wife Amabel, whom he met while attending Harvard. They have three children.

Product Description
James D.Hamilton – Time Series Analysis

 
 
The last decade has brought dramatic changes in the way that researchers analyze economic and financial time series. This book synthesizes these recent advances and makes them accessible to first-year graduate students. James Hamilton provides the first adequate text-book treatments of important innovations such as vector autoregressions, generalized method of moments, the economic and statistical consequences of unit roots, time-varying variances, and nonlinear time series models. In addition, he presents basic tools for analyzing dynamic systems (including linear representations, autocovariance generating functions, spectral analysis, and the Kalman filter) in a way that integrates economic theory with the practical difficulties of analyzing and interpreting real-world data. Time Series Analysis fills an important need for a textbook that integrates economic theory, econometrics, and new results.
 
The book is intended to provide students and researchers with a self-contained survey of time series analysis. It starts from first principles and should be readily accessible to any beginning graduate student, while it is also intended to serve as a reference book for researchers.

                This review was written for God's Glory in Salvation Through Judgment: A Biblical  Theology.
            
 
            God's glory in Salvation through Judgment: A Biblical Theology is written by Dr. James M. Hamilton Jr., Associate Professor of Biblical Theology at The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary. The purpose of this book is to do for biblical theology what Kevin Vanhoozer has done for hermeneutics and David Wells has done for evangelical theology (page 38).


Dr. Hamilton begins the book by asking, "Can the Center Hold?, by exploring how others have treated the topic of the metanarrative of the Bible. The part in this chapter one, I appreciate the most is how he handles the various options regarding the metanarrative of the Bible, and yet he still makes the time to recognize that these options have contributed to his own understanding of the metanarrative of the Bible. The author does not just stop at what others have contributed though, but advances the discussion in my opinion in a significant way.


The book then protrudes out to look at God's glory in Salvation through Judgment in the Torah, the Prophets, the Writings, the Gospels, Acts, the Letters of the New Testament and Revelation. The second to last chapter looks at objections to the centrality of God's Glory in salvation through judgment, and concludes by looking at how God's Glory in Salvation through Judgment in Ministry Today.


Having read Dr. Wells series on evangelical theology and Dr. Vanhoozer's book, and now Dr. Hamilton's, I can say with confidence that Dr. Hamilton's book accomplishes what it seeks to do and then some. The part that I appreciate the most about this book is not only is it biblical but it is also practical. At the end of each section, Dr. Hamilton offers a "theology of" each book of the Bible as well as the major divisions of the Bible (Torah, Prophets, Writings, Gospels, Acts, Letters of the New Testament, and Revelation).


The most interesting part of this book was the last chapter titled God's Glory in Salvation through Judgment in Ministry Today where Dr. Hamilton applies his biblical theology to Church Ministry, Evangelism, Discipleship, Corrective Church Discipline, Personal Spiritual Discipline and concludes the book.


God's Glory in Salvation Through Judgment is an academic book that is not overly academic. By that, I mean this book has all the footnotes and references you would expect from a world-class scholar, but it is not boring. Dr. Hamilton has written a masterpiece a book that should be read by laymen, Pastors, seminary students, missionaries, Sunday school teachers, Bible College and Seminary Professors. I encourage you to read this book and learn from Dr. Hamilton on this vital topic.

            By far the best book I have read in a long time! I never knew reading a text book on Biblical theology could be so captivating. Hamilton starts with the premise that there is indeed still a consistent theological message throughout all of scripture. That message is that God is seeking His glory in the salvation of mankind through His judgment. He then goes section by section and book by book to prove this thesis. I think he does so in a very compelling and interesting way. I know when I finished this book I had a much fuller understanding and love of the Bible. I am sure it will bless you in the same way.

            Biblical Theology is often viewed as a difficult discipline to master, but Christians should not shy away from the study of Theology. Our task as Christians is to honor and glorify Christ and delight in Him. We do this by knowing God and making Him known.


Biblical Theology is easily defined as getting to "know" God. It's not just "knowing" about Him, but it is imperative that we "know" Him in a personal relational way.


James Hamilton, Jr. wants all of us to be able to study the Bible as a whole unit, not just 66 individual books with 66 individual central topics. He believes that there is a "central" theme to the Bible and one that we should keep in mind as we read through the Bible in a year, or study individual books and chapters of books.


Hamilton is aware that many may disagree with his premise, so early in the book he declares, "Anticipating the charge that it might be too broad to be useful, I am sharpening the proposal to focus specifically on the glory of God manifested in salvation through judgment." He then asks the question, "Can the center hold?"


His book will seek to answer the question that yes, the center can hold. He will also seek to show how the theme of God being manifested in salvation through judgment is part of each of the 66 books of the Bible. As such after a brief introduction to his topic he delves into examining each book of the Bible to show how it fits into the central theme that he is working from.


I believe that you will find that his work is thoughtful and well documented. You will be drawn to see the case that he is making and be challenged to adopt or refine his thesis. He does not shy away from sharing how other Theologians would differ with him in his thoughts. That is comforting because it shows that he is not trying to just dismiss others views to push his own.


As a Missions Pastor I teach part of the Perspectives Course every year regarding Missions the major theme of the Bible, God's Story of making His name known among the nations.


Each of us has our leanings towards how we see Scripture fitting together as a whole. I was very encouraged by Hamilton's book to contemplate on his structure and theme and see how that complimented or helped to further explain the Theme of the Bible that I have taught for years.


The work is well written and will be easy for the average laymen to understand as well as provide good material for serious Bible students to contemplate as they work through understanding the whole Theme of God's Word.


Particularly helpful is Hamilton's Analytical Outline at the beginning of the book. It will help you quickly catch the structure of his thesis as well as find a section that you might be particularly interested in.


At 640 pages this is not a quick read, but it is a very interesting one.


Enjoy!

            James M. Hamilton JR.'s biblical theology centers on God's glory in salvation through judgment. Hamilton views each book of the Bible through a lens of judgment, revealing man's sinfulness and need of a Savior. It is through understanding judgment that man is able to see and understand salvation. When salvation is received, God's glory is evident.


This biblical theology will provide the reader with great insight into each book of the Bible, as well as connecting the dots between each book, and the OT/NT in general. Apart from bringing a different perspective on the big picture of God's unfolding story, it is a solid biblical theology text and will aid the pastor in his studies. The final chapter, applying Hamilton's thesis to ministry today, was particularly helpful.


Even if one doesn't agree with each point that is made, there is no doubt the reader will sense anew God's glory and holiness. Through that lens one will understand God's righteous judgment leading to a deeper appreciation of salvation. For bible expositor's, this will be a very helpful book, one that I will reach for often.

                This review was written for Revelation: The Spirit Speaks to the Churches (Preaching the Word).
            
 
            Have you been frustrated to find a balanced commentary on the book of Revelation? I find that commentaries on Revelation fall into two camps. One falls into academic commentary. Most often, it is difficult to find practical applications to be integrated into Sunday's sermons. The other one places too much emphasis on the end-time prophecy fulfillment. It often tries to fit today's events into the biblical text.


I find Hamilton 's commentary readable by a lay person because it results from the sermons on Revelation he had the opportunity to preach twice, one at Baptist Church of the Redeemer in Houston, TX in 2005 and the other at Kenwood Baptist Church in Louisville, KY from April 2009 to April 2010. As a result, the commentary maintains a simple structure: Introduction, Body, and Conclusion. He employs a story to get the attention of the readers in his introduction. Then, he gives the overview of the text before he proceeds in a detailed discussion in the body. Finally, he concludes with the main point so that the readers can apply the teaching in their lives.


While readable, the commentary involves a serious scholarship. It interprets the symbols in Revelation from the first century Christians' context, for example, the meaning of the numbers "666" in Revelation 13:18 and the identities of the great prostitute and the beast in Revelation 17. Some have associated the numbers "666" with Papacy or with the recent technology of RFID chips being implanted in human bodies. However, Hamilton Jr. carefully evaluated the numbers as non-literal symbol. The numbers are well understood in the first century as Emperor Nero. Apostle John refers Nero as a wicked tyrant who persecuted Christians and demanded them to worship him as a god. Concerning the great prostitute and the beast, the historical reading would point to Babylon (the prostitute) and Rome (the beast). These two ancient superpowers are symbols John uses to describe the worldly powers who would entice Christians to forsake their true allegiance with God and to form an alliance with the world.


The whole commentary of Revelation can be summarized with whom we will give our allegiance. In the context of the first century Christians, they had a choice whether to be faithful followers of Jesus or to participate in the imperial cult worshipping Roman emperor as God. In our context, our faithfulness to God is also constantly tested by the allure of the world. We are also not immune from worshipping modern idols such as money, power, and sex. Hamilton refers this modern idolatry as misplaced allegiance. Therefore, he repeatedly challenges us, Christians not to forsake our allegiance with God: "Live for the Lamb not for the beast and his cheap whore" (:331). He also invites non-believers to come to trust in Jesus: "if you are an unbeliever, you are a fool if you do not repent and trust in Jesus" (:320).


I am grateful that Hamilton publishes his sermons as one of the most readable commentary on Revelation. It aims for simplicity for lay readers so that they can capture the main idea of the passages in Revelation. That main idea is our true allegiance to Jesus. For this reason, I am giving Hamilton's commentary on Revelation 5 stars.

                This review was written for Revelation: The Spirit Speaks to the Churches (Preaching the Word).
            
 
            How many times have we been told not to judge a book by its cover? This sage advice applies to everything from automobiles to Zambonis and from airplanes to zeppelins. And it also happens to be true for the popular vehicle of written words; books. This saying applies to more than books; that is clear. But it also applies to books. Such is the case for Revelation: The Spirit Speaks to the Churches. On the back of the dust jacket appears the following: "BY PASTORS FOR PASTORS". This might lead the average layperson to determine that this book is not for them. However, judging this book by these words on its cover would be a mistake. One needs to read the small print. The complete sentence on the dust jacket reads: "The Preaching the Word series is written BY PASTORS FOR PASTORS and their churches." This book is indeed for the churches, and the people in them, as well as the clergy. In Revelation: The Spirit Speaks to the Churches, Dr. Jim Hamilton Jr. has written a book, comprised of a collection of sermons, that exposits the canonical Revelation in a manner that is thorough, engaging, and practical. The format of this book and the structure of its chapters ensure a comprehensive account of this intriguing apocalyptic prophetic epistle.


As mentioned, this book is a collection of sermons. These 37 sermons were preached at Kenwood Baptist Church in Louisville, Kentucky and the thoroughness of this work is largely due to the fact that it is a compilation of preached homilies. The sections of Scripture considered in each chapter, which corresponds with a sermon on the passage selected, are successfully initiated in an introduction which includes several components. The sermons begin with an attention-grabber, often allusions to historical events and other works of literature or perhaps personal anecdotes from the author's life. I found these "hooks" very well done. They accomplished the goal they were intended for. I found myself immediately intrigued in the Scripture passage under consideration while wanting to continue reading through the sermon. The sermon introductions indicate the main point of the verses as well as making the readers aware of the need that the text addresses. Finally, the opening places the particular passage into its context in the larger book of Revelation. The repetition of this process throughout the 37 sermons was very helpful. I found that my overall understanding of the book of Revelation increased as I read the main idea of each section and was taught where it that fit into the larger scheme of this last book of the Bible. The comprehensiveness of Hamilton's teaching was aided the body of the sermon which not only includes a thorough explanation of what the passage actually said, but also offers an abundance of application to people in all walks of life. A conclusion with a restatement of concepts already covered along with many memorable illustrations filled out this already extensive treatment. The thoroughness of Hamilton's expositions of this New Testament writing might have been overwhelming were it not for the engaging style in which the book was written.


Stylistically I found this book to have a conversational feel to it. I suppose that should not be unexpected as these were oral presentations in their original form. Nevertheless, it seemed as though I had sat down for a coffee, on my dime of course, with the theologian and enjoyed the ensuing discussion centered on the last book of our Bible. It was a one-way conversation mind you, but imagine sitting at a table with a dark roast in hand and inquiring of Hamilton, "What do you think of this portion of chapter 3?" This would immediately be followed by a 10 or 15 minute explanation in which the doctor's passion and exuberance for the topic was clearly evident. That is something like the experience I seemed to have as I read this book. The aforementioned passion of the author for this topic is impossible to miss and adds to the inviting impression that this book elicits. Adding to the engaging quality of this book was its irenic tone. Considering this topic is one of great controversy, Hamilton does an admirable job of clearly and unapologetically offering his interpretation of passages while doing so in a conciliatory manner. While approaching the text from a historic premillennial position, Hamilton never writes disparagingly of other eschatological views and on several occasions produces a perspective which could be appreciated by all interested parties. The conversational style of the writing and the gracious tone of the author, mixed with a strong sense of passion, is one of the books endearing qualities. Its practical suggestions of application are the final qualities we will consider.


Hamilton does an excellent job of demonstrating how the Biblical book of Revelation can be a very practical book. Revelation soars to inestimable heights when it talks about such things as the throne room of God. It plunges to incalculable depths when it speaks of the bottomless pit. It would be understandable if one thought that this writing of the Apostle John was an impractical flight of fancy in the dreamscape of this disciple. But Hamilton grounds the apocalyptic letter with a solid sense of its applicability to everyday life. Hamilton does this effectively in two ways that I found compelling. The first is his desire to draw out a gospel call from the passage he is dealing with. Whether it be a cry for repentance based on terribleness of the tribulations ahead or a presentation of the beauty of the world to come, Hamilton shows the reader how Scripture, even seemingly fanciful passages, can apply to the unbeliever in a real and tangible way. I appreciate how Hamilton responsibly brings God's Word to bear on the heart and soul of the unregenerate. This was far more nuanced and thoughtful than a "turn or burn" slogan-esque approach. It reads as a sincere appeal to those who do not know the Lord. Similarly, Hamilton determinedly demonstrates to believers the practical import of this book and its various sections. It could be a very straightforward application such as taking Jesus' appeal for repentance from one of the seven churches and employing that as a similar request for all of us to repent. It might be something less obvious like a call to worship the greatness of God based on Yahweh's superiority when compared to an already incredibly impressive archangel. Hamilton finds creative and stirring ways of applying the Scripture to our lives which is no small feat considering the topic at hand. Hamilton walks us through, or perhaps talks us through, the head-heart-hand paradigm taking the theoretical into the practical.


Covering the content of the biblical book of Revelation thoroughly, engagingly, and practically, Hamilton's contribution to the Preaching the Word series is well worth reading. Though this would surely be a valuable resource for the preachers and pastors of Christian churches, it is no less valuable to all students of God's Word. God sovereignly delivered the wonderful prophetic book of Revelation to us in the Bible, and in Revelation: The Spirit Speaks to the Churches Hamilton has helped us all in our understanding about, rejoicing in, and applying of the " revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave him to show to his servants the things that must soon take place" (Revelation 1:1 ESV). I highly recommend this book.

                This review was written for Revelation: The Spirit Speaks to the Churches (Preaching the Word).
            
 
            Revelation: The Spirit Speaks to the Churches is a new commentary written by Southern Baptist Theological Seminary professor James Hamilton. Hamilton is known from his magnum opus, God's Glory in Salvation Through Judgment: A Biblical Theology which is an excellent and highly recommended work. There is much to commend this work, starting with its accessible content valuing clear explanation and application, which is to be expected from a book in a series entitled Preaching the Word. This commentary series is intended for pastors and others involved in the teaching ministry of the church and, through my other interactions with the series (namely Hughes and Chapell's 1 & 2 Timothy and Titus: To Guard the Deposit), I had high hopes for this entry and, presentation issues aside, I was not disappointed on the whole. Let's begin with areas that I quibbled with and then move on to what I found to be helpful...


Right off the bat, one area of disappointment is the manner in which the commentary has been put together: these are a series of teachings which are broken down and explained exactly like sermons with sections on introduction, body, and conclusion. While the structure can be helpful at times, it took away from the book's usefulness as a commentary and in some chapters is more noticeable (and thus less helpful) than in other chapters where it is virtually invisible (and thus quite helpful). While Hughes & Chapell do some of this as well, I never got the feeling while reading their text that I was reading sermon manuscripts and at the same time I could easily find their comments for any given passage.


Moving forward, the book begins with a single chapter overview of the entirety of Revelation, which is a feature that more commentaries should have as the Biblical-Theological implications of this are massive and help us to locate the teachings of the text within the larger framework of the entire revelation of Scripture. After this introduction, Hamilton then moves into his first section, Revelation 1:1-8. On the content side of the equation, the comments that Hamilton makes on the text itself are spot on and quite helpful. On the other hand, to get at those nuggets one has to dig through quite a bit of sermon text linking everything together. For example, when speaking of 1:3 (p.33), Hamilton offers some explanation of the text itself, but then launches into a section of question after question ("Is your experience of Christianity like John's?" and "Do you know the relief that comes from knowing that faith in Christ and his death on the cross makes you right before God?" amongst others). While these questions are well meant and potently asked, their helpfulness in a commentary seems at times distracting from the point that these particular verses are making. Perhaps they would make more since in a concluding application section at the end of each chapter. Speaking of, application is of course, a perennial issue in our information-overload culture, but before we can get to application we need observation and interpretation. It is in these two attributes that I occasionally was left lacking in my understanding of the text before jumping straight into the application.


On the positive side in the same chapter, Hamilton describes the blessing of reading the Book of Revelation as the "blessing of being affected by the reading and hearing of the words of this prophecy. The reading and hearing of the words of Revelation changes those who experience it. They believe what it reveals, and as a result they Ã¢â¬Ëkeep what is written in it' (p.34)." Now this is helpful stuff: Hamilton's view is that the blessing isn't some sort of undefined action that God does as a reward for reading but that instead the blessing is offered in the reading itself. The message from God itself is the blessing, which should provoke us with much food for thought.


Moving forward, Hamilton also does an adequate job of dealing with differences in interpretation (a major issue in the Book of Revelation!). To give just one example, we see that Hamilton describes the angel's purpose in 10:2-3 is to reflect Christ's glory rather than to be an apocalyptic picture of Christ Himself: "_some suggest that this angel might be Christ himself. But this figure is called Ã¢â¬Ëanother mighty angel' in the first part of 10:1_we saw a Ã¢â¬Ëmighty angel' back in 5:2_we'll see a third Ã¢â¬Ëmighty angel' in 18:21. So I don't think this angel is Jesus because there are other Ã¢â¬Ëmighty angels' in Revelation (p.224)." This is good, practical commentary, using the entire teaching of the book to show us what the book says.


Another area in which Hamilton excels is in drawing out Old Testament references and parallels. There are numerous examples of this throughout the book, but one that sticks out is found in the parallels between Ezekiel's eating of the scroll and John's eating of the scroll (to show that John is a true prophet just as Ezekiel was, p.228). Hamilton continues with a chart and explanation of how the Book of Ezekiel very much parallels the structure of Revelation (p.229). Seeing this connection is incredibly valuable to our understanding both of Revelation itself and of the Bible as a whole.


Finally, let us close by examining one more chapter. Revelation 21 gives us a picture of hope and great joy when, in a very tangible sense, God will be "with us." I am greatly pleased to see Hamilton reinforcing this picture in ways that are nothing short of worshipful. Continuing his helpful links between Old Testament and New, Hamilton states: "Verse 1 gives us the wide-angle view of the new heaven and earth, and now 21:2 seems to focus in on the new city_ here John describes the fulfillment of Isaiah 52:1, where Jerusalem, the holy city, is called to put on beautiful garments, and it also fulfills Isaiah 61:10, where the redeemed are likened to a bride who Ã¢â¬Ëadorns herself with jewels' (p.383)."


Another helpful comment is given regarding the relationship of the word-pictures that John gives us: "So this new Jerusalem is a city because God will dwell there, and it seems to be likened to a bride because God will be in covenant with his people who dwell with him there (p.384)."


In conclusion, I would recommend Revelation: The Spirit Speaks to the Churches as a worthwhile commentary provided that you have other more focused resources available to aid you as well. This is a commentary that gets right to the point of understanding the big picture of Revelation and would be well used as preparation for a small group or similar teaching role as well as for personal understanding and devotions.


(In the interest of full disclosure, I wish to note that the publisher of this book, Crossway, provided it to me at no cost as a review sample. That said, my review is in no way influenced or controlled by them and thus I write my review of this book with honesty and integrity.)
