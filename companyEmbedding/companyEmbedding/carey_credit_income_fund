                What Is Carey Credit Income Fund?
            
CCIF's current offering, Carey Credit Income Fund – I (CCIF – I), is a feeder fund in a master/feeder structure that is designed to provide its investors with: 


Current Income
Capital Preservation
Capital Appreciation, to a lesser extent



                        There is no guarantee these objectives and goals will be achieved.
                    









                HOW DOES CCIF CREATE VALUE FOR ITS INVESTORS?
            
CCIF intends to invest primarily in large, privately-negotiated loans to private middle market U.S. companies, focusing on senior secured debt investments.
CCIF seeks to provide value for the investors of its feeder funds through its experienced management team and disciplined investment strategy that seeks to capitalize on the supply/demand imbalances in the market.






Management
W. P. Carey Inc. and Guggenheim Partners, LLC, parent companies of the Advisors to CCIF, have a 50+ year aggregate track record, and both play an active role in sourcing, evaluating and monitoring portfolio investments.






Alignment
W. P. Carey Inc. and Guggenheim Partners, LLC have made an initial commitment of $50 million in CCIF, effectively aligning their interests with those of the feeder fund shareholders.1






Opportunity
U.S. middle market companies are continuously looking for capital to invest into their businesses. CCIF seeks to capitalize on the shortage in supply of financing from traditional lenders by providing loans to these companies.2




1The Sub-Advisor’s alignment of interest today is maintained by Guggenheim Partners, LLC, the parent company of Guggenheim Partners Investment Management LLC, the Sub-Advisor.
2CCIF seeks to primarily invest in the senior secured debt of private middle market American companies.

Investing in privately held middle market companies involves a number of risks including reduced access to capital, diminished ability to
withstand financial distress and limited liquidity.







 HOW WILL CCIF GUIDE INVESTORS IN THEIR SEARCH FOR INCOME?
CCIF is the master fund, which pools investor capital raised through its feeder funds—such as the current fund offering, CCIF – I. Both master and feeder share the same investment objectives and strategies. All portfolio investments are made by Carey Credit Income Fund, the master fund.


 

 Investors can only acquire shares in a feeder fund, which invests substantially all of its assets in the common shares of CCIF at net asset value, which will vary over time. CCIF, the master fund, and the feeder funds share the same investment objectives and strategies. The imposition of fees and expenses may affect a non-traded BDC’s ability to generate income.







                ExperiencedManagement Team

NEW YORK, July 27, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- W. P.

No-Action Letter: Carey Credit Income Fund (July 15, 2015)





















Home | Previous Page


























Investment Company Act of 1940  Sections 7(a), 55(a) and 23(c)
Carey Credit Income Fund and Carey Credit Income Fund 2015 T

July 15, 2015
Response of the Office of Chief Counsel
  Division of Investment Management
IM Ref. No. 20157151458
File No. 814-01117

	Our response provides assurance that we would not recommend enforcement action to the Securities and Exchange Commission ("Commission") under certain provisions of the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("Act") against certain business development companies ("BDCs") structured as a master-feeder arrangement, as detailed below.

	Specifically, in your letter, dated July 15, 2015, you request assurance that the Division of Investment Management will not recommend enforcement action to the Commission against: (A) the Feeder Funds (as defined below) (i) under section 7(a) of the Act if each elects to be regulated as a BDC pursuant to section 54 of the Act or (ii) under section 55(a) of the Act if, for purposes of determining the composition of its assets under section 55(a), each Feeder Fund looks to its proportionate ownership interest in the assets of the Master Fund (as defined below); or (B) the Master Fund under section 23(c) of the Act if the Master Fund repurchases Master Fund Shares (as defined below) in a planned liquidation of a Feeder Fund in accordance with rule 23c-1 under the Act except as described below.

  Facts

You represent as follows:


	Carey Credit Advisors, LLC ("Adviser") and Guggenheim Partners Investment Management, LLC ("Sub-Adviser" and together with the Adviser, "Advisers"), each an investment adviser registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, propose to offer a BDC structured as a master-feeder arrangement for bona fide business reasons, including economies of scale and more efficient portfolio management. The assets of each Feeder Fund will be pooled into one Master Fund, generating significant expense savings. Each Feeder Fund will have a finite term and a target liquidation date so that the Advisers will be able to manage the maturity and duration of the Master Fund’s fixed income portfolio efficiently to generate the necessary liquidity to fund the known upcoming liquidation. The master/feeder structure also will provide the Advisers with the ability to manage the liquidity of the Master Fund based on the liquidity being provided by the Feeder Funds.
    

	Carey Credit Income Fund (the "Master Fund") is a closed-end management investment company formed on September 5, 2014 as a statutory trust under the laws of the State of Delaware that has elected to be regulated as a BDC pursuant to section 54 of the Act. The Master Fund’s investment objectives will be to provide shareholders with current income, capital preservation and, to a lesser extent, long-term capital appreciation. The Master Fund intends to meet its investment objectives by investing primarily in large, privately-negotiated loans to private middle market U.S. companies. The Master Fund will engage in a continuous offering on a private placement basis of its common shares (the "Master Fund Shares").[1] The Master Fund will have an indefinite life and will not list its shares on a securities exchange. The only shareholders of the Master Fund will be the Feeder Funds (as defined below), the Adviser, and an affiliate of the Sub-Adviser who have provided seed capital. The Master Fund’s income, gains, deductions, losses and distributions will be allocated only to the Feeder Funds and the Adviser and affiliate of the Sub-Adviser based on their proportionate interest in the Master Fund.
	

	The Master Fund intends to offer a quarterly share repurchase program in which it will repurchase a certain amount of its outstanding Master Fund Shares at a price equal to the net asset value per share on the last day of the most recent quarterly reporting period via an issuer tender offer under rule 13e-4 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Rule 13e-4").
    

	The Carey Credit Income Fund 2016 T (the "Existing Feeder Fund") is a closed-end management investment company formed on September 5, 2014 as a statutory trust under the laws of the state of Delaware that will elect to be regulated as a BDC pursuant to section 54 of the Act. The Existing Feeder Fund will engage in a continuous public offering of its common shares for a finite offering period. The Existing Feeder Fund will have a finite term of no more than five years from the closing of the offering (contemplated to be on or before December 31, 2021) and will invest all or substantially all of its assets in the Master Fund.
    
	
	In the future, the Adviser may create other closed-end management investment companies that will elect to be regulated as BDCs pursuant to section 54 of the Act and invest all or substantially all of their assets in the Master Fund (each, a "Future Feeder Fund" and together with the Existing Feeder Fund, the "Feeder Funds"). No Feeder Fund will engage in any investment or borrowing activity, except indirectly through its interest in the Master Fund. Each Feeder Fund will engage in a public offering of its common shares ("Feeder Fund Shares") for a finite offering period and have a finite life of between five and 25 years.[2]

	
	Each Feeder Fund intends to offer a quarterly share repurchase program in which it will repurchase a certain amount of its outstanding Feeder Fund Shares at a price equal to the net asset value per share on the last day of the most recent quarterly reporting period via an issuer tender offer under Rule 13e-4. Each such quarterly tender offer will be conducted in parallel with the Rule 13e-4 tender offers conducted by the Master Fund.
    

	As a Feeder Fund approaches the end of its finite term, the Feeder Fund’s board of trustees will authorize the liquidation and dissolution of the Feeder Fund. Such Feeder Fund liquidation and dissolution will be effectuated by the purchase by the Master Fund for cash of all of the Master Fund Shares owned by the Feeder Fund in accordance with all the conditions of rule 23c-1 under the Act (except as described below) and the distribution of that cash to the liquidating Feeder Fund’s shareholders.
    

Legal Analysis

Section 7(a) of the Act

	Section 7(a) of the Act generally prohibits an investment company, unless registered under section 8 of the Act, from offering to sell, selling or delivering after sale any security or any interest in a security, or otherwise engaging in any business in interstate commerce. Section 6(f) of the Act makes section 8 inapplicable to a BDC. Therefore, you state, neither the Feeder Funds nor the Master Fund will be registered under section 8. You state that if a Feeder Fund does not satisfy the definition of a BDC in section 2(a)(48) of the Act, unless an exclusion or exception from registration under section 8 is available, each Feeder Fund might be in violation of section 7(a).

	You request assurance that we will not recommend enforcement action against the Feeder Funds under section 7(a) of the Act, if each Feeder Fund elects to be regulated as a business development company pursuant to section 54(a) of the Act.

Section 54(a) of the Act

	Section 54(a) of the Act generally provides that any company that meets the definition in sections 2(a)(48)(A) and (B) of the Act may elect to be subject to regulation as a BDC under the Act. Section 2(a)(48) of the Act generally defines a BDC to be any closed-end investment company that operates for the purpose of making investments in securities described in sections 55(a)(1) through (3) of the Act and makes available significant managerial assistance with respect to the issuers of those securities.[3]

	You state that each Feeder Fund will elect to be regulated as a BDC pursuant to section 54(a) of the Act. No Feeder Fund will have any direct operations other than owning Master Fund Shares. You state that the Master Fund intends to invest at least 70% of its assets in assets described in sections 55(a)(1) through (6) of the Act and to make available significant managerial assistance with respect to the issuers of those securities.

Sections 2(a)(48) and 55(a) of the Act

	The definition of a BDC under section 2(a)(48) of the Act states that a BDC is operated for the purpose of making investments in securities described in sections 55(a)(1) through (3) of the Act and makes available significant managerial assistance with respect to the issuers of those securities. Those securities generally are issued by an eligible portfolio company, as defined in section 2(a)(46) of the Act. Section 2(a)(46) excludes from the definition of an eligible portfolio company an investment company as defined in section 3 of the Act and any company that would be an investment company but for an exclusion under section 3(c) of the Act. You state that because the Master Fund will be an investment company as defined in section 3(a)(1) of the Act, Master Fund Shares will not be securities issued by an eligible portfolio company or securities described in paragraphs (1) through (3) of section 55(a). You state that because all or substantially all of each Feeder Fund’s assets will consist of Master Fund Shares, each Feeder Fund will (i) not be operated for the purpose of making direct investments in securities described in sections 55(a)(1) through (3) of the Act, and (ii) will not make available significant managerial assistance with respect to issuers of those securities. Accordingly, each Feeder Fund might not satisfy the definition of a BDC in section 2(a)(48).

	Section 55(a) of the Act generally prohibits a BDC from acquiring any assets (other than assets described in paragraphs (1) through (7) of the section) unless, at the time of acquisition, at least 70% percent of its total assets (excluding assets for sustaining its business, described in paragraph (7)) are assets described in paragraphs (1) through (6) ("Qualifying Assets"). You state that because all or substantially all of the assets of each Feeder Fund will be invested in Master Fund Shares, no Feeder Fund will have 70% of its assets invested directly in Qualifying Assets. Thus, section 55(a) might prohibit a Feeder Fund from acquiring any assets other than assets described in paragraphs (1) through (7) of section 55(a).

	You request assurances that we would not recommend enforcement action against the Feeder Funds under sections 7(a) and 55(a) of the Act if each Feeder Fund includes its respective indirect ownership interest in the Qualifying Assets of the Master Fund as its own investments for purposes of section 2(a)(48) and section 55(a) of the Act.

	In support of your request, you state that the Master Fund intends to comply with section 55(a) at all times following its commencement of operations and that the Master Fund expects to make available significant managerial assistance with respect to the issuers of those securities described in sections 55(a)(1) through (3). You represent that the proposed master-feeder structure has been established for bona fide business reasons. You represent that each Feeder Fund will be merely an entity for investing indirectly in the Master Fund’s assets and, as such, should be permitted to include its proportionate interest in the assets of the Master Fund for purposes of satisfying the definition of BDC in section 2(a)(48) of the Act and for purposes of determining the percentage of its total assets that are Qualifying Assets.

	You state that under these circumstances, allowing each Feeder Fund to treat its respective indirect ownership interest in portfolio companies of the Master Fund as its own investments and to treat the significant managerial assistance offered to those portfolio companies by the Master Fund as also offered by the Feeder Fund is consistent with the intent behind sections 2(a)(48) and 55(a) of the Act.

Section 23(c) of the Act and Rule 23c-1 under the Act

	Section 23(c) of the Act (generally made applicable to a BDC by Section 63 of the Act) prohibits a BDC from purchasing its own securities except under certain limited circumstances, including, among others, as the Commission may permit by rule. Rule 23c-1 under the Act permits a registered closed-end investment company to purchase its securities for cash subject to certain conditions. You request assurance that we would not recommend enforcement action to the Commission against the Master Fund under section 23(c) of the Act if it repurchases Master Fund Shares in a planned liquidation of a Feeder Fund in accordance with rule 23c-1 under the Act except as described below.

	Rule 23c-1(a)(3), in relevant part, provides that, if the security to be purchased is junior to any class of outstanding security of the issuer representing indebtedness, all securities of such class must have an asset coverage of at least 300% immediately after such purchase. This provision parallels the provision in section 18(a)(1)(A) of the Act that, in relevant part, makes it unlawful for any registered closed-end investment company to issue any class of senior security representing indebtedness unless, immediately after such issuance, it will have an asset coverage of at least 300%.[4] As a BDC, the Master Fund is subject to section 61(a)(1) of the Act, which provides, in relevant part, that the asset coverage requirement of section 18(a)(1)(A) of the Act applicable to BDCs shall be 200%. Accordingly, you state that the Master Fund will comply with rule 23c-1(a)(3) except that any of its outstanding securities representing indebtedness will have asset coverage of at least 200% immediately after its repurchase of the Master Fund Shares.

	Rule 23c-1(a)(4) provides that the seller of the security, to the knowledge of the issuer, not be an affiliated person of the issuer. You state that each Feeder Fund will be an affiliated person of the Master Fund, but that the proposed repurchases of Master Fund Shares from a liquidating Feeder Fund do not raise the potential for abuse that this provision was designed to address.[5] In particular, you note that the finite term of each Feeder Fund and the planned liquidation and dissolution of each Feeder Fund at the end of its finite term are key aspects of the proposed arrangement, which will be clearly disclosed to the Master Fund’s and each Feeder Fund’s shareholders. You further state that all Feeder Funds will liquidate and dissolve in the same planned manner and, therefore, you do not believe that there is a risk of overreaching in the proposed repurchases by the Master Fund from the liquidating Feeder Funds.

  Conclusion

	Based on the facts and representations set forth in your letter, we would not recommend enforcement action to the Commission against: (A) the Feeder Funds (i) under section 7(a) of the Act if each elects to be regulated as a BDC pursuant to section 54 of the Act or (ii) under section 55(a) of the Act if, for purposes of determining the composition of its assets under section 55(a), each Feeder Fund looks to its proportionate ownership interest in the assets of the Master Fund; or (B) the Master Fund under section 23(c) of the Act if the Master Fund repurchases Master Fund Shares in a planned liquidation of a Feeder Fund in accordance with rule 23c-1 under the Act except as described above.[6] Any different facts or representations might require a different conclusion. This response expresses our position on enforcement action only and does not represent any legal conclusions regarding the matters discussed in your letter.

	Vanessa M. Meeks
	Senior Counsel




[1] The Master Fund Shares will not be subject to any sales load or distribution or shareholder servicing fee. 



[2] Feeder Fund Shares may be subject to a front-end sales charge and/or an annual distribution/shareholder servicing fee and may be sold under a multi-class arrangement pursuant to a Commission exemptive order.  No Feeder Fund will be offered that has a different sales load and distribution/shareholder servicing fee structure but the same or a similar finite life as another Feeder Fund and the Master Fund will not indirectly create a multi-class structure by using the Feeder Funds to offer different classes of Master Fund Shares.		



[3] The term "making available significant managerial assistance" by a BDC is defined in section 2(a)(47) of the Act.		



[4] See Investment Company Act Release No. 415 (Dec. 11, 1942) (stating that "[t]he asset coverage requirements of [rule 23c-1(a)(3)] are the same as those prescribed by section 18 of the Act with respect to the issuance of securities and the term asset coverage as used with respect to this condition has the same meaning as defined by section 18(h) of the Act.").		



[5] See Investment Company Act Release No. 78 (Mar. 4, 1941) (stating that "[r]epurchases from affiliated persons of the issuer are not within the rule.  The abuses which may flow from such repurchases, and the consequent advisability of permitting them only upon the basis of applications describing the individual transactions, are apparent.").		



[6] The Division generally permits third parties to rely on no-action letters to the extent that the third party’s facts and circumstances are substantially similar to those described in the underlying request for the no-action letter.  See Informal Guidance Program for Small Entities, Investment Company Act Release No. 22587 (Mar. 27, 1997), n. 20.  In light of the very fact-specific nature of your request, however, we note that this letter applies only to the entities named herein, and no other entity may rely on the position stated in this letter.  We are willing to consider similar requests from other BDCs.

Nuveen Covered Call Closed-End Funds 
For income-oriented investors who are seeking the growth and diversification potential of equities, but who desire higher income and reduced volatility, covered call closed-end funds (also known as equity option closed-end funds) can be an attractive diversifying portfolio opportunity.



Covered Call Strategies for Today's Income Investors 
Nuveen's covered call closed-end funds have been designed to meet the income, risk, and diversification needs of income-oriented investors. Combining a traditional equity portfolio strategy of persistently selling covered calls, then monetizing the long-term expected total returns into quarterly cash distributions, results in the strong potential for a diversifying, higher-yielding and more stable investment.

Nuveen S&P 500 DynamicOverwrite Fund (SPXX)


Nasdaq

Nuveen Nasdaq 100 DynamicOverwrite Fund (QQQX)


DJIA

Nuveen Dow 30SM DynamicOverwrite Fund (DIAX)



What are covered call strategies?
							Covered call strategy funds invest in a portfolio of stocks, and sell call options on either individual stocks or stock indices, for the purpose of enhancing total return, reducing volatility, and providing a measure of downside protection over time.  The fund receives a premium from the buyer of the call option, and must sell or deliver the underlying stock (or cash, in the case of a stock index call option) if the call option is exercised by the buyer.  The value of the stocks that are linked to call options sold, relative to the value of full stock portfolio, is termed the Option Overwrite percentage.

Chart Definitions
Income-oriented closed-end funds make payouts largely from interest	and dividends.
Income and capital appreciation funds seek regular cash	flow made up of interest and dividends, with the remainder from capital appreciation or, if necessary, return of capital.
Capital appreciation and income closed-end funds seek cash flow mainly from capital appreciation.
Single-asset-class funds invest primarily in one asset class, which can be used as components in a well-diversified income portfolio.
Pre-packaged combinations are funds featuring multiple asset types, which are designed to work together to diversify fund cash flow risks.

Closed the Income Gap®
with Nuveen Closed-End Funds



Closed-End Funds Offer Attractive Income Potential
In the search for increased income opportunities, closed-end funds can be a smart choice. Designed and built for income, closed-end funds seek to provide regular, stable cash flow over time and can serve as a compelling tool for optimizing an income portfolio.
Consider closed-end funds if you’re seeking to:1


1


Enhance Income and Cash Flow
Because of their unique closed structure and ability to use leverage,2 closed-end funds offer potentially higher distributions3 than traditional income investments.4


2


Manage Interest Rate Risk 
Floating rate, shorter duration or equity closed-end funds may help reduce a portfolio’s interest rate sensitivity.


3


Protect Purchasing Power
Closed-end funds that invest in real assets and dividend-paying stocks, which typically increase their payments with rising inflation, may help buffer the effects of rising inflation.


4


Maximize After-Tax Efficiency
Nuveen offers a wide array of national, state specific and AMT-free municipal closed-end funds that may help reduce your tax liability on investment income.5


5


Improve Diversification
With strategies that provide access to specialized asset classes, including alternatives, Nuveen closed-end funds may enhance portfolio diversification.

There is no guarantee that any of the funds will achieve their stated objectives. For detailed information on the specific risks associated with each fund, please view the fund overview by clicking on the fund name above.
1 Goal classifications represent common investor concerns when evaluating portfolio needs, are provided for informational purposes only, and are not intended to be relied upon as investment advice or recommendations.
2 Leverage typically magnifies the total return of a fund’s portfolio, whether that return is positive or negative, and creates an opportunity for increased common share net income as well as higher volatility of net asset value, market price, and distributions. There is no assurance that a fund’s leveraging strategy will be successful.
3 Potential distribution sources include net investment income, realized gains and return of capital.  
4 Different types of asset investments have different types of risks, which may provide higher returns but also greater volatility. In general, equity securities tend to be more volatile that fixed income securities. The value of, and income generated by, debt securities will decrease or increase based on changes in market interest rates. As interest rates risk, bond prices fall. In general, below investment grade (high-yield) debt securities tend to be more volatile than investment grade securities. Preferred securities are subordinated to bonds and other debt instruments in a company's capital structure, and therefore are subject to greater credit risk. The interest and principal payments of U.S. Treasury securities are guaranteed.
5 Income may be subject to state and local income taxes and the alternative minimum tax. Capital gains, if any, will be subject to capital gains tax.

            About Our Funds
        













Investments are not FDIC-insured, nor are they deposits of or guaranteed by a bank or any other entity, so they may lose value.
Investors should carefully consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other important information is contained in the fund prospectuses and summary prospectuses, which can be obtained from a financial professional and should be read carefully before investing.



Excludes certain securities in initial period of acquisition.
Includes short-term securities, accrued income and other assets less liabilities.
Prior to September 30, 2016, securities in the Real Estate sector were reported under the Financials sector.
Figures include convertible securities; totals may not reconcile due to rounding. Methodology notes: The equity breakdown by revenue reflects the fund’s publicly traded equity holdings and excludes cash (and fixed income securities, if applicable). Underlying revenue data were compiled by MSCI and account for disparities in the way companies report their revenues across geographic segments. MSCI breaks out each company’s reported revenues into country-by-country estimates. MSCI provides revenue data figures based on a proprietary, standardized model. Revenue exposure at the fund and index level was calculated by using FactSet, which takes these company revenue exposures and multiplies by the company’s weighting in the portfolio and index. In this breakdown, Israel has been included in Europe.
Calculated by American Funds. Due to differing calculation methods, the figures shown here may differ from those calculated by Morningstar.
Calculated by Morningstar. Due to differing calculation methods, the figures shown here may differ from those calculated by American Funds.
The months indicated for dividends and capital gains paid represent the anticipated current year ex-dividend date schedule for all share classes.
Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus.
Read more information about Morningstar Style Box methodology. The model for the fixed-income style box is based on the two pillars of fixed-income performance: interest-rate sensitivity and credit quality. The three interest sensitivity groups are limited, moderate and extensive and the three credit quality groups are high, medium and low. These groupings display a portfolio's effective duration and third party credit ratings to provide an overall representation of the fund's risk orientation given the sensitivity to interest rate and credit rating of bonds in the portfolio.

Terms and Definitions


Beta: Beta relatively measures a fund's sensitivity to market movements over a specified period of time. The beta of the market (represented by the benchmark index) is equal to 1; a beta higher than 1 implies that a fund's return was more volatile than the market. A beta lower than 1 suggests that the fund was less volatile than the market. Generally the higher the R-squared measure, the more reliable the beta measurement will be. 
Bond Statistic  Average Coupon: The average coupon is the weighted average coupon rate of all the bonds in the fund.
Bond Statistic  Average Duration in Years: Expressed in years, average duration is a weighted average of the estimated price sensitivity of the bonds in the fund's portfolio to a given change in interest rates. With respect to individual bonds, for example, a duration of 4 years indicates that the price of a bond will rise/fall by approximately 4% if rates in general fall/rise by 1%. Typically, bonds with a longer duration pay higher interest but are more sensitive to interest rate changes.
Bond Statistic  Average Life in Years: Expressed in years, average life is time weighting the expected principal payments, taking into consideration the impact of calls and prepayments. In general, it is a better measure than average maturity for bonds that have the ability to prepay principal before they reach maturity (e.g., mortgages, mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities). Data shown is a weighted average of the bond funds held in the fund's portfolio.
Bond Statistic  Average Yield to Maturity: A weighted average of all the fund's bond holding's yield to maturities. Yield to maturity is the return a bond earns if held to maturity, based on its price and coupon. Assumes that coupon payments can be reinvested at the yield to maturity.
Capture Ratio  Downside: Capture ratios reflect the annualized product of fund vs. index returns for all months in which the index had a positive return (upside capture) or negative return (downside capture).
Capture Ratio  Upside: Capture ratios reflect the annualized product of fund vs. index returns for all months in which the index had a positive return (upside capture) or negative return (downside capture).
Distribution rate  12-month: The income per share paid by the fund over the past 12 months to an investor from dividends (including any special dividends). The distribution rate is expressed as a percentage of the current price.
Historical  Long-Term Capital Gains: When a capital gain distribution is paid, the net asset value per share is reduced by the amount of the payment plus or minus any change in the value of the fund's holdings. Read our explanation of the effect of a capital gain on a fund's price for details. Two types of capital gains are realized by our funds — short-term and long-term. Net short-term capital gains are distributed to shareholders as income dividends and are taxed at ordinary income tax rates. Long-term capital gain distributions are taxed at a maximum 15% rate. The information above classifies gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for more than one year as a long-term capital gain.
Historical  Regular Dividend: The share prices of all of our equity funds decrease when a dividend is paid. The share price of only one of our fixed-income funds, Capital World Bond Fund, also decreases when a dividend is paid. A fund pays a special dividend when the investment income generated by the fund exceeds the income the fund has paid in the form of dividends throughout the year. Special dividends are distributed with the last dividend payment at the end of the calendar year. Prior to January 1, 2003, short-term capital gains distributed to shareholders as income dividends and special dividends paid to shareholders were included in the aggregate income dividend dollar amount.

R-Squared: R-squared is a measure of the correlation between a particular fund's return and that of its benchmark index. A measure of 100 indicates that all of the fund's return can be explained by movements in its benchmark. Generally the higher the R-squared measure, the more reliable the beta measurement will be. Calculated by Morningstar.
Standard Deviation: Annualized standard deviation (based on monthly returns) is a common measure of absolute volatility that tells how returns over time have varied from the mean. A lower number signifies lower volatility. Calculated by Morningstar.

            About Our Funds
        













Investments are not FDIC-insured, nor are they deposits of or guaranteed by a bank or any other entity, so they may lose value.
Investors should carefully consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other important information is contained in the fund prospectuses and summary prospectuses, which can be obtained from a financial professional and should be read carefully before investing.



Excludes certain securities in initial period of acquisition.
Includes short-term securities, accrued income and other assets less liabilities.
Prior to September 30, 2016, securities in the Real Estate sector were reported under the Financials sector.
Figures include convertible securities; totals may not reconcile due to rounding. Methodology notes: The equity breakdown by revenue reflects the fund’s publicly traded equity holdings and excludes cash (and fixed income securities, if applicable). Underlying revenue data were compiled by MSCI and account for disparities in the way companies report their revenues across geographic segments. MSCI breaks out each company’s reported revenues into country-by-country estimates. MSCI provides revenue data figures based on a proprietary, standardized model. Revenue exposure at the fund and index level was calculated by using FactSet, which takes these company revenue exposures and multiplies by the company’s weighting in the portfolio and index. In this breakdown, Israel has been included in Europe.
Calculated by American Funds. Due to differing calculation methods, the figures shown here may differ from those calculated by Morningstar.
Calculated by Morningstar. Due to differing calculation methods, the figures shown here may differ from those calculated by American Funds.
The months indicated for dividends and capital gains paid represent the anticipated current year ex-dividend date schedule for all share classes.
Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus.
Read more information about Morningstar Style Box methodology. The model for the fixed-income style box is based on the two pillars of fixed-income performance: interest-rate sensitivity and credit quality. The three interest sensitivity groups are limited, moderate and extensive and the three credit quality groups are high, medium and low. These groupings display a portfolio's effective duration and third party credit ratings to provide an overall representation of the fund's risk orientation given the sensitivity to interest rate and credit rating of bonds in the portfolio.

Terms and Definitions


Beta: Beta relatively measures a fund's sensitivity to market movements over a specified period of time. The beta of the market (represented by the benchmark index) is equal to 1; a beta higher than 1 implies that a fund's return was more volatile than the market. A beta lower than 1 suggests that the fund was less volatile than the market. Generally the higher the R-squared measure, the more reliable the beta measurement will be. 
Bond Statistic  Average Coupon: The average coupon is the weighted average coupon rate of all the bonds in the fund.
Bond Statistic  Average Duration in Years: Expressed in years, average duration is a weighted average of the estimated price sensitivity of the bonds in the fund's portfolio to a given change in interest rates. With respect to individual bonds, for example, a duration of 4 years indicates that the price of a bond will rise/fall by approximately 4% if rates in general fall/rise by 1%. Typically, bonds with a longer duration pay higher interest but are more sensitive to interest rate changes.
Bond Statistic  Average Life in Years: Expressed in years, average life is time weighting the expected principal payments, taking into consideration the impact of calls and prepayments. In general, it is a better measure than average maturity for bonds that have the ability to prepay principal before they reach maturity (e.g., mortgages, mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities). Data shown is a weighted average of the bond funds held in the fund's portfolio.
Bond Statistic  Average Yield to Maturity: A weighted average of all the fund's bond holding's yield to maturities. Yield to maturity is the return a bond earns if held to maturity, based on its price and coupon. Assumes that coupon payments can be reinvested at the yield to maturity.
Capture Ratio  Downside: Capture ratios reflect the annualized product of fund vs. index returns for all months in which the index had a positive return (upside capture) or negative return (downside capture).
Capture Ratio  Upside: Capture ratios reflect the annualized product of fund vs. index returns for all months in which the index had a positive return (upside capture) or negative return (downside capture).
Distribution rate  12-month: The income per share paid by the fund over the past 12 months to an investor from dividends (including any special dividends). The distribution rate is expressed as a percentage of the current price.
Historical  Long-Term Capital Gains: When a capital gain distribution is paid, the net asset value per share is reduced by the amount of the payment plus or minus any change in the value of the fund's holdings. Read our explanation of the effect of a capital gain on a fund's price for details. Two types of capital gains are realized by our funds — short-term and long-term.

            About Our Funds
        













Investments are not FDIC-insured, nor are they deposits of or guaranteed by a bank or any other entity, so they may lose value.
Investors should carefully consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other important information is contained in the fund prospectuses and summary prospectuses, which can be obtained from a financial professional and should be read carefully before investing.



Excludes certain securities in initial period of acquisition.
Includes short-term securities, accrued income and other assets less liabilities.
Prior to September 30, 2016, securities in the Real Estate sector were reported under the Financials sector.
Figures include convertible securities; totals may not reconcile due to rounding. Methodology notes: The equity breakdown by revenue reflects the fund’s publicly traded equity holdings and excludes cash (and fixed income securities, if applicable). Underlying revenue data were compiled by MSCI and account for disparities in the way companies report their revenues across geographic segments. MSCI breaks out each company’s reported revenues into country-by-country estimates. MSCI provides revenue data figures based on a proprietary, standardized model. Revenue exposure at the fund and index level was calculated by using FactSet, which takes these company revenue exposures and multiplies by the company’s weighting in the portfolio and index. In this breakdown, Israel has been included in Europe.
Calculated by American Funds. Due to differing calculation methods, the figures shown here may differ from those calculated by Morningstar.
Calculated by Morningstar. Due to differing calculation methods, the figures shown here may differ from those calculated by American Funds.
The months indicated for dividends and capital gains paid represent the anticipated current year ex-dividend date schedule for all share classes.
Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus.
Read more information about Morningstar Style Box methodology. The model for the fixed-income style box is based on the two pillars of fixed-income performance: interest-rate sensitivity and credit quality. The three interest sensitivity groups are limited, moderate and extensive and the three credit quality groups are high, medium and low. These groupings display a portfolio's effective duration and third party credit ratings to provide an overall representation of the fund's risk orientation given the sensitivity to interest rate and credit rating of bonds in the portfolio.

Some of the information contained herein: (1) is proprietary to Morningstar and/or its content providers; (2) may not be copied or distributed; and (3) is not warranted to be accurate, complete or timely. Neither Morningstar, its content providers nor the American Funds are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Information is calculated by Morningstar. Due to differing calculation methods, the figures shown here may differ from those calculated by American Funds.





Terms and Definitions


Beta: Beta relatively measures a fund's sensitivity to market movements over a specified period of time. The beta of the market (represented by the benchmark index) is equal to 1; a beta higher than 1 implies that a fund's return was more volatile than the market. A beta lower than 1 suggests that the fund was less volatile than the market. Generally the higher the R-squared measure, the more reliable the beta measurement will be. 
Bond Statistic  Average Coupon: The average coupon is the weighted average coupon rate of all the bonds in the fund.
Bond Statistic  Average Duration in Years: Expressed in years, average duration is a weighted average of the estimated price sensitivity of the bonds in the fund's portfolio to a given change in interest rates. With respect to individual bonds, for example, a duration of 4 years indicates that the price of a bond will rise/fall by approximately 4% if rates in general fall/rise by 1%. Typically, bonds with a longer duration pay higher interest but are more sensitive to interest rate changes.
Bond Statistic  Average Life in Years: Expressed in years, average life is time weighting the expected principal payments, taking into consideration the impact of calls and prepayments. In general, it is a better measure than average maturity for bonds that have the ability to prepay principal before they reach maturity (e.g., mortgages, mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities). Data shown is a weighted average of the bond funds held in the fund's portfolio.
Bond Statistic  Average Yield to Maturity: A weighted average of all the fund's bond holding's yield to maturities. Yield to maturity is the return a bond earns if held to maturity, based on its price and coupon. Assumes that coupon payments can be reinvested at the yield to maturity.
Capture Ratio  Downside: Capture ratios reflect the annualized product of fund vs. index returns for all months in which the index had a positive return (upside capture) or negative return (downside capture).
Capture Ratio  Upside: Capture ratios reflect the annualized product of fund vs. index returns for all months in which the index had a positive return (upside capture) or negative return (downside capture).
Distribution rate  12-month: The income per share paid by the fund over the past 12 months to an investor from dividends (including any special dividends). The distribution rate is expressed as a percentage of the current price.
Historical  Long-Term Capital Gains: When a capital gain distribution is paid, the net asset value per share is reduced by the amount of the payment plus or minus any change in the value of the fund's holdings. Read our explanation of the effect of a capital gain on a fund's price for details. Two types of capital gains are realized by our funds — short-term and long-term. Net short-term capital gains are distributed to shareholders as income dividends and are taxed at ordinary income tax rates. Long-term capital gain distributions are taxed at a maximum 15% rate. The information above classifies gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for more than one year as a long-term capital gain.
Historical  Regular Dividend: The share prices of all of our equity funds decrease when a dividend is paid. The share price of only one of our fixed-income funds, Capital World Bond Fund, also decreases when a dividend is paid. A fund pays a special dividend when the investment income generated by the fund exceeds the income the fund has paid in the form of dividends throughout the year. Special dividends are distributed with the last dividend payment at the end of the calendar year. Prior to January 1, 2003, short-term capital gains distributed to shareholders as income dividends and special dividends paid to shareholders were included in the aggregate income dividend dollar amount.
Historical  Short-Term Capital Gains: When a capital gain distribution is paid, the net asset value per share is reduced by the amount of the payment plus or minus any change in the value of the fund's holdings. Read our explanation of the effect of a capital gain on a fund's price for details. Two types of capital gains are realized by our funds — short-term and long-term. Net short-term capital gains are distributed to shareholders as income dividends and are taxed at ordinary income tax rates. Long-term capital gain distributions are taxed at a maximum 15% rate.
Historical  Special Dividend: The share prices of all of our equity funds decrease when a dividend is paid. The share price of only one of our fixed-income funds, Capital World Bond Fund, also decreases when a dividend is paid. A fund pays a special dividend when the investment income generated by the fund exceeds the income the fund has paid in the form of dividends throughout the year. Special dividends are distributed with the last dividend payment at the end of the calendar year. Prior to January 1, 2003, short-term capital gains distributed to shareholders as income dividends and special dividends paid to shareholders were included in the aggregate income dividend dollar amount.
R-Squared: R-squared is a measure of the correlation between a particular fund's return and that of its benchmark index. A measure of 100 indicates that all of the fund's return can be explained by movements in its benchmark. Generally the higher the R-squared measure, the more reliable the beta measurement will be. Calculated by Morningstar.
Standard Deviation: Annualized standard deviation (based on monthly returns) is a common measure of absolute volatility that tells how returns over time have varied from the mean. A lower number signifies lower volatility. Calculated by Morningstar.

Dividends Taken in Cash
Dividend Reinvested














Figures shown are past results and are not predictive of results in future periods. Current and future results may be lower or higher than those shown. Share prices and returns will vary, so investors may lose money. Investing for short periods makes losses more likely. View fund expense ratios and returns.
Returns shown at net asset value (NAV) have all distributions reinvested. If a sales charge had been deducted, the results would have been lower.
Investments are not FDIC-insured, nor are they deposits of or guaranteed by a bank or any other entity, so they may lose value.
Investors should carefully consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other important information is contained in the fund prospectuses and summary prospectuses, which can be obtained from a financial professional and should be read carefully before investing.
The return of principal for bond funds and for funds with significant underlying bond holdings is not guaranteed. Fund shares are subject to the same interest rate, inflation and credit risks associated with the underlying bond holdings. Lower rated bonds are subject to greater fluctuations in value and risk of loss of income and principal than higher rated bonds.
For more information about the risks associated with each fund, go to its detailed fund information page or read the prospectus.
State-specific tax-exempt funds are more susceptible to factors adversely affecting issuers of their states' tax-exempt securities than more widely diversified municipal bond funds. Income from municipal bonds may be subject to state or local income taxes and/or the federal alternative minimum tax. Certain other income, as well as capital gain distributions, may be taxable.
Investment results assume all distributions are reinvested and reflect applicable fees and expenses.
When applicable, investment results reflect fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements, without which results would have been lower. Read details about how waivers and/or reimbursements affect the results for each fund. View results and yields without fee waiver and/or expense reimbursement

For Class A Shares, this chart tracks the total returns since the fund's inception date (Thursday, August 14, 1986) through December 31, 2016.  Fund returns and, if available, index returns are for calendar years except for the inception year (1986), which may not be a full calendar year. In cases where the index was launched after the fund inception, the index returns are shown in calender years.

Returns shown at net asset value (NAV) have all distributions reinvested. If a sales charge had been deducted, the results would have been lower.
Returns with sales charge for Class A shares reflect payment of the -32768.00% maximum sales charge.
Investments are not FDIC-insured, nor are they deposits of or guaranteed by a bank or any other entity, so they may lose value.
Investors should carefully consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other important information is contained in the fund prospectuses and summary prospectuses, which can be obtained from a financial professional and should be read carefully before investing.

State-specific tax-exempt funds are more susceptible to factors adversely affecting issuers of their states' tax-exempt securities than more widely diversified municipal bond funds. Income from municipal bonds may be subject to state or local income taxes and/or the federal alternative minimum tax. Certain other income, as well as capital gain distributions, may be taxable.
There may have been periods when the fund(s) lagged the index(es). Certain market indexes are unmanaged and, therefore, have no expenses. Investors cannot invest directly in an index.
Investment results assume all distributions are reinvested and reflect applicable fees and expenses.
When applicable, investment results reflect fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements, without which results would have been lower. Read details about how waivers and/or reimbursements affect the results for each fund. View results and yields without fee waiver and/or expense reimbursement
  .



Barclays Municipal Virginia Index did not exist prior to June 30, 1993. Therefore, results are measured from June 30, 1993, and are based on the corresponding value of the hypothetical $10,000 investment in the fund on that date.
YTD (year-to-date return): the net change in the value of the fund's shares (in percentage terms) from January 1, 2017, to the current date shown above.
For bond funds, the maximum initial sales charge was 4.75% prior to 1/10/2000.

            About Our Funds
        













Investments are not FDIC-insured, nor are they deposits of or guaranteed by a bank or any other entity, so they may lose value.
Investors should carefully consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other important information is contained in the fund prospectuses and summary prospectuses, which can be obtained from a financial professional and should be read carefully before investing.



Excludes certain securities in initial period of acquisition.
Includes short-term securities, accrued income and other assets less liabilities.
Prior to September 30, 2016, securities in the Real Estate sector were reported under the Financials sector.
Figures include convertible securities; totals may not reconcile due to rounding. Methodology notes: The equity breakdown by revenue reflects the fund’s publicly traded equity holdings and excludes cash (and fixed income securities, if applicable). Underlying revenue data were compiled by MSCI and account for disparities in the way companies report their revenues across geographic segments. MSCI breaks out each company’s reported revenues into country-by-country estimates. MSCI provides revenue data figures based on a proprietary, standardized model. Revenue exposure at the fund and index level was calculated by using FactSet, which takes these company revenue exposures and multiplies by the company’s weighting in the portfolio and index. In this breakdown, Israel has been included in Europe.
Calculated by American Funds. Due to differing calculation methods, the figures shown here may differ from those calculated by Morningstar.
Calculated by Morningstar. Due to differing calculation methods, the figures shown here may differ from those calculated by American Funds.
The months indicated for dividends and capital gains paid represent the anticipated current year ex-dividend date schedule for all share classes.
Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus.
Read more information about Morningstar Style Box methodology. The model for the fixed-income style box is based on the two pillars of fixed-income performance: interest-rate sensitivity and credit quality. The three interest sensitivity groups are limited, moderate and extensive and the three credit quality groups are high, medium and low. These groupings display a portfolio's effective duration and third party credit ratings to provide an overall representation of the fund's risk orientation given the sensitivity to interest rate and credit rating of bonds in the portfolio.

Terms and Definitions


Beta: Beta relatively measures a fund's sensitivity to market movements over a specified period of time. The beta of the market (represented by the benchmark index) is equal to 1; a beta higher than 1 implies that a fund's return was more volatile than the market. A beta lower than 1 suggests that the fund was less volatile than the market. Generally the higher the R-squared measure, the more reliable the beta measurement will be. 
Bond Statistic  Average Coupon: The average coupon is the weighted average coupon rate of all the bonds in the fund.
Bond Statistic  Average Duration in Years: Expressed in years, average duration is a weighted average of the estimated price sensitivity of the bonds in the fund's portfolio to a given change in interest rates. With respect to individual bonds, for example, a duration of 4 years indicates that the price of a bond will rise/fall by approximately 4% if rates in general fall/rise by 1%. Typically, bonds with a longer duration pay higher interest but are more sensitive to interest rate changes.
Bond Statistic  Average Life in Years: Expressed in years, average life is time weighting the expected principal payments, taking into consideration the impact of calls and prepayments. In general, it is a better measure than average maturity for bonds that have the ability to prepay principal before they reach maturity (e.g., mortgages, mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities). Data shown is a weighted average of the bond funds held in the fund's portfolio.
Bond Statistic  Average Yield to Maturity: A weighted average of all the fund's bond holding's yield to maturities. Yield to maturity is the return a bond earns if held to maturity, based on its price and coupon. Assumes that coupon payments can be reinvested at the yield to maturity.
Capture Ratio  Downside: Capture ratios reflect the annualized product of fund vs. index returns for all months in which the index had a positive return (upside capture) or negative return (downside capture).
Capture Ratio  Upside: Capture ratios reflect the annualized product of fund vs. index returns for all months in which the index had a positive return (upside capture) or negative return (downside capture).
Distribution rate  12-month: The income per share paid by the fund over the past 12 months to an investor from dividends (including any special dividends). The distribution rate is expressed as a percentage of the current price.
Historical  Long-Term Capital Gains: When a capital gain distribution is paid, the net asset value per share is reduced by the amount of the payment plus or minus any change in the value of the fund's holdings. Read our explanation of the effect of a capital gain on a fund's price for details. Two types of capital gains are realized by our funds — short-term and long-term. Net short-term capital gains are distributed to shareholders as income dividends and are taxed at ordinary income tax rates. Long-term capital gain distributions are taxed at a maximum 15% rate. The information above classifies gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for more than one year as a long-term capital gain.
Historical  Regular Dividend: The share prices of all of our equity funds decrease when a dividend is paid. The share price of only one of our fixed-income funds, Capital World Bond Fund, also decreases when a dividend is paid. A fund pays a special dividend when the investment income generated by the fund exceeds the income the fund has paid in the form of dividends throughout the year. Special dividends are distributed with the last dividend payment at the end of the calendar year. Prior to January 1, 2003, short-term capital gains distributed to shareholders as income dividends and special dividends paid to shareholders were included in the aggregate income dividend dollar amount.
Historical  Short-Term Capital Gains: When a capital gain distribution is paid, the net asset value per share is reduced by the amount of the payment plus or minus any change in the value of the fund's holdings. Read our explanation of the effect of a capital gain on a fund's price for details. Two types of capital gains are realized by our funds — short-term and long-term. Net short-term capital gains are distributed to shareholders as income dividends and are taxed at ordinary income tax rates. Long-term capital gain distributions are taxed at a maximum 15% rate.
Historical  Special Dividend: The share prices of all of our equity funds decrease when a dividend is paid. The share price of only one of our fixed-income funds, Capital World Bond Fund, also decreases when a dividend is paid. A fund pays a special dividend when the investment income generated by the fund exceeds the income the fund has paid in the form of dividends throughout the year. Special dividends are distributed with the last dividend payment at the end of the calendar year. Prior to January 1, 2003, short-term capital gains distributed to shareholders as income dividends and special dividends paid to shareholders were included in the aggregate income dividend dollar amount.
R-Squared: R-squared is a measure of the correlation between a particular fund's return and that of its benchmark index. A measure of 100 indicates that all of the fund's return can be explained by movements in its benchmark. Generally the higher the R-squared measure, the more reliable the beta measurement will be. Calculated by Morningstar.
Standard Deviation: Annualized standard deviation (based on monthly returns) is a common measure of absolute volatility that tells how returns over time have varied from the mean. A lower number signifies lower volatility. Calculated by Morningstar.

Dividends Taken in Cash
Dividend Reinvested














Figures shown are past results and are not predictive of results in future periods. Current and future results may be lower or higher than those shown. Share prices and returns will vary, so investors may lose money. Investing for short periods makes losses more likely. View fund expense ratios and returns.
Returns shown at net asset value (NAV) have all distributions reinvested. If a sales charge had been deducted, the results would have been lower.
Investments are not FDIC-insured, nor are they deposits of or guaranteed by a bank or any other entity, so they may lose value.
Investors should carefully consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other important information is contained in the fund prospectuses and summary prospectuses, which can be obtained from a financial professional and should be read carefully before investing.
The return of principal for bond funds and for funds with significant underlying bond holdings is not guaranteed. Fund shares are subject to the same interest rate, inflation and credit risks associated with the underlying bond holdings. Lower rated bonds are subject to greater fluctuations in value and risk of loss of income and principal than higher rated bonds.
For more information about the risks associated with each fund, go to its detailed fund information page or read the prospectus.
State-specific tax-exempt funds are more susceptible to factors adversely affecting issuers of their states' tax-exempt securities than more widely diversified municipal bond funds. Income from municipal bonds may be subject to state or local income taxes and/or the federal alternative minimum tax. Certain other income, as well as capital gain distributions, may be taxable.
Investment results assume all distributions are reinvested and reflect applicable fees and expenses.
When applicable, investment results reflect fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements, without which results would have been lower. Read details about how waivers and/or reimbursements affect the results for each fund. View results and yields without fee waiver and/or expense reimbursement

Barclays Municipal Virginia Index did not exist prior to June 30, 1993. Therefore, results are measured from June 30, 1993, and are based on the corresponding value of the hypothetical $10,000 investment in the fund on that date.
YTD (year-to-date return): the net change in the value of the fund's shares (in percentage terms) from January 1, 2017, to the current date shown above.
For bond funds, the maximum initial sales charge was 4.75% prior to 1/10/2000.
