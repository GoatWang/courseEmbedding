Custom  Computer Programming










Computer Programming For Any Platform


Our mission at Surge is to provide high-end software programming and consulting services to our clients that are unmatched in the industry. Our expert US onshore team will build your custom software solution up to 40% faster with 100% precision.



Quality Code Matters
Quality code matters to us and it should matter to you. Not only will your code be built to meet your current needs, it will be built to facilitate future needs.  This is significant when you want to add new features, cross platforms, or make updates down the road. This is also one of the major differences between good code and bad code. All of our software solutions deliver functions and features that are built on-spec, as well as scalable, reliable, and robust.

 




Not All Code is Equal





Any Platform, Any Code
One of our core competencies is versatility. Whatever your needs may be, our diverse team of software engineers, designers, and testers who specialize in every major software development platform available will make your software dreams a reality. From database design to web application development, systems integration to cloud consulting, mobile app development to Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), or software product development, we have the experience, expertise, and technology to build your next software application.



US-Based Developers and Designers
We know that you have a lot of options when it comes to software programming. Offshoring can certainly be an attractive option when considering the (assumed) cost savings. However, in the end, offshoring usually costs you more time, money, and frustration than you originally planned. At Surge, we only employ highly-trained, highly-experienced, US-based programmers and designers.

Transparent and Honest
We believe in providing a high level of transparency to our clients, abiding by our core principles, and always communicating honestly and frequently. From small businesses to Fortune 500 companies, we’ve worked with them all and we anxiously welcome a new project and challenge from you. Request a free estimate today and let us earn your trust and business.

No Cookie-Cutter Solutions
We take custom software development projects very seriously. They are our specialty for a reason. We take the time to get to know not only your idea, but also your company and your industry. This allows us to suggest just the right tools, technologies, and frameworks to accomplish your goals. Every custom software development project is just that, custom. With every new project, we start with a blank canvas. We get to know you and your project then, and only then, do we suggest the right tools for the job.

We Build Custom Software For Any Platform


Our mission at Surge is to provide high-end software development & consulting services to our clients that are unmatched in the industry. Our expert onshore team will build your software solution up to 40% faster with 100% precision.

Everything Agile
After years of business, we know that plans often change. That’s why we’re passionate proponents of the Agile development method. Every project is given a road map, then broken down into “sprints” as we execute rapid delivery of your project one element at a time. This guarantees that every component is either done to your satisfaction or given modifications at your request. We’ve perfected the process of adaptation and collaboration between our teams and our clients, and the end result is a thing of beauty. 

100% Scrum Certified
At Surge, we require all of our Project Managers to be scrum certified in order to ensure the highest level of productivity, transparency, and success. Rest assured, your next project will be managed in an efficient and organized manner. This is just one of the ways we maximize your dollar and quicken your timeline.



Quality Code Matters

  Vendor Collaboration









Paperless Purchase Orders for vendors.American Software Inc. has expanded its existing e-applications “Paperless Purchase Order” system to provide Vendor Web-Site with a secured Login by the vendor.
The “PO Tracking” allows the buyer/ planner and vendor to track PO Acknowledgement, PO Acceptance, PO Changes, and PO Shipments. The user can view all open PO’s, delinquent PO’s, and closed PO’s.
Vendor can change the “Promise Ship Date” on any PO line items. This “Promise ship date” will be updated real-time on the host (AS400 or System/390).
Any “Promise date” changes that are outside of tolerance (acceptable range) will be routed to the planner for “Electronic Approvals”.
As events occur such as the above PO changes and approvals, the system automatically records messages into “PO Collaboration History”. The buyer/ planner and vendor can enter freeform messages for the PO and/ or PO line items that will be stored as “PO Collaboration History” on the web server. This history of messages (both automatic event and ad hoc messages) is available real-time to buyer /planners and vendors.
The “Message Center” displays all unread messages that were targeted for the buyer or vendor.
The buyers are provided automatic e-mail alerts about late acknowledgements and delinquent Purchase Orders. The buyers and planners have access to their PO Status information and Vendor feedback information.
Benefits of the e-forms Purchase Order Tracking and Vendor Interaction module

Improve Supply Chain Cycle Time over manual faxes or mail
Automate many of the buyer and planner processes
Provide easy and quick Vendor Interaction that’s rewarding for you and your Vendors
Provide the information needed to really control the Purchase Orders and the purchasing process
Reduce the administrative cost of document processing by lowering postage, labor, material and storage

American Software’s e-applications (e-business suite of solutions) help companies leverage the full value of their existing ERP and legacy systems. These e-business solutions can be easily added to your ERP system with a very fast implementation and payback.

Sysmex America, Inc. Announces XN-V Series™ Software for Automated Hematology Analyzer for Scientific Research










[July 25, 2017]


Sysmex America, Inc. Announces XN-V Series™ Software for Automated Hematology Analyzer for Scientific Research







LINCOLNSHIRE, Ill., July 25, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Sysmex America, Inc., a leading provider of automated hematology and urinalysis diagnostic testing equipment, as well as middleware information systems technology, today announced that it launched the XN-V Series Software for Automated Hematology Analyzers* in the United States and Canada. "Today, Sysmex America introduces the next generation of hematology analyzers geared toward the acceleration of research in the scientific community. The XN-V Series hematology systems may advance multispecies hematology technology with the same cell analysis channels that are used in today's leading medical institutions and laboratories," said Dr. Simon Shorter, senior director of product marketing.  



The XN-V Series of analyzers include specialized software to test a broad range of laboratory animal species including mouse, rat, non-human primate, cattle, plus other species and sub-species. In addition to the pre-loaded species, the software is customizable with manual gating for each paameter which allows for the creation of other protocols. "The system has powerful and intuitive software offering the flexibility in data analysis that will enable laboratories to explore new testing protocols which may lead to scientific breakthroughs," said Shorter. 



"The XN-V, comparable to the XN-Series designed for in vitro diagnosis use in humans, offers the reliability and high accuracy data required by the scientific community," said Shorter. The XN-V Series offers 35 whole blood parameters including white blood cells (WBC), reticulocytes, nucleated red blood cells (NRBC) and platelet-F (PLT-F – fluorescent platelet counts). The system requires minimal sample volumes including: 88µl for whole blood, down to 50µl in low aspiration mode. The system also offers a body fluid mode resulting in 7 reportable parameters. 
Interested laboratories should contact their local Sysmex representative or visit http://www.sysmex.com/XNV.
* For Animal Use Only.
About Sysmex America, Inc.
Sysmex America, Inc. distributes and supports a diverse portfolio of best-in-class, in vitro diagnostic hematology and clinical laboratory products in the U.S., Canada and Latin America. It is the U.S. headquarters of Sysmex Corporation, located in Kobe, Japan, a trusted world leader in clinical laboratory solutions that optimize efficiency, operations and financial performance in the lab.

Custom  Computer Programming










Computer Programming For Any Platform


Our mission at Surge is to provide high-end software programming and consulting services to our clients that are unmatched in the industry. Our expert US onshore team will build your custom software solution up to 40% faster with 100% precision.



Quality Code Matters
Quality code matters to us and it should matter to you. Not only will your code be built to meet your current needs, it will be built to facilitate future needs.  This is significant when you want to add new features, cross platforms, or make updates down the road. This is also one of the major differences between good code and bad code. All of our software solutions deliver functions and features that are built on-spec, as well as scalable, reliable, and robust.

 




Not All Code is Equal





Any Platform, Any Code
One of our core competencies is versatility. Whatever your needs may be, our diverse team of software engineers, designers, and testers who specialize in every major software development platform available will make your software dreams a reality. From database design to web application development, systems integration to cloud consulting, mobile app development to Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), or software product development, we have the experience, expertise, and technology to build your next software application.



US-Based Developers and Designers
We know that you have a lot of options when it comes to software programming. Offshoring can certainly be an attractive option when considering the (assumed) cost savings. However, in the end, offshoring usually costs you more time, money, and frustration than you originally planned. At Surge, we only employ highly-trained, highly-experienced, US-based programmers and designers.

Transparent and Honest
We believe in providing a high level of transparency to our clients, abiding by our core principles, and always communicating honestly and frequently. From small businesses to Fortune 500 companies, we’ve worked with them all and we anxiously welcome a new project and challenge from you. Request a free estimate today and let us earn your trust and business.

We Build Custom Software For Any Platform


Our mission at Surge is to provide high-end software development & consulting services to our clients that are unmatched in the industry. Our expert onshore team will build your software solution up to 40% faster with 100% precision.

Everything Agile
After years of business, we know that plans often change. That’s why we’re passionate proponents of the Agile development method. Every project is given a road map, then broken down into “sprints” as we execute rapid delivery of your project one element at a time. This guarantees that every component is either done to your satisfaction or given modifications at your request. We’ve perfected the process of adaptation and collaboration between our teams and our clients, and the end result is a thing of beauty. 

100% Scrum Certified
At Surge, we require all of our Project Managers to be scrum certified in order to ensure the highest level of productivity, transparency, and success. Rest assured, your next project will be managed in an efficient and organized manner. This is just one of the ways we maximize your dollar and quicken your timeline.



Quality Code Matters
Quality code matters to us and it should matter to you. Not only will your code be built to meet your current needs, it will be built to facilitate future needs.  This is significant when you want to add new features, cross platforms, or make updates down the road.

No Cookie-Cutter Solutions

This allows us to suggest just the right tools, technologies, and frameworks to accomplish your goals. Every custom software development project is just that, custom. With every new project, we start with a blank canvas. We get to know you and your project then, and only then, do we suggest the right tools for the job.

Raymond C McAleer | Amazon Customer









You only need 1 malware tool - PCMATIC!

Robert | Amazon Customer









So happy to have PC MATIC by my side
They keep my computer running smoothly and are quick to handle your needs. What an awesome company. Thank You! PC MATIC....

This program is very user-friendly and has more features to protect my computer than the Norton 360 and I was currently using.

I am worry free with my computer.
I think I am in my third year using PC Matic, and tried all of the rest over the years and none of them even came close to protecting me like PC Matic does.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
