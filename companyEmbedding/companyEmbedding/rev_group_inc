Momentum demands movement.
Tim Sullivan
REV Group, Inc., President and CEO





Welcome to REV Group, Inc.
REV is not an acronym. It’s a statement that drives home our company’s commitment and momentum to connect and protect communities through our products. In short, we strive to build “vehicles for life.”
From emergency to recreation, from bus to street sweeper, it’s our goal to become No. 1 in every market we serve. Already, we manufacture many of the nation’s top buses, ambulances, fire apparatus, mobility equipment, street sweepers, terminal trucks and recreation vehicles. REV Group itself is an industry-leading company, generating more than $2 billion in annual revenue with more than 20,000 vehicle sales per year. And regardless of industry, we plan to deliver on our goal with a speed and passion that only a revved-up corporation experiences when focused on the road ahead.

VEHICLES FOR LIFE, NOW
BUSINESS PARTNERS FOR LIFE.






The benefits of REV Group's equipment financing services
Reason #1 ... we're business partners, even after the sale
As a $2 billion company (and growing), we understand what it means to run a business. We understand the value of cash flow, flexible payments and tax benefits, so we built our equipment financing program to maximize the bottom dollar. Whether you’re considering a lease or a loan, there are many benefits to choosing REV Financial Services …





 



Conserve Your Cash Flow
1. No down payment options You can acquire the equipment with no down payment. We can book loans and lease transactions with no cash down.
2. Save your current bank lines of credit By using REV Financial Services, your business can keep its current bank lines of credit for growth projects and other investments.
3. Manage your cash flow With REV Financial Services, our financing options let you schedule your payments to fit changes in your cash flow. For companies with contract and seasonal cash flow fluctuations, your financing contract can be structured to provide step-up or step-down payments. We also can schedule your contract with skip payments during slow months or plan annual, semi-annual, quarterly or monthly payments.


 



Flexible Equipment Financing Programs
1. Flexible payment schedules Take advantage of flexible payment schedules to allow for seasonality in your business or contracts. We have financial solutions to suit any scenario.
2. End-of-term options At REV Financial Services, you can choose a number of contract term end equipment options. We can schedule a walk-away lease on your equipment purchase. Simply operate the equipment during term and then turn in the equipment at lease end.
3. Application process We offer application-only approvals up to $250K. Credit approval is quick and easy.


 



More REV Financial Service Benefits
1. Keep your equipment updated Keeping your fleet updated with the latest options and technological advances can give you a decided edge in this competitive market. By working with REV Financial Services, you can upgrade to new and better equipment during or at the end of the equipment contract term.
2. Tax benefits Depending on whether you are financing through a lease or a loan product, your payments may be treated as a fully deductible operating expense, or you may depreciate the equipment. These deductions can reduce your tax liability.

From emergency to recreation, from bus to street sweeper, it’s our goal to become No. 1 in every market we serve. Already, we manufacture many of the nation’s top buses, ambulances, fire apparatus, mobility equipment, street sweepers, terminal trucks and recreation vehicles. REV Group itself is an industry-leading company, generating more than $2 billion in annual revenue with more than 20,000 vehicle sales per year. And regardless of industry, we plan to deliver on our goal with a speed and passion that only a revved-up corporation experiences when focused on the road ahead.

        REV Group Acquires Ferrara Fire Apparatus, Inc.
      

        Apr. 25th, 2017
      




MILWAUKEE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
      REV Group (NYSE:REVG), a $2+ billion manufacturer of industry-leading
      specialty vehicle brands and leading provider of parts and services,
      today announced the acquisition of Ferrara Fire Apparatus, Inc.
      (“Ferrara”), a leading custom fire apparatus and rescue vehicle
      manufacturer that engineers and manufactures vehicles for municipal and
      industrial customers. The Ferrara product portfolio includes multiple
      fire apparatus configurations tailored to the specific requirements and
      demands of the fire service industry – including custom-builds on their
      own chassis as well as solutions on commercially available chassis such
      as Freightliner and International. This acquisition enhances REV’s
      product offering in its Fire Group within its Fire & Emergency segment,
      particularly with custom chassis pumpers, aerials, and industrial
      apparatus.
    
      “We are pleased to welcome Ferrara to the line-up of our premier
      portfolio of fire brands which includes E-ONE and KME,” said Dan Peters,
      President of REV Fire Group. “The Ferrara brand has a long history of
      product innovation built around a commitment to heavy duty vehicle
      construction.” Peters added, “The addition of Ferrara to the REV Fire
      Group enables a number of new growth opportunities including expansion
      of our reach nationwide and adding new geographical regions and key
      accounts. We look forward to building upon the success of the Ferrara
      brand with an emphasis on driving new product innovation and exceeding
      customers’ expectations.”
    
      Tim Sullivan, CEO, REV Group, Inc. commented, “We are extremely pleased
      to have Ferrara Fire Apparatus join our team at REV. Ferrara further
      strengthens our brand offering of fire apparatus vehicles and market
      presence, adding a diverse product portfolio that is complementary to
      our line of great American-made specialty vehicles. Ferrara will
      immediately contribute strategic value by expanding the REV Fire Group
      national footprint, dealer sales network, service and after-market parts
      revenue as well as enhancing our robust line of custom chassis and
      aerial products for multiple market segments.”
    
      Headquartered in Holden, LA, Ferrara employs more than 450 employees
      with annual revenue of approximately $140 million. The acquisition of
      Ferrara Fire Apparatus, Inc. closed on April 25, 2017. Contemporaneous
      with the acquisition, REV has refinanced its debt facilities to include
      a new $350 million Asset Based Lending (ABL) revolving credit facility
      and a $75 million 5-year Term Loan. Details are available in the 8-K
      filed today with the SEC.

Rev Group acquires Ferrara Fire Apparatus, Inc.
The acquisition enhances REV's product offerings, particularly with custom chassis pumpers, aerials and industrial apparatus





















REV Group, Inc.MILWAUKEE — REV Group has acquired Ferrara Fire Apparatus, Inc., a leading custom fire apparatus and rescue vehicle manufacturer that engineers and manufactures vehicles for municipal and industrial customers.The Ferrara product portfolio includes multiple fire apparatus configurations tailored to the specific requirements and demands of the fire service industry – including custom-builds on their own chassis as well as solutions on commercially available chassis such as Freightliner and International. This acquisition enhances REV’s product offering in its Fire Group within its Fire & Emergency segment, particularly with custom chassis pumpers, aerials and industrial apparatus.“We are pleased to welcome Ferrara to the lineup of our premier portfolio of fire brands, which includes E-ONE and KME,” said Dan Peters, President of REV Fire Group. “The Ferrara brand has a long history of product innovation built around a commitment to heavy duty vehicle construction,” Peters added. “The addition of Ferrara to the REV Fire Group enables a number of new growth opportunities, including expansion of our reach nationwide and adding new geographical regions and key accounts. We look forward to building upon the success of the Ferrara brand with an emphasis on driving new product innovation and exceeding customers’ expectations.”“We are extremely pleased to have Ferrara Fire Apparatus join our team at REV. Ferrara further strengthens our brand offering of fire apparatus vehicles and market presence, adding a diverse product portfolio that is complementary to our line of great American-made specialty vehicles," Tim Sullivan, CEO, REV Group, Inc., said. "Ferrara will immediately contribute strategic value by expanding the REV Fire Group national footprint, dealer sales network, service and aftermarket parts revenue, as well as enhancing our robust line of custom chassis and aerial products for multiple market segments.”Headquartered in Holden, La., Ferrara employs more than 450 employees with annual revenue of approximately $140 million. The acquisition of Ferrara Fire Apparatus, Inc. closed on April 25, 2017. Contemporaneous with the acquisition, REV has refinanced its debt facilities to include a new $350 million Asset Based Lending (ABL) revolving credit facility and a $75 million 5-year Term Loan. Details are available in the 8-K filed today with the SEC.

(“Ferrara”), a leading custom fire apparatus and rescue vehicle manufacturer that engineers and manufactures vehicles for municipal and industrial customers. The Ferrara product portfolio includes multiple fire apparatus configurations tailored to the specific requirements and demands of the fire service industry – including custom-builds on their own chassis as well as solutions on commercially available chassis such as Freightliner and International. This acquisition enhances REV’s product offering in its Fire Group within its Fire & Emergency segment, particularly with custom chassis pumpers, aerials, and industrial apparatus.“We are pleased to welcome Ferrara to the line-up of our premier portfolio of fire brands which includes E-ONE and KME,” said Dan Peters, President of REV Fire Group. “The Ferrara brand has a long history of product innovation built around a commitment to heavy duty vehicle construction.” Peters added, “The addition of Ferrara to the REV Fire Group enables a number of new growth opportunities including expansion of our reach nationwide and adding new geographical regions and key accounts. We look forward to building upon the success of the Ferrara brand with an emphasis on driving new product innovation and exceeding customers’ expectations.”Tim Sullivan, CEO, REV Group, Inc. commented, “We are extremely pleased to have Ferrara Fire Apparatus join our team at REV. Ferrara further strengthens our brand offering of fire apparatus vehicles and market presence, adding a diverse product portfolio that is complementary to our line of great American-made specialty vehicles. Ferrara will immediately contribute strategic value by expanding the REV Fire Group national footprint, dealer sales network, service and after-market parts revenue as well as enhancing our robust line of custom chassis and aerial products for multiple market segments.”Headquartered in Holden, LA, Ferrara employs more than 450 employees with annual revenue of approximately $140 million. The acquisition of Ferrara Fire Apparatus, Inc. closed on April 25, 2017. Contemporaneous with the acquisition, REV has refinanced its debt facilities to include a new $350 million Asset Based Lending (ABL) revolving credit facility and a $75 million 5-year Term Loan.
