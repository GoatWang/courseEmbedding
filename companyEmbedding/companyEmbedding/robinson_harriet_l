              Abstract




Prime/boost immunizations using DNA priming and recombinant MVA boosters have proved to raise much higher levels of T cells than either DNA or MVA immunizations alone. The goals of this Program Project are to evaluate the cross clade activity of DNA /MVA protocols for immunodeficiency virus vaccines. Can worldwide vaccination be accomplished with a single DNA/MVA immunogen, or will a mixture of DNA/MVA immunogens, or geographically targeted clade-specific immunogens, be necessary? The charges for Project 2 are to perform the preclinical testing that will determine which DNAs or formulated DNAs will be used for priming MVA boosters in human trials, and to provide preclinical data to support IND applications for human trials. One major goal for Project 2 is to determine in preclinical models how DNA/MVA immunogens from two different clades affect the height and breadth of T-cell responses compared to those raised by single clade immunogens. A second major goal is to identify conditions that will allow the amount of DNA needed for priming MVA boosters to be reduced by ten-fold. Project 2 will be accomplished by a team of Emory investigators. Dr. Ahmed will be responsible for screening novel DNAs and formulated DNAs in mouse models for effects on the height and breadth of the memory T cell response. Dr. Robinson will be responsible for GLP studies in macaques testing the ability of selected immunogens, both singly and in combination, to raise memory T-cell responses. Studies will be done with clade B immunogens that represent the HIV-1 epidemic in North America and with clade AG immunogens that match the predominant infection at the CDC test site in Abidjan, Cote d'lvoire.

 Obituary			



 Service Details
			




Mrs. Harriet Lucille (McKeever) Robinson, 82, passed away peacefully at Heritage Place on the morning of April 20, 2017. She was a retired middle school teacher in the Pittsburgh Public Schools and former Sunday school teacher in the Baptist Temple Church. She was a graduate of the Pittsburgh Public Schools and the University of Pittsburgh, where she earned both her bachelor’s and master’s degrees in education. Mrs. Robinson dedicated her life to improving the quality of life for others initially as a nurse but mostly as an educator. She was a mentor and role model for her students in both school and church settings. And she was especially sensitive to the needs of the culturally disadvantaged and the spiritually inquisitive. She endeavored to nurture and nourish the promise and potential in others. Harriet Robinson enjoyed cooking and gardening. Her passion for cooking stemmed from her love of gardening. She was a member of the Knotty Pine Garden Club, one of the few African American Garden Clubs in Allegheny County. She maintained many flower, vegetable, and herb gardens around her home. All were used to either adorn the home with beautiful bouquets or used in rich cooking, a family affair every weekend. Extended family enjoyed hearty meals on holidays and special occasions. Mrs. Robinson baked cookies, cakes, and pies for family gatherings and holiday events at Baptist Temple. Harriet Robinson enjoyed jazz and gospel music. Almost every room in her home had a source of music: radio, stereo players, and TV. Music, especially gospel and contemporary adult music, played frequently. Whenever riding in the car, the radio was always tuned to music. Mrs. Robinson loved to read, especially history and literature reflecting African American heritage and culture. She also enjoyed modern music and classic movies. However, her favorite pastimes were family picnics and reunions, whether held in a public park or at her private residence. She believed that a family gave its members roots to understand themselves and wings to realize their dreams. Mrs. Robinson was a beloved and devoted wife, mother, grandmother, sister, cousin, aunt, friend, and confidante. Mrs. Robinson leaves to celebrate her home-going her beloved husband Roland Robinson, Sr., daughters Karen Robinson and Allison Robinson, daughter-in-law Geraldine Robinson, grandson Cavin Robinson (Franche) and family, granddaughter Constance Gamble (Jonathan) and family, sister Esther Hamiel, brother Benjamin McKeever, niece Denise Bunger and family, nephew David Roberson (Tameica), cousins Helen Todd and Robert Stroud (Talitha), sisters-inlaw Doris McKeever and Sara Prioleau and family, “special sister” LaRue Sowell (Henry), and other loving relatives and friends. .

 Educational Background



Bachelor of Arts Degree 


Swarthmore College

                  Since its founding in 1864, Swarthmore College has given students the knowledge, insight, skills, and experience to become leaders for the common good. Offering a liberal arts and engineering curriculum, the College is private, yet open to all regardless of financial need. It is also decidedly global in outlook, drawing students from around the world and all 50 states. The diversity of perspectives represented by Swarthmore students, faculty, and staff - including different viewpoints, identities, and histories - contributes to the community's strong sense of open dialogue and engagement with ideas and issues.

So much of what Swarthmore stands for, from its commitment to curricular breadth and rigor to its demonstrated interest in facilitating discovery and fostering social responsibility, lies in the quality and passion of its faculty. A student/faculty ratio of 8:1 ensures that students have close, meaningful engagement with their professors, preparing the former to translate the skills and understanding gained at Swarthmore into the mark they want to make on the world.

The College's Honors program features small groups of dedicated and accomplished students working closely with faculty; an emphasis on independent learning; ongoing dialogue between students and their peers, teachers, and examiners; and an examination at the end of two years' study by outside scholars.

Swarthmore's idyllic, 425-acre arboretum campus features rolling lawns, a creek, wooded hills, and hiking trails, and is located just 11 miles from Philadelphia.
