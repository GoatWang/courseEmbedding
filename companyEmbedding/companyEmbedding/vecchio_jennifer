She has been my family attorney for nearly two years in Miami. Prior to working with Chantale I had worked with four different attorneys and I had interviewed several others, so I have a strong basis in which to provide this review. Chantale's expertise is wide-ranging. She has helped me on the simplest issues to highly complex family law matters. From timeshare and child support issues to relocation and even an appellate case, Chantale has proven to me time and time again to be a fighter with passion and compassion! My children were taken out of the U.S. to a foreign country and now they are back! Her courtroom presence is dominated and her attention to procedural details is spot-on! She has demonstrated to me over-and-over her ability to "think outside the box" when it comes to finding solutions to complex family law issues. Chantale is not afraid to stand up, speak up and challenge the court on behalf of her clients and fathers. The name of her firm, Dadvocacy, says it all and she fights hard for fathers. At the same time she will wisley advise her clients when a legal battle does not make economic sense or when it is time to negotiate a settlement on a particular issue. She does not waste time or your legal expense dollar in bringing closure to your family law matter. Chantale is fair on fees and provides great results and tremendous value for her clients. Chantale is also supported by an amazing staff! Her associate attorneys share the same critical thinking traits as Chantale and share her passion to solve the issues. When you work with Chantale the whole staff makes you feel like family and every member of the staff is working hard in an organized manner for the client. Hiring a family law attorney is not easy and unfortunately I have had to do it several times over the course of five years. When you are standing in front of a judge or sitting at the negotiating table with your former "better half"...Your future and the future of your children is in the hands of your attorney. There is no room to make the mistake of hiring the wrong attorney for your case. Chantale has demonstrated to me over a long period of time on a wide range of family law issues, she takes this responsibility very serious and Chantale will do whatever it takes to get a favorable outcome for fathers and their children. With Chantale it is not just about generating a fee...it is about fighting for what is right and being an advocate for the rights of fathers in Miami! Chantale is one of a kind and I continue to be very grateful she is on my side!Idalis Perez PaRobert T. ratedI recommend Idalis Perez.Pedirle a la abogada Idalis Perez que represente a mis dos menores hijos en un complicado caso de ajuste de status es una de las mejores decisiones que he tomado en mi vida. El caso de mis hijos tomó un giro inesperado y problemático una noche que oficiales de inmigración visitaron mi domicilio, luego de esa visita quedé desmoralizado y casi sin esperanzas, sinceramente me hacía de regreso en mi país con mis hijos. Antes de visitar a la abogada Idalis Perez me entrevisté con dos abogados mas, honestamente no me convencieron, a pesar de ser muy "conocidos" en el medio no me inspiraron confianza. Todo lo contrario sucedió al entrevistarme con Idalis, sobria en su análisis de la situación, sincera al darme su opinión, absolutamente entendida en las leyes de inmigración y los pasos a seguir. Idalis estableció una estrategia y esa estrategia nos llevó a un final feliz, hoy mis hijos son residentes permanentes. A lo largo del camino Idalis nos nos mantuvo informados, absolvió todas nuestras dudas, siempre estuvo ahí para nosotros, si hubieran 10 estrellas en vez de 5 para calificar su conocimiento de las leyes, su trato humano , su honestidad y su disponibilidad para atender mis dudas o preocupaciones con gusto le daría 10 estrellas. Quiero hacer una mención muy especial al staff de Idalis, todos ellos se han portado maravillosamente con nosotros, han sido eficientes, atentos, muy pero muy pacientes con un padre preocupado del futuro de sus hijos, realmente son el equipo que toda persona que se enfrenta a un complicado caso de inmigración sueña tener. Hoy que hemos superado existosamente el complicado camino que la vida nos puso por delante quiero agradecer a Idalis y su staff, sin ellos no lo hubiéramos logrado y quiero que mi experiencia sirva a los que vienen detrás. Los casos de inmigración afectan las vidas de las personas, al confiarle un caso de inmigración practicamente estamos confiando nuestro futuro al abogado que escojamos, haberle confiado a Idalis el caso de inmigración y por ende el futuro de mis hijos fue la mejor decisión que pude tomar. Una vez mas y no me cansaré de repetirlo Gracias Idalis!Law Offices of Diane M Trainornotredame82 ratedI went online to find the new office address for Ms. Trainor and was shocked to read the reviews that were written.  They are so vindictive and so untrue, that I feel that I have to take the time to address them.  They were clearly submitted by a disgruntled ex-spouse(s) of one of Ms. Trainor's clients and in no way accurately reflect Ms. Trainor, her professionalism and high moral and professional standards.  To say that she would put a child at risk and allow pedophiles on the streets is disgusting and an abuse of the opportunities allowed by unchecked reviews.  It sounds as though somebody ended up on the losing end in court and is now striking out in the most miserable way possible.  The writer(s) should be ashamed of themselves.  I was referred to Ms. Trainor many years ago and have since referred others to her.  She is an incredibly compassionate, fair, intelligent lawyer who advocates aggressively on behalf of her clients, but at the same time will tolerate nothing less than decency and truth from those whom she represents.  In my experience and from what I have heard, she has never charged more than a fair fee and has never billed up a file.  To detail the alleged family background and to imply that Ms. Trainor is complicit in any of the alleged actions in a professional review is ridiculous and puerile.  There have been no rulings nor sanctions against Ms. Trainor and she has always been in good standing with the FL Bar.  The reviewer(s), who by the way seem to have been on a vengeance streak that day considering the multiple negative reviews against others, has mischaracterized all info that he or she found as they pursued their vendetta.  I highly suggest contacting current or former clients of Ms. Trainor.  I guarantee that they will offer only positive reviews and commentary on Ms. Trainor.  Shame on you reviewer.  You seem to be an angry, unstable individual(s), who has lost control and needs more help than a public forum can offer. Idalis Perez PaPhilippe G. ratedI can't remember where I first saw Idalis's name but I do remember her outstanding reviews convinced me and my husband to go with her as our counsel. I'm very glad I did. Idalis and her team, because it's a team effort, with a special shout out to Idalmis (her sister who's the the COO to her CEO) Got the process going, kept it going, took care of every little detail, was very responsive to questions and concerns (even if I asked like the same thing probably five times). And kept checking in . Immigration issues always carry some stress. Knowing they were there for us took a huge weight off our shoulders. They weren't perfect there were a couple of glitches (most notably a form that didn't get filed as fast as it should of due to a teammembers medical issue that caused it to be overlooked for a few days.) But with the good communication back and forth, once the problem was identified it was immediately expedited and taken care of. To me seeing how a team handles a problem is a better indication of how good they are as opposed to when everything is running totally smoothly. Seeing them handle the problem so quickly and efficiently after recognizing it gave me more confidence that if something went wrong they would have it cleared up ASAP. So If you want a warm and friendly, and caring staff (the second time I sat with Idalmis she asked about my mother-in-law's health, which had been fragile at the time of initial meeting. Her concern was genuine and I was touched she remembered and asked me about it - luckily she was much better). Who is also experienced, diligent and effective. I absolutely recommend Idalis Perez and her excellent team.Law Offices of Robert Rubenstein, P.A.robert.rubenstein.1 ratedI am a previous client of the Robert Rubenstein Law Firm. I recently picked up my settlement this afternoon and I am writing to say Thank You to each and every one of you. This was my first experience dealing with a law suit. It can be very scary, confusing, and frustrating. For me, this experience was an educating and comfortable experience. From the minute I called the Offices of Robert Rubenstein Law the girls answered the phone so quickly, so bubbly, so helpful, and respectful. They connect you to someone highly intelligent and a great sense of humor. In my case that person was Attorney Kelly Amritt and she was so awesome! She explained everything so I could understand, always responded to my emails, and/or returned phone calls in a timely manner. When Kelly was not in the office I had the absolute pleasure of speaking with Ms. Lopez who is also knowledgeable, hard working, and was always able to provide me with any information I needed. She is Kelly's right hand, and she ROCKS! When I couldn't speak with Kelly or Ms. Lopez I was connected to a very important department in the company, Customer Service. Rubenstein Law Customer Service representatives are so awesome. I had a wonderful experience, and I would definitely recommend Robert Rubenstein Law to all of my family, friends, and co-workers. My husband and I thank each and everyone one of you personally.

Jason was referred to us by family members, even though, as husband and wife, we already worked with and had our own personal injury attorneys.

I would recommend without hesitation. The most important quality I dealt with when working with them was honesty. Lawyer Freire took my case after a free consultation of over two hours. He cared about the situation and listened attentively providing me with the best recommendations. Honestly never looked at the watch to take another client of end with the consultation. All my questions were answered.As instructed by the office I sent them all the documents required to file for chapter 7 bankruptcy.  My case was filed in August, and received the discharge in November. Lawyer Gonzalez represented me in court with such professionalism. You feel supported by a great professional.  Did not have to pay any additional fees, and got my life (and my family's life) back! BEST of the BEST! Including Fernanda and Dania who always were there for me to resolve all my inquiries, even after the discharge.It is very important to mention that I consulted other lawyers that even recommended economical strategies that were detrimental of my situation and did not even applied to my case. Had I followed their advice I would be in a black hole at this point! Choose wisely and good luck!Law Offices of Paul D. Petruzzi PAAndres V. ratedI want to thank God for giving me the opportunity of finding a criminal lawyer to represent my son who is not only professional but an extraordinary human being. From the beginning of my journey with Mr. Petruzzi and his staff, I felt I was in good hands. They were always attentive in answering my phone calls, emails, meetings and most importantly serving all my sons legal matters since his arrest. We were provided with guidance along the way, which gave us a sense of comfort and positive thinking. Mr. Petruzzi and staff really go out of their way to attend your legal needs, even on days I would arrive without a scheduled appointment. I’m truly grateful for having the opportunity to work with Mr. Petruzzi and achieving an excellent result to my son’s federal criminal case. Mr. Petruzzi assisted my son and family tremendously by reducing his sentence to the utmost minimum in regards to credit card fraud and for that I am truly grateful and beyond happy with his legal services. Thank you to The Law Offices of Paul D. Petruzzi. Attorneys At Law Antonio Pagan PlViennawhorley@aol.com F. rated When it comes to the field of law.......I simply don't believe they come much better!!My husband and I had the pleasure of working with Antonio Pagan initially in 2011.  Since that time we have used him again when I filed bankruptcy separately in 2012.  During both bankruptcies, Mr. Pagan was very helpful and professional.  He and I established such a rapport that I continued to use him for various situations I encountered as a Realtor.  Since our initial encounter, he has been beneficial in assisting my short sale clients and also handled a case for one of my clients when their parent died without a will.  I have had an awesome relationship with Mr. Pagan since 2011 and find him to be extremely knowledgeable and helpful.  I also really appreciate him because if he does not know the answer to a question I inquire about..... he does not hesitate to contact one of his fellow lawyers and obtain the answer; regardless of the field of law.  As far as the field of law is concerned...... I don't think they come much better!!Attorneys At Law Antonio Pagan Plknowlesc ratedThis is the 2nd time we've used Jose Antonio Pagan's services. Seven months earlier he handled my husband's bankruptcy. Everything worked out well then - as it has worked out recently in my bankruptcy.The guy is very people oriented and down to earth in dealing with you. He gathers all the needed information for filing right over the phone. So you don't have to leave your home. He answered all questions I had, "upfront", during the telephone interview. So I knew what to expect and how things would proceed, without surprises. His cost was very reasonable (one of the lowest), and broken down to include court costs, and locked in. My money was already tight and the last thing I need is a surprise I couldn't afford. Mr. Pagan is extremely qualified and knows what he is doing. In my husband's case, and now mine, things came out exactly as he said they would. He's honest and a hard worker and will fight for your best interest. I (WE) recommend his firm. -  [Miami, FL]Did You Know?Types of AttorneysThe legal profession is vast, with each attorney having his or her specialties. Here are some of the most common attorneys individuals seek out when they require legal aid:Criminal Lawyer
A criminal defense lawyer is probably the attorney the average person imagines. Criminal attorneys are the men and women who defend individuals accused of a crime. The lawyer may work pro bono - for the public good - so the accused is certain to have representation, even if he or she cannot afford an attorney.Criminal lawyers are experts in the criminal justice system. They help their clients decide how to plead when first charged by the police and guide them through trial procedures. Defense lawyers must use every bit of their knowledge and resources to get their clients the fairest results from criminal proceedings.Business Lawyer
If you are a small business owner or the head of a larger corporation, you may come into contact with a business lawyer. Many big companies keep a legal staff on payroll to deal with the daily operations of running and maintaining a large enterprise. Business lawyers may have more specific specialties like copyright law, product liability and mergers and acquisitions.Business attorneys may focus their practices on certain industries. There are entertainment lawyers to guide artists through royalties and media contracts, while hospitals employ malpractice attorneys to protect doctors from aggressive litigation.Employment Lawyer
When you work for a company, you may find yourself in need of an employment lawyer - especially if the relationship between you and your employer sours. An employment attorney prevents people from losing their jobs due to unfair reasons. Workers' compensation lawyers help maintain safe employment conditions and ensure workers receive fair compensation after workplace injury or discrimination.Finance Lawyer
A personal finance attorney can protect and manage your investments and securities. You may use a finance lawyer to help you prepare your taxes, but you might be better off working with an accountant. A tax attorney is more commonly contacted after a business or individual runs into trouble with the IRS or state regulators.Real Estate Lawyer
Your family may keep a lawyer on retainer to guide you through the major expenses that come up in life. When buying a home, you could work with a real estate lawyer to make sure you get the best deal and won't get taken advantage of by tricky mortgage agreements or unfair landlords. An estate attorney can help you plan for the worst by creating a will and preparing your finances for after your death.Bankruptcy Lawyer
A bankruptcy lawyer is essential to help you resolve your financial difficulties when they start to spin out of control. Certain attorneys help create strategies to bring you out of debt and speak to your creditors. A lawyer can advise you on which type of bankruptcy you should file for.Civil Lawyer
If you are suing someone or being sued, you need a civil lawyer. Civil attorneys - and criminal lawyers - are the legal representatives who argue on your behalf in a courtroom setting. Civil lawyers may represent you on matters of business, finance or a wide variety of other specialized needs.One of the most common types of civil attorneys is a personal injury lawyer. When you're hurt by an outside party and you would like to hold them legally responsible, a personal injury attorney conducts litigation and negotiates settlements to compensate for your pain and suffering. Sometimes many wronged people will join together with a single civil lawyer or law office to form a class action lawsuit.Family/Divorce Lawyer
Most people will turn to a lawyer during a divorce to navigate the emotionally charged legal proceedings. A divorce attorney can assist in determining grounds for separation, division of property and custody of children.Family attorneys deal with much more personal matters. If you're getting married, a family lawyer can help you prepare a prenuptial agreement or other family planning paperwork such as adoption or inheritance documents.Questions One Should Ask a Lawyer Before Hiring ThemTo ensure you find a competent attorney who won't abuse your trust or drain your finances, you have to make the proper inquiries. There are several questions you should ask, but the majority will fall under three general topics:Training and Experience Questions
One of the best ways to determine quality is to examine an attorney's history. When you first step into a lawyer's office, you should check for the appropriate certifications and diplomas. You have to ask how long he or she has practiced law and request information that demonstrates the practice's success. Look for precise details such as percentage of cases settled out of court.Once you inquire about the broad details of their legal career, you should ask questions about their experience that pertains to your specific issue. You should ask how many similar cases they have handled and if they have special skills or training that applies specifically to your needs. Lawyers can't mention clients by name, but you should ask for basic details about identical past cases.Financial Questions
You need to ask about every possible fee that will come up when working with an attorney. You should request a list of all costs in advance so you won't be surprised by additional expenses like overhead. Also determine exactly when you will start being billed. You want to inspect paperwork carefully. If the attorney charges you for his or her experience, you need to make sure he or she will perform tasks personally and not hand it off to an assistant.Find out if the attorney has a flat fee or charges by the hour. Many civil lawyers work on contingency. Whatever the payment plan, make inquiries about how the lawyer plans to provide service for your money and what you can do if you start to feel unsatisfied with his or her performance.Lawyer/Client Relationship Questions
When you hire a lawyer, you're agreeing to work with someone over a certain period of time. You need to ask questions about how the attorney will communicate with you and what responsibilities you hold in the relationship. The attorney should let you know the best channel for quick communication and you need to inform him or her when you want updates.You should also ask questions to get to know the attorney as an individual in order to ensure this is a person you can trust. Ask about their legal philosophy and how he or she views the lawyer/client relationship. Great questions to start off with are ones that will make your life easier, such as how to keep fees down or what daily disruptions you should expect from a long legal battle. The more forthcoming the lawyer appears to be with individual needs, the better.Top Reasons to Hire a LawyerYou may keep a lawyer on retainer or you could turn to an attorney during specific situations. Here are some common reasons people begin seeking legal representation or advice:You Know Your Limitations
If you sign documents and you come across a word you don't recognize, you need assistance. You may need a third party to help you navigate important employment or real estate paperwork. It's essential you fully understand the terms of any legally binding documentation or activity you become a part of. If you are not an expert in a given field, you'll want to hire an attorney who is.A lawyer may find legal implications or opportunities you might miss. If you find yourself in a civil or criminal matter, a proper attorney ensures you don't receive a harsh punishment for a small mistake.You're Facing an Important Event/Decision
When making decisions critical to your financial stability or personal life, you may want a lawyer with expertise in your situation to make sure you do everything you can to arrive at the proper resolution. This is especially true when you become involved in a criminal case and your freedom is on the line.It's not just a matter of legal knowledge; lawyer's have access to numerous resources you do not. They have staff ready to work around the clock and experts in a variety of fields to give your important issues the attention they deserve.You Can't Be Impartial
During times when personal matters intersect with legal proceedings, you may need to have an advocate to prevent your emotions from getting in the way of level-headed thinking. For example, divorce lawyers can mediate a heated argument and help both partners get on with their lives.Emotional investment could be subtle. You may want to have a lawyer look over an investment opportunity that looks too good to be true or investigate the merits of a possible civil suit when you feel wronged.You're Out of Options
Many people turn to lawyers when they are in trouble. If you've been accused of a crime or are in a terrible financial situation, you can find an attorney who will work with what you have available to assist you as you deal with your problems.Personal injury lawyers find solutions for people who can no longer work under their own power and bankruptcy attorneys prevent people from giving in to debt. If you find yourself in a situation where you can't find a solution, a lawyer may be able to offer the counsel you need.How to Choose a LawyerWhen it comes time to choose a lawyer, you should start by searching close to home. While you probably don't want the conflict of interest that comes from being represented by a family member, friends and loved ones can recommend lawyers who served them well in the past. If you do have attorneys you are familiar with, ask who they believe would be best for you.After going through personal references - especially from individuals who had similar needs - you should broaden your search through public information resources. You can call your area's attorney referral service or check legal organizations like Martindale-Hubbell. There are other resources available online. You should check websites for client reviews and other third-party forms of approval.When you build a list of possible candidates, perform a background check on each one. See if you can find information on their history and success record. Once you find a possible lawyer, you should call to arrange a consultation so you can ask your important questions in person.By performing the necessary research and taking every available precaution, you can narrow your search to the attorney most suited to your needs.
