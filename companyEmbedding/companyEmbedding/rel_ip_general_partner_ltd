Partnerships vs. LLCs




Learn about the difference between partnerships and LLCs.


By Diana Fitzpatrick, J.D.




Share on Google Plus

Many new businesses with more than one owner may consider whether to operate as partnerships or Limited Liability Companies (LLCs). There are two types of partnerships; general partnerships and limited partnerships.   
General partnerships involve two or more parties who voluntarily agree to own and run a for-profit business in which they equally share management duties and profits or losses.   
Limited partnerships are made up of at least one general partner who finances and manages a for-profit business as well as one or more limited partners who provide only capital to that partnership entity.   
Most states also recognize LLCs with two or more owners called members.   Multi-member LLCs are unincorporated business organizations which combine positive features of both partnerships and corporations for its members.   Many state laws have adopted all or part of uniform laws that help govern general partnerships, limited partnerships, and LLCs.   This overall review of general and limited partnerships and LLCs focuses on four key aspects: formation, management, profit-sharing, and legal liability.

Formation
A general partnership can be formed in a variety of formal and informal ways, including orally, in writing or implied by a court from party conduct, such as pooling capital resources and sharing management duties and business profits or losses.   Although not required to do so, it is always recommended that you form a general partnership in a written partnership agreement or articles of partnership.   This type of agreement spells out each partner’s rights and duties and helps avoid future litigation between partners.   Several states mandate the filing of a certificate of partnership to evidence the existence of a general partnership.   
Under most state laws, limited partnerships are established in a more formal way through a required filing of a certificate of partnership with the relevant department, normally the secretary of state’s office.   Similar to general partnerships, the general and limited partners may wish to enter into articles of limited partnership to clarify partner roles and obligations in operating that business.   
Although less complex to form than a standard corporation, LLCs require more formal documentation than general partnerships demand.   For multi-member LLCs, the owners must enter into an operating agreement to clarify members’ different rights and responsibilities.   LLCs must register articles of organization with a relevant state office.   These articles of organization usually identify an LLC’s name, the location of its principal offices, the identities of its owners, any planned LLC term or duration, along with other statutory requirements. 
Management
A key characteristic of a general partnership is the equal right of each partner to manage the business enterprise.   Typically each general partner possesses one vote in any key partnership decisions regardless of the amount of their individual capital contribution.   Simple majorities normally determine the outcome of key business determinations.   Under this business organization, general partners must be able to persuade their co-owners to agree with certain business policies or ideas.     
Limited partnerships may have either one general partner or two or more general partners who operate a limited partnership on a daily basis.   In a limited partnership with two or more general partners, the management framework amongst them is often similar to general partnerships.   Limited partners do not manage the business and supply only capital contributions.   
If you are a single member LLC, you own, manage, and operate your business.   As a single-owner LLC, you can set your own business strategies and policies without having to consult or seek approval from others, but you may lose out on the professional experiences and insights of fellow owners.   If there are two or more members, your LLC’s operating agreement may be used to structure management roles and decision-making authority in a way that best suits your business needs.   You may decide that all members will manage their LLC or delegate management and decision-making powers to certain designated members.   
Profit-Sharing
The division of profits and losses are similar for both general partnerships and multi-member LLCs.   Unless the partners agree otherwise, general partners and LLC members share equally in the profits of their respective business organizations.   Under a limited partnership, general and limited partners usually share profits and losses based upon the value or percentage of each partner’s capital contributions to their business.   Alternatively, general and limited partners as well as LLC owners possess the flexibility to enter into agreements to allocate business profits and losses in a different manner that best suits their respective business models.
Legal Liability
Like many aspects of the law, legal liability often follows party control or authority.   In both general and limited partnerships, general partners have unlimited personal liability since they manage their respective businesses.   When handling partnership business, general partners are liable for their own conduct as well as the acts of their fellow general partners, known as joint and several liability. 
Conversely, limited partners only risk their capital contributions in limited partnerships, similar to shareholders in a corporation or members in an LLC.   However, if a limited partner participates in managing the business or signs a personal guarantee for the business they may be held personally liable for these business obligations.   
LLC members are entitled to manage while retaining the limited personal liability of shareholders in a corporation.   Normally LLC members are not personally liable for LLC debts or legal liabilities, putting only their financial contributions to their LLC at risk.   LLC owners may still be personally liable for their own conduct that harms others, for breaches of their duties owed to their LLC or personally guarantees LLC loans.   Any business owner should consider appropriate insurance and other liability protection strategies to help shield personal assets and business resources.  
For more information, see Nolo's article,  50-State Guide to LLC Asset Protection.

Learn more about the simplest business structure for companies with more than one owner.

A partnership is a business with more than one owner that has not filed papers with the state to become a corporation or LLC (limited liability company). There are two basic types of partnerships -- general partnerships and limited partnerships. The general partnership is the simplest and least expensive co-owned business structure to create and maintain. However, there are a few important facts you should know about the personal liability of general partners.
By definition, a partnership is a business with more than one owner that has not filed papers with the state to become a corporation or LLC (limited liability company). There are two basic types of partnerships: general partnerships and limited partnerships. This article discusses general partnerships, the more common structure in which every partner has a hand in managing the business.
The partnership is the simplest and least expensive co-owned business structure to create and maintain. However, there are a few important facts you should know before you begin.
Personal Liability for All Owners
First, partners are personally liable for all business debts and obligations, including court judgments. This means that if the business itself can't pay a creditor, such as a supplier, lender, or landlord, the creditor can legally come after any partner's house, car, or other possessions.
There are a few exceptions to this personal liability. Some of the partners can have limited personal liability if the partnership is set up as a limited partnership. This is a partnership in which only the general partner, who runs the business, has personal liability, while the limited partners, who are basically passive investors, can lose no more than their stake in the partnership. Also, some states allow special limited liability partnerships (LLPs). More commonly, though, businesspeople who are particularly concerned about personal liability choose to incorporate their business or operate as a limited liability company (LLC). For more information, see Nolo's articles on corporations  and  limited liability companies.
Joint Authority
In addition, any individual partner can usually bind the whole business to a contract or other business deal. For instance, if your partner signs a year-long contract with a supplier to buy inventory at a price your business can't afford, you can be held personally responsible for the money owed under the contract.
There are just a few limits on a partner's ability to commit the partnership to a deal -- for instance, one partner can't bind the partnership to a sale of all of the partnership's assets. But generally, unless an outsider has reason to know of any limits the partners have placed on each other's authority in their partnership agreement, any partner can bind the others to a deal.
Joint Liability
Each individual partner can be sued for -- and required to pay -- the full amount of any business debt. If this happens, an individual partner's only recourse may be to sue the other partners for their shares of the debt.
Because of this combination of personal liability for all partnership debt and the authority of each partner to bind the partnership, it's critical that you trust the people with whom you start your business.
Partnership Taxes
A partnership is not a separate tax entity from its owners; instead, it's what the IRS calls a "pass-through entity." This means the partnership itself does not pay any income taxes on profits. Business income simply "passes through" the business to the partners, who report their share of profits (or losses) on their individual income tax returns. In addition, each partner must make quarterly estimated tax payments to the IRS each year.
While the partnership itself doesn't pay taxes, it must file IRS Form 1065, an informational return, each year. This form sets out each partner's share of the partnership profits (or losses), which the IRS reviews to make sure the partners are reporting their income correctly.
For more information on reporting and paying partnership taxes, see How Partnerships Are Taxed.
Creating a Partnership
You don't have to file any paperwork to establish an ordinary partnership -- just agreeing to go into business with another person will get you started.
Of course, partnerships must  meet the same local registration requirements as any new business. Most cities and counties require businesses to register with them and pay at least a minimum tax. You may also have to obtain an employer identification number from the IRS, a seller's license from your state, and a zoning permit from your local planning board.
In addition, your partnership may have to register a fictitious or assumed business name. If your business name doesn't contain all of the partners' last names (for instance, you want to use "London Landscapes" instead of "Harper & Reed Landscapes"), you usually must register that name -- known as a fictitious or assumed business name -- with your county clerk. For more information on fictitious business names, see Registering Your Business Name.
While the owners of a partnership are not legally required to have a written partnership agreement, it makes good sense to put the details of ownership, including the partners' rights and responsibilities and their share of profits, into a written agreement. For more about why partnership agreements are so important, read Creating a Partnership Agreement.
Ending a Partnership
One disadvantage of partnerships is that when one partner wants to leave the company, the partnership generally dissolves. In that case, the partners must fulfill any remaining business obligations, pay off all debts, and divide any assets and profits among themselves.
If you want to prevent this kind of ending for your business, you should create a buy-sell agreement, or buyout agreement, which can be included as part of your partnership agreement. A buy-sell/buyout agreement helps partners decide and plan for what will happen when one partner retires, dies, becomes disabled, or leaves the partnership to pursue other interests. For example, such an agreement might allow the partners to buy out a departing partner's interest, so business can continue as usual. For more information, see Plan Ahead for Changes in Partnership Ownership.
For more information on the legal and practical issues involved in forming a business partnership, see Form a Partnership: The Complete Legal Guide, by Ralph Warner and Denis Clifford (Nolo). Or, to create a "business prenup" that will protect a business if someone leaves, seeBusiness Buyout Agreements: A Step-by-Step Guide for Co-Owners, by Bethany Laurence and Anthony Mancuso (Nolo).

BOXED WARNING:
POST TREATMENT EXACERBATION OF HEPATITIS B
Atripla is not approved for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and the safety and efficacy of Atripla have not been established in patients coinfected with HBV and HIV-1. Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B have been reported in patients who are coinfected with HBV and HIV-1 and have discontinued products containing emtricitabine and/or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, which are components of Atripla. Hepatic function should be monitored closely with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months in patients who are coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV and discontinue Atripla. If appropriate, initiation of anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted.

About HIV/AIDS
Infection with HIV-1, or human immunodeficiency virus, is one of the world’s greatest health challenges, currently affecting more than 35 million people worldwide. HIV progressively damages the immune system, weakening the body’s ability to fight life-threatening infections, which can lead to AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome.

About 



                                                Complera® (emtricitabine 200 mg/rilpivirine 25 mg/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg) is indicated for use as a complete regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in patients 12 years of age and older with no antiretroviral treatment history and with HIV-1 RNA ≤ 100,000 copies/mL at the start of therapy, and in certain virologically-suppressed (HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL) adult patients on a stable antiretroviral regimen at start of therapy in order to replace their current antiretroviral treatment regimen.
                                            


Prescribing considerations in adults with no ARV treatment history:
Virologic failure (HIV-1 RNA ≥50 copies/mL) was higher in subjects with baseline HIV-1 RNA >100,000 copies/mL and in subjects with baseline CD4 cell count <200 cells/mm3 (regardless of baseline HIV-1 RNA levels). Compared to efavirenz, virologic failure in rilpivirine-treated subjects conferred a higher rate of overall resistance and cross-resistance to the NNRTI class and more subjects developed tenofovir and lamivudine/emtricitabine associated resistance.
Prescribing considerations in virologically suppressed adults:
Patients must have no history of virologic failure, be stably suppressed (HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL) for ≥6 months prior to switching therapy, currently be on their first or second ARV regimen prior to switching therapy, and have no current or past history of resistance to any component of Complera.

BOXED WARNING:
POST TREATMENT ACUTE EXACERBATION OF HEPATITIS B

Complera is not approved for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and the safety and efficacy of Complera have not been established in patients coinfected with HBV and HIV-1. Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B have been reported in patients who are coinfected with HBV and HIV-1 and have discontinued products containing emtricitabine and/or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, which are components of Complera. Hepatic function should be monitored closely with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months in patients who are coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV and discontinue Complera. If appropriate, initiation of anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted.

                                                Truvada® (emtricitabine 200 mg/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg) is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in patients weighing at least 35 kg. Truvada is also indicated in combination with safer sex practices for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to reduce the risk of sexually acquired HIV-1 infection in adults at high risk. 
                                            

The following points should be considered when initiating therapy with Truvada:

Prescribing considerations when initiating TRUVADA for treatment of HIV-1 infection:
Do not use TRUVADA as a component of a triple nucleoside regimen or coadminister with other products containing emtricitabine, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, or lamivudine. Use of TRUVADA in treatment experienced HIV-1 infected patients should be guided by laboratory testing and treatment history.
Prescribing Considerations before initiating TRUVADA for PrEP:
TRUVADA for PrEP must only be prescribed as part of a comprehensive prevention strategy because TRUVADA is not always effective in preventing the acquisition of HIV-1 infection. Reduction in risk of acquiring HIV-1 is strongly correlated to adherence; therefore, individuals must strictly adhere to their dosing schedule.  HIV-1 negative status must be confirmed prior to initiating TRUVADA for PrEP and at least every 3 months thereafter. Delay initiating TRUVADA for PrEP for at least one month until negative HIV-1 status is reconfirmed if signs or symptoms of acute HIV-1 infection are present and if recent exposure is reported (< 1 month). Alternatively, confirm negative HIV status with a test approved by the FDA to aid diagnosis of acute or primary HIV-1 infection.

BOXED WARNING:
POST TREATMENT ACUTE EXACERBATION OF HEPATITIS B and RISK OF DRUG RESISTANCE WITH USE OF TRUVADA FOR PRE-EXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS (PrEP) IN UNDIAGNOSED EARLY HIV-1 INFECTION
TRUVADA is not approved for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and the safety and efficacy of TRUVADA have not been established in patients coinfected with HBV and HIV-1. Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B have been reported in patients who are coinfected with HBV and HIV-1 and have discontinued TRUVADA. Hepatic function should be monitored closely with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months in patients who are infected with HBV and discontinue TRUVADA. If appropriate, initiation of anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted.
TRUVADA when used for a PrEP indication must only be prescribed to individuals confirmed to be HIV-negative immediately prior to initiating and periodically (at least every 3 months) during use.  Drug-resistant HIV-1 variants have been identified with use of TRUVADA for PrEP following undetected acute HIV-1 infection. Do not initiate TRUVADA for PrEP if signs or symptoms of acute HIV-1 infection are present unless negative infection status is confirmed.

About 



                                                Tybost® (cobicistat 150 mg) is a CYP3A inhibitor indicated to increase systemic exposure of atazanavir or darunavir once daily in combination with other antiretroviral agents in the treatment of HIV-1 infection. 
                                            


Limitations of use:
Tybost is not interchangeable with ritonavir. Do not use Tybost with other protease inhibitors or darunavir 600 mg twice daily. Tybost and ritonavir may result in different drug interactions when used with concomitant medications.
Contraindictions:
Coadministration: Do not use with drugs highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and/or life-threatening events. Do not use with drugs that strongly induce CYP3A as this may lead to a loss of therapeutic effect of atazanavir or darunavir and development of resistance. 
Use with the following drugs is contraindicated: alfuzosin, dronedarone, rifampin, dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, methylergonovine, cisapride, lovastatin, simvastatin, pimozide, sildenafil for pulmonary arterial hypertension, triazolam, oral midazolam, and St. John’s wort. When coadminstered with atazanavir, irinotecan, nevirapine, and indinavir are also contraindicated.

                                                Viread® (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in patients 2 years of age and older. Viread is also indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in adults and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older. 
                                            

The following points should be considered when initiating therapy with Viread for the treatment of HIV-1 infection: 

Viread should not be used in combination with Atripla®, Complera®, Stribild®, or Truvada®

The following points should be considered when initiating therapy with Viread for the treatment of HBV infection:

The indication in adults is based primarily on data from treatment of subjects who were nucleoside-treatment-naïve and a smaller number of subjects who had previously received lamivudine or adefovir dipivoxil. Subjects were adults with HBeAg+ and HBeAg- chronic hepatitis B with compensated liver disease
Viread was evaluated in a limited number of subjects with chronic hepatitis B and decompensated liver disease
The numbers of subjects in clinical trials who had adefovir-associated substitutions at baseline were too small to reach conclusions of efficacy

BOXED WARNING:
POST TREATMENT EXACERBATION OF HEPATITIS B
Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis have been reported in HBV-infected patients who have discontinued anti-hepatitis B therapy, including VIREAD. Hepatic function should be monitored closely with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months in patients who discontinue anti-hepatitis B therapy, including VIREAD. If appropriate, resumption of anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted.

About Chronic Hepatitis B
Chronic hepatitis B is a liver disease caused by infection with the hepatitis B virus (HBV).  While some people naturally clear HBV infection, many go on to develop chronic (long-term) infection.  Chronic HBV may not show symptoms for many years but over time can lead to life-threatening liver damage, including liver cirrhosis (scarring) and liver cancer.

About 



                                                Letairis® is indicated for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) (WHO Group 1) to improve exercise ability and delay clinical worsening; and in combination with tadalafil to reduce the risks of disease progression and hospitalization for worsening PAH, and to improve exercise ability. Studies establishing effectiveness included predominantly patients with WHO Functional Class II-III symptoms and etiologies of idiopathic or heritable PAH (60 percent) or PAH associated with connective tissue diseases (34 percent).
                                            

WARNING: EMBRYO-FETAL TOXICITY
 
Do not administer Letairis to a pregnant female because it may cause fetal harm.  Letairis is very likely to produce serious birth defects if used by pregnant females, as this effect has been seen consistently when it is administered to animals.
 
Exclude pregnancy before the initiation of treatment with Letairis.  Females of reproductive potential must use acceptable methods of contraception during treatment with Letairis and for one month after treatment.  Obtain monthly pregnancy tests during treatment and 1 month after discontinuation of treatment.
 
Because of the risk of embryo-fetal toxicity birth defects, females can only receive Letairis through a restricted program called the Letairis REMS program.

About Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a serious cardiovascular disease that can lead to breathing difficulties and ultimately heart failure.  PAH refers to a narrowing of the vessels that carry blood between the lungs and heart; this narrowing increases blood pressure in the lungs and makes the heart work harder.  In many cases the underlying cause of PAH is unknown.

About 



                                                Lexiscan® (regadenoson) injection is a pharmacologic stress agent indicated for radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) in patients unable to undergo adequate exercise stress.
                                            

CONTRAINDICATIONS:
Do not administer Lexiscan to patients with second- or third-degree AV block or sinus node dysfunction unless these patients have a functioning artificial pacemaker.
WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS:
Fatal cardiac arrest, life threatening ventricular arrhythmias, and myocardial infarction may result from the ischemia induced by pharmacologic stress agents. Cardiac resuscitation equipment and trained staff should be available before administering Lexiscan. If serious reactions to Lexiscan occur, consider the use of aminophylline, an adenosine antagonist, to shorten the duration of increased coronary blood flow induced by Lexiscan.
Adenosine receptor agonists, including Lexiscan, can depress the SA and AV nodes and may cause first-, second or third-degree AV block, or sinus bradycardia requiring intervention. In clinical trials first degree AV block (PR prolongation > 220 msec) developed in 3% of patients within 2 hours of Lexiscan administration; transient second degree AV block with one dropped beat was observed in one patient receiving Lexiscan. In postmarketing experience, third degree heart block and asystole within minutes of Lexiscan administration have occurred.
Adenosine receptor agonists, including Lexiscan, induce arterial vasodilation and hypotension. In clinical trials, decreased systolic blood pressure (> 35 mm Hg) was observed in 7% of patients and decreased diastolic blood pressure (> 25 mm Hg) was observed in 4% of patients within 45 min of Lexiscan administration. The risk of serious hypotension may be higher in patients with autonomic dysfunction, hypovolemia, left main coronary artery stenosis, stenotic valvular heart disease, pericarditis or pericardial effusions, or stenotic carotid artery disease with cerebrovascular insufficiency. In postmarketing experience, syncope, transient ischemic attacks and seizures have been observed.
Administration of adenosine receptor agonists, including Lexiscan, may result in clinically significant increases in blood pressure in some patients. Among patients who experienced an increase in blood pressure in clinical trials, the increase was observed within minutes of Lexiscan administration. Most increases resolved within 10 to 15 minutes, but in some cases, increases were observed at 45 minutes following administration. In post-marketing experience, cases of potentially clinically significant hypertension have been reported, particularly with underlying hypertension and when low-level exercise was included in the MPI.
Adenosine receptor agonists, including Lexiscan, may cause bronchoconstriction and respiratory compromise. For patients with known or suspected bronchoconstrictive disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma, appropriate bronchodilator therapy and resuscitative measures should be available prior to Lexiscan administration.
The incidence of bronchoconstriction (FEV1 reduction > 15% from baseline) was assessed in two clinical studies. In a randomized, controlled study of 49 patients with moderate to severe COPD, the rate of bronchoconstriction was 12% and 6%, for the Lexiscan and placebo groups, respectively. In a randomized, controlled study of 48 patients with mild to moderate asthma who had previously been shown to have bronchoconstrictive reactions to adenosine monophosphate, the rate of bronchoconstriction was the same (4%) for both the Lexiscan and placebo groups. In both studies, dyspnea was reported as an adverse reaction in the Lexiscan group (61% for patients with COPD; 34% for patients with asthma) while no subjects in the placebo group experienced dyspnea.

About Radionuclide Myocardial Perfusion Imaging
Radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging (RMPI) is a medical technique for diagnosing coronary artery disease, the narrowing or blockage of blood vessels by the build-up of cholesterol or other fatty substances. Coronary artery disease is a leading cause of death in the United States and globally.
RMPI involves injecting a small amount of radioactive liquid, or tracer, into the bloodstream.  As the tracer moves through blood vessels and the heart, a camera captures information about blood flow.  This helps doctors assess the extent of any blockage and determine appropriate treatment options.

About Chronic Angina
Coronary artery disease – the narrowing or blockage of blood vessels by the build-up of cholesterol or other fatty substances – is a leading cause of death in the United States and globally.   The most common symptom of the disease is chronic angina, recurring chest pain or discomfort due to restricted blood flow to muscles that power the heart. The severe discomfort of angina can prevent people from engaging in everyday activities such as walking and running.

About Cystic Fibrosis
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an inherited genetic disorder that causes the accumulation of mucus in the lungs. The mucus traps bacteria and increases susceptibility to serious respiratory infections (in addition to its effect on the lungs, CF also affects other bodily systems, e.g., causes high levels of mucus in the digestive tract, leading to digestion problems). Many people with CF are diagnosed as children and may experience life-threatening complications as they reach adulthood. The goal of CF treatment, which may include medication, is to reduce CF symptoms, infection and slow lung damage.

oseltamivir phosphate 75 mg

About 



                                                Tamiflu® (oseltamivir phosphate) is an influenza neuraminidase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of uncomplicated acute illness due to influenza infection in patients 1 year and older who have been symptomatic for no more than 2 days.  Tamiflu is also indicated for the prophylaxis of influenza in patients 1 year and older.
                                            

The following points should be considered before initiating treatment or prophylaxis with Tamiflu:

Efficacy of Tamiflu in patients who begin treatment after 48 hours of symptoms has not been established.
Tamiflu is not a substitute for early influenza vaccination on an annual basis as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.
There is no evidence for efficacy of Tamiflu in any illness caused by agents other than influenza viruses Types A and B.
Influenza viruses change over time. Emergence of resistance mutations could decrease drug effectiveness. Other factors (for example, changes in viral virulence) might also diminish clinical benefit of antiviral drugs. Prescribers should consider available information on influenza drug susceptibility patterns and treatment effects when deciding whether to use Tamiflu.

CONTRAINDICATIONS:
Tamiflu is contraindicated in patients with known serious hypersensitivity to oseltamivir or any component of the product. Severe allergic reactions have included anaphylaxis and serious skin reactions including toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, and erythema multiforme.
WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS:
Cases of anaphylaxis and serious skin reactions including toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, and erythema multiforme have been reported in postmarketing experience with Tamiflu. Tamiflu should be stopped and appropriate treatment instituted if an allergic-like reaction occurs or is suspected.
Influenza can be associated with a variety of neurologic and behavioral symptoms which can include events such as hallucinations, delirium, and abnormal behavior, in some cases resulting in fatal outcomes. These events may occur in the setting of encephalitis or encephalopathy but can occur without obvious severe disease.
There have been postmarketing reports (mostly from Japan) of delirium and abnormal behavior leading to injury, and in some cases resulting in fatal outcomes, in patients with influenza who were receiving Tamiflu. Because these events were reported voluntarily during clinical practice, estimates of frequency cannot be made but they appear to be uncommon based on Tamiflu usage data. These events were reported primarily among pediatric patients and often had an abrupt onset and rapid resolution. The contribution of Tamiflu to these events has not been established. Closely monitor patients with influenza for signs of abnormal behavior. If neuropsychiatric symptoms occur, evaluate the risks and benefits of continuing treatment for each patient.
Serious bacterial infections may begin with influenza-like symptoms or may coexist with or occur as complications during the course of influenza. Tamiflu has not been shown to prevent such complications.
Efficacy of Tamiflu in the treatment of influenza in patients with chronic cardiac disease and/or respiratory disease has not been established. No difference in the incidence of complications was observed between the treatment and placebo groups in this population. No information is available regarding treatment of influenza in patients with any medical condition sufficiently severe or unstable to be considered at imminent risk of requiring hospitalization.
Efficacy of Tamiflu for treatment or prophylaxis of influenza has not been established in immunocompromised patients.

About Influenza 
Influenza, or the flu, is a common respiratory disease caused by infection with one of multiple influenza viruses.  Influenza takes different forms:  So-called seasonal, or annual, influenza occurs regionally during cold months and pandemic influenza occurs less frequently but can affect the entire globe.
Many people with influenza recover after a period of a few days.  However, influenza can be significantly more serious, as well as life threatening, in some people or when caused by particular viral strains.  In certain cases, antiviral medication is an appropriate option for treating influenza or for preventing those exposed to an influenza virus from becoming sick.  Vaccination is also available to prevent many forms of influenza.

About Neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration 
Neovascular (or “wet”) age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is an eye disease that makes reading and seeing details difficult.  It results from abnormal blood vessels that grow underneath a part of the retina (the tissue lining the eye) that are fragile and leak.  AMD is most common in people over age 60, and the cause is not understood.

NETWORK TRANSFORMATION
Network transformation is part of the network modernization process by service providers working towards a migration away from legacy systems and archaic network infrastructure to a more efficient and highly consolidated network able to offer innovative services via Internet Protocol and cloud technologies. Not only do legacy systems require expensive upfront capital investments, they also incur ongoing operational costs and consume significant power and space. Network transformation helps minimizes these inefficiencies and the transformation paid for by operating-expense-based program options. Network transformation also ensures carrier-grade reliability and scalability, especially for regional or rural networks that demand infrastructure modernization.
Check out GENBAND’s Network Modernization solutions, including Network Transformation.
UNIFIED COMMUNICATIONS
Unified communications (UC) solutions offer real time communications in a bundle, providing streamlined and consolidated functions. With a unified communications solution, text, voice, video, and screen sharing collaboration can all be accessed from one integrated system. Not only can unified communications be applied to residential services, enterprises can merge their communications with their branch offices. Unified communications solutions also apply to contact centers and intelligent messaging, where greater demand of multi-function services is present. Going a step further, virtualization creates the opportunity for unified communications to be consumed or offered as a service from the cloud.
Check out GENBAND’s array of Unified Communications solutions for Communications Service Providers or Enterprises.
NFV
Network functions virtualization (NFV) takes service providers towards more efficient, innovative and agile solutions for consumer and business communications service offerings by consolidating network capabilities into the cloud with virtualized functions. NFV allows carrier service providers to cut costs associated with monolithic and proprietary systems and approaches of today. With the migration to network functions virtualization (NFV) solutions, services become easier to configure and deliver, and new services become deployable in days, not years.

REAL TIME COMMUNICATIONS
Real time communication (RTC) is about connecting people anywhere, on any device. With the ability to embed on an array of systems, including mobile devices, business processes and workflows, real time communication transforms the speed and quality of everyday communication as well as increase productivity and accessibility. Today’s consumers and businesses demand immediate communication at a growing rate, calling for high quality and personalized services. These RTC services include a suite of solutions that work together to form an integrated system, providing comprehensive access and quality implementation of connecting people, groups, and businesses.
