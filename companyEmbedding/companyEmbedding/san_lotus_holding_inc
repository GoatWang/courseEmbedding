(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains "forward-looking" statements as such term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements consist of information relating to the Company that is based on the beliefs of the Company's management as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to the Company's management. When used in this report, the words "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "expect" and "intend" and words or phrases of similar import, as they relate to the Company or Company management, are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Such statements reflect the current risks, uncertainties and assumptions related to certain factors including, without limitation, competitive factors, general economic conditions, customer relations, relationships with vendors, the interest rate environment, governmental regulation and supervision, seasonality, distribution networks, product introductions and acceptance, technological change, changes in industry practices, onetime events and other factors described herein and in other filings made by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Based upon changing conditions, should any one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should any underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those described herein as anticipated, believed, estimated, expected or intended. The Company does not intend to update these forward-looking statements.  BUSINESS OVERVIEW  San Lotus Holding Inc. was incorporated in the state of Nevada on June 21, 2011 to (1) market travel products and services to the growing "baby boomer" market, with an initial focus on the Asian market, via developing and operating a global travel and leisure agency business; and (2) jointly develop the tourism and travel of He Ping Zhen, Shaowu City, Fujian Province, China with He Ping Zhen Development Ltd., a China Limited Corporation, the specific plans of which remains under preliminary discussion. Our vision is to consolidate travel products and services and deliver value to the world's travel population. We changed our state of incorporation from the State of Nevada to the State of California (the "Conversion") on July 21, 2015.  We are a development stage company that plans to market global travel products to the retiring baby boomer generation in the Asian markets. We are in the initial stages of opening a travel agency in Taiwan, Republic of China. On May 21, 2012, we obtained a license from the Investment Commission, Ministry of Economic Affairs, Taiwan (R.O.C.) to invest into Taiwan through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Green Forest Management Consulting Inc., a Taiwan (R.O.C.) company. We anticipate that we will be able to obtain this approval by the end of 2016. The challenges we anticipate in obtaining the necessary approvals to operate a travel agency in Taiwan (as well as in other countries) primarily involves meeting the statutory requirements related to capital requirements, statutory reserves and employing fit, proper and qualified management. These challenges have already been addressed by starting our business in Taiwan (as referenced in Risk Factors under government approval). We expect to begin generating revenue in Taiwan in April 2016, after we obtain the relevant licenses and approval from Taiwan's government.  Our travel services entity in Taiwan will provide both outbound travel services for customers based in Taiwan and inbound travel services for customers based abroad and coming to Taiwan. Both the outbound and inbound services will be conducted in our Taiwan office, except the inbound services will rely in part on advertising conducted or directed outside of Taiwan.  We will not only book airplane tickets, hotels and tours, but design specialized destination-related travel services for our customers based on their specific needs and desires while they are in Taiwan. In this way, our market will consist of both those potential travelers based in Taiwan, but also anyone from any other country who might be planning a trip to Taiwan or need assistance with designing a travel itinerary once they arrive in Taiwan. We will market our products and services to the travel population in Taiwan and abroad through our website, www.sanlotusholding.com, as well as through services such as Twitter and other media outlets. we have purchased three vehicles to provide transportation to our customers while they are in California, a common destination for Taiwan business travelers and tourists.  We intend to use the cars, with hired drivers, to provide car service for our customers from the airport to their hotels or other desired destinations upon their arrival in California. Providing car service is an experimental project at this point as we only have three vehicles available for use. We will charge our customers an amount that will cover our expenses in providing the car and driver. In the event the service is popular and appears to benefit our services, we may add to the service in the future, at which time we would reevaluate the amount we charge for the service.  In addition to developing our business in Taiwan, in the first quarter of 2013, we entered into non-binding letters of intent to acquire existing travel services agencies in Taipei City, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Vancouver, British Columbia and California. We plan to proceed in negotiating terms for these acquisitions over the course of the next several months while we simultaneously gather operational data from our module operation in Taiwan. We expect to complete the acquisitions of such travel agencies by the end of 2016. At the same time, we also have entered into non-binding letters of intent to acquire land in Taiwan, which land we intend to use to develop destination-related travel services. We expect to complete the acquisitions of such land and/or land holding companies by the end of 2016.  Despite of entering the non-binding letters of intent to acquire the travel agencies and land, we remain in the preliminary discussion with the travel agencies and the sellers of the land about the specific considerations to acquire them. Thus, to date, we are not able to estimate any specific costs in completing such acquisitions. Acquiring the travel agencies located both within and outside of Taiwan and land in Taiwan is an ongoing effort that will continue during the life of the Company. To facilitate our acquisition efforts, we will actively seeking additional funding on favorable terms to continue our acquisition. If additional funding is not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to implement our acquisitions and continue our operations. We plan to be funded by private placement of our equity securities and/or mortgage our land. But, there can be no assurance we will be funded as such. Thus, there can be no assurance we will successfully complete our acquisitions of travel agencies and/or land. If we fail to complete our acquisitions of travel agencies and/or land, we may be forced to cease our operation entirely, and you may lose all your investment.  Each of these non-binding letters of intent above was disclosed to the SEC in a Current Report on Form 8-K shortly after our entry into each such non-binding letter of intent.  Regarding the development of our travel services entity in Taiwan, our plan is to build up a successful module operation in Taiwan and to gain meaningful operational data for one year before using it as a model to replicate throughout Asia. It is critically important for us to obtain credible data in terms of the following (per module main office, plus branch officers):  1. Start-up Cost  A. Capital requirements - estimated $100,000 upon application license - end of 2016  B. Statutory reserve - estimated $20,000 upon approval of license - end of 2016  C. Fees - estimated $1,000 upon application for license - end of 2016  D. Rent deposit - estimated $2,000 upon rental of office - end of 2016  E. Equipment, etc. - estimated $5,000 - end of 2016  F.

Breakeven point and Projected Earnings  Making projections using real figures based on the module operations should lower our level of risk as we expand into other countries. While it is premature to set any definitive dates in applying for obtaining statutory approval to operate travel agencies beyond Taiwan (R.O.C.), we anticipate that after one full year of operation, we will have sufficient data to construct an expansion plan for establishing ventures beyond Taiwan.  Products and Services Offered:  - Transportation: airlines / buses / car rentals / railways / cruises;  - Accommodation: hotels / resorts / cruises; and  - Packaged holidays / local tours.  Our business strategy is to generate revenue mainly through commissions or mark-ups for selling travel products. For example, for airplane tickets, for which we do not take inventory, we will receive commission revenue from the airlines as compensation for selling airplane tickets to our customers. In other words, our revenue will not come directly from the payments which the customers make to the airlines, but instead our commission revenue will be paid by the product provider (e.g. airlines) directly to our Company. The size of commission will vary from product to product, depending on how product providers (e.g. airlines) set their distribution strategy. Below is an estimate of the commission percentage we expect to be able to obtain for each type of product:  Type of Product Estimated Commission %  Transportation 3 ~ 10% Accommodation 3 ~ 10% Packaged Tours 3 ~ 10%  Another type of revenue would come from mark-ups. Our mark-up revenue will be earned when we choose to take inventory on products such as hotel stays, cruise trips or tours. This type of revenue is different from commission-based revenue in that we will secure the product outright before customers purchase the product. After we purchase the product, we would then sell the product to the customer at a higher price, thereby earning the difference or mark-up as profit. The size of the mark-up will vary depending on our inventory level, market conditions and customer preference.  Below is an estimate of the mark-up percentage and the initial cost of obtaining wholesale inventory for each type of product:  Type of Product Estimated Mark-up % Initial Cost of Obtaining Wholesale Inventory  Transportation 5 ~ 20% $10,000 Accommodation 10 ~ 30% $30,000 Packaged Tours 10 ~ 20% $10,000  We expect to incur the cost of obtaining wholesale inventory as soon as our license to operate a travel agency has been granted. Consequently, we will recover the cost and make a profit when inventory is turned over or sold. The profitability of our mark-up business will depend on how frequent inventory is turned.  We anticipate providing other ancillary travel services such as submitting visa applications on behalf of clients. It is our understanding that it is customary to charge a handling fee of US$5~10 for the submission of a visa application. These types of services, however, should only constitute a small part of our overall revenue.  We plan to market our company to high-income individuals and affinity groups, such as private schools, alumni groups and wealth management organizations at banks and investment firms. Our plan to reach these target customers is through seeking lists from the affinity groups and marketing online. In terms of seeking lists from affinity groups, our strategy involves no upfront cost to our company. We will instead share the profits with the organizations that provided such lists when customers purchase travel products through our company. Our general rule of thumb is to share 50% of the profit with the affinity group. This estimate may be adjusted upward or downward depending on the size and quality of the customer list. Separately, we plan to market our company online through our company website. Currently under construction, our company website, www.sanlotusholding.com, will be a vehicle to promote our offerings to a wide audience. We plan on interacting with our retail customers primarily through our website. Our customers will be able to place their purchases via the telephone, through credit card or bank transfer payment.  Business Development  The Company seeks to develop mutually beneficial business relationships with travel product providers, such as airlines, hotels and tour operators, and will begin offering travel products to our customers. The Company will work on reaching a variety of affinity groups and reaching agreements to service their customers. The Company recently launched a website, www.sanlotusholding.com, to begin marketing our services online. Our costs as a reporting company in our first year are approximately $165,000 in legal fees and $45,000 in auditing fees, including the preparation of our 10-K filing and annual audit. And, our costs as a reporting company in our second year are approximately $16,193 in legal fees and $50,300 in auditing fees, including the preparation of our 10-K filing and annual audit.  Marketing and Sales  Our initial marketing efforts will be designed to drive prospective clients to our website, www.sanlotusholding.com. We plan to use social media vehicles such as Twitter and Facebook to generate awareness of our website. We expect to engage prospective clients through promoting our website and responding to requests for information. Eventually, we expect to use broader-based email marketing to generate a much larger number of sales leads that will be followed up with a personal exchange, via email or telephone, but there is no guarantee this will be successful.  We have taken the following steps in implementing our business plan:  Vendor Discussion and Supplier Agreements We have contacted vendors to provide travel related products to our customers. Below is a summary of the number of vendors who have responded favorably to our request. We have not signed any formal supplier agreements with product vendors. Type of Vendor Number of Vendor Airline 2 Bus Company 1 Cruise Company 2 Hotel 7 Resort 2  Website Development  We have completed the initial version of our website, www.sanlotusholding.com, and will use this site to market our services to the general public.  Affinity Groups  We have used the contacts of our directors and officers in initially contacting various affinity groups. Thus far, we have had conversations with no less than five groups that have expressed interest in sharing their group list with our company. However, at this time we have not executed any of agreements with these companies. Below is a summary of the statistics we wish to reach regarding various affinity groups:  Type of Vendor Number of Vendor Airline 5 Bus Company 2 Cruise Company 2 Hotel 15 Resort 5  We are in the process of applying for our license to operate a travel agency in Taiwan. We expect to receive approval for our business license by the end of 2016. Once proper licenses and approvals have been granted, we will need to take the following steps in generating revenue:  - Formally launch online operations (in or after 2016)  - Sign formal supplier agreements with product vendors that have expressed interest previously (in or after 2016)  - Sign on additional product vendors (in or after 2016)  - Sign profit sharing agreements with affinity groups that have expressed interest previously (completed as of the year 2012)  - Sign on additional affinity groups (in or after 2016)  - Hire office staff (in or after 2016)  These steps will ensure that we have sufficient product and service offerings to attract customers, both to launch our operations and on an ongoing basis going forward.  In addition to the aforementioned steps, we are in the process of investing in and developing scenic/destination real estate sites through the acquisition of land and land holding companies. We acquired certain land and canceled certain land transactions in Taiwan (R.O.C.), which is specifically described in Item 2 of our annual report on Form 10-K filed on March 9, 2016 (as amended by the Form 10K/A filed on March 11, 2016).  We expect the destination real estate portion of our business to make up approximately half of our overall business in the future, with the other half consisting of travel agencies. By destination real estate, we mean to develop locations that will attract and support visitors for stays of one day or longer, providing outdoor activities and places of interest for visitors from both domestic locales and abroad. In addition to our destination real estate business, we are continuing to develop our travel agency in Taiwan and have entered into certain non-binding letters of intent to acquire travel agencies located outside of Taiwan in both Asia and North America. We aim to complete the acquisition of five travel agencies by the end of 2016. We intend to fund all of these acquisitions through the sale of our common stock. While this will cause dilution to the existing shareholders, we do not believe this dilution will negatively affect the shareholders as the acquisitions will add significant value to the Company and will allow the Company to proceed in developing its business.  We may also from time to time invest in travel-related service providers that we believe can help us better service our customers and help them meet their travel needs. Through investing in such entities, we may be able to recoup some of our costs through maintaining small ownership interests in the entities our clients use. Furthermore, by investing in these entities, we may be able to work with them to better improve their travel offerings or related services or bring the entities up to the standard of service our customers expect. We recently made one such investment in A Peace World Holding Inc. ("APW"), a company in the early stages of developing destination real estate products and services. We expect that APW, based on its expressed business plans, will develop destination real estate that our customers will be interested in traveling to, thus enhancing the products and services we can provide to our customers. Any costs involved in offering such products and services to our customers, if there are any such costs, will be incorporated into the fees we charge our customers for our service. At this time we have no further plans for making any additional such investments and therefore have no plans of making further capital expenditures in relation to such investments.  Competition  We will be operating in two sectors - in the area of destination real estate development and travel agencies. These two sectors will complement each other as, over the long term, the travel agencies will be able to refer clients and visitors to our destination real estate sites. We will face competition from many individuals and companies that also market travel locations and products. As concerns travel destinations, we desire to utilize scenic properties that will allow for outdoor activities. Thus we must create locations that provide both activities of interest and provide convenience and amenities, while allowing visitors to enjoy the natural beauty of the area around them.  Observation tells us that the current travel industry is generally driven by the lowest cost provider. However, different segments of the market, such as the affluent segment, consider factors beyond cost when they plan vacations and travel. Ahead of cost, an affluent consumer may value factors such as convenience, comprehensive service, and luxury and/or prestige, to name a few. We believe that a successful marketing effort to reach the affluent market segment (retiring baby boomers) with the right quality of products should increase our revenue opportunity. In Taiwan, market conditions for the travel industry are similar to those of the U.S. There is a mix of large travel agencies, online service providers and small-scale local operators. However, since Taiwan is geographically much smaller than the U.S., competition is fierce.  In Taiwan, there are four types of travel agencies:  1. Mega Agencies  A. Lion Travel  B. Cola Tour  C. EZ Travel  2. Intermediate-Small - locally or regionally owned agencies  A. Star Travel  B. SET Tour  3. Independent Agencies: Usually catering to a special or niche market  A. Royal Jet Way  B. Perfect Travel  C. Life Tour  4. Airline & other types of travel consolidators  A. China Airlines  B. EVA Airlines  C. American Express  We feel at this time we would fall into the Independent Agency category and hope to create our own niche as a more customer-oriented agency or travel service provider with a reputation of going the "extra mile" wherever possible in connecting the right type of customers with the right type of products.  Concerning destination real estate sites, there are many competitors who will be vying for the business of our potential clientele. The key will be to develop attractive properties that provide the amenities and activities that visitors would enjoy. In our development plans, we are defining destination real estate as locations that will draw tourist from both domestically and abroad to visit our sites for a period of one or two days or more. So in the long term we will be developing sites that include hotels, restaurants, as well as activity and entertainment centers, among other things. Some of our competitors in the destination real estate sector in Taiwan include the following companies:  Elements Innovation Co. Ltd. E United Group Taiwan Land Development Inc. EMERGING GROWTH COMPANY STATUS We qualify as an "emerging growth company" under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the "JOBS Act"). As a result, we are permitted to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements. For so long as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to: have an auditor report on our internal ? controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory ? audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor's report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (i.e., an auditor discussion and analysis); submit certain executive compensation ? matters to shareholder advisory votes, such as "say-on-pay" and "say-on-frequency"; and disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation ? between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the CEO's compensation to median employee compensation.  In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.  We will remain an "emerging growth company" for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a "large accelerated filer" as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which would occur if the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The following table summarizes our historical condensed consolidated statements of operations data.  Nov 04, 2016  (c) 1995-2016 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc.

	CAUTIONARY NOTE ON FORWARD LOOKING
	STATEMENTS





	 


	 




	This Quarterly
	Report on Form 10-Q (this "Report") contains "forward-looking
	statements." Forward-looking statements discuss matters that are not
	historical facts. Because they discuss future events or conditions,
	forward-looking statements may include words such as "anticipate,"
	"believe," "estimate," "intend,"
	"could," "should," "would," "may,"
	"seek," "plan," "might," "will,"
	"expect," "predict," "project,"
	"forecast," "potential," "continue," negatives
	thereof or similar expressions. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the
	date they are made, are based on various underlying assumptions and current
	expectations about the future and are not guarantees. Such statements involve
	known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our
	actual results, level of activity, performance or achievement to be materially
	different from the results of operations or plans expressed or implied by such
	forward-looking statements. We cannot predict all of the risks and
	uncertainties. Accordingly, such information should not be regarded as
	representations that the results or conditions described in such statements or
	that our objectives and plans will be achieved and we do not assume any
	responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of any of these forward-looking
	statements. Except to the extent required by law, we undertake no obligation to
	update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new
	information, future events, a change in events, conditions, circumstances or
	assumptions underlying such statements, or otherwise.  Readers are
	urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made throughout
	the entirety of this Report.

	NATURE








	OF








	OPERATIONS








	AND








	SUMMARY








	OF








	ACCOUNTING








	POLICIES





	 






	Nature












	of












	Operations






	San




	Lotus




	Holding




	Inc.(the




	“Company”




	or




	“San




	Lotus”),




	was




	incorporated




	on




	June




	21,




	2011




	in




	the State of




	Nevada and changed our state of incorporation from the
	State of Nevada to the State of California (the "Conversion") on July
	21, 2015.




	 




	The Company is in the initial stages of opening a travel
	agency in Taiwan through its wholly owned subsidiary, Green Forest Management
	Consulting Inc., a Taiwan company. The Company has not conducted business
	operations nor had revenues from operations since its inception. The Company’s
	business plan is to desig and market global travel packages and affinity travel
	excursions through out the world, and develop a global travel and leisure
	agency business.




	The Company, through its recent acquisition, is engaged
	in the provision of travel services, including hotel reservation services,
	airline ticketing, and travel package in the United States.




	The Company’s year-end is December 31.





	 







	Basis of presentation






	The accompanying consolidated financial statements of the
	Company have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally
	accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).




	 






	Consolidation Policy






	The consolidated financial statements of the Company
	include the accounts of San Lotus Holding, Inc. and its subsidiaries. Intercompany
	accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.




	 






	Going












	Concern






	The accompanying consolidated financial statements were
	prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes the realization of assets and
	discharge of liabilities in the normal course of business. As shown in the
	accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company had an accumulated
	deficit of $1,155,270 as of June 30, 2016.




	The Company faces all the risks common to companies at
	the development stage, including capitalization and uncertainty of funding
	sources, high initial expenditure levels, uncertain revenue streams and
	difficulties in managing growth. The Company's losses raise substantial doubt
	about its ability to continue as a going concern. The Company's consolidated
	financial statements do not reflect any adjustments that might result from the
	outcome of this uncertainty.




	The Company is currently addressing its liquidity issue
	by continually seeking investment capital through private placements of common
	stock and debt. The Company believes its current and future plans enable it to
	continue as a going concern. The Company's ability to achieve these objectives
	cannot be determined at this time. These consolidated financial statements do
	not give effect to any adjustments which would be necessary should the Company
	be unable to continue as a going concern and therefore be required to realize
	its assets and discharge its liabilities other than the normal course of
	business and at amounts which may differ from those in the accompanying
	consolidated financial statements.




	 






	Use












	of












	Estimates






	The preparation of financial statements in conformity
	with U.S. GAAP, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.




	 






	Revenue recognition






	The Company’s revenues are principally derived from providing
	hotel reservation, air ticketing, other travel and non-travel services. The
	Company recognizes revenues when all of the following have occurred: persuasive
	evidence of arrangement with the customer, services have been performed, fees
	are fixed or determinable and collectability of the fees is reasonably assured,
	as prescribed by ASC 605-10,



	 Revenue Recognition, Overall



	. These
	criteria as related to revenues are considered to have been met as follows:





	Packaged-tour:



	The Company receives referral fees from travel product
	providers for packaged -tour products and services through its service platform
	and branch offices. Referral fees are recognized as commissions on a net basis
	after the packaged-tour service are rendered and collections are reasonably
	assured .




	In case s where these entities undertake the majority of
	the business risks and acts as principal related to the travel tour services
	provided, revenues are recognized at gross amounts received from customers
	after the services are rendered. Loss due to obligations from cancelled travel
	services of such principal arrangement is minimal in the past.





	Air ticketing services:



	Commissions from air ticketing services rendered are
	recognized upon the issuance of air tickets, net of estimated cancellations.
	Customers purchase the air tickets, and the Company remits the net amount less
	base commission to the airlines. Estimated cancellations were insignificant for
	the years ended June 30, 2016. The Company presents revenues from such
	transactions on a net basis in the consolidated statements of comprehensive
	income (loss), as the Company acts as an agent, does not assume any inventory
	risk, and has no obligations for cancelled airline ticket reservations. The
	Company sometimes also receives additional discretionary commissions from
	certain airlines when performance targets are met. Such discretionary
	commissions are recognized on a cash basis because the Company cannot
	reasonably estimate the amount, or timing of receipt, of such commissions in
	advance.





	Other travel services:



	Other travel services are mainly commissions from
	insurance companies for the sale of travel insurance. Customers purchase the
	travel insurance, and the Company remits the net amount less commission to the
	insurance companies. The Company recognizes revenue when the travel insurance
	is issued to the customer, net of estimated cancellations.

	exist.




	 






	Goodwill and intangible assets






	Goodwill
	represents the excess of costs over fair value of the net assets of businesses
	acquired. The Company follows ASC subtopic 350-20,



	 Intangibles-Goodwill
	and Other: Goodwill



	. Goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a business
	combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized,
	but instead tested for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if
	certain circumstances indicate a possible impairment may exist. The Company
	performs its annual impairment assessment for goodwill and indefinite-lived
	intangible assets in December of each year.




	The
	Company adopted ASU 2012-02,



	 Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets
	for Impairment



	, which amends the guidance in ASC subtopic 350-30 on testing
	indefinite-lived intangible assets, other than goodwill, for impairment. ASU
	2012-02 provides an entity testing an indefinite-lived intangible asset for
	impairment the option of performing a qualitative assessment before calculating
	the fair value of the asset. Although ASU 2012-02 revises the examples of
	events and circumstances that an entity should consider in interim periods, it
	does not revise the requirements to test indefinite-lived intangible assets (1)
	annually for impairment and (2) between annual tests if there is a change in
	events or circumstances. If the Company determines, on the basis of qualitative
	factors, that the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets is more
	likely than not less than the carrying amount, further testing is required.
	Under the further testing, the impairment test on indefinite-lived intangible
	assets that are not subject to amortization consists of a comparison of the
	fair value of each intangible asset with its carrying amount. If the carrying
	amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is
	recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Assets with definite lives are
	carried at cost less accumulated amortization. Intangible assets with definite
	lives are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated economic
	life.

	Concentration of Credit Risk






	Financial
	instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit
	risk are cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivables, prepaid expenses,
	accounts payable and accruals, due to/from related party and shareholder
	accounts arising from its normal business activities. 




	The
	Company maintains cash and cash equivalents with major financial institutions. 
	In addition, the due to/from affiliated companies is under common control. 
	Management considers the risk of non-performance of these instruments to be
	remote.




	The
	Company has a diversified customer-base. The Company controls credit risk
	related to accounts receivables through merchant credit card approvals, credit
	limits and monitoring procedures.  The Company routinely assesses the financial
	strength of its customers and, based upon factors surrounding the credit risk,
	establishes an allowance, if required, for uncollectible accounts and, believes
	that its accounts receivable related credit risk exposure beyond such allowance
	is limited. Based on the historical experience, Management considers the that
	it is low risk of non-performance of this instruments.




	The Company’s
	business is subject to certain risks and concentrations including risks
	relating to the condition of the economy, outbreak of disease or the occurrence
	of natural or man-made disasters, dependence on relationships with travel
	suppliers, primarily hotels and airlines, dependence on third-party technology,
	internet service, utility services and telecommunications providers, exposure
	to risks associated with online commerce security, data privacy, online payment
	and credit card fraud.

	Foreign Currency Translation Adjustment






	The Company’s financial statements are presented in the U.S.
	dollar ($), which is the Company’s reporting currency, while its functional
	currency is New Taiwan Dollar (NTD). Transactions in foreign currencies are
	initially recorded at the functional currency rate prevailing at the date of
	transaction. Any differences between the initially recorded amount and the
	settlement amount are recorded as a gain or loss on foreign currency
	transaction in the statements of operations. Monetary assets and liabilities
	denominated in foreign currency are translated at the functional currency rate
	of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date. Any differences are taken to
	profit or loss as a gain or loss on foreign currency translation in the
	statements of operations.




	In
	accordance with ASC 830, Foreign Currency Matters, the Company translates the
	assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars using the rate of exchange prevailing
	at the balance sheet date and the statements of operations and cash flows are
	translated at an average rate during the reporting period. Adjustments
	resulting from the translation from RMB into U.S. dollar are recorded in
	stockholders’ equity as part of accumulated other comprehensive income. The
	exchange rates used for financial statements in accordance with ASC 830,
	Foreign Currency Matters, are as follows:

	Accounting












	Pronouncements






	In
	September 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB")
	issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2015-16, “Business
	Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period
	Adjustments” (“ASU 2015-16”), which requires that an acquirer recognize
	adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement
	period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined.
	ASU 2015-16 is effective for fiscal years, and interim reporting periods within
	those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. The Company is currently
	evaluating the impact of the adoption of this guidance on the Consolidated
	Financial Statements.




	 




	In
	May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.
	The standard provides companies with a single model for use in accounting for
	revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes current revenue
	recognition guidance, including industry-specific revenue guidance. The core
	principle of the model is to recognize revenue when control of the goods or
	services transfers to the customer, as opposed to recognizing revenue when the
	risks and rewards transfer to the customer under the existing revenue guidance.
	On July 9, 2015, FASB voted to defer the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one
	year. The guidance would be effective for annual and interim reporting periods
	beginning after December 15, 2018 and early adoption is permitted. We are
	currently assessing the impact that adoption of ASU 2014-09 will have on our
	financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

	Note 6 LONG-TERM
	RECEIVABLES





	The Company entered
	into several collateral transfer agreements with the creditors in February 2010
	to assign the right of debt, which was collateralized by the land. In 2011,
	Taiwan Taichung District Court has ordered the pay warrants to request debtor
	pay the Company in the amount of NT$5,851,967,413. Pursuant to the agreement,
	the creditors agreed with the Company to enforce and execute the auction by the
	court or itself against the debtor’s remaining assets. In the return, the
	Company is being compensated by the creditors to use the proceeds from the sale
	of collateralized land to reinvest or develop the collateralized land to
	construct the real estate and then sell. There is no timeline to pay off the
	long-term payable and it’s probable to pay off the debt in exchange of
	investments of San Lotus Holding Inc.




	The Company has
	hired the independent appraiser to evaluate the fair value of collateralized
	land and recorded the long-term receivable based on the net realized value of
	the collaterals.




	 




	As of June 30,2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company
	has the other receivable in the following

	BUSINESS
	OVERVIEW





	 


	 




	San Lotus Holding Inc. was
	incorporated in the state of Nevada on June 21, 2011 to (1) market travel
	products and services to the growing "baby boomer" market, with an
	initial focus on the Asian market, via


	developing and
	operating a global travel and leisure agency business; and (2)


	jointly develop the tourism and travel of He Ping
	Zhen, 


	Shaowu 


	 


	City, Fujian Province,
	China with He Ping Zhen Development Ltd., a China Limited Corporation


	,
	the specific plans of which remains under preliminary discussion. Our vision is
	to consolidate travel products and services and deliver value to the world's
	travel population


	. W


	e changed our state
	of incorporation from the State of Nevada to the State of California (the
	"Conversion") on July


	 


	21,
	2015.




	 


	 




	We are a development stage
	company that plans to market global travel products to the retiring baby boomer
	generation in the Asian markets. We are in the initial stages of opening a
	travel agency in Taiwan, Republic of China. On May 21, 2012, we obtained a
	license from the Investment Commission, Ministry of Economic Affairs, Taiwan
	(R.O.C.) to invest into Taiwan through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Green Forest
	Management Consulting Inc., a Taiwan (R.O.C.) company. We anticipate that we
	will be able to obtain this approval by the end of 2016. The challenges we
	anticipate in obtaining the necessary approvals to operate a travel agency in
	Taiwan (as well as in other countries) primarily involves meeting the statutory
	requirements related to capital requirements, statutory reserves and employing
	fit, proper and qualified management. These challenges have already been
	addressed by starting our business in Taiwan (as referenced in Risk Factors
	under government approval). We expect to begin generating revenue in Taiwan in
	April 2016, after we obtain the relevant licenses and approval from Taiwan's
	government.




	 


	 




	Our travel services entity
	in Taiwan will provide both outbound travel services for customers based in
	Taiwan and inbound travel services for customers based abroad and coming to
	Taiwan. Both the outbound and inbound services will be conducted in our Taiwan
	office, except the inbound services will rely in part on advertising conducted
	or directed outside of Taiwan.




	 


	 




	We will not only book
	airplane tickets, hotels and tours, but design specialized destination-related
	travel services for our customers based on their specific needs and desires
	while they are in Taiwan. In this way, our market will consist of both those
	potential travelers based in Taiwan, but also anyone from any other country who
	might be planning a trip to Taiwan or need assistance with designing a travel
	itinerary once they arrive in Taiwan. We will market our products and services
	to the travel population in Taiwan and abroad through our website,



	www.sanlotusholding.com



	,
	as well as through services such as Twitter and other media outlets. we have
	purchased three vehicles to provide transportation to our customers while they
	are in California, a common destination for Taiwan business travelers and
	tourists.




	 


	 




	We intend to use the cars,
	with hired drivers, to provide car service for our customers from the airport
	to their hotels or other desired destinations upon their arrival in California.
	Providing car service is an experimental project at this point as we only have
	three vehicles available for use. We will charge our customers an amount that
	will cover our expenses in providing the car and driver. In the event the
	service is popular and appears to benefit our services, we may add to the
	service in the future, at which time we would reevaluate the amount we charge
	for the service.

	In addition
	to developing our business in Taiwan, in the first quarter of 2013, we entered
	into non-binding letters of intent to acquire existing travel services agencies
	in Taipei City, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Vancouver, British Columbia and
	California. We plan to proceed in negotiating terms for these acquisitions over
	the course of the next several months while we simultaneously gather
	operational data from our module operation in Taiwan. We expect to complete the
	acquisitions of such travel agencies by the end of 2016. At the same time, we
	also have entered into non-binding letters of intent to acquire land in Taiwan,
	which land we intend to use to develop destination-related travel services. We
	expect to complete the acquisitions of such land and/or land holding companies
	by the end of 2016.




	 


	 




	Despite of entering the
	non-binding letters of intent to acquire the travel agencies and land, we
	remain in the preliminary discussion with the travel agencies and the sellers
	of the land about the specific considerations to acquire them. Thus, to date,
	we are not able to estimate any specific costs in completing such acquisitions.
	Acquiring the travel agencies located both within and outside of Taiwan and
	land in Taiwan is an ongoing effort that will continue during the life of the
	Company. To facilitate our acquisition efforts, we will actively seeking
	additional funding on favorable terms to continue our acquisition. If
	additional funding is not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to
	implement our acquisitions and continue our operations. We plan to be funded by
	private placement of our equity securities and/or mortgage our land. But, there
	can be no assurance we will be funded as such. Thus, there can be no assurance
	we will successfully complete our acquisitions of travel agencies and/or land.
	If we fail to complete our acquisitions of travel agencies and/or land, we may
	be forced to cease our operation entirely, and you may lose all your
	investment.




	 


	 




	Each of these non-binding
	letters of intent above was disclosed to the SEC in a Current Report on Form
	8-K shortly after our entry into each such non-binding letter of intent.




	 


	 




	Regarding the development of
	our travel services entity in Taiwan, our plan is to build up a successful
	module operation in Taiwan and to gain meaningful operational data for one year
	before using it as a model to replicate throughout Asia. It is critically
	important for us to obtain credible data in terms of the following (per module
	main office, plus branch officers):

	5.    Breakeven
	point and Projected Earnings




	 


	 




	Making projections using
	real figures based on the module operations should lower our level of risk as
	we expand into other countries. While it is premature to set any definitive
	dates in applying for obtaining statutory approval to operate travel agencies
	beyond Taiwan (R.O.C.), we anticipate that after one full year of operation, we
	will have sufficient data to construct an expansion plan for establishing
	ventures beyond Taiwan.

	Products and Services
	Offered:




	-


	               


	Transportation: airlines / buses / car
	rentals / railways / cruises;




	-


	               


	Accommodation: hotels / resorts /
	cruises; and




	-


	              


	Packaged holidays / local tours.




	 


	 




	Our business strategy is to
	generate revenue mainly through commissions or mark-ups for selling travel
	products. For example, for airplane tickets, for which we do not take
	inventory, we will receive commission revenue from the airlines as compensation
	for selling airplane tickets to our customers. In other words, our revenue will
	not come directly from the payments which the customers make to the airlines,
	but instead our commission revenue will be paid by the product provider (e.g.
	airlines) directly to our Company. The size of commission will vary from
	product to product, depending on how product providers (e.g. airlines) set
	their distribution strategy. Below is an estimate of the commission percentage
	we expect to be able to obtain for each type of product:




	 


	 








	Type of Product






	Estimated Commission %










	Transportation






	3 ~ 10%








	Accommodation






	3 ~ 10%








	Packaged Tours






	3 ~ 10%









	 


	 




	Another type of revenue
	would come from mark-ups. Our mark-up revenue will be earned when we choose to
	take inventory on products such as hotel stays, cruise trips or tours. This
	type of revenue is different from commission-based revenue in that we will
	secure the product outright before customers purchase the product. After we
	purchase the product, we would then sell the product to the customer at a
	higher price, thereby earning the difference or mark-up as profit. The size of
	the mark-up will vary depending on our inventory level, market conditions and
	customer preference.




	 


	 




	Below is an
	estimate of the mark-up percentage and the initial cost of obtaining wholesale
	inventory for each type of product:





	 



	 








	Type of
	Product






	Estimated
	Mark-up %






	Initial
	Cost of Obtaining Wholesale Inventory










	Transportation






	5 ~ 20%






	$10,000








	Accommodation






	10 ~ 30%






	$30,000








	Packaged Tours






	10 ~ 20%






	$10,000










	 



	 




	We expect to incur the cost
	of obtaining wholesale inventory as soon as our license to operate a travel
	agency has been granted. Consequently, we will recover the cost and make a
	profit when inventory is turned over or sold. The profitability of our mark-up
	business will depend on how frequent inventory is turned.




	 


	 




	We
	anticipate providing other ancillary travel services such as submitting visa
	applications on behalf of clients. It is our understanding that it is customary
	to charge a handling fee of US$5~10 for the submission of a visa application.
	These types of services, however, should only constitute a small part of our
	overall revenue.




	 


	 




	We plan to market our
	company to high-income individuals and affinity groups, such as private
	schools, alumni groups and wealth management organizations at banks and
	investment firms. Our plan to reach these target customers is through seeking
	lists from the affinity groups and marketing online. In terms of seeking lists
	from affinity groups, our strategy involves no upfront cost to our company. We
	will instead share the profits with the organizations that provided such lists
	when customers purchase travel products through our company. Our general rule
	of thumb is to share 50% of the profit with the affinity group. This estimate
	may be adjusted upward or downward depending on the size and quality of the
	customer list. Separately, we plan to market our company online through our
	company website. Currently under construction, our company website,
	www.sanlotusholding.com, will be a vehicle to promote our offerings to a wide
	audience. We plan on interacting with our retail customers primarily through
	our website. Our customers will be able to place their purchases via the
	telephone, through credit card or bank transfer payment.

	Business
	Development





	 


	 




	The Company seeks to develop
	mutually beneficial business relationships with travel product providers, such
	as airlines, hotels and tour operators, and will begin offering travel products
	to our customers. The Company will work on reaching a variety of affinity
	groups and reaching agreements to service their customers. The Company recently
	launched a website, www.sanlotusholding.com, to begin marketing our services
	online. Our costs as a reporting company in our first year are approximately
	$165,000 in legal fees and $45,000 in auditing fees, including the preparation
	of our 10-K filing and annual audit. And, our costs as a reporting company in
	our second year are approximately $16,193 in legal fees and $50,300 in auditing
	fees, including the preparation of our 10-K filing and annual audit.




	 


	 





	Marketing
	and Sales





	 


	 




	Our initial marketing
	efforts will be designed to drive prospective clients to our website,
	www.sanlotusholding.com. We plan to use social media vehicles such as Twitter
	and Facebook to generate awareness of our website. We expect to engage
	prospective clients through promoting our website and responding to requests
	for information. Eventually, we expect to use broader-based email marketing to
	generate a much larger number of sales leads that will be followed up with a
	personal exchange, via email or telephone, but there is no guarantee this will
	be successful.




	 


	 




	We have
	taken the following steps in implementing our business plan:




	 


	 







	Vendor
	Discussion and Supplier Agreements





	 


	 




	We have contacted vendors to
	provide travel related products to our customers. Below is a summary of the
	number of vendors who have responded favorably to our request. We have not
	signed any formal supplier agreements with product vendors.

	We have
	completed the initial version of our website, www.sanlotusholding.com, and will
	use this site to market our services to the general public.




	 


	 





	Affinity
	Groups





	 


	 




	We have used the contacts of
	our directors and officers in initially contacting various affinity groups.
	Thus far, we have had conversations with no less than five groups that have
	expressed interest in sharing their group list with our company. However, at
	this time we have not executed any of agreements with these companies. Below is
	a summary of the statistics we wish to reach regarding various affinity groups:

	We are in the process of
	applying for our license to operate a travel agency in Taiwan. We expect to
	receive approval for our business license by the end of 2016. Once proper
	licenses and approvals have been granted, we will need to take the following
	steps in generating revenue:




	 


	 




	-


	        


	Formally launch online operations (in or after 2016)




	 


	 




	-


	        


	Sign formal supplier agreements with product vendors
	that have expressed interest previously (in or after 2016)




	 


	 




	-


	        


	Sign on additional product vendors (in or after 2016)




	 


	 




	-


	        


	Sign profit sharing agreements with affinity groups
	that have expressed interest previously (completed as of the year 2012)




	 


	 




	-


	        


	Sign on additional affinity groups (in or after 2016)




	 


	 




	-


	        


	Hire office staff (in or after 2016)




	 


	 




	These steps will ensure that
	we have sufficient product and service offerings to attract customers, both to
	launch our operations and on an ongoing basis going forward.




	 


	 




	In addition to the aforementioned
	steps, we are in the process of investing in and developing scenic/destination
	real estate sites through the acquisition of land and land holding companies.
	We acquired certain land and canceled certain land transactions in Taiwan
	(R.O.C.), which is specifically described in Item 2 of our annual report on
	Form 10-K filed on March 9, 2016 ( as amended by the Form 10K/A filed on March
	11, 2016


	).  




	 


	 




	We expect the destination
	real estate portion of our business to make up approximately half of our
	overall business in the future, with the other half consisting of travel
	agencies. By destination real estate, we mean to develop locations that will
	attract and support visitors for stays of one day or longer, providing outdoor
	activities and places of interest for visitors from both domestic locales and
	abroad. In addition to our destination real estate business, we are continuing
	to develop our travel agency in Taiwan and have entered into certain
	non-binding letters of intent to acquire travel agencies located outside of
	Taiwan in both Asia and North America. We aim to complete the acquisition of
	five travel


	 


	agencies by the end of 2016. We
	intend to fund all of these acquisitions through the sale of our common stock.
	While this will cause dilution to the existing shareholders, we do not believe
	this dilution will negatively affect the shareholders as the acquisitions will
	add significant value to the Company and will allow the Company to proceed in
	developing its business.




	 


	 




	We may also from time to time
	invest in travel-related service providers that we believe can help us better
	service our customers and help them meet their travel needs. Through investing
	in such entities, we may be able to recoup some of our costs through
	maintaining small ownership interests in the entities our clients use.
	Furthermore, by investing in these entities, we may be able to work with them
	to better improve their travel offerings or related services or bring the
	entities up to the standard of service our customers expect. We recently made
	one such investment in A Peace World Holding Inc. ("APW"), a company
	in the early stages of developing destination real estate products and
	services. We expect that APW, based on its expressed business plans, will
	develop destination real estate that our customers will be interested in
	traveling to, thus enhancing the products and services we can provide to our
	customers. Any costs involved in offering such products and services to our
	customers, if there are any such costs, will be incorporated into the fees we
	charge our customers for our service. At this time we have no further plans for
	making any additional such investments and therefore have no plans of making
	further capital expenditures in relation to such investments.




	 


	 




	 


	 




	 


	 




	 


	 




	 


	 




	 


	 





	Competition





	 


	 




	We will be operating in two
	sectors - in the area of destination real estate development and travel
	agencies. These two sectors will complement each other as, over the long term,
	the travel agencies will be able to refer clients and visitors to our
	destination real estate sites. We will face competition from many individuals
	and companies that also market travel locations and products. As concerns
	travel destinations, we desire to utilize scenic properties that will allow for
	outdoor activities. Thus we must create locations that provide both activities
	of interest and provide convenience and amenities, while allowing visitors to
	enjoy the natural beauty of the area around them.

	Observation tells us that
	the current travel industry is generally driven by the lowest cost provider.
	However, different segments of the market, such as the affluent segment,
	consider factors beyond cost when they plan vacations and travel. Ahead of
	cost, an affluent consumer may value factors such as convenience, comprehensive
	service, and luxury and/or prestige, to name a few. We believe that a
	successful marketing effort to reach the affluent market segment (retiring baby
	boomers) with the right quality of products should increase our revenue
	opportunity. In Taiwan, market conditions for the travel industry are similar
	to those of the U.S. There is a mix of large travel agencies, online service
	providers and small-scale local operators. However, since Taiwan is geographically
	much smaller than the U.S., competition is fierce.




	 


	 




	In Taiwan, there are four types of travel agencies:




	 


	 




	1.


	     


	Mega Agencies




	 


	 




	A.


	       


	Lion Travel




	 


	 




	B.


	       


	Cola Tour




	 


	 




	C.


	       


	EZ Travel




	 


	 




	2.


	     


	Intermediate-Small - locally or regionally owned
	agencies




	 


	 




	A.


	       


	Star Travel




	 


	 




	B.


	       


	SET Tour




	 


	 




	3.


	     


	Independent Agencies: Usually catering to a special or
	niche market




	 


	 




	A.


	       


	Royal Jet Way




	 


	 




	B.


	       


	Perfect Travel




	 


	 




	C.


	       


	Life Tour




	 


	 




	4.


	     


	Airline & other types of travel consolidators




	 


	 




	A.


	       


	China Airlines




	 


	 




	B.


	       


	EVA Airlines




	 


	 




	C.


	       


	American Express




	 


	 




	We feel at this time we
	would fall into the Independent Agency category and hope to create our own
	niche as a more customer-oriented agency or travel service provider with a
	reputation of going the "extra mile" wherever possible in connecting
	the right type of customers with the right type of products.




	 


	 




	Concerning destination real
	estate sites, there are many competitors who will be vying for the business of
	our potential clientele. The key will be to develop attractive properties that
	provide the amenities and activities that visitors would enjoy. In our
	development plans, we are defining destination real estate as locations that
	will draw tourist from both domestically and abroad to visit our sites for a
	period of one or two days or more. So in the long term we will be developing
	sites that include hotels, restaurants, as well as activity and entertainment
	centers, among other things. Some of our competitors in the destination real
	estate sector in Taiwan include the following companies:

	EMERGING GROWTH COMPANY
	STATUS





	We
	qualify as an "emerging growth company" under the Jumpstart Our
	Business Startups Act (the "JOBS Act"). As a result, we are permitted
	to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements. For so long as we
	are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to:




	 


	 








	●






	have
	an auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant
	to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;








	 


	 








	●






	comply
	with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting
	Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to
	the auditor's report providing additional information about the audit and the
	financial statements (i.e., an auditor discussion and analysis);








	 


	 








	●






	submit
	certain executive compensation matters to shareholder advisory votes, such as
	"say-on-pay" and "say-on-frequency"; and








	 


	 








	●






	disclose
	certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between
	executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the CEO's
	compensation to median employee compensation.









	 


	 




	In
	addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth
	company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in
	Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised
	accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the
	adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise
	apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits
	of this extended transition period. Our financial statements may therefore not
	be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised
	accounting standards.




	 


	 




	We
	will remain an "emerging growth company" for up to five years, or
	until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our
	total annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a
	"large accelerated filer" as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the
	Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which would occur if the market value of our
	ordinary shares that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the
	last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or (iii)
	the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt
	during the preceding three year period.

	Liquidity
	and Capital Resources





	 


	 





	Capital
	Resources and Liquidity





	 


	 




	Excluding
	our planned acquisitions, we expect the running of San Lotus Holding Inc.;
	Green Forest  Management
	Consulting Inc.; Da Ren International Development Inc.;


	Mao Ren International Inc.; and


	XO Experience Inc. to require
	approximately $600,000 to carry out planned operations for the next 12 months.
	 


	To meet our needs for cash required for
	sustain our businesses and completing our planned acquisitions, we will need to
	generate sufficient revenues or require additional funding through the private
	placement of our equity securities and/or mortgage our land. But, there can be
	no assurance we will be funded as such. And, there can be no assurance that our
	existing shareholders will provide us with additional capital.




	  




	As
	of June 30, 2016, we had $3,088cash in the bank; $1,844 cash held by our
	wholly-owned Taiwan (R.O.C.) subsidiary, Green Forest Management Consulting
	Inc.; $132 cash held by our wholly-owned Taiwan (R.O.C.) subsidiary,


	Mao Ren International Inc.;


	$30 cash held by
	our wholly-owned Taiwan (R.O.C.) subsidiary, Da Ren International Development
	Inc.; and $0 cash held by our wholly-owned California subsidiary,


	XO EXPERIENCE INC.


	for purposes of building our
	travel services business in Taiwan.




	 


	 




	Based upon the
	above, we believe that Mao Ren


	International
	Inc.


	will not have enough funds to support themselves for remaining
	months.


	We will likely to seek


	additional funding through the private placement of our equity
	securities and/or mortgage our land. But, there can be no assurance we will be
	funded as such. And, there can be no assurance that our existing shareholders
	will provide us with additional capital.




	 


	 




	As
	to our planned acquisitions, although the non-binding letters of intent to
	acquire the travel agencies were entered, we remain in the preliminary
	discussion with them about the specific considerations to acquire each of them.
	Thus, to date, we are not able to estimate any specific costs in completing
	such acquisitions. Additionally, except for the completed acquisitions of Da
	Ren International Development Inc., we remain in the preliminary
	discussion about the specific consideration in acquiring other land or land
	holding companies. Thus, to date, we are not able to estimate any specific
	costs in completing the acquisitions other than the completed acquisitions.




	 


	 




	If
	we require additional funding to complete our planned acquisitions, we will
	actively seeking additional funding by completing a private placement of our
	equity securities and/or mortgage our land. But, there can be no assurance we
	will be funded as such. And, there can be no assurance that our existing
	shareholders will provide us with additional capital. Finally, if we are unable
	to generate sufficient revenue and/or obtain additional funding, we may have to
	cease operations entirely. We cannot guarantee that our operations and proceeds
	from any funding will be sufficient for us to continue as going concern.

	Going
	Concern





	 


	 




	At present, we have no
	enough cash to pay for our selling, general and administrative expenses. As
	such, in order to continue developing our operations as planned, we may be
	reliant on obtaining additional funding by private placement of our equity
	securities and/or obtaining the loan by mortgage our land. But, there can be no
	assurance we will be funded as such. Thus, there can be no assurance we will
	successfully continue our operation and/or complete our plan of operations


	. 


	Based on these assumptions, our auditor has
	expressed doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.




	 


	 





	Critical
	Accounting Polices





	 


	 




	We
	have made no material changes to our critical accounting policies in connection
	with the preparation of financial statements included in this Quarterly Report
	on Form 10-Q.




	 


	 





	Impact
	of Accounting Pronouncements





	 


	 




	There
	were no recent accounting pronouncements that have had a material effect on the
	Company's financial position or results of operations.




	 


	 





	Recently
	Issued Accounting Policies





	 


	 




	The
	Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect.
	These pronouncements did not have any material impact on the financial
	statements unless otherwise disclosed, and the Company does not believe that
	there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that
	might have a material impact on its financial position or results of
	operations.




	 


	 




	 


	 




	 


	 





	OFF-BALANCE

	do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably
	likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition or results
	of operations.




	 


	 







	Item

	We do not take positions or

	degree, nor as defined by SEC rules and instructions. Based on the nature of
	our current operations, we have not identified any issues of market risk at
	this time.

	Item
	4. Controls and Procedures.





	 


	 





	Evaluation
	of disclosure controls and procedures.





	 


	 




	Disclosure controls and
	procedures are controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that
	information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities
	Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") are recorded, processed,
	summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules
	and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation,
	controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be
	disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange
	Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief
	executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow for
	timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our
	disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and
	procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only
	reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and
	management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating and implementing
	possible controls and procedures.




	 


	 




	Management conducted its
	evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures under the supervision of our
	chief executive officer. Based on that evaluation, our chief executive officer
	and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and
	procedures were not effective as of June 30, 2014 due to a material weakness in
	our internal control over financial reporting which is described below.




	 


	 




	Management identified
	significant deficiencies related to (i) the lack of U.S. GAAP expertise of our
	chief financial officer, (ii) the lack of U.S. GAAP expertise of our internal
	accounting staff, and (iii) the company's failure to have a board of directors
	consisting of a majority of independent directors and our lack of a director
	who qualifies as an audit committee financial expert as defined in Item
	407(d)(5)(ii) of Regulation S-K. We plan to address these weaknesses in the
	near term as the Company develops.




	 


	 





	Changes
	in internal controls.





	 


	 




	There
	were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the
	period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably
	likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
	reporting.

	PART II - OTHER INFORMATION





	 


	 







	Item
	1. Legal Proceedings.





	 


	 




	Our management knows of no
	material existing or pending legal proceeding, litigation or claim against us,
	nor are we involved as a plaintiff in any material existing legal proceeding or
	pending legal proceeding, litigation or claim.




	 


	 




	Yu Chien-Yang, our vice
	president and a member of our board of directors, was indicted by the Taichung
	District Prosecutor's Office of Taichung County, Taiwan (R.O.C.) on May 17,
	2013. The indictment in no way involves San Lotus Holding Inc. or any of our
	subsidiaries and the matters described therein do not include any conduct
	involving, by, or on behalf of the Company or any of our subsidiaries.




	 


	 




	The
	enforcement actions were brought against seven individuals, including Mr. Yu,
	alleging violations of Taiwan's banking and securities laws in connection with
	disclosure issues related to a single corporate bond issuance. The action
	predates Mr. Yu's employment with the Company and is in connection with Mr.
	Yu's service at another company, Da Chuang Business Management Consultant Co.,
	Ltd. and its subsidiary, Da Ren International Investments Inc., which had
	conducted a general solicitation of its corporate bonds to the general public
	in the year 2010. We do not expect this litigation to have a material effect on
	our business.





	 


	 







	Item
	1A. Risk Factors.





	 


	 




	There
	is no any material changes from risk factors as previously disclosed in our
