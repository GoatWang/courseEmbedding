Enhanced Yield Dividend







An Income Oriented Portfolio

The Cypress Enhanced Dividend Yield Portfolio seeks to maximize current income while protecting principle through investment in fundamentally sound dividend paying equities, preferred stocks, MLPs, and convertible debt securities.
In the current low rate environment, we seek a yield between 3% and 5% – approximately 2x the rate of S&P 500 and 2.5x the 10yr treasury rate – with some capacity for future growth in the income stream. To achieve this target, the mix of instruments may vary over time as market conditions evolve.

What are analysts saying about Zoetis stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Zoetis stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Zoetis’ growth in revenues is being driven by sales of companion animal products such as Simparica, Apoquel and Cytopoint while the livestock portfolio was driven by growth in swine, cattle and fish across the international markets. Zoetis’ expects to see stronger growth from its companion animal portfolio in 2017 driven by Apoquel and Cytopoint, further penetration of Simparica, and ongoing uptake of new vaccines. Favorable market conditions contributed to swine performance in China as well as cattle product sales in Brazil. Shares of Zoetis have outperformed the industry in 2017 so far. However, disease outbreak among animals is a material cause of concern for Zoetis’ livestock products. Zoetis faces stiff competition from companies like Merck Animal Health (the animal health division of Merck), Elanco (the animal health division of Eli Lilly among others. " (7/4/2017)
2. Guggenheim analysts commented, "We are raising our PT for ZTS shares after a 4Q beat and a lower than expected FX headwind for '17. The increase in our PT is driven by multiple expansion. We arrive at our new PT by using a DCF analysis. ZTS's solid execution this quarter increases our confidence that it can exceed consensus expectations for '17+ and sustain its 21x forward P/E multiple. Upward earnings revisions could come from margin expansion, M&A, and launches. Therefore, the sell-off today, which we think is motivated by profit taking, is overdone, in our view. We believe the weakness (ZTS down 3% vs. S&P down 0.14%) presents a good buying opportunity for the stock." (2/16/2017)

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Zoetis (NYSE:ZTS) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 1 Sell Rating, 4 Hold Ratings, 13 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 2.67)Consensus Price Target: $63.06 (0.17% downside)
