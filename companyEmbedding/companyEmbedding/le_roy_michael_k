        Office of the President
        









President Michael K. Le Roy, Ph.D.




Michael K. Le Roy was born in La Mesa, Calif., and  grew up on Bainbridge Island, Washington, near Seattle. He has spent a lot of  time sailing, canoeing and kayaking on the waters of Puget Sound.
Baptized in the Methodist Church, Le Roy was raised  as a Presbyterian, and he credits two ministers of his home church with helping  him to form his faith: “These leaders created the space within the church where  I could ask questions and be honest with my doubts, but not be left to struggle  alone,” he said.
On the recommendation of his mentors, Le Roy  attended Whitworth University, a Christian liberal arts institution in Spokane,  Wash. He described his undergraduate career there as “nothing short of  transforming.” Le Roy majored in international studies and peace studies. He  traveled and studied in three Central American countries in the midst of civil  war. He worked on trade policy in apartheid-era South Africa through an  internship with the Presbyterian Church in Washington, D.C.
“I was confronted with the pervasiveness and  totality of human sin and became committed to a Reformed worldview as the only  credible intellectual and spiritual response to the brokenness I found,” he  said of these experiences.
At Whitworth, Le Roy met Andrea Nelson, a graduate  of Taylor University. They married in 1988. Le Roy graduated Whitworth in 1989.  He earned a PhD in political science at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tenn., in 1994. Andrea completed a master’s in psychology from Vanderbilt’s Peabody School of Education in 1992.
During his time at Vanderbilt, Le Roy worked his way  through a reading list—works by Augustine, Calvin, Kuyper, Noll, Wolters,  Wolterstorff, plus the Westminster and Heidelberg catechisms—that nourished his  growing Reformed perspective on life and learning. He also studied on a  Fulbright Scholarship at Goteborgs universitet in Goteberg, Sweden, and taught  as a visiting professor at the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Va.
From 1994 through 2002, Le Roy taught political  science at Wheaton College in Wheaton, Ill. He also chaired the department of  politics and international relations, developed a new international relations major  and served for six years as the director of the Wheaton in Europe program.
Le Roy was recognized with that institution’s  Faculty Achievement Award for Excellence in Teaching in 1998. He earned the  Excellence in Teaching Award from the American Political Science Association in  1999.
Le Roy returned to his alma mater in  2002, where he established himself as a teacher and a prolific scholar. He led  faculty teams that worked on Whitworth's capstone program—integrating ethics,  public policy, culture and Christian worldview—and its venerable Central  America Study Program.
In 2005, Le Roy was appointed as Whitworth's vice  president of academic affairs and dean of faculty: “I remember feeling quite  content in my role as a faculty member,” he said, “but I also felt a deep  obligation to be of service to the institution, my colleagues, our students and  Whitworth’s mission.”
Le Roy worked to extend the university’s teaching  and research in the sciences and to expand the funding for both. He improved  the university’s tenure standards and established “Vocation of the Christian Professor,”  Whitworth’s faculty development program. He also led design planning for the  Ernst F. Lied Center for the Visual Arts, the Robinson Science Hall and Whitworth’s  first international education center in San Rafael de Heredia, Costa Rica. In  2010, Le Roy was appointed Whitworth’s executive vice president.
In December 2011, after a seven-month process, the presidential  search committee of Calvin College asked Michael K. Le Roy, Ph.D., to serve as the  college’s 10th president. In January, the Calvin board of trustees  approved the committee’s choice, and on June 11, 2012, the synod of the  Christian Reformed Church (CRC) of North America ratified the decision.
“Higher education is at a very  challenging era of its history right now in the United States, and it’s not  clear what paths forward are the best,” Le Roy said. “I’m convinced that with  the kinds of minds and capable people we have at Calvin that, together, we will  discover some powerful ways forward.”
He is a strong believer in the role of Christian liberal arts in the landscape  of Christian higher education:
“You can’t diminish the importance of  preparing students for meaningful work, and yet, that’s one part of a whole  life lived well,” he said, “but a lot of it has to do with what we do after 5  o’clock, as parents, as citizens, as community members, as patrons of the arts…. Christian higher education then says all of faith is relevant to all of  that life.”
Michael K. Le Roy and Andrea Nelson Le Roy are both ordained elders in the Presbyterian Church. They have three  children: son Dana,  and daughters Hannah and Astrid. The family  enjoys hiking, sailing, cross-country skiing and other outdoor sports. They  plan to join a Christian Reformed congregation when they move to Grand Rapids.
The Le Roy family looks forward to mingling with the Calvin student body at art  exhibitions, engineering open houses, poster sessions, musical and theatrical  performances and other events.
“Usually, if you are tired of  meetings, the thing that puts the energy and sense of purpose back in the work  is to make sure that you are out there, touching base and connecting,” Le Roy  said. They are ready to cheer on the Knights in every sport.
President Le Roy is eager to take on  the challenge of leading Calvin: “I’ve wanted to be in the place—and I’ve only  ever wanted to be in the place—where I delight in the work of the mission,” he  said, “and at Calvin I found a place that I’m very confident that I will  delight in that work for years to come.”

Mixed Race Studies   » Michael K. Le Roy
























































































































Mixed Race Studies
Scholarly perspectives on the mixed race experience.	


The contrast between the multigenerational and first-generation experiences is further underscored by the fact that the latter is frequently viewed as a more legitimate basis for multiracial identity. The reasons for this are related to the repeal of anti-miscegenation laws in 1967 and the liberalization of social attitudes on race over the past three decades. Moreover, the first-generation experience originates in the context of interracial marriage and thus includes an element of choice. Marriages confer equal legal status on both parties and, by extension, equal legitimacy on both parents' identities. The one-drop rule, therefore, has been less consistently enforced, both in theory and in practice, in the case of their offspring. This is particularly true of policies at the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) and to a lesser extent of the Census Bureau. Before the 1980s, the NCHS ciassified racially blended children in terms of the "minority" parent, while the Census Bureau classified them in terms of the father's racial or ethnic identity. Since the 1980s both agencies have based the children's race on the racial identity of the mother. Many multiracial  children of European American mothers have therefore been designated as "white" rather than as "biracial." Since the mid-1960s, however, adoption agencies have tended to describe blended children as "racially mixed" or "biracial" in order to attract white adoptive parents by appealing to their Eurocentric bias. Such flexibility has not been extended so readily to multi generational individuals. Their experience carries with it the implicit stigma of concubinage, rape, and illegitimacy; and the parents and families of these individuals have typically been seen as African American. Attitudes toward Native Americans and Latinos—two other populations that have experienced significant miscegenation with European Americans—provide a point of contrast. The European American, as well as the Native American and Latino communities, have more openly acknowledged multiple racial and cultural backgrounds in the discourse on identity. In these populations as well, however, the same divisive and pernicious "colorism" that has infected African-descent Americans has arisen, with the result that  lighter-skinned and otherwise more European-appearing Latinos and Native Americans are  treated preferentially within and outside their communities. Nevertheless,  greater openness among these groups to multiracialism has mitigated the generational differences as the primary factor determining the legitimacy of multiracial identity. Multigenerational individuals of European American and African American decent, therefore, find themselves at odds not only with the larger society and the African American community, but often with first-generation individuals as well. Since most African-descent Americans have some European American ancestry in their genealogy but identify themselves as black, blacks often accuse multigenerational individuals of trying to escape the stigma attached to "blackness."  Some first-generation individuals contend that their own biracial experience is the legitimate starting point for a blended identity...

Putting racism, white supremacy, and white privilege in context

Putting racism, white supremacy, and white privilege in context
Chimes: The official student newspaper of Calvin College
Grand Rapids, Michigan
2015-12-11
Joseph Kuilema, Professor of Social Work

On Sunday, Nov. 22, two members of our community wrote “white power” and drew a swastika in the snow on a car. Many members of our community condemned these actions as hateful and totally incompatible with our mission. In some ways, that’s the easy part. What has been more difficult is to acknowledge that what occurred was not an isolated incident, a freak occurrence in an otherwise loving and inclusive community. While few members of this community openly espouse white supremacy, many members of our community continue to deny white privilege. It must be clearly stated that those who deny white privilege functionally believe in white supremacy, whether they have the courage to write it on a car or not.
In his remarks on the incident, President Le Roy rightly identified the statement “white power” and the swastika with white supremacy and the ideology that shaped Nazi Germany, apartheid South Africa, chattel slavery in the U.S. and the Jim Crow South. He focused on two scriptures, the story of Jesus and the woman caught in adultery (John 7:53-8:11), and Jesus warning that before we remove the splinter in the eye of the other we ought to attend to the plank in our own (Matthew 7:1-5, Luke 6:37-42). He did this largely in the context of not demonizing those who committed these acts, and that is an appropriate concern. Christians should never reduce anyone to the worst thing they have done. None of us stands innocent before the Lord.
However, we should never mention Nazi Germany, apartheid South Africa or the Jim Crow South without identifying the connections to us here at Calvin College and the brutality right here in Grand Rapids…
…At the same time, I have to respectfully disagree with President Le Roy’s assertion that we are all racists. I, Joseph Kuilema, am certainly a racist. As a white male, I benefit tremendously from institutions and systems that have been built by and for people like me. This is how the social sciences define racism, not as merely the product of prejudice, explicit or implicit bias, but a system of power based on the invention of the “white race” by people in power. By this definition, we are not all racists…
