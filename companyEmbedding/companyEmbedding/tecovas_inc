    Our Story | Tecovas Fine Bootmakers
  


















































































FREE SHIPPING • FREE RETURNS • FREE EXCHANGES










Our Story




How It Started


          Our story starts with a simple desire for handmade, high-quality
          boots that don't break the bank. We were tired of exorbitant
          $400-600 entry-level prices for the boots we wanted–not to 
          mention the lack of trustworthy online shopping options.
        



           We spent months traveling and researching before figuring 
           out that it was possible to make the boots we wanted to
           wear—at prices that everyone would want to wear them. So we got to work.
        






          
          WE HAVE A LOVE FOR CLASSIC BOOTMAKING… BUT NOT CLASSIC RETAIL MODELS.
        




The Tecovas Promise

Quality Without Compromise

         	 It isn't easy to make boots the way we do,
            but we stick with our top-notch leathers and 
            classic construction techniques because we
            believe anyone who loves boots deserves the 
            best. We’ll never compromise our quality by
            using cheap materials or quick workarounds.          
          
TRANSPARENCY, ALWAYS

            We don't like secrets (or marketing gimmicks, or hidden 
            markups, or mysterious places of origin) — and we
            don't think anyone else does either. As our customer, it's 
            your right to know where and how your products are made.
          
YOUR EXPERIENCE ABOVE ALL

            Our goal goes far beyond making high-quality
            boots -- it's to transform the customer 
            experience,  from shopping for the perfect pair
            of boots to making sure you find your forever 
            fit. We know our brand starts and ends with 
            you — and we won’t forget it.

A New Model
We sell directly to you and only online

              Our boots are made by hand in León, 
              Mexico — appropriately known as the 
              Shoe-Making Capital of the World — 
              alongside some of the biggest, most
              respected brands in the industry. By 
              selling our boots directly to you and 
              exclusively online, we’re saving you 
              from paying for the unnecessary markups 
              and costs associated with a traditional 
              brick-and-mortar supply chain.
            










The Truth
Handmade Boots Don't Need To Cost Half A Grand 

           		By the time you pay for them, top-quality boot manufacturers
                and retailers have marked up their boots 4 to 6 times (or more!). 
                We sell you handmade boots that can stand toe-to-toe against the most
                expensive brands out there — but at a fraction of the cost. 
            










DOUBLING DOWN ON VALUE
OUR BOOTS ARE A GOOD INVESTMENT

           	  Simply put? Our boots are not only half the price of
              those of similar quality, but they’re twice the quality
              of those at similar prices.
