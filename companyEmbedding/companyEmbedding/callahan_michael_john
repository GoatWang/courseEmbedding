Top record matches for John Michael Callahan






Surname meaning for "Callahan"
Irish: reduced Anglicized form of Gaelic Ó Ceallacháin
‘descendant of Ceallachán’, a diminutive of the personal
name Ceallach, possibly meaning ‘lover of churches’, from
ceall ‘church’, or (more likely) ‘bright-headed’, from
cen ‘head’ + lach ‘light’. This name was borne by a
10th-century king of Munster, from whom many present-day bearers of
the surname claim descent.
