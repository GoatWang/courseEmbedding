Supplier diversity program










At United, we are dedicated to helping connect not just places but people, and foster a more open, prosperous and tolerant world. In order to fulfill that mission, our people and processes must be as diverse and far-reaching as the communities we connect and the customers we serve around the globe.
We make this commitment not merely because we believe it creates value for our company, though it does; but because it derives from our fundamental values as a company.
The phrase, “We are United,” though expressed in many languages by our more than 86,000 employees spread around the globe, articulates a shared purpose to make a lasting, positive impact everywhere we operate.
This commitment to diversity, inclusion and empowerment extends from our workforce and continues in our relationships with our suppliers. As a global operating company, with countless moving parts, we know the scale of impact we can make on local communities around the world by reaching out to suppliers of all backgrounds and sizes.
When a young, female entrepreneur can compete on a level playing field with larger companies, and have access to business opportunities with United, that makes our own product better. When ambitious start-ups can break barriers of race and religion that held previous generations back from achieving their dreams and make the best bid for our business, then progress is made. When a veteran can apply the world-class skills and experiences in order to make us safer and better, we can fly a little friendlier each day.
We hold true to these commitments because they are right, and because they elevate the quality of the service we provide - which is to deliver the most safe, high-quality, on-time, customer-friendly experience in the industry.
On behalf of the entire United family, I hope that you recognize the pride we take in opening doors of opportunity to all types of businesses and entrepreneurs around the globe and helping to build a more united economy.

Commitment
United's commitment to providing equal business opportunities is expressed through our Supplier Diversity Initiative. Over the years our program has grown into an integral part of United’s business operations. Today we view all of our suppliers as key business partners who contribute to the bottom line.
Our program objective is to ensure that certified minority-, women-, veteran and service disabled veteran-, LGBT- owned companies, business enterprises owned by persons with disabilities, small businesses, and historically underdeveloped regions (HUBZone) businesses have the opportunity to compete to provide products and services within United’s extensive supply chain. United encourages all viable minority- and women-owned businesses to become part of our Supplier Diversity Initiative.
United is a member of the National Minority Supplier Development Council (NMSDC) and  Women’s Business Enterprise National Council (WBENC) and many of their local affiliate councils such as the  Chicago Minority Supplier Development Council (CMSDC), the Houston Minority Supplier Development Council (HMSDC), the Women’s Business Enterprise Alliance (WBEA) and the Women's Business Development Center (WBDC).
Expectations
United Airlines utilizes a robust competitive/total cost of ownership (TCO) bid process to deliver products and services to our customers worldwide. Our TCO process ensures suppliers add value to our supply chain by understanding our business. We look for:

Quality products and services
Best overall value
Reliable delivery
Customer service and effective follow-through
Financial stability
Innovation and continuous improvement

We’re sorry for the inconvenience. Please print the registration form and then email the completed form to supplierdiversity@united.com.

If there is a business opportunity that matches your capabilities, we will reach out to you. If there is a current contract in place, or if we do not have an opportunity for you at this time, we will retain your information in our database for future consideration.
If you have any questions, please contact our Supplier Diversity Team at a phone number listed below or at supplierdiversity@united.com. Thank you for your interest in doing business with United Airlines.
Second-tier supplier diversity participation program
At United we encourage our key business partners to participate in our supplier diversity efforts by working with diverse suppliers to support the work they do for us. This allows United to maximize opportunities in the supply chain and further support the communities we serve.
Second-tier supplier diversity results are due 15 days after the close of each quarter. To report your second-tier supplier diversity results, please visit united.starssmp.com.

Ticket refund policies
Tickets purchased through united.com or the United Customer Contact Center within the last 24 hours may qualify for waiver of change or cancellation fees under our 24-hour flexible booking policy.
In all other cases, a refund may be requested for any fare that allows refunds. Depending on the rules of the fare purchased, a cancellation fee may apply. Most fares are nonrefundable, and are not eligible for voluntary refunds. However, the value of your ticket may be eligible to be applied toward the price of a new ticket for a fee. Tickets are valid one year from the date of ticket issuance.
The refund amount you will receive depends on several variables. For example, tickets that are partially traveled will be calculated at a prorated amount based on the rules of the ticket purchased and segments flown. Fees and surcharges collected in conjunction with the ticket will only be refunded if applicable.
Select a section below for more information:


Travel agency and cruise line agency tickets

Refunds for tickets issued through a travel agency should be processed through the issuing agency.

Tickets issued by another airline
Refunds for tickets issued by another airline for United flights should be processed through the issuing airline.
Reissued and partially-used tickets
The refund amount for reissued or partially used tickets will be based on the difference between the fare plus charges applicable to the originally issued ticket and the fare plus charges of the segments flown.
MileagePlus®

MileagePlus award tickets are subject to the fees outlined in our MileagePlus Award Terms and Conditions.
MileagePlus mileage purchase
Purchased or transferred MileagePlus miles are added to the receiving account immediately, and these transactions are nonrefundable.
MileagePlus upgrade service fees
Members will be charged the service fee when requesting an upgrade to United PolarisSM first class, United First®, United Polaris business class or United Business®. If for any reason the upgrade is not provided, the service fee will be refunded in conjunction with the re-deposit of the miles used to upgrade.

Delayed or canceled flights

When complications such as weather, air traffic control, and mechanical delays occur, you may be eligible to request a refund for a ticket that would otherwise be nonrefundable or have restrictions on refunds. In these situations, please submit a refund request.
If your flight is delayed two hours or more, and you would rather postpone your travel, please let us know, and we'll waive any change penalties that may have applied to your ticket. You may also receive a travel credit or refund for the unused portion of your trip if you choose not to travel. If your trip involves a connection and you have made it to the connecting city, you may ask to return to your origin and receive a travel credit or refund if there are no other suitable alternatives. The amount and type of credit will depend on the fare and what portion of the ticket has been used.
Different policies will apply when traveling to and from certain other countries. Learn more about policies specific to the European Union or refer to our Contract of Carriage for more information.

Refund request for nonrefundable tickets — unplanned event

United will refund change fees and tickets in certain cases. All requests must be received prior to the ticket’s expiration date and must be accompanied by proper documentation (see “Documentation requirements and processing” below). We will refund tickets only when the unplanned event prevents the use of that ticket within one year of the ticket’s date of issue. In all other instances, the fare can be credited toward future travel, though the customer may receive a refund for flight change fees (see “Change fee refunds” below).
If your refund request is approved, a refund will be provided to the original form of payment. Refunds for purchases made with Gift Certificates will be provided in the form of electronic travel certificates.
This policy applies in the following cases:

Death of the traveler, traveling companion or immediate family member
Travelers in the reservation actively on jury duty during the dates of planned travel
Certain illness situations

Change fee refunds
In the event that your travel plans change as a result of illness or jury duty, you will be required to pay the applicable change fee at the time of that change. Once this change fee is applied, you may submit a request to have the fee refunded.
Ticket refunds
Ticket refunds will be provided in the event of death and, in some cases, illness and jury duty. This applies to all tickets, including revenue, MileagePlus award tickets, promotional, bulk and net fares.
Documentation requirements and processing


In cases of death:
 Refunds require a copy of the death certificate. If your change is due to the death of an immediate family member, the request must contain the family member’s name and relationship to you.


Illness situations:
 Change fee refunds require a letter (on letterhead) from a licensed physician confirming that travel was not recommended due to the customer's illness. Ticket refunds require a letter (on letterhead) from a licensed physician confirming that travel was not recommended within the validity of the ticket (one year of ticket’s issued date) due to illness. If the request is due to the illness of an immediate family member, the request must contain the family member’s name and relationship to you.


Jury duty refund requests: Refunds require a copy of the jury summons. 

Send all refund requests to United Refunds for consideration. Requests directed through other departments (contact centers, airport staff, etc.) will be referred to United Refunds.


Surcharges and taxes
Surcharges, including international and insurance surcharges filed as YQ or YR, will follow the refund rule of the fare. If the fare is nonrefundable, the surcharges are also nonrefundable.
Lost paper tickets

In the event that you have lost your paper ticket, please complete the lost ticket refund form. At least one of the following supporting documents must be provided in order for us to process your request:

Lost and/or Replacement Ticket number
If paid by check, copies of both sides of the canceled check
If purchased through a travel agency, a copy of the lost ticket, which can be requested from the issuing agency
If you are a travel agent submitting an application on behalf of your customer, please enclose a copy of your lost ticket coupon.

You may submit your request by printing the lost ticket refund form, filling in the required information, and returning it to United. You may bring the form and supporting document(s) to any United Airlines ticketing location or mail it to the address on the form.
The Lost Ticket Application must be submitted within 12 months after you purchased the lost ticket. All refund requests are subject to audit and final approval by the United Airlines Refund Department. A $150 nonrefundable processing fee will be charged for each lost ticket, and your application may take 90 days to process. 
All refund requests are subject to audit and final approval by the United Airlines Refund Department. All refunds, with the exception of purchases made with Gift Certificates, are credited to the form of payment of the original ticket. Refunds for purchases made with Gift Certificates will be provided in the form of electronic travel certificates. Please allow 90 days for processing of lost ticket claims.



Other refund policies
To learn about refund eligibility for fee payments, expand a section below for more information:

Baggage service fees
Baggage service fee refunds may be requested if you have paid for one or more checked bags and don't travel as a result of a cancellation, change in schedule or schedule irregularity caused by United.
Booking service fees
Reservation booking service fees and close-in booking fees for award tickets are refundable only if you cancel your reservation within 24 hours of purchase. If you have purchased a ticket from United in the last 24 hours, go to Manage Reservations to cancel your reservation or contact the United Customer Contact Center for assistance.
Day-of-departure upgrades

Cabin upgrade fees are generally nonrefundable, but if a flight for which an upgrade fee has been paid is affected by a schedule change, cancellation or oversale, and you cannot be accommodated in a premium cabin on a later flight, you may request a refund of the fees paid for the upgrade using the Cabin Upgrade refund form.

Economy Plus® seating
There are certain scenarios where you may be reaccommodated in a seat other than the one you've purchased, such as in instances of irregular operations, a last minute aircraft change or an oversell. In these cases, you will be issued a new boarding pass. If you find that you have not been reaccommodated in a seat of similar or greater value, fees paid for the seat will usually automatically be refunded. In the event a new boarding pass is not issued, however, you may request a refund for your Economy Plus purchase.
