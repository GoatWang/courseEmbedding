Blue Sky Group Holdings, Inc will use the proceeds from the offering to pay for
professional fees and other general expenses, as well as fund the development of
the Company’s operations. The total estimated costs of the offering ($15,974) 
may exceed the amount of offering proceeds.


Even though we currently originate conventional agency and government conforming
loans, if we intend to originate non-prime mortgage loans, we believe we would
be required to pay a higher fee to access the secondary market for selling our
loans to GSEs. We believe that because many of our competitors have always
originated conventional loans, they are able to sell newly originated loans on
more favorable terms than us. As a result, these competitors are able to earn
higher margins than we earn on originated loans, which could materially impact
our business.


Company Description
The Company was incorporated in Delaware on Sept 30 2016 and is a development
stage company focusing on originating mortgage loans. At Blue Sky Group
Holdings, we seek to provide loans to mid-grade and high-grade borrowers that
are seeking to purchase primary residences. Among these borrowers,


 Management
has developed the following demographic profile that the Company will continue
use for its marketing campaigns and credit guidelines. Much like other mortgage
banking firms, the business continually maintain strict controls over its
lending procedures to ensure that defaults are kept to an absolute minimum. Blue
Sky Group Holdings, may sell the mortgages it originates to Fannie Mae, Freddie
Mac and Ginnie Mae.
 
Below is Management’s average customer profile:

• Household income of $50,000+

• FICO Score of 680 or higher

• Is seeking a mortgage loan of $150,000 to $300,000

• Has documented income (W-2) or an extended history of independently earned     
  income.                                                                        

Nonbank mortgage servicers expanded their footprint in agency mortgage servicing
rights during the third quarter of 2016, according to a new Inside Mortgage
Finance analysis. Overall, there were $6.062 trillion of single-family mortgages
outstanding tied to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae mortgage-backed
securities at the end of September according to
http://www.insidemortgagefinance.com/
 
Blue Sky Group Holdings may originate mortgage loans domestically in the U.S.
only and at its sole discretion may sell to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie
Mae. Furthermore, Blue Sky Group Holdings Group Holdings originates mortgage
loans it intends to sell into the secondary markets through whole loan sales or
securitizations. Blue Sky Group Holdings, may also purchase loans out of a
Ginnie Mae securitization pool if that loan meets certain criteria, including
being delinquent greater than 90 days. Blue Sky Group Holdings has elected to
carry these loans at fair value; furthermore Blue Sky Group Holdings measures
our newly originated prime (RML’s) Residential Mortgage Loans held for sale at
fair value. Blue Sky Group Holdings also determines the fair value of loans held
for investment, net, using internally developed valuation models. These
valuation models estimate the exit price Blue Sky Group Holdings expects to
receive in the loan’s principal market primarily.
 
Blue Sky Group Holdings, Inc will grow through three main avenues:

• The successful marketing and growth of the Company’s financial infrastructure
  through the acquisition of larger warehouse lines of credit.
 
• Continued implementation of streamlined methods for closing and selling
  loans while conforming to all state and federal level laws.
 
• Continue to develop relationships with investors and institutional loan buyers
  so that the Company can quickly divest its loan and lending assets at a
  premium while retaining servicing rights for originated financings. This will
  be achieved once the business acquires its warehouse credit facilities.
 
• Blue sky understands that the refinance boom will potentially be declining
  with HARP coming to an end within the next year and the market shifting a
  purchase market. While there is still a possibility of an extension and
  expansion of HARP, we already make preparations for focusing a significant
  portion of our resources on REO asset management which is positioning Blue Sky
  Mortgage strongly into the home purchase market. Furthermore, Blue sky
  mortgage has multiple home builders and realtor contacts that have assured
  multiple referrals to the company for their client’s needs.
