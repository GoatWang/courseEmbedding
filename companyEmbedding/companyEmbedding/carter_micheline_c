Boost productivity with exact positioning
Integrated laser projection systems for both 2D and 3D applications providing precision alignment. Allows for projection of laser patterns onto complex curved surfaces in complete 3D images, suitable for mold composite layup, wind turbine blade production, vehicle construction, aerospace and a variety of manufacturing processes.







Carter lights the way to greater accuracy
A full offering of high powered line lasers, both red and green, suitable for any application requiring a clean crisp line for visual alignment. These lasers carry a full two-year warranty, are waterproof and come in a variety of line lengths, optics and mounts.







The Next Evolution in Steadyrest Work Support Systems
This system is compatible with a range of lathe sizes from mini to 20" all with one unit. The system is lightweight, yet very robust. The system can be split open to access or remove the work piece as well as converting it from Steadyrest to Bowlrest configurations.







Spend more time cutting and less time adjusting
Carter Upgrade conversion kits increase your saws performance through the use of sealed ball bearing roller guides or Tefloy™ lubricated block support guides. This provides your saw with reduced blade friction, improved cutting accuracy, and is adjustable for various blade widths. Our bearing guides have no wear surfaces which means that until you need to change the blade size you won’t have to adjust your guides, so spend more time woodworking and less time adjusting.







Innovative new Hollowing System from Carter
The Hollow Roller™ system is a complete, easy to set-up turnkey hollowing system that allows the operator to focus on the work and art of the vessel being turned versus on the system. The boring bar is completely captive and incorporates a full sealed bearing lubrication free roller system that eliminates the drag on the bar, thus enabling a smoother flowing motion to all tool movements.

Carter’s Baby Clothes Make Excellent Gifts
Carter’s baby clothes are great gifts for parents and babies! With over 100 years of experience in children’s clothing, Carter’s knows the kind of clothing babies need and parents want. Shop layette sets for newborns. Layette sets are the perfect baby shower gift. The Carter’s Classic Baby Essentials collection includes all of the essential clothing parents will need for their new baby. The collection features bodysuits, hoodies, pants, bibs, and more. It also comes in neutral colors, making it a great unisex gift. The Take Me Home set is another wonderful gift. Mom and dad can bring baby home in this cozy little set that includes long-sleeve and short-sleeve bodysuits, footed pants, and a cap. Babies grow quickly, so get a few extra sets of clothing to accommodate rapid growth spurts. Carter’s knows the difficulty that comes with finding preemie clothing. While you’re at it, pick up a few accessories to give out too! Carter’s has super cute animal themed bath sets. Get a hood towel, washcloth, and robe with matching booties. Babies will sleep sweetly with a soother that sings lullabies, plays nature sounds, and casts moon images on the ceiling. Shop Carter’s baby clothes in the baby department for great gifts that parents will love.
 
Carter’s Clothing: Stylish Clothes for Babies of All Ages
Carter’s clothing makes the earliest years of your baby’s life super stylish! In the first three months, babies spend the majority of their time eating, sleeping, and in need of a diaper change. Simple clothing is the best in these early months. Stock up on Carter’s bodysuits, hats, and booties, made from warm and cozy cotton. Get these three essentials in packs or separates. From six to nine months, your baby will start getting mobile. They’ll begin crawling, scooting, and sliding. Rompers are a great choice to provide maximum mobility and comfort. We have adorable Carter’s rompers for boys and girls in beautiful colors and designs. From nine months and up, comfortable separates, such as t-shirts, sweat pants, leggings, and jeans are essential. Our Carter’s sale has all of these items and more! Outfit your future sports star in a handsome all-American varsity jacket with a button front. Carter’s even has baby puffer jackets for those bitter cold days when something heavier is necessary.
