The Bell Tower and Beyond: Reflections on Learning and Living
 (2002)





In Search of the Simple Life : American Voices, Past and Present (1996)

 


The Simple Life: Plain Living 
and High Thinking in American Culture

(2007)

Praise for The Simple Life

"A masterly book—as fascinating as it is educational . . . Shi combines impressive scholarship with intriguing anecdotes and insights into the lives of presidents, religious leaders, naturalists, industrialists, and others who praised plain living.”--
Charlotte Observer   

"Shi's genius is in tying diverse social and cultural threads together and weaving an excellent book about the history of ideas."--
Choice  

"Exemplary . . . Shi's study can serve as a handbook to guide us in facing the insistent and inevitable challenges of the future."--
Sierra   

"Shi manages time and again in specific instances to be lively and illuminating."--
Philadelphia Inquirer   

"A candid, informative, scholarly examination throughout American social history of the drive to simplify one’s life and find meaning by the means of deliberately giving up excess material vanity . . . a thoughtful book, filled with carefully assessed observations, The Simple Life is strongly recommended reading for anyone contemplating simplification of their personal lifestyles and circumstances as a means of improving the quality of their lives and themselves."--
Midwest Book Review   

"Meticulously researched . . . it should stand as a seminal study of an enduring theme in U.S. social history."--
Sojourners   

"Mr. Shi's study is interesting for the light it sheds on America's moral development."--
New York Times Book Review   

"The most recent expression of a complex intellectual tradition which has shaped American cultures for centuries. If many of Shi's sources for this tradition are familiar, he does a masterful job of bringing them together."--The Nation

 AWESOME BOOK -
This book is truly amazing. The way the author vividly describes important historial events is captivating. I have never been so impressed with a book before. Definitely one that I will cherish always. Buyer sent the product within the two days as promised. Excellent service! Great book!



 Love It -
This is an amazing history book. I can honestly say I read it cover-to-cover, and found the content to be objective, accurate, and motivating.


From Barnes and Noble

Amazing Text - This book was used as our AP US History textbook and is one of the most interesting history textbooks that I have read. I definitely recommend this book if you're interested in learning American history.


Superb Narrative History  - 
After teaching for more than 36 years, I find this text to be the best I have ever used. It is a balanced synthesis of historiographical develoments in the last thirty or so years as well as an interesting story which blends a difficult mix of social, political, and economic trends. Nothing really important is wanting in this text, even humor (sometimes subtle). The study materials are also quite helpful according to the testimonials of my former students. Especially noteworthy are the human interest stories which clarify the historical narrative.

Facing facts : realism in American thought and culture, 1850-1920 by

                           worldwide
                           The public developed an ever-expanding appetite for concrete facts and for art that accurately depicted them. As Shi proceeds
                              through the nineteenth century, he traces the realist impulse in each major area of arts and letters, combining an astute
                              analysis of the movement's essential themes with incisive portraits of its leading practitioners. Here we see Oliver Wendell
                              Holmes, Jr., shaken to stern realism by the horrors of the Civil War; the influence of Walt Whitman on painter Thomas Eakins
                              and architect Louis Sullivan, a leader of the Chicago school; the local-color verisimilitude of Louisa May Alcott and Sarah
                              Orne Jewett; and the impact of urban squalor on intrepid young writers such as Stephen Crane. In the process of surveying
                              nineteenth-century cultural history, Shi provides fascinating insights into the specific concerns of the realist movement
                              - in particular, the nation's growing obsession with gender roles

                           worldwide
                           Since colonial days Americans have greatly admired, variously defined, and occasionally practiced the simple life. In doing
                              so they have provided a significant shaping force in the history of American values. Though quickly displaced by the cult
                              of more and more, the simple life has remained an elevated ideal for a resolute few. For some it has meant a life of pious
                              austerity; for others it has entailed conscientious consumption and aesthetic creation; for a few it has resulted in withdrawal
                              from the larger society. Yet whatever form of simplicity has been adopted, those promoting the ideal have been animated by
                              the same common purpose: to subordinate material desires to 'higher' activities. This richly illustrated anthology presents
                              a fascinating and compelling array of original writings, woven together with Shi's illuminating commentary. -- publisher

Description

    America has sold more than 1.8 million copies over the past eight editions because it's a book that students enjoy reading. Effective storytelling, colorful anecdotes, and biographical sketches make the narrative absorbing and the material more memorable. The Brief Ninth Edition is 20% shorter, and includes refreshed and updated coverage of African American history, and has been streamlined from 37 to 34 chapters.
