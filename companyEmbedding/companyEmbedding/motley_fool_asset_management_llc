We know you're busy, so let's jump right into the details.

Q: "I want to invest, but I don't want to lose money."
A: We absolutely understand your fear. And you're absolutely not alone.
You're investing your hard-earned dollars to make your dreams come true, not to see it drip out of your brokerage account like change through a hole in your pocket.
The truth is that loss happens. Even the world's best investors pick the occasional dud.
But they don't panic.
They understand that if you buy and hold for the long term, it's possible one of your investments could go to 0. But you can gain many, many times more than you could ever lose.
And they play it smart.
With a portfolio made up of a dozen great stocks or more, your winners will most likely squash the ones that didn't play out the way you expected.
That strategy has helped hundreds of thousands of investors build lasting wealth. Without fear.
Now...
We understand you might still have some questions...
You still might even have some doubts...
We don't blame you.
If you're still not sure if Motley Fool newsletter services are worth checking out...
Or if they're right for you...
Here's what we recommend:
Take a look at the results Mark and Bob have been getting because they were a part of our services...



Mark T.


"Motley Fool's changed my life in this main respect: I'm financially independent today. I didn't think that would be possible until maybe my mid or late 60s. I have the ability to make choices and quality-of-life decisions now that I would never be able to make before."





Bob A.


"I use the Fool to do the things that I don't have time to do. If you have a busy life and want to invest in the market, this is one of the best vehicles to support you in doing that."


And see the advice Linda has for folks just getting started with investing...



Linda Q.


"If I can do it, you can do it. I was able to buy my house because of investments through here. There’s a [30-day] membership fee-back guarantee, so go right ahead. It won’t hurt. It’s been a life-changing experience for me."


Now it's clear what we're doing works, isn't it?
If you're looking for a magic formula or a quick fix, The Motley Fool investing newsletter services are not for you. We're all about finding fantastic companies and holding them for the long haul.
Investing riches don't magically appear overnight.

The Motley Fool












Wall Street is getting it all wrong... And we believe the little guy can outsmart the market with a simple investing strategy
Our time-tested investing approach has resulted in market-beating returns. In fact, The Motley Fool's newsletter services earned the top three spots in Wall Street Journal columnist Mark Hulbert's August 2013 ranking of more than 200 services he tracks.





The Motley Fool's Secret to Uncovering Wealth-Building Buys




Buy Businesses, Not TickersStraight from the mouth of famed investor Peter Lynch, we buy into a company's prospects, future, and management, and we put our money into companies that will generate shareholder value over the long term.


Be a Lifetime InvestorWe're investors that believe the best way to beat the market is to hold stocks for the long term. But we don't just buy and forget about our stocks. We dive deep into research, keep a close eye on our investing thesis, and relentlessly pursue compelling stocks we think will outperform.




Fish Where Others Aren'tWe're not interested in following the crowds or what Wall Street thinks is the next hot stock. That's a money-losing strategy! We are interested in thinking for ourselves and scoring profits with unbiased research.


Be Foolish and Have FunMany believe the little guy can't win in the market, but we believe our members can beat Wall Street professionals... and we think you should have fun along the way.

Not to alarm you, but you're about to miss an important event
...And it's not too late to claim your front row seat!
























See, two men leading newsletters The Wall Street Journal reported as some of the best performing in America just released two new stock picks  exclusively to Stock Advisor members!
And when Motley Fool co-founders David Gardner and Team Tom announce new picks, it's a big deal...
Because since 2002, their average stock pick is up 265%... that's doubling the performance of the S&P 500.
Just take a look at this chart to see what that means in dollars and cents:






To state the obvious, you don't double the stock market's return over 12+ years by getting lucky.
And that's exactly why people are so excited about the new picks that were just released.
So if you have any interest in these stocks...
Please clear your office of all distractions and give this your full attention, because...
Time is running out and you might not get a second chance.
Now, if you're like most people, you're probably ready to start investing like a pro.
You want your money to start working for you.
You would love to give your family the gift of true financial security and freedom.
Because it's not about money... it's about improving the quality of life.
And whether you want to buy a vacation home, a sailboat, or simply pay tuition for your kids and grandkids...
It simply isn't possible without money.
And investing is the best way we know to create that kind of wealth.
We know you're considering joining Stock Advisor, because otherwise you wouldn't be reading this.
But you might wonder why now is the right time to join.
Well, while timing isn't everything, the history of David Gardner and Team Tom's stock picks shows that it pays to get in early.
Just consider this:
If you had joined on June 7, 2002, hours before David recommended Marvel, you'd be up 5609% today.
Or on May 21, 2004, right before David first recommended Priceline.You'd be up 8476% today.
Or on June 15, 2007... just moments before Team Tom announced their recommendation of Netflix? You'd be up 6616%.
If you had invested just $1,000 in each of those stocks, you'd be sitting on close to $210,004 today.
And loyal followers of David Gardner and Team Tom who invested more did even better — a $5,000 investment in each of those ideas would be worth about $1,050,018 today.
It's time to stop waiting.
There will never be a "perfect" moment to make the changes you've been wanting to make.
Why don't you make today the day you take your first step towards your new life by joining Stock Advisor?
Especially since you can get started absolutely risk-free thanks to our membership fee-back guarantee.
You DON'T need $100,000 to start investing with Stock Advisor
Contrary to popular belief, investing isn't just for the rich. If you've got $100, you've got enough to get started (assuming you've paid off your high-interest debt and you've built up an emergency fund in case of, well, emergency).
In fact, if you're able to invest just $50 a month and you've got a few years to let your money compound, you have plenty to build up a very healthy portfolio.
And good investing has the potential to make anybody rich beyond their wildest dreams, including you.
The stock market is a great equalizer. It doesn't care who you are, how much money you make, or how well-connected you are.
Plumbers, doctors, and millionaire playboys can all buy the same stocks at the same price. It's a level playing field once you know which stocks to buy.
Our favorite success stories are from people who weren't sure they could manage their own money, but then followed our recommendations to achieve major accomplishments.



Mark T.
Des Moines, Iowa


"Motley Fool's changed my life in this main respect: I'm financially independent today. I didn't think that would be possible until maybe my mid or late 60s. I have the ability to make choices and quality-of-life decisions now that I would never be able to make before."





Linda Q.
Nashua, New Hampshire


"If I can do it, you can do it. I was able to buy my house because of investments through here. There’s a membership fee-back guarantee, so go right ahead. It won’t hurt. It’s been a life-changing experience for me."

The Overall Morningstar Rating™ for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five- and ten-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics.
As of 06/30/2017, Motley Fool Great America Fund was rated among 576 Mid-Cap Growth funds in the last three years and received a 3-star rating.
As of 06/30/2017, Motley Fool Great America Fund was rated among 502 Mid-Cap Growth funds in the last five years and received a 4-star rating.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results.
For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating™ based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund’s monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads, and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance.
The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.

Fund Overview

The Motley Fool Great America Fund seeks excellent small and mid-cap companies at what we consider to be attractive prices.
We look for well-managed companies that boast strong financial positions and operate in industries that our management team truly understands. Performing rigorous, fundamental analysis, we dissect each company's strategy, competitive position, operations, and performance, and we review all pertinent public documents and official communications about the company. We purchase high quality businesses with an intention to hold for years because long-term buy and hold investing allows for value to compound in a tax efficient manner. We will sell when business quality deteriorates or the valuation of the shares becomes unattractive. As part of our assessment to sell shares, we consider industry developments including technological advances, intensifying competition, and regulatory changes.

Proxy Voting Information




The performance data quoted represents past performance and does not guarantee future results. Current performance may be lower or higher. The investment return and principal of an investment will fluctuate so that shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. A redemption fee of 2.00% of the then-current value of the shares redeemed is imposed on redemptions of shares made within 90 days of purchase (i.e., the redemption is effective on or before the 90th day following the date of purchase), subject to certain exceptions. The redemption fee is not reflected in the quoted returns. See additional performance information about each fund at these links: Independence Fund, Great America Fund and Emerging Markets Fund.

 Educational Background



Graduate 
Class of 1994 


Yale University - Yale School of Management

                  The Yale School of Management is the graduate business school of Yale University and is located on Hillhouse Avenue in New Haven, Connecticut, United States. The School awards the Master of Business Administration (MBA), Master of Advanced Management (MAM), and Ph.D. degrees. As of April 2012, 475 students were enrolled in its MBA program, 33 in the MBA for Executives program, and 33 in the PhD program.                




Graduate 


Trinity College

                  Trinity College looks like a traditional New England liberal arts school.

But we act in some untraditional ways.

Our commitment to urban-global education, for example, is groundbreaking, as is our interdisciplinary Neuroscience Program and our First-Year Program, one of the earliest in the nation. We have also just added more than 20 young teacher/scholars to our faculty, and our faculty across the board is committed to collaboration with students on real-world research projects.

We continue to re-examine and transform the concept of liberal arts education because our graduates expect to thrive and to have a serious effect on the world.

Trinity’s 10:1 student/faculty ratio means access to teachers who have time to discuss your term paper in person, encourage your research project, and celebrate your success on Commencement Day. Choose from 38 academic majors in the liberal arts and sciences, including one in engineering, another program that is not traditional for a college like Trinity. Twenty-six interdisciplinary minors like human rights, Jewish studies, and African American studies give you even more choices.

World-wide study abroad, courses that include interaction with the city around us, and for-credit academic internships give you experience beyond the classroom.

And yes, our campus is beautiful in a traditional New England-college way—100 green acres dotted with historic buildings—and it’s located in an interesting place, Connecticut’s state capital, the city of Hartford. It’s home to 2,300 students from 45 states and 47 countries who connect to the College and each other through 100 student organizations, 29 NCAA Division III athletic teams, internships, and volunteer projects.

You can learn about all of this here on our Web site—academics, athletics, student activities, and more—but the best thing is to visit Trinity and see for yourself. Campus visits are conducted year-round, and you are always welcome

Motley Fool Wealth Management LLC


                  Motely Fool Wealth Management's (MFWM) separately managed account program allows clients to own individually tailored portfolios that employ a mix of strategies. Each model portfolio focuses on a particular investment strategy (such as long term buy and hold) or specific type of security (such as growth stocks). The model portfolios represent different investing strategies that enable clients to hold balanced and diverse portfolios through various stages in their lives. Based on the client's specific financial objectives and risk tolerance, MFWM creates a portfolio that allocates the client’s assets across some, or all of the model portfolios. Several of the model portfolios are inspired by specific The Motely Fool (TMF) real money portfolio services. Other model portfolios are inspired by the mutual funds managed by their affiliate, Motley Fool Asset Management LLC, whose investment personnel perform research and investment management services for MFWM. The model portfolios include: Long-term Buy and Hold; Growth Investing; Hedged Equity Investing and Equity Substitutes; Domestic Stocks; Domestic Small/Mid-cap Stocks; International Stocks; and Fixed Income.MFWM’s premium wealth management service is designed for high net-worth individuals who wish to invest in stocks, bonds and other similar securities. MFWM's product, The Snapshot, uses a third-party platform and software to provide guidance regarding retirement sufficiency, cash flow, education planning and asset allocation. The firm's product, Motley Fool Touchstone, employs a proprietary, interactive, algorithmic system, designed by personnel acting on MFWM’s behalf that is based on the Fama-French Capital Asset Pricing Model. MFWM’s algorithm and their individual advisors consider factors such as the client’s income, asset allocation, portfolio holdings, assets available for investment, investing period, time to retirement, financial goals, and need to access assets, as well as the client’s risk tolerance and preferences regarding the number of positions in his or her portfolio.

Paulson & Co., Inc.


                  Paulson & Co.'s investment strategies are all based on the same underlying investment philosophy of capital preservation and low correlation to the broad markets. The firm specializes in global merger and event arbitrage, as well as financial restructuring, real estate and credit opportunities involving a range of financial instruments, including equity and debt securities, currencies, commodities, fixed income products, MBS and other derivative securities. Paulson's products are provided through collective investment vehicles, including both domestic partnerships and offshore private investment companies, and separately managed accounts that deploy all or a subset of the firm's investment strategies.The Paulson Funds' investment objective is to achieve positive excess returns through trading the securities and/or derivatives thereon of companies that are the subject of proposed changes in corporate structure or control such as tender offers, mergers, spin-offs, proxy contests, liquidations, recapitalizations, restructurings and bankruptcy reorganizations. Paulson's objective is to purchase these securities and/or derivatives at a discount to what they believe will be their value on the consummation of the proposed event. A complementary objective is to minimize exposure to the general securities markets by concentrating the portfolio on event-specific investments which act independently of the markets. In addition, some of the funds seek to achieve their objective through trading the securities and/or derivatives of companies that are the subject of special situations such as spin-offs, litigation, relative value, restructurings, proxy contests, and post-bankruptcy equities, as well as distressed securities and credit related securities and derivatives, gold and gold related securities and/or derivatives, and direct real estate and real estate related securities.

We wanted to take a moment and answer some of the most common questions we've received, so you can decide for yourself if our award-winning Stock Advisor service is worth checking out.
We know you're busy, so let's jump right into the details.

Q: "I want to invest, but I don't want to lose money."
A: We absolutely understand your fear. And you're absolutely not alone.
You're investing your hard-earned dollars to make your dreams come true, not to see it drip out of your brokerage account like change through a hole in your pocket.
The truth is that loss happens. Even the world's best investors pick the occasional dud.
But they don't panic.
They understand that if you buy and hold for the long term, it's possible one of your investments could go to 0. But you can gain many, many times more than you could ever lose.
And they play it smart.
With a portfolio made up of a dozen great stocks or more, your winners will most likely squash the ones that didn't play out the way you expected.
That strategy has helped hundreds of thousands of investors build lasting wealth. Without fear.
Now...
We understand you might still have some questions...
You still might even have some doubts...
We don't blame you.
If you're still not sure if Motley Fool newsletter services are worth checking out...
Or if they're right for you...
Here's what we recommend:
Take a look at the results Mark and Bob have been getting because they were a part of our services...



Mark T.


"Motley Fool's changed my life in this main respect: I'm financially independent today. I didn't think that would be possible until maybe my mid or late 60s. I have the ability to make choices and quality-of-life decisions now that I would never be able to make before."





Bob A.


"I use the Fool to do the things that I don't have time to do. If you have a busy life and want to invest in the market, this is one of the best vehicles to support you in doing that."


And see the advice Linda has for folks just getting started with investing...



Linda Q.


"If I can do it, you can do it. I was able to buy my house because of investments through here. There’s a [30-day] membership fee-back guarantee, so go right ahead. It won’t hurt. It’s been a life-changing experience for me."


Now it's clear what we're doing works, isn't it?
If you're looking for a magic formula or a quick fix, The Motley Fool investing newsletter services are not for you. We're all about finding fantastic companies and holding them for the long haul.
Investing riches don't magically appear overnight.
But if you're serious about your financial future and want to commit to building your lasting wealth...
Just click the button below and discover if our services are right for you...

Before you submit your order
Lots of people spin their wheels, collecting information, joining groups, and running in place. But you can do that your whole life and never actually get anywhere!

And because we want to be sure you're getting into a service that's right for you, we're even offering you a full 30-day membership fee refund if you don't love it.

Wall Street is getting it all wrong... And we believe the little guy can outsmart the market with a simple investing strategy
Our time-tested investing approach has resulted in market-beating returns. In fact, The Motley Fool's newsletter services earned the top three spots in Wall Street Journal columnist Mark Hulbert's August 2013 ranking of more than 200 services he tracks.





The Motley Fool's Secret to Uncovering Wealth-Building Buys




Buy Businesses, Not TickersStraight from the mouth of famed investor Peter Lynch, we buy into a company's prospects, future, and management, and we put our money into companies that will generate shareholder value over the long term.


Be a Lifetime InvestorWe're investors that believe the best way to beat the market is to hold stocks for the long term. But we don't just buy and forget about our stocks. We dive deep into research, keep a close eye on our investing thesis, and relentlessly pursue compelling stocks we think will outperform.




Fish Where Others Aren'tWe're not interested in following the crowds or what Wall Street thinks is the next hot stock. That's a money-losing strategy! We are interested in thinking for ourselves and scoring profits with unbiased research.


Be Foolish and Have FunMany believe the little guy can't win in the market, but we believe our members can beat Wall Street professionals... and we think you should have fun along the way.

The Business[edit]
Investment advice[edit]
The Motley Fool offers a wide range of stock news and analysis at its free website, www.fool.com, as well as through a variety of paid investment advice services. The services, many of which combine a traditional paper newsletter with interactive electronic discussion boards and other tools, cover a range of styles from small caps to international stocks, to options, to shorting.[1]
Media[edit]

The Motley Fool runs the Motley Fool Money radio show and four other podcasts.[2]
The Motley Food newspaper column is syndicated by Universal Uclick.[3]

Motley Fool Culture[edit]
The company received the 2014 and 2015 nationwide honor for being "the No. 1 Medium-Sized Company to Work for in the United States" from Glassdoor.com.[4][5]
Mutual funds[edit]
In June 2009, Motley Fool Funds launched its first mutual fund, Motley Fool Independence Fund.[6] As of mid-December 2014, the fund (FOOLX) had outperformed the Russell 2000 index by almost 20 percentage points and earned 3 out of 5 stars from Morningstar.[7]
In November 2010, Motley Fool funds launched Motley Fool Great America Fund. As of mid-December 2014, the fund (TMFGX) had outperformed the Russell 2000 and the most popular low-cost ETF tracking the Russell 2000, the iShares Russell 2000 (IWM), by almost 20 percentage points and earned a 3-star rating from Morningstar.[8]
In November 2011, Motley Fool funds launched Motley Fool Epic Voyage Fund (TMFEX). As of mid-December 2014, the return of this fund was one-third that of the S&P 500.[9]
History[edit]




Motley Fool headquarters in Alexandria, VA


The name "Motley Fool" is taken from Shakespeare's comedy As You Like It.[10][11]
In August 1994, brothers David and Tom Gardner parlayed their one-year-old investment newsletter into a content partnership with America Online. The Motley Fool gained renown for its early recommendations of stocks, such as Amazon.com, America Online (AOL), Amgen, eBay, PayPal, and Starbucks, and was featured in a cover story for Fortune magazine (1996) about the emergence of online interactive discussion as a new form of investment research.[citation needed] In April 1997, the site was moved from AOL to the Fool.com website,[12] and a UK site, Fool.co.uk, was established.[13]
Motley Fool content is available to the public on Fool.com and fool.co.uk, and in its Motley Fool Money podcast and nationally syndicated newspaper column. The Gardners have written several bestselling books on investing, most recently the New York Times Best Seller Motley Fool Million Dollar Portfolio, published in December 2008.[14] Their third book, Rule Makers and Rule Breakers, was published in 2000.[15] Their best-known book, The Motley Fool Investment Guide, was in 2003 called the "#1 All-Time Classic" by investment club members of the NAIC.[citation needed]
During the financial crisis and the dot-com bubble collapse in 2001, the company ran into trouble, resulting in the loss of 80% of the staff in a series of three layoffs and the closure of its operations in Germany and Japan. Following the 2000–2002 stock market downturn, Motley Fool started to cover more strategies, such as a range of investment styles from small cap stock investing to growth and technology stocks, to dividend investing.[citation needed]
A December 2005 Washington Post article detailed the Motley Fool's 10-year lease for new offices in Old Town Alexandria, Virginia, taking over office space vacated by Time-Life.[16]
In September 2006, the company unveiled Motley Fool CAPS, a service that monitors and ranks the most successful stock pickers amongst its members.[17]
In 2011, the company launched Fool Australia,[18] followed in 2012 by Fool Canada[19] and Fool Singapore.[20]
Premium services[edit]
Motley Fool Stock Advisor[edit]
In April 2002, the company launched the first of its premium subscription services. David and Tom Gardner pick one stock each month in a brotherly competition to best each other and the S&P 500. They maintain a consistent buy-and-hold style, tending to let their winning stocks compound returns over longer periods of time.

This service consists of three portfolios: one for regular wage earners, another for people nearing retirement, and a third portfolio which pits baskets of stocks against each other in a battle to see the "best of the bunch". Returns on the Odyssey portfolio were 67.1% growth after 28 months (as of October 2014)[21][not in citation given]

Community discussion boards[edit]
The Motley Fool hosts online discussion boards. Registered users can get access to all non-newsletter boards that cover a variety of stock, personal finance, and investing concepts. The discussion boards are used heavily to recruit future Motley Fool staffers; frequent posters are first awarded free subscriptions to their favorite Motley Fool newsletters then eventually receive a small stipend and "TMF" username moniker to patrol the boards.[citation needed]
On Thursday 3 November 2016 it was announced that the UK boards would close, with a post stating "It's my sad duty to announce that we'll be closing the Fool UK Discussion Boards to new posts on Thursday 17 November. After they close to new posts, the Boards will remain accessible as a 'read-only' archive for at least 3 months."[22] Several Fools have suggested alternative sites including lemonfool.co.uk.[23][citation needed]
The Foolish Four[edit]
Main article: Foolish Four
In 1999, Motley Fool ran into controversy with its eventually discredited Foolish Four investment theory, which had been marketed as a way to "crush mutual funds [in] only 15 minutes a year" by using a simple mathematical formula to find stocks likely to grow much more than average.[24][25] This stock-picking technique was referred to as "investment hogwash in its purest form" by Money writer Jason Zweig in an August 1999 article titled "False Profits."[26] Zweig also called it "one of the most cockamamie stock-picking formulas ever concocted" in his 2003 commentary in the revised edition of Benjamin Graham's acclaimed Value investing book, The Intelligent Investor.[24]
Motley Fool writer Ann Coleman admitted in 2000 that the Foolish Four method "turned out to be not nearly as wonderful a strategy as we thought."[27]
Blog Network[edit]
The Motley Fool Blog Network was a stock analysis and news site that provided a platform for non-Motley Fool staff writers to submit articles. They received compensation ranging from $50–$100 for each article submitted and additional compensation for how many recommendations or "editors picks" they received.[28] Eventually the company merged the Blog Network with its primary site, syndicating bloggers' articles alongside those written by in-house staff and making the beta.fool.com blogging platform defunct. In July 2014, after Yahoo announced its new Yahoo Finance Contributors platform,[29] Motley Fool was negatively impacted, as a significant percentage of traffic to its website relied on syndication of articles via Yahoo Finance. This led the company to sever relationships with the majority of its freelance contributors and former bloggers.[30]

The Business[edit]
Investment advice[edit]
The Motley Fool offers a wide range of stock news and analysis at its free website, www.fool.com, as well as through a variety of paid investment advice services. The services, many of which combine a traditional paper newsletter with interactive electronic discussion boards and other tools, cover a range of styles from small caps to international stocks, to options, to shorting.[1]
Media[edit]

The Motley Fool runs the Motley Fool Money radio show and four other podcasts.[2]
The Motley Food newspaper column is syndicated by Universal Uclick.[3]

Motley Fool Culture[edit]
The company received the 2014 and 2015 nationwide honor for being "the No. 1 Medium-Sized Company to Work for in the United States" from Glassdoor.com.[4][5]
Mutual funds[edit]
In June 2009, Motley Fool Funds launched its first mutual fund, Motley Fool Independence Fund.[6] As of mid-December 2014, the fund (FOOLX) had outperformed the Russell 2000 index by almost 20 percentage points and earned 3 out of 5 stars from Morningstar.[7]
In November 2010, Motley Fool funds launched Motley Fool Great America Fund. As of mid-December 2014, the fund (TMFGX) had outperformed the Russell 2000 and the most popular low-cost ETF tracking the Russell 2000, the iShares Russell 2000 (IWM), by almost 20 percentage points and earned a 3-star rating from Morningstar.[8]
In November 2011, Motley Fool funds launched Motley Fool Epic Voyage Fund (TMFEX). As of mid-December 2014, the return of this fund was one-third that of the S&P 500.[9]
History[edit]




Motley Fool headquarters in Alexandria, VA


The name "Motley Fool" is taken from Shakespeare's comedy As You Like It.[10][11]
In August 1994, brothers David and Tom Gardner parlayed their one-year-old investment newsletter into a content partnership with America Online. The Motley Fool gained renown for its early recommendations of stocks, such as Amazon.com, America Online (AOL), Amgen, eBay, PayPal, and Starbucks, and was featured in a cover story for Fortune magazine (1996) about the emergence of online interactive discussion as a new form of investment research.[citation needed] In April 1997, the site was moved from AOL to the Fool.com website,[12] and a UK site, Fool.co.uk, was established.[13]
Motley Fool content is available to the public on Fool.com and fool.co.uk, and in its Motley Fool Money podcast and nationally syndicated newspaper column. The Gardners have written several bestselling books on investing, most recently the New York Times Best Seller Motley Fool Million Dollar Portfolio, published in December 2008.[14] Their third book, Rule Makers and Rule Breakers, was published in 2000.[15] Their best-known book, The Motley Fool Investment Guide, was in 2003 called the "#1 All-Time Classic" by investment club members of the NAIC.[citation needed]
During the financial crisis and the dot-com bubble collapse in 2001, the company ran into trouble, resulting in the loss of 80% of the staff in a series of three layoffs and the closure of its operations in Germany and Japan. Following the 2000–2002 stock market downturn, Motley Fool started to cover more strategies, such as a range of investment styles from small cap stock investing to growth and technology stocks, to dividend investing.[citation needed]
A December 2005 Washington Post article detailed the Motley Fool's 10-year lease for new offices in Old Town Alexandria, Virginia, taking over office space vacated by Time-Life.[16]
In September 2006, the company unveiled Motley Fool CAPS, a service that monitors and ranks the most successful stock pickers amongst its members.[17]
In 2011, the company launched Fool Australia,[18] followed in 2012 by Fool Canada[19] and Fool Singapore.[20]
Premium services[edit]
Motley Fool Stock Advisor[edit]
In April 2002, the company launched the first of its premium subscription services. David and Tom Gardner pick one stock each month in a brotherly competition to best each other and the S&P 500. They maintain a consistent buy-and-hold style, tending to let their winning stocks compound returns over longer periods of time.

Motley Fool Supernova - Gives subscribers access to a team of analysts building a portfolio of David Gardner's stocks. This service consists of three portfolios: one for regular wage earners, another for people nearing retirement, and a third portfolio which pits baskets of stocks against each other in a battle to see the "best of the bunch". Returns on the Odyssey portfolio were 67.1% growth after 28 months (as of October 2014)[21][not in citation given]

Community discussion boards[edit]
The Motley Fool hosts online discussion boards. Registered users can get access to all non-newsletter boards that cover a variety of stock, personal finance, and investing concepts. The discussion boards are used heavily to recruit future Motley Fool staffers; frequent posters are first awarded free subscriptions to their favorite Motley Fool newsletters then eventually receive a small stipend and "TMF" username moniker to patrol the boards.[citation needed]
On Thursday 3 November 2016 it was announced that the UK boards would close, with a post stating "It's my sad duty to announce that we'll be closing the Fool UK Discussion Boards to new posts on Thursday 17 November. After they close to new posts, the Boards will remain accessible as a 'read-only' archive for at least 3 months."[22] Several Fools have suggested alternative sites including lemonfool.co.uk.[23][citation needed]
The Foolish Four[edit]
Main article: Foolish Four
In 1999, Motley Fool ran into controversy with its eventually discredited Foolish Four investment theory, which had been marketed as a way to "crush mutual funds [in] only 15 minutes a year" by using a simple mathematical formula to find stocks likely to grow much more than average.[24][25] This stock-picking technique was referred to as "investment hogwash in its purest form" by Money writer Jason Zweig in an August 1999 article titled "False Profits."[26] Zweig also called it "one of the most cockamamie stock-picking formulas ever concocted" in his 2003 commentary in the revised edition of Benjamin Graham's acclaimed Value investing book, The Intelligent Investor.[24]
Motley Fool writer Ann Coleman admitted in 2000 that the Foolish Four method "turned out to be not nearly as wonderful a strategy as we thought."[27]
Blog Network[edit]
The Motley Fool Blog Network was a stock analysis and news site that provided a platform for non-Motley Fool staff writers to submit articles. They received compensation ranging from $50–$100 for each article submitted and additional compensation for how many recommendations or "editors picks" they received.[28] Eventually the company merged the Blog Network with its primary site, syndicating bloggers' articles alongside those written by in-house staff and making the beta.fool.com blogging platform defunct. In July 2014, after Yahoo announced its new Yahoo Finance Contributors platform,[29] Motley Fool was negatively impacted, as a significant percentage of traffic to its website relied on syndication of articles via Yahoo Finance. This led the company to sever relationships with the majority of its freelance contributors and former bloggers.[30]

The Business[edit]
Investment advice[edit]
The Motley Fool offers a wide range of stock news and analysis at its free website, www.fool.com, as well as through a variety of paid investment advice services. The services, many of which combine a traditional paper newsletter with interactive electronic discussion boards and other tools, cover a range of styles from small caps to international stocks, to options, to shorting.[1]
Media[edit]

The Motley Fool runs the Motley Fool Money radio show and four other podcasts.[2]
The Motley Food newspaper column is syndicated by Universal Uclick.[3]

Motley Fool Culture[edit]
The company received the 2014 and 2015 nationwide honor for being "the No. 1 Medium-Sized Company to Work for in the United States" from Glassdoor.com.[4][5]
Mutual funds[edit]
In June 2009, Motley Fool Funds launched its first mutual fund, Motley Fool Independence Fund.[6] As of mid-December 2014, the fund (FOOLX) had outperformed the Russell 2000 index by almost 20 percentage points and earned 3 out of 5 stars from Morningstar.[7]
In November 2010, Motley Fool funds launched Motley Fool Great America Fund. As of mid-December 2014, the fund (TMFGX) had outperformed the Russell 2000 and the most popular low-cost ETF tracking the Russell 2000, the iShares Russell 2000 (IWM), by almost 20 percentage points and earned a 3-star rating from Morningstar.[8]
In November 2011, Motley Fool funds launched Motley Fool Epic Voyage Fund (TMFEX). As of mid-December 2014, the return of this fund was one-third that of the S&P 500.[9]
History[edit]




Motley Fool headquarters in Alexandria, VA


The name "Motley Fool" is taken from Shakespeare's comedy As You Like It.[10][11]
In August 1994, brothers David and Tom Gardner parlayed their one-year-old investment newsletter into a content partnership with America Online. The Motley Fool gained renown for its early recommendations of stocks, such as Amazon.com, America Online (AOL), Amgen, eBay, PayPal, and Starbucks, and was featured in a cover story for Fortune magazine (1996) about the emergence of online interactive discussion as a new form of investment research.[citation needed] In April 1997, the site was moved from AOL to the Fool.com website,[12] and a UK site, Fool.co.uk, was established.[13]
Motley Fool content is available to the public on Fool.com and fool.co.uk, and in its Motley Fool Money podcast and nationally syndicated newspaper column. The Gardners have written several bestselling books on investing, most recently the New York Times Best Seller Motley Fool Million Dollar Portfolio, published in December 2008.[14] Their third book, Rule Makers and Rule Breakers, was published in 2000.[15] Their best-known book, The Motley Fool Investment Guide, was in 2003 called the "#1 All-Time Classic" by investment club members of the NAIC.[citation needed]
During the financial crisis and the dot-com bubble collapse in 2001, the company ran into trouble, resulting in the loss of 80% of the staff in a series of three layoffs and the closure of its operations in Germany and Japan. Following the 2000–2002 stock market downturn, Motley Fool started to cover more strategies, such as a range of investment styles from small cap stock investing to growth and technology stocks, to dividend investing.[citation needed]
A December 2005 Washington Post article detailed the Motley Fool's 10-year lease for new offices in Old Town Alexandria, Virginia, taking over office space vacated by Time-Life.[16]
In September 2006, the company unveiled Motley Fool CAPS, a service that monitors and ranks the most successful stock pickers amongst its members.[17]
In 2011, the company launched Fool Australia,[18] followed in 2012 by Fool Canada[19] and Fool Singapore.[20]
Premium services[edit]
Motley Fool Stock Advisor[edit]
In April 2002, the company launched the first of its premium subscription services. David and Tom Gardner pick one stock each month in a brotherly competition to best each other and the S&P 500. They maintain a consistent buy-and-hold style, tending to let their winning stocks compound returns over longer periods of time.

Returns on the Odyssey portfolio were 67.1% growth after 28 months (as of October 2014)[21][not in citation given]

Community discussion boards[edit]
The Motley Fool hosts online discussion boards. Registered users can get access to all non-newsletter boards that cover a variety of stock, personal finance, and investing concepts. The discussion boards are used heavily to recruit future Motley Fool staffers; frequent posters are first awarded free subscriptions to their favorite Motley Fool newsletters then eventually receive a small stipend and "TMF" username moniker to patrol the boards.[citation needed]
On Thursday 3 November 2016 it was announced that the UK boards would close, with a post stating "It's my sad duty to announce that we'll be closing the Fool UK Discussion Boards to new posts on Thursday 17 November. After they close to new posts, the Boards will remain accessible as a 'read-only' archive for at least 3 months."[22] Several Fools have suggested alternative sites including lemonfool.co.uk.[23][citation needed]
The Foolish Four[edit]
Main article: Foolish Four
In 1999, Motley Fool ran into controversy with its eventually discredited Foolish Four investment theory, which had been marketed as a way to "crush mutual funds [in] only 15 minutes a year" by using a simple mathematical formula to find stocks likely to grow much more than average.[24][25] This stock-picking technique was referred to as "investment hogwash in its purest form" by Money writer Jason Zweig in an August 1999 article titled "False Profits."[26] Zweig also called it "one of the most cockamamie stock-picking formulas ever concocted" in his 2003 commentary in the revised edition of Benjamin Graham's acclaimed Value investing book, The Intelligent Investor.[24]
Motley Fool writer Ann Coleman admitted in 2000 that the Foolish Four method "turned out to be not nearly as wonderful a strategy as we thought."[27]
Blog Network[edit]
The Motley Fool Blog Network was a stock analysis and news site that provided a platform for non-Motley Fool staff writers to submit articles. They received compensation ranging from $50–$100 for each article submitted and additional compensation for how many recommendations or "editors picks" they received.[28] Eventually the company merged the Blog Network with its primary site, syndicating bloggers' articles alongside those written by in-house staff and making the beta.fool.com blogging platform defunct. In July 2014, after Yahoo announced its new Yahoo Finance Contributors platform,[29] Motley Fool was negatively impacted, as a significant percentage of traffic to its website relied on syndication of articles via Yahoo Finance. This led the company to sever relationships with the majority of its freelance contributors and former bloggers.[30]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
