Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Florida:













Does Murphy Thomas P Jr carry a valid contracting license?



If you pay someone to construct a building or a structure, make structural alterations to load bearing walls, or perform services such as plumbing or air conditioning work, that person must have a state contractor's license.
Murphy Thomas P Jr currently holds license FRO2524, 0002524 (Construction Financial Officer), which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Florida?



The Florida Construction Industry License Board maintains high standards for contractor licensing. Prior to receiving their license, Florida contractors are required to prove four years of relevant work experience or education; pass a board examination and prove financial solvency.











Your liability risk when hiring Murphy Thomas P Jr



In Florida, licensed contractors with employees are required to carry workers' compensation insurance and attest they have obtained public liability and property damage insurance in the amounts determined by the Board.











Financial recourse when hiring Murphy Thomas P Jr



Florida maintains a recovery fund, called the Florida Homeowners' Construction Recovery Fund, which is available to a natural person who has suffered monetary damages by the financial mismanagement or misconduct of a contractor, and who has exhausted all other sources of payment. The Board makes the determination of eligibility for an award. Florida contractors are not required to carry an active bond.











What else should I know before hiring Murphy Thomas P Jr



As of 2007, the Florida DBPR began requiring license applicants to submit their fingerprints, which are used to run a criminal background check with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. In addition, they are required to provide a credit report during the license application process to demonstrate financial stability. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The Florida Construction Industry License Board recommends getting at least three written bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.

Tom Murphy, Jr




Chairman & CEO


“If there’s one thing that a century of building has taught us, it’s that we’re only as good as our last job. We’ve built our reputation by treating each client personally and with the utmost importance. No matter the size of the project, the same rules apply. The same respect. The same integrity. The same passion. The same attention to detail. With every project we build, it’s not just our business on the line…it’s our family’s name and reputation.That is why at Coastal, It’s Not Just Business… It’s Personal.”




Tom built Coastal on a simple foundation…to provide quality service for a select group of clients through a hands-on approach. As the visionary behind his company, Tom has taken a family business and has grown it into a billion dollar corporate enterprise.
