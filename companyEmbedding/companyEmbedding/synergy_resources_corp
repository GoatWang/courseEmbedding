Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Synergy Resources Corp (ARCA:SYRG) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 1 Buy RatingConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 3.00)Consensus Price Target: N/A

Operations Overview
SRC Energy’s core area of operations is in the Wattenberg Field, a very prolific oil and gas producing area where management has long-term, hands-on experience. The Wattenberg Field is in the the Denver-Julesburg Basin ( D-J Basin).
The D-J Basin is a hydrocarbon-rich area centered in eastern Colorado that extends into southeast Wyoming, western Nebraska and Kansas. Oil and gas has been produced from the D-J Basin since its discovery in 1901. It has been one of the most important producing areas in the country.
Relative to other producing regions the D-J Basin has many positive attributes that include:

Low drilling and completion costs
Rapid return on investment
High level of predictability
High drilling success rate
Rich in drilling opportunities, including horizontal drilling in the Niobrara and Codell formations
Long life production and reserves (~30+ years)
Liquid-rich natural gas (high BTU content)
Well developed pipeline infrastructure

SRC Energy's strategy for continued growth includes additional drilling activities, acquisition of existing wells, and re-completion of wells that provide good prospects for improved hydraulic stimulation techniques. The company attempts to maximize its return on assets invested by drilling and operating development wells in which it has a significant net revenue interest. SRC Energy attempts to limit its risk by drilling in proven areas. To date, the company has not drilled any dry holes.  SRC Energy began drilling and operating horizontal wells in May, 2013 with the first production from five horizontal wells on the Renfroe Pad beginning in September, 2013 and has a total of 96 gross operated horizontal wells producing as of June 2016.  The company has also participated as a non-operated working interest owner in over 130 other gross horizontal wells in the Wattenberg Field.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Synergy Resources Corp. Reports Two Insider Buys


January 21, 2013, 06:14:28 PM EDT
By Dianne Tordillo, GuruFocus

Two members of Synergy Resources Corp. (
  SYRG

  )'s executive officers have purchased company shares, reported
  Jan. 16 according to
  GuruFocus Insider Buys

  .
  


  Director Rick Wilber added 50,000 shares to his stake costing him
  $293,000, while Director George Seward added 15,000 shares to his
  stake, an $88,100 transaction.
  


  For Wilber, this is his third stake increase, aside from
  purchasing 20,000 shares in both June 2012 and August 2012.
  Seward's purchase, on the other hand, makes his 15th buy.
  


  Market capitalized at $332.2 million, Synergy Resources Corp. is
  a domestic oil and natural gas exploration and production
  company. Headquartered in Platteville, Colo., the company's core
  operations are located in the Denver-Julesburg Basin, which
  encompasses Colorado, Wyoming, Kansas and Nebraska.
  



  Having served as independent director of Synergy Resources since
  September 2008, Wilber has been a private investor and consultant
  to numerous development-stage companies, according to his Reuters
  profile. He co-founded athletic product retailer, Champs Sporting
  Goods, and has also served as a director for Ultimate Software
  Group (
  ULTI

  ) and Royce Laboratories.
  


  Director Seward has served the company since 2010, according to
  his Reuters description. He co-founded Prima Energy, which was
  eventually sold to energy company, Petro-Canada. Currently,
  Seward serves as the president of Pocito Oil and Gas.
  


  In one year, Synergy's market value has gone up 103.69 percent.
  


  In November, the company reported its 2012 year-end results.
  Synergy's revenue increased 150 percent to $25 million for the
  full year. This increase was driven by a surge in production, due
  to the company buying 52 new wells during the year.
  


  Operating income for the full year was $11.8 million, up 317
  percent from the $2.8 million in the previous year.
  


  "We had a very successful year achieving all of our stated
  drilling and completion goals within the Wattenberg," said Ed
  Holloway, Synergy Resources CEO. "Despite the difficult
  conditions for part of the year with high line pressure in the
  Wattenberg and modest commodity price pressure in the fourth
  quarter, neither within our control, we remain well positioned
  with our drilling program to grow production in fiscal 2013. We
  have the capital, access to equipment and talented management to
  ensure continued growth."
  


  Synergy Resources was included in the Russell l Microcap Index,
  the Russell 3000 Index and the Russell Global Index on June 25.
  


  With its stock up 1.68 percent this afternoon, Synergy Resources
  trades at $6.07.
  


  Currently, no Gurus followed by GuruFocus hold stakes in the
  company.

If you are currently struggling with issues such as finding information for customers, difficulty in quoting accurate delivery dates, on-time product delivery, losing orders to competitors because of price/quality/delivery issues, maintaining inventory etc., then all your worries can end.
By deploying an enterprise-wide application like VISUAL ERP, you can get access to information whenever you need it. Finding the right information will allow you to minimize risk, improve operational efficiencies and maximize throughput (boost profitability).
When your organization is growing at a fast pace, you come across new challenges every day. However, with the right information, you can turn these challenges into opportunities. In a normal business scenario, such opportunities may be completely hidden from view. This happens due to a lack of visibility or transparency in your business process.
The biggest opportunities when streamlining a manufacturing business lies in eliminating the non-value-added activities (NVAs). A few examples are waiting times, unnecessary transportation movement and disorganization.
This is where VISUAL ERP plays a key role by improving and implementing demand pull techniques based on LEAN/TOC concepts. Such a process can dramatically increase the process flow, which results in faster lead times, reduced inventory, higher productivity gains, better on-time delivery, fewer reworks, higher revenues and delighted customers.
Also, in your endeavor to increase higher returns, overhead costs don’t go up. Sounds great, doesn’t it?
All these can be a reality for your business when you use VISUAL ERP for manufacturing, quality, customer service, financials and so on. These tools are fast, easy, flexible and functionally rich. Also, we would be assisting you at every step in implementing these tools, while training your staff for a seamless transition.
