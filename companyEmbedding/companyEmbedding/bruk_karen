CounterPath Announces Closing of Private Placement








Vancouver, BC, Canada — July 21, 2017 — 
CounterPath Corporation (“CounterPath” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: CPAH) (TSX: PATH), a global provider of award-winning over-the-top (OTT) Unified Communications solutions for enterprises and carriers, announced today the closing of a non-brokered private placement of 539,240 shares of common stock (each, a “Share”) of the Company at a price of US$2.20 for gross proceeds of US$1,186,328 (the “Offering”).
The net proceeds from the Offering will be used to (1) buildout the Company’s Unified Communications-as-a-Service (UCaaS) offerings, (2) expand sales and marketing resources and (3) for general corporate purposes.
Wesley Clover International Corporation the Company’s largest shareholder, KMB Trac Two Holdings Ltd. (“KMB”) and the Company’s executives subscribed for an aggregate of 345,227 Shares. The Offering constituted a related party transaction under Multilateral Instrument 61-101 – Protection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions (“MI 61-101”). The issuance to the insiders is exempt from the formal valuation and minority shareholder approval requirements of MI 61-101 because neither the fair market value of the subject matter of the transaction nor the consideration paid will exceed 25% of the Company's market capitalization. As the Offering is a related party transaction and was announced less than 21 days before its closing, MI 61-101 requires the Company to explain why the shorter period was reasonable or necessary in the circumstances. In the view of the Company it was necessary to immediately close the Offering and therefore, such shorter period was reasonable and necessary in the circumstances to improve the Company’s financial position.
All of the securities issued by the Company in connection with the Offering will be subject to hold periods expiring on November 21, 2017 under Canadian and United States securities laws. None of the securities to be issued will be registered under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “1933 Act”), and none of them may be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the 1933 Act. This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy nor shall there be any sale of the securities in any State where such offer, solicitation, or sale would be unlawful.

CounterPath Closes Private Placement








Vancouver, BC, Canada — December 15, 2016 — 
CounterPath Corporation (NASDAQ: CPAH) (TSX: PATH), a global provider of award-winning, over-the-top (OTT) Unified Communications (UC) solutions for enterprises and carriers, today announced the closing of a non-brokered private placement of 454,097 shares of common stock (each, a “Share”) of the Company at a price of US$2.05 per Share for total gross proceeds of US$930,898.85 (the “Offering”).
The net proceeds from the Offering will be used to: (1) market Bria X, the Company’s Unified Communications-as-a-Service (UCaaS) offering that overlays existing PBX and VoIP Services and adds provisioning, messaging, presence and screen sharing; (2) expand sales and business development resources; (3) fund development for integration of the Company’s UC solutions with other enterprise applications; and (4) for general corporate purposes.
Terence Matthews, Chairman and the Company’s largest shareholder, KMB Trac Two Holdings Ltd., the Company’s second largest shareholder and Donovan Jones, President and Chief Executive Officer, subscribed to the full amount of the Offering. The Offering constituted a “related party transaction” within the meaning of Multilateral Instrument 61-101 Protection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions (“MI 61-101”). The issuance to the insiders is exempt from the valuation requirement of MI 61-101 by virtue of the exemption contained in sections 5.5(a) and 5.7(a) of MI 61-101 in that the fair market value of the consideration of the shares issued to the related parties did not exceed 25% of the Company’s market capitalization. As the Offering is a related party transaction and was announced less than 21 days before its closing, MI 61-101 requires the Company to explain why the shorter period was reasonable or necessary in the circumstances. In the view of the Company it was necessary to immediately close the Offering and therefore, such shorter period was reasonable and necessary in the circumstances to improve the Company’s financial position.
All of the securities issued by the Company in connection with the Offering will be subject to hold periods expiring on April 16, 2017 under Canadian securities laws, and will also be subject to applicable hold periods under United States securities laws. None of the securities issued have been registered under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “1933 Act”), and none of them may be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the 1933 Act. This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy nor shall there be any sale of the securities in any State where such offer, solicitation, or sale would be unlawful.
Early Warning Disclosure
Kanata Research Park Corporation (“KRPC”), located at 555 Legget Drive, Suite 206, Kanata, Ontario, Canada K3K 2X3, purchased 198,000 Shares issued pursuant to the Offering for aggregate consideration of US$405,900 (CDN$532,677.17) in reliance on the prospectus exemption contained in section 2.10 of National Instrument 45-106 Prospectus Exemptions. KRPC acquired the Shares for investment purposes. Wesley Clover International Corporation (“Wesley Clover”) owns 100% of the issued and outstanding voting shares of KRPC. Dr. Terence H.

Forward-looking Statements
This news release contains "forward-looking statements". Statements in this news release which are not purely historical, are forward-looking statements and include any statements regarding beliefs, plans, outlook, expectations or intentions regarding the future such as: (i) the net proceeds received by CounterPath from the Offering will be used for marketing Bria X, expanding sales and business development resources; funding development for integration of the Company’s UC solutions with other enterprise applications and for general corporate purposes, (ii) the early warning reports mentioned in this news release will be filed with Canadian regulators, and (ii) that the hold period on the Shares issued pursuant to the Offering will expire on the date stated in this news release.
The forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. It is important to note that actual outcomes and the Company’s actual results could differ materially from those in such forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ from those projected in any forward-looking statements due to numerous factors. Such factors include, among others: (1) the lack of cash flow which may affect CounterPath’s ability to continue as a going concern, (2) the variability in CounterPath’s sales from reporting period to reporting period due to extended sales cycles as a result of selling CounterPath’s products through channel partners or the length of time of deployment of CounterPath’s products by its customers, (3) the inability to predict subscription renewal rates and the impact these rates may have on our future revenue and operating results, (4) a decline in the Company’s stock price or insufficient investor interest in the Company’s securities which may impact the Company’s ability to raise additional financing as required or be delisted from a stock exchange on which its common stock trades, (5) the impact of intellectual property litigation that could materially and adversely affect CounterPath’s business, (6) the failure to develop new and innovative products using the Company’s technologies. Readers should also refer to the risk disclosures outlined in the Company’s quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, or in the annual reports on Form 10-K, and the Company’s other disclosure documents filed from time-to-time with the Securities and Exchange Commission at www.sec.gov and the Company’s interim and annual filings and other disclosure documents filed from time-to-time on SEDAR at www.sedar.com.
