Funding stage comparison

Estimated website visits
This graph shows estimated monthly visits to the company website. As our data source puts it, "a visit is defined as an entry to a web domain from a different web domain or from the beginning of an empty browsing session, and expires after 30 minutes of inactivity."


Ok, thanks






















Funding stage comparison
This graph gives a simple snapshot of a startup's evolutionary position among its competitors. To determine a company's development stage, we count the number of funding rounds and the amount of capital raised. We then approximate and visualise a company's value -- the bigger its circle, the more valuable the company.
Why does it matter?
The size and number of funding rounds says a lot about a startup and where it is headed. Investors use this basic data to take the pulse of a startup among its competitors that aim for the same market. Several funding rounds and sizable investments are a good gauge of current investors' confidence in the market, the business, and the team.
Ideally, you'll want to see the startup developing from the lower left corner of the graph to the top right. This would signify a gradual rise in both funding and value. Anomalies, such as multiple small funding rounds, or few very large funding rounds, also warrant closer inspection.


Ok, thanks










Value, Funderbeam estimate, $m
















Employee comparison
This graph shows staff growth over time. If an older company’s balloon still lingers low, its employee growth has stalled.
                            Larger balloons indicate that hiring has likely been fuelled by investors' cash, smaller balloons high in the graph hint at revenue-driven staff growth.

funding history











Disclosed funding
This build-up graph gives an overview of disclosed funding rounds in chronological order, indicating the time and type of funding raised.
Why does it matter?
The size and frequency of funding rounds says a lot about a startup and where it is headed. Experienced investors look at the size, number and timing of funding rounds in a given industry, and estimate the value of a startup,
                            as well as the amount of equity that founders have likely surrendered. Funding reflects investor confidence in the market, the business, and the team.


Ok, thanks












 








Valuation, Funderbeam estimate
This graph shows a given startup's valuation at different disclosed funding rounds. We approximate the post-money valuation by estimating the value range of the equity stake that the startup may have surrendered to investors in each disclosed funding round.
Why does it matter?
Investors usually want to avoid overpaying for an equity stake in a startup. Comparing startup valuations in the same industry segment helps you read the mood and maturity of the market, investors' exit potential, etc. It also helps you see if a startup prices itself above or below its competitors, considering its product, development stage, etc.
A startup's precise value is impossible to estimate, partly because parties rarely disclose the percentage of the company that's surrendered to investors in any given funding round. However, we can estimate a likely value range based on how startup investments usually work.


Ok, thanks












 








Relative funding history
This graph gives competitors a common starting point, making it easier to view their speed of growth in relation to one another.


Ok, thanks






















Funding history
This graph makes it easy to see and compare the pace of funding among competitors. As a rule, later rounds mean that a company's business model works. This helps to gauge when business in a given sector really took off.


Ok, thanks

Milwaukee, WI (PRWEB)
May 24, 2014
 Wantable, Inc., a leading discovery service for makeup, accessories and intimates, announces its June Box. The June Makeup Box features products from Vincent Longo, Eddie Funkhouser and Mirabella. New to the Makeup Box is Tarina Tarantino and Ofra. The June Intimates Box features brands like Honeydew Intimates, R E A L Underwear, Coobie, and Rhonda Shear.
Wantable welcomes Melissa Raymond from the YouTube channel Melphs Knows Makeup as June’s makeup expert. Melissa “loves every item she’s ever received from Wantable” and her favorite looks for June include pink cheeks by Tarina Tarantino, Bronzed eyes from Mirabella and pink nude lips from Eddie Funkhouser.” Vincent Longo is back in Wantable Makeup Boxes with complexion products, and newcomer Ofra features their Universal Brow Pencil and lip liners. 
June Accessory Boxes feature pops of turquoise, colorful leather wrap watches, light printed scarves, and metal chain details. Blogger Zeba from Ella Pretty is June’s accessory stylist.  Zeba loves the Wantable accessory box because “it is a mix of items that [she] would pick out for herself, but also items that take [her] slightly out of [her] comfort zone.”

R E A L Underwear is new to Wantable intimates boxes and will feature sexy panties and bras. New from Honeydew Intimates are colorful panties and cami sets.

Wantable prepares for its next growth spurt

Haircare was going to be Wantable Inc.’s third product category. The research was done and the company started talking to customers and vendors about what they wanted and what the category would look like.
But president and chief executive officer Jalem Getz decided to pull the plug on the idea after realizing the company couldn’t deliver on what customers wanted. Wantable’s main focus is on meeting and exceeding customer expectations, Getz says.
Getz
“For many months afterwards, a lot of people thought that (decision) was a mistake,” Getz said. “It was not a mistake because we launched our largest category, which is women’s fitness, instead.”
Milwaukee-based Wantable is one of hundreds of entrants to the subscription apparel market in recent years. Customers pay a monthly fee and stylists send five to seven handpicked items to try on. The customer sends back the items she doesn’t like and pays for what she keeps.
The company has been among Milwaukee’s fastest-growing startups, repeatedly outgrowing its available space, hiring 100 people and raising more than $4 million in investments. Getz, who founded the company and was also the founder of New Berlin-based Buyseasons Inc., doesn’t reveal revenue figures, but said the company has been doubling its revenues each year, posted its first profit in 2016 and has hundreds, if not thousands, of customers in most states. The company has had 18 consecutive quarters of growth, according to a news release.
Wantable’s focus has turned from, “Where’s our meal going to come from tomorrow?” to setting itself up for the next chapter, Getz said.
He’s developing a stronger management structure and narrowing roles and responsibilities. The company hired its first human resources director and Getz also is spending a large portion of his time, around 20 percent, focused on recruiting top talent.
“We are an apparel company that is extremely mindful of the importance of technology not only in our model, because we pick products for customers, but also just in generally doing business,” Getz said, noting the technology and purchasing staff are about the same size.
Adjusting to the market while keeping the customer front of mind will help Wantable survive a potential shakeout of an industry that has seen an influx of new competitors in recent years, he said.
“You’re going to see a lot of companies fail this year,” Getz said. “We’re not out of the woods, but we’re certainly much closer to being out of the woods than a lot of the competitors, because we never entered this space with the starry-eyed notion of getting rich quick; that was never the plan.”

Wantable, Inc. Announces Its April Box

26

Milwaukee, WI (PRWEB) March 24, 2014 
 Wantable, Inc., a leading discovery service for makeup, accessories and intimates announces its April Box. The new box features makeup brands MiA BelleZZa, ‘Tini Beauty, Cailyn, and Chella along with intimates brands Miel, Honeydew Intimates, and K. Bell.
 
Fashion and beauty vlogger Kassie Edwardson joins Wantable as April’s makeup specialist. Kassie loves that Wantable is “not just a generic box,” but rather “tailored to [her] and the products that [she’s] interested in.” Featured brand Chella will help keep brows neat and tidy this month; something that Kassie believes is “a must no matter what the season.”
 
Wantable will also partner with Miel this month.  Sisters Camila and Valeria created Miel for active and fashionable women who want to feel their best in fresh and sexy underwear. Another addition to April’s Intimates Box is K. Bell, a company founded in 1979 that designs fun and fashionable socks.
 
April’s Accessories Box features bold scarves, on-trend sunglasses, midi rings, and watches. Guest stylist Laura Mitchell from YouTube channel MrsLolaLynn loves gold tones and geometric patterns as this month’s trends.
 
Wantable, Inc.’s April boxes will be available online from March 24 to April 23.
