BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

Edelman Financial to be bought for $257 million
Wealth manager will be acquired by private-equity firm for substantial premium over current stock price






Apr 16, 2012 @ 1:12 pm
By 
	Dan Jamieson


















+ Zoom




      The Edelman Financial Group Inc. is going private.The nationwide wealth manager, founded by financial planning industry icon Ric Edelman, announced  today that it will be acquired by the private equity firm of Lee Equity Partners LLC.Lee will pay $8.85 per share in cash, a premium of 43% over Edelman Financial's Ticker:(EF) Friday closing price of $6.18. That puts the deal price at around $265 million.
				



"Companies of our size really have no business being public, especially in the financial sector" that is dominated by big firms, Mr. Edelman said in an interview. The company's market capitalization was too small to get the attention of analysts and build liquidity, he said. "It's been very difficult for shareholders to liquidate their shares without punishing the stock," he said. "So this is an excellent liquidity event."The deal is expected to close in the third quarter, subject to approval by shareholders.The Edelman Financial Group manages about $17 billion in client assets through 43 offices in the U.S. Employees and clients of Edelman, which manages about $17 billion in assets through 43 offices in U.S., will see no changes, he said. "We've agreed for me to maintain executive control over the business," he said. George Ball, co-chief executive of Edelman Financial, will become chairman of the company after the transaction closes, Mr. Edelman said.In 2005, Mr. Edelman sold his firm to Sanders Morris Harris Group Inc., a publicly traded holding company co-founded by Mr. Ball. Later, Sanders Morris changed its name to The Edelman Financial Group.Last year, Mr. Edelman -- one of the biggest names in the financial planning industry -- announced that he was exiting the independent-contractor brokerage business, saying the channel faces steep hurdles that limit profitability."Everyone will draw their own conclusions, but I consider the independent-broker-dealer channel severely flawed and question the sustainability of many of the players in the space,” Mr. Edelman said in an interview in October. “The economics are very challenging in today's environment.”Mr. Edelman added that he was exiting the indie B-D space -- a move that affected about 15 practices with roughly 75 reps across his firm -- to focus on the wealth management business. Mr. Edelman is the largest shareholder of his firm."The Edelman Financial Group has achieved a strong track record and is a clear leader in the independent financial adviser field," said Thomas H. Lee, president of Lee Equity Partners, in a statement today. "We are excited to partner with Edelman Financial's management team, and we look forward to supporting the company's continued expansion."The PE firm has been down this path before. Last year, the firm was one of a handful of private equity outfits reportedly interested in acquiring Morgan Keegan last year, before the brokerage business was sold to Raymond James. After MF Global declared bankruptcy at the end of October, the PE firm reportedly lowered its bid for Morgan Keegan to $750 million, according to anonymous sources who spoke to Bloomberg News. Mr. Lee is a "pillar" in the private equity space, Mr. Edelman said. He added that Lee's "seal of approval" should help Edelman Financial continue to grow.
