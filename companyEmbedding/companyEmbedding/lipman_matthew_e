“Joining the Lipman family of companies is exciting for all of us at The Produce Exchange,” said Jones. “We look forward to using Lipman’s national farming and repacking network to give our customers access to the acre.”
 
Shoemaker concluded, “Lipman and The Produce Exchange have a lot in common and it is summed up best by TPE’s mission statement: The relentless creation of extraordinary successes together with our partners. Strategically, our values are in alignment, our facilities and farms complement one another, and our seasoned people together bring experience that will give our customers what they need to be successful.”
 
Congrats on the successful acquisition, Lipman!
