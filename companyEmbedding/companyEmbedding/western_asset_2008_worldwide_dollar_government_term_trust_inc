1. INFORMATION PERTAINING TO THE ELECTION OF DIRECTORS:


In accordance with each Fund's Charter, the Fund's Board of Directors is
divided into three classes: Class I, Class II and Class III.



Global Partners Income Fund Inc.



At the Meeting, stockholders will be asked to elect two Class III Directors,
to hold office until the year 2000 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, or
thereafter until their respective successors are elected and qualified. In
addition, the stockholders will be asked to elect one Class II Director who
was appointed to the board to fill a vacancy created by the resignation of Mr.
Alan H. Rappaport, to hold office until the 1999 Annual Meeting of
Stockholders, or thereafter until his successor is elected and qualified. The
terms of office of the remaining Class I and Class II Directors expire at the
Annual Meeting of Stockholders in 1998 and 1999, respectively, or thereafter
in each case when their respective successors are elected and qualified. The
effect of these staggered terms is to limit the ability of other entities or
persons to acquire control of the Fund by delaying the replacement of a
majority of the Board of Directors. All of the nominees are currently members
of the Board of Directors of the Fund and all nominees except Mr. Cvengros
have previously been elected a director by stockholders of the Fund.

MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT

SALOMON BROTHERS INVESTORS FUND INC


Seven World Trade Center

New York, New York 10048


Salomon Brothers Asset Management Inc

Seven World Trade Center

New York, New York 10048


Dear Sirs:


We herewith confirm our agreement with you as follows:


We are engaged in the business of investing and reinvesting our assets in
securities of the type and in accordance with the limitations specified in our
Articles of Incorporation, By-Laws, Registration Statement filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission under the Investment Company Act of 1940,
and any representation made in our Prospectus. We have previously forwarded to
you copies of the documents listed above and will from time to time furnish
you with any amendments thereof.


We hereby employ you to manage the investing and reinvesting of our assets as
above specified, and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, to
provide management and other services specified below.


You will provide us, at your expense, with office facilities, including
space, furniture and equipment, and all personnel reasonably necessary for our
operations. Other than as herein specifically indicated, you will not be
responsible for any of our expenses. Specifically you will not be responsible,
except to the extent of the reasonable compensation of our employees whose
services may be involved, for our legal and auditing expenses; taxes and
governmental fees and any membership dues; fees of custodian, transfer agent
and registrar, if any; expense of preparing share certificates and other
expenses of issue, sale, underwriting, distribution, redemption or repurchase
of our shares; expense of registering or qualifying securities for sale;
expense of preparing and distributing reports, notices and dividends to
stockholders; cost of stationery; cost of stockholders' and other meetings;
compensation of our Board of Directors and its Executive Committee; and
traveling expenses of officers, directors and employees, if any. Should you
determine that services which would ordinarily be rendered by our employees at
our office can be better rendered by some other outside agency, you shall bear
the costs of employing that agency.


As manager of our portfolio, it shall be your duty to make purchases and
sales of securities on our behalf in accordance with your best judgment and
within the investment objectives and restrictions set forth in our Articles of
Incorporation, By-Laws, Registration Statement and Prospectus, the Investment
Company Act of 1940, the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code with respect
to regulated investment companies, and such policy decisions as the Board of
Directors shall from time to time adopt. You will further advise our Board of
Directors, at such intervals as it may require, of purchases and sales during
such intervals and will, when requested by the Board of Directors, supply the
reasons and considerations that prompted your decisions.


It is understood that you will from time to time employ or associate with you
such persons as you believe to be particularly fitted to assist you in the
execution of your performance of this


B-1-1





agreement, the compensation of such persons to be paid by you. No obligation
may be incurred on our behalf in any such respect. During the continuance of
this agreement you will provide persons satisfactory to our Board of Directors
to serve us as officers and employees, if elected or appointed as such. These
shall be a president, one or more vice presidents, a secretary, a treasurer
and such additional officers and employees as may reasonably be necessary for
the conduct of our business, and you agree to pay the reasonable compensation
of all such persons.


We shall expect of you, and you will give us the benefit of, your best
judgment and efforts in rendering these services to us, and we agree as an
inducement to your undertaking these services that you shall not be liable
hereunder for any mistake of judgment or in any event whatsoever, except for
lack of good faith, provided that nothing herein shall be deemed to protect,
or purport to protect, you against any liability to us or to our stockholders
to which you would otherwise be subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad
faith or gross negligence in the performance of your duties hereunder, or by
reason of your reckless disregard of your obligations and duties hereunder.


In consideration of the foregoing, we will pay you quarterly, promptly after
the last day of each March, June, September and December, a fee consisting of
a base fee as computed below (the "Base Fee") plus a performance adjustment.


The Base Fee shall be calculated as follows:








BASE FEE (AVERAGE DAILY NET ASSETS)                          QUARTERLY FEE RATE
-----------------------------------                          ------------------
First $350 million..........................................       .1625 %
Next $150 million...........................................       .1375 %
Next $250 million...........................................       .13125%
Next $250 million...........................................       .125  %
Over $1 billion.............................................       .1125 %








The Base Fee shall be calculated using the daily net assets averaged over the
most recent quarter. For each percentage point by which our investment
performance exceeds or is exceeded by the investment record of the Standard &
Poor's Composite Index of 500 Stocks (the "S&P 500 Index") over the one year
period ending on the last day of each calendar quarter, the Base Fee will be
adjusted upward or downward by the product of (i) 1/4 of .01% multiplied by

(ii) our average daily net assets for the one year period ending on the last
day of each calendar quarter. If the amount by which we outperform or
underperform the S&P 500 Index is not a whole percentage point, a pro rata
adjustment shall be made. However, there will be no performance adjustment
unless our investment performance exceeds or is exceeded by the investment
record of the S&P 500 Index by at least one percentage point over the same
period. The maximum quarterly adjustment is 1/4 of .1%, which would occur if
our performance exceeds or is exceeded by the S&P 500 Index by ten or more
percentage points.


Our investment performance, for a period of one year, shall mean the sum of

(i) the change in our net asset value per share during such period, (ii) the
value of cash distributions per share accumulated to the end of such period
and (iii) the value of capital gains taxes per share paid or payable on
undistributed realized long-term capital gains accumulated to the end of such
period; expressed as a percentage of our net asset value per share at the
beginning of such period. For this purpose, the value of distributions per
share of realized capital gains, of dividends per share paid from investment
income and of capital gains taxes per share paid or payable on undistributed
realized long-term capital gains shall be treated as reinvested in our shares
at the


B-1-2





net asset value per share in effect at the close of business on the record
date for the payment of such distributions and dividends and the date on which
provision is made for such taxes, after giving effect to such distributions,
dividends and taxes.


The investment record of the S&P 500 Index, for a period of one year, shall
mean the sum of (i) the change in the level of the index during such period
and (ii) the value, computed consistently with the index, of cash
distributions made by companies whose securities comprise the index
accumulated to the end of such period; expressed as a percentage of the index
level at the beginning of such period. For this purpose, cash distributions on
the securities which comprise the index shall be treated as reinvested in the
index at least as frequently as the end of each calendar quarter following the
payment of the dividend.


For this purpose the value of our net assets shall be computed in the manner
specified in our Articles of Incorporation for the computation of the value of
such net assets in connection with the determination of the net asset value of
our shares.


If the fee payable to the Investment Manager pursuant to this agreement
begins to accrue on a date prior to the end of any quarter or if this
agreement terminates before the end of any quarter, compensation for the
period from such date to the end of such quarter or from the end of the last
quarter ending prior to such termination to the date of termination shall be
prorated and shall be payable promptly at the end of such quarter or after the
date of termination, as the case may be.


Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the aggregate expenses (excluding interest,
taxes, brokerage commissions and other portfolio transaction expenses and any
extraordinary expenses, but including the management fee) incurred by, or
allocated to, us in any fiscal year shall exceed the most stringent expense
limitations applicable to us imposed by state securities laws or regulations
thereunder, as such limitations may be raised or lowered from time to time,
you shall reimburse us for such excess. Your reimbursement obligation will be
limited to the amount of fees you received under this agreement during the
period in which such expense limitations were exceeded, unless otherwise
required by applicable laws or regulations. With respect to portions of a
fiscal year in which this contract shall be in effect, the foregoing
limitations shall be prorated according to the proportion which that portion
of the fiscal year bears to the full fiscal year. Any such payments required
to be made shall be made once a year promptly after the end of our fiscal
year.


You will (i) not make a short sale of any share of our capital stock, (ii)
not purchase any such share otherwise than for investment and (iii) advise us
of any sale of such share made by you less than two months after the date of
acquisition.


This agreement shall remain in effect for twelve months from the date hereof
and thereafter shall continue automatically for successive annual periods,
provided that such continuance is specifically approved at least annually (i)
by the vote of a majority of our directors who are not parties to this
agreement or "interested persons" (as defined in the Investment Company Act of
1940) of any such party, cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of
voting on such approval and (ii) either by the vote of (x) the Board of
Directors or (y) a majority of our outstanding voting securities (as so
defined). This agreement may be terminated at any time, without the payment of
any penalty, by vote of a majority of our outstanding voting securities (as so
defined), or by a vote of a majority of our entire Board of Directors, on
sixty days' written notice to you, or by you on sixty days' written notice to
us.


This agreement may not be transferred, assigned, sold or in any manner
hypothecated or pledged by you. This agreement shall terminate automatically
in the event of its assignment (as defined in the Investment Company Act of
1940) by you.


B-1-3





Except to the extent necessary to perform your obligations hereunder, nothing
herein shall be deemed to limit or restrict your right, or the right of any
parent, subsidiary or affiliate of yours, or the right of any employees of
yours or any of them who may also be a director, officer or employee of ours,
to engage in any other business or to devote time and attention to the
management of other aspects of any other business, whether of a similar or
dissimilar nature, or to render services of any kind to any other corporation,
firm, individual or association.


If the foregoing is in accordance with your understanding, will you kindly so
indicate by signing and returning to us the enclosed copy hereof.


Very truly yours,

4. As manager of Fund's assets, Adviser shall make purchases and sales of
securities for Fund's account in accordance with Adviser's best judgment and
within the investment objectives and restrictions set forth in Fund's Articles
of Incorporation, Registration Statements under the 1940 Act and the 1933 Act,
the 1940 Act, the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code relating to
regulated investment companies and policy decisions adopted by Fund's Board of
Directors from time to time. Adviser shall advise Fund's officers and Board of
Directors, at such times as Fund's Board of Directors may specify, of
purchases and sales made for Fund's account and shall, when requested by
Fund's officers or Board of Directors, supply the reasons for making such
purchases and sales.


5. Adviser shall give Fund the benefit of Adviser's best judgment and efforts
in rendering services under this Contract. As an inducement to Adviser's
undertaking to render these services, Fund agrees that Adviser shall not be
liable under this Contract for any mistake in judgment or in any other event
whatsoever except for lack of good faith, provided that nothing in this
Contract shall be deemed to protect or purport to protect Adviser against any
liability to Fund or its shareholders to which Adviser would otherwise be
subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the
performance of Adviser's duties under this Contract or by reason of Adviser's
reckless disregard of its obligations and duties hereunder.


6. In consideration of the services to be rendered by Adviser under this
Contract, Fund shall pay Adviser a monthly fee on the first business day of
each month, [based upon the average daily closing value of fund's net assets
during the next preceding month, at the following annual rates:








      PORTION OF AVERAGE DAILY
     CLOSING VALUE OF NET ASSETS       FEE
     ---------------------------      ------
Not exceeding $100 Million........... 1.00 %
In excess of $100 million but not
 exceeding $200 million.............. 0.75 %
In excess of $200 million but not
 exceeding $400 million.............. 0.625%
In excess of $400 million............ 0.50 %]/3/








If this Contract becomes effective or terminates before the end of any month,
the fee for the period from the effective date to the end of such month or
from the beginning of such month to the date of termination, as the case may
be, shall be prorated according to the proportion which such period bears to
the full month in which such effectiveness or termination occurs. For purposes
of calculating each such monthly fee, the value of Fund's net assets shall be
computed in the manner specified in its Articles of Incorporation for the
computation of the value of such net assets in connection with the
determination of the net asset value of shares of its Capital Stock.


7. Adviser agrees that it will bear any expenses of Fund (exclusive of
interest, taxes, brokerage expenses and extraordinary items) for any fiscal
year of Fund in excess of the most stringent expense limitation imposed by
state securities regulations applicable to Fund in an amount equal to the
lesser of such excess or the aggregate amount of fees paid by Fund to Adviser
pursuant to paragraph 6 for services rendered by Adviser under this Contract
during such fiscal year. In the event this Contract is terminated as of a date
other than the last day of the fiscal year of Fund, Adviser shall pay Fund the
amount by which such expenses incurred by Fund prior to the termination date
exceeds a pro rata portion of the applicable expense limitation, so Adviser is
required to reimburse Fund for no more than the total reimbursement which
would have been

ing value of Fund's net assets during the next preceding month" for brack-
eted language.


B-2-2





made had this Contract remained in effect for the full fiscal year multiplied
by a fraction equal to the portion of such fiscal year this Contract remained
in effect./4/


8. This Contract shall remain in effect for twelve months from the date
hereof and thereafter shall continue automatically for successive annual
periods, provided that such continuance is specifically approved at least
annually (a) by the vote of a majority of Fund's outstanding voting securities
(as defined in the 1940 Act) or by Fund's Board of Directors and (b) by the
vote, cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose, of a majority of
Fund's directors who are not parties to this Contract or "interested persons"
(as defined in the 1940 Act) of any such party. This Contract may be
terminated at any time, without the payment of any penalty, by a vote of a
majority of Fund's outstanding voting securities (as defined in the 1940 Act)
or by a vote of a majority of Fund's entire Board of Directors on 60 days'
written notice to Adviser or by Adviser on 60 days' written notice to Fund.
This Contract shall terminate automatically in the event of its assignment (as
defined in the 1940 Act) by Adviser.


9. Upon the expiration or earlier termination of this Contract, Fund shall,
if so requested by Adviser in writing, as promptly as practicable change its
corporate name so as to eliminate all reference to "Salomon Brothers," and
thereafter Fund shall cease transacting business in any corporate name using
the words "Salomon Brothers" in any form or combination and shall not use the
words "Salomon Brothers" [or any other reference to Adviser or "Salomon
Brothers"]./5/ The foregoing rights of Adviser and obligations of Fund shall
not deprive Adviser, or any affiliate thereof which has "Salomon Brothers" in
its name, of, but shall be in addition to, any other rights or remedies to
which Adviser and any such affiliate may be entitled in law or equity by
reason of any breach of this Contract by Fund, and the failure or omission of
Adviser to request a change of Fund's name or cessation of the use of the name
of "Salomon Brothers" as described in this paragraph shall not under any
circumstances be deemed a waiver of the right to require such change or a
cessation at any time thereafter for the same or any subsequent breach. The
damage to Adviser, or any affiliate thereof which has "Salomon Brothers" in
its name, by reason of any failure of Fund after request to change its name
and to cease using the name of "Salomon Brothers" would be irreparable and
impossible of ascertainment in terms of money, and Fund consents and agrees
that, consistent with the foregoing, in any such case an injunction may issue
against it restraining it from the further use of the name of "Salomon
Brothers."
/4/SBOF agreement substitutes paragraph 7 with the following: "If the
aggregate expenses of every character incurred by Fund in any fiscal year,
other than interest, taxes, brokerage commissions and any extraordinary
expenses, but including the fees provided for in paragraph 6 (includable
expenses), shall exceed the applicable expense limitations imposed by the
securities, regulations of any state in which shares of Fund's Capital
Stock are and continue to be, with Adviser's consent, registered or
qualified for sale to the public, Adviser shall pay Fund the amount equal
to the lesser of such excess or the aggregate amount of fees paid by Fund
to Adviser pursuant to paragraph 6 for services rendered by Adviser under
this Contract during such fiscal year. With respect to portions of a fiscal
year in which this Contract shall be in effect, the foregoing limitation
shall be prorated according to the proportion which that portion of the
fiscal year bears to the full fiscal year. At the end of each month of
Fund's fiscal year, Adviser shall review the includable expenses accrued
during such year to the end of the period, and shall estimate the
contemplated includable expenses for the balance of the fiscal year. If as
a result of such review and estimation, it appears likely that the
includable expenses will exceed the limitations provided for in this
paragraph for such year, the monthly fee set forth in paragraph 6 payable
to Adviser for such month shall be reduced, subject to a later adjustment,
by an amount equal to a prorata portion (prorated on the basis of the
remaining months of the fiscal year, including the month just ended) of the
amount by which the includable expenses for the fiscal year are expected to
exceed the limitations provided for in this paragraph. For purposes of the
foregoing, the value of Fund's net assets shall be computed in the manner
specified in the last sentence of paragraph 6, and any payment required to
be made by Adviser shall be made once a year promptly after the end of
Fund's fiscal year."

/5/SBOF agreement substitutes "or any name derived from the name "Salomon
Brothers"," for bracketed language.


B-2-3





10. Except to the extent necessary to perform Adviser's obligations under
this Contract, nothing herein shall be deemed to limit or restrict the right
of Adviser, or any affiliate of Adviser, or any employee of Adviser, including
any employee who may also be a director, officer or employee of Fund, to
engage in any other business or to devote time and attention to the management
or other aspects of any other business, whether of a similar or dissimilar
nature, or to render services of any kind to any other corporation, firm,
individual or association.


If the foregoing correctly sets forth the agreement between Fund and Adviser,
please so indicate by signing and returning to Fund the enclosed copy hereof.

4. As manager of the Fund's assets, the Investment Manager shall make
investments for the Fund's account in accordance with the investment objective
and limitations set forth in the Articles, the Prospectus, the 1940 Act, the
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code [of 1986, as amended,]/1/1/ relating

Directors, at such times as the Company's Board of Directors may specify, of
investments made for the Fund's account and shall, when requested by the
Company's officers or Board of Directors, supply the reasons for making such
investments.

to time when deemed to be in the best interests of the Company and to the
extent permitted by applicable law, to purchase and/or sell securities in
which the Investment Manager or any of its affiliates underwrites, deals in

services for issuers of such securities. The Investment Manager is further

services described in this agreement, the Company agrees that the Investment
Manager shall not be liable under this agreement for any error of judgment or
mistake of law or for any loss suffered by the Company/1/2/ in connection
with the performance of this agreement, provided that nothing in this
agreement shall be deemed to protect or purport to protect the Investment
Manager against any liability to the Company or its stockholders to which the
Investment Manager would otherwise be subject by reason of willful
misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of the

[Investment Manager's]/1/3/ duties under this agreement or by reason of the

[Investment Manager's]/1/4/ reckless disregard of its obligations and duties
hereunder./1/5/

/1/IAG and SAG add "(including any Hong Kong taxes or related

language.


/1/SAG, IEMD, IHYBand IAG agreements substitute "its" for bracketed
language.


/1/SAG, IEMD, IHYB and IAG agreements add the following language to paragraph
6: "("disabling conduct'). The Fund will indemnify the Investment Manager
against, and hold it harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages,
liabilities or expenses [(including any Hong Kong taxes or related
expenses imposed on the Fund in relation to the matters contemplated by
this agreement)], including reasonable counsel fees and expenses and any
amounts paid in satisfaction of judgments, in compromise or as fines or
penalties, not resulting from disabling conduct by the Investment Manager.
Indemnification shall be made only following: (i) a final decision on the
merits by a court or other body before whom the proceeding was brought
that the Investment Manager was not liable by reason of disabling conduct,
or (ii) in the absence of such a decision, a reasonable determination,
based upon a review of the facts, that the Investment Manager was not
liable by reason of disabling conduct by (a) the vote of a majority of a
quorum of directors of the Company who are neither "interested persons" of
the Company nor parties to the proceeding ("disinterested non-party
directors"), or (b) an independent legal counsel in a written opinion. The
Investment Manager shall be entitled to advances from the Fund for payment
of the reasonable expenses incurred by it in connection with the matter as
to which it is seeking indemnification in the manner and to the fullest
extent permissible under law. The Investment Manager shall provide to the
Fund a written affirmation of its good faith belief that the standard of
conduct necessary for indemnification by the Fund has been met and a
written undertaking to repay any such advance if it should ultimately be
determined that the standard of conduct has not been met. In addition, at
least one of the following additional conditions shall be met: (a) the
Investment Manager shall provide security in form and amount acceptable to

7. In consideration of the services to be rendered by the Investment Manager
under this agreement, the Company shall pay the Investment Manager a monthly
fee on the first [business day]/1/6/  of each month at an annual rate of

[0.60%]/1/7/ of the average daily value (as determined on the days and at
the time set forth in the Prospectus for determining net asset value per
share) of the Fund's net assets during the preceding month. If the fee payable
to the Investment Manager pursuant to this paragraph 7 begins to accrue before
the end of any month or if this agreement terminates before the end of any
month, the fee for the period from such date to the end of such month or from
the beginning of such month to the date of termination, as the case may be,
shall be prorated according to the proportion which such period bears to the
full month in which such effectiveness or termination occurs. For purposes of
calculating each such monthly fee, the value of the Fund's net assets shall be
computed in the manner specified in the Prospectus and the Articles for the
computation of the value of the Fund's net assets in connection with the
determination of the net asset value of shares of the Fund's capital stock.


8. If the aggregate expenses incurred by, or allocated to, the Fund in any
fiscal year shall exceed the expense limitations applicable to the Fund
imposed by state securities laws or regulations thereunder, as such
limitations may be raised or lowered from time to time, the Investment Manager
shall reimburse the Fund for such excess. The Investment Manager's
reimbursement obligation will be limited to the amount of fees it received
under this agreement during the period in which such expense limitations were
exceeded, unless otherwise required by applicable laws or regulations. With
respect to portions of a fiscal year in which this contract shall be in
effect, the foregoing limitations shall be prorated according to the
proportion which that portion of the fiscal year bears to the full fiscal
year. Any payments required to be made by this paragraph 8 shall be made once
a year promptly after the end of the Company's fiscal year.


9. This agreement shall continue in effect until two years from the date
hereof and thereafter for successive annual periods, provided that such
continuance is specifically approved at least annually (a) by the vote of a
majority of the Fund's outstanding voting securities (as defined in the 1940
Act) or by the Company's Board of Directors and (b) by the vote, cast in
person at a meeting called for the purpose, of a majority of the Company's
directors who are not parties to this agreement or "interested persons" (as
defined in the 1940 Act) of any such party. This agreement may be terminated
at any time, without the payment of any penalty, by a vote of a majority of
the Fund's outstanding voting securities (as defined in the 1940 Act) or by a
vote of a majority of the Company's entire Board of Directors on 60 days'
written notice to the Investment Manager or by the Investment Manager on 60
days' written notice to the Company. This agreement shall terminate
automatically in the event of its assignment (as defined in the 1940
Act)./1/8/




quorum of disinterested non-party directors, or independent legal counsel,
in a written opinion, shall have determined, based on a review of facts
readily available to the Fund at the time the advance is proposed to be
made, that there is reason to believe that the Investment Manager will
ultimately be found to be entitled to indemnification. For purposes of this
paragraph 6 only, the term "Investment Manager" shall be deemed to include
affiliates of the Investment Manager to whom the Investment Manager has
delegated the exercise of all or any of its powers, discretion and duties
under this agreement." IEMB and IHYB agreements omit the bracketed language
in the footnote.


/1/SCM, SNYM and SIMM agreements substitute "Business Day (as defined in the
Prospectus)" for the bracketed language.


/1/IAG, SHYB and SSB agreements substitute "0.75%," SCM, SNYM and SIMM
agreements substitute "0.20%," IHYB and SNIM agreements substitute "0.50,"

STR agreement substitutes "0.55%."


/1/SAG, IEMD, IHYB and IAG agreements add the following language to paragraph
9: "The respective agreements, covenants, indemnities and other statements
set forth in Section 6 hereof shall remain in full force and effect
regardless of any termination or cancellation of this agreement. All
property of the Fund shall be returned to the Fund as soon as reasonably
practicable after the termination of this agreement."


B-3-4





10. Upon expiration or earlier termination of this agreement, the Company
shall, if reference to "Salomon Brothers" is made in the corporate name of the
Company or in the name of the Fund and if the Investment Manager requests in
writing, as promptly as practicable change its corporate name and the name of
the Fund so as to eliminate all reference to "Salomon Brothers", and
thereafter the Company and the Fund shall cease transacting business in any
corporate name using the words "Salomon Brothers" or any other reference to
the Investment Manager or "Salomon Brothers". The foregoing rights of the
Investment Manager and obligations of the Company shall not deprive the
Investment Manager, or any affiliate thereof which has "Salomon Brothers" in
its name, of, but shall be in addition to, any other rights or remedies to
which the Investment Manager and any such affiliate may be entitled in law or
equity by reason of any breach of this agreement by the Company, and the
failure or omission of the Investment Manager to request a change of the
Company's or the Fund's name or a cessation of the use of the name of "Salomon
Brothers" as described in this paragraph 10 shall not under any circumstances
be deemed a waiver of the right to require such change or cessation at any
time thereafter for the same or any subsequent breach.


11. Except to the extent necessary to perform the Investment Manager's
obligations under this agreement, nothing herein shall be deemed to limit or
restrict the right of the Investment Manager, or any affiliate of the
Investment Manager, or any employee of the Investment Manager, to engage in
any other business or to devote time and attention to the management or other
aspects of any other business, whether of a similar or dissimilar nature, or
to render services of any kind to any other corporation, firm, individual or
association.


12. This agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York.


If the foregoing correctly sets forth the agreement between the Company and
the Investment Manager, please so indicate by signing and returning to the
Company the enclosed copy hereof.

SBAM pursuant to the powers granted to the Corporation in its Articles of
Incorporation.


2. Subject to the Board of Directors of the Corporation, SBAM shall manage
the investment operations of the Corporation, and shall provide management and
other services specified in this agreement and especially shall make purchases
and sales of portfolio securities on behalf of the Corporation in accordance
with the best judgment of SBAM and within the investment objectives and
restrictions set forth in the Corporation's Articles of Incorporation, By-Laws
and Registration Statement, the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended,
the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code with respect to regulated
investment companies, and when requested by such Board of Directors, supply
the reasons and considerations that prompted SBAM's decisions.


3. SBAM shall at its expense provide the Corporation with office facilities,
including space, furniture and equipment and all personnel reasonably
necessary for the operation of the Corporation. Other than as herein
specifically indicated, SBAM shall not be responsible for any expenses of the
Corporation. Specifically SBAM shall not be responsible, except to the extent
of the reasonable compensation of employees of the Corporation whose services
may be involved, for the Corporation's legal and auditing expenses; fees and
expenses of its Board of Directors, Executive or special committees; taxes and
governmental fees and any membership dues; fees of custodian, transfer agent
and registrar, if any; expense of preparing share certificates and other
expenses of issue, sale, underwriting, distribution or repurchase of the
Corporation's shares; expenses of registering or qualifying securities for
sale; expense of preparing and distributing reports, notices and dividends to
shareholders; cost of stockholders' and other meetings; or fees in connection
with the listing of its shares on any stock exchange. Should SBAM determine
that services which would ordinarily be rendered by the employees of the
Corporation at its office can be better rendered by some other agency, SBAM
shall bear the costs of employing that agency.


4. It is understood that SBAM shall from time to time employ or associate
with itself such persons as it believes to be particularly fitted to assist it
in the execution of this agreement, the compensation of such persons to be
paid by SBAM. No obligation may be incurred on behalf of the Corporation in
any such respect. During the continuance of this agreement, SBAM shall provide
persons satisfactory to the Board of Directors of the Corporation to serve as
officers and employees of the Corporation. These may be a chairman of the
board, chairman of the executive committee, president, one or more vice-
presidents, a secretary, a treasurer, and such additional


B-4-1





officers and employees as may reasonably be necessary for the conduct of the
Corporation's business and SBAM agrees to pay the compensation of all such
persons.


5. In consideration of the foregoing, the Corporation will pay SBAM
quarterly, promptly after the last day of each March, June, September and
December, a fee consisting of a base fee as computed below (the "Base Fee")
plus a performance adjustment. The Base Fee shall be calculated as follows:








BASE FEE (AVERAGE DAILY NET ASSETS)                          QUARTERLY FEE RATE
-----------------------------------                          ------------------
First $350 million..........................................      .1625 %
Next $150 million...........................................      .1375 %
Next $250 million...........................................      .13125%
Next $250 million...........................................      .125  %
Over $1 billion.............................................      .1125 %








The Base Fee shall be calculated using the daily net assets averaged over the
most recent calendar quarter. For each percentage point by which the
investment performance of the Corporation exceeds or is exceeded by the
investment record of the Standard & Poor's Composite Index of 500 Stocks (the
"S&P 500 Index") over the one year period ending on the last day of each
calendar quarter, the Base Fee will be adjusted upward or downward by the
product of (i) 1/4 of .01% multiplied by (ii) the Corporation's average daily
net assets for the one year period ending on the last day of the calendar
quarter. If the amount by which the Corporation outperforms or underperforms
the S&P 500 Index is not a whole percentage point, a pro rata adjustment shall
be made. However, there will be no performance adjustment unless the
investment performance of the Corporation exceeds or is exceeded by the
investment record of the S&P 500 Index by at least one percentage point over
the same period. The maximum quarterly adjustment is 1/4 of .1%, which would
occur if the Corporation's performance exceeds or is exceeded by the S&P 500
Index by ten or more percentage points.


The investment performance of the Corporation, for a period of one year,
shall mean the sum of (i) the change in the Corporation's net asset value per
share during such period, (ii) the value of cash distributions per share
accumulated to the end of such period and (iii) the value of capital gains
taxes per share paid or payable on undistributed realized long-term capital
gains accumulated to the end of such period; expressed as a percentage of the
Corporation's net asset value per share at the beginning of such period. For
this purpose, the value of distributions per share of realized capital gains,
of dividends per share paid from investment income and of capital gains taxes
per share paid or payable on undistributed realized long-term capital gains
shall be treated as reinvested in shares of the Corporation at the net asset
value per share in effect at the close of business on the record date for the
payment of such distributions and dividends and the date on which provision is
made for such taxes, after giving effect to such distributions, dividends and
taxes. However, notwithstanding the foregoing, the investment performance of
the Corporation shall not include, and there shall be excluded from the change
in the net asset value per share for such period, and the value of the
Corporation's cash distributions per share accumulated to the end of such
period shall be adjusted for, any increase or decrease in the investment
performance of the Corporation resulting from the issuance, sale or repurchase
of any shares of the capital stock or any other securities of the Corporation.


The investment record of the S&P 500 Index, for a period of one year, shall
mean the sum of (i) the change in the level of the index during such period
and (ii) the value, computed consistently with the index, of cash
distributions made by companies whose securities comprise the index
accumulated to the end of such period; expressed as a percentage of the index
level at the beginning of such period. For this purpose, cash distributions on
the securities which comprise the index shall be treated as reinvested in the
index at least as frequently as the end of each calendar quarter following the
payment of the dividend.


B-4-2





If the fee payable to the Investment Manager pursuant to the agreement begins
to accrue on a date prior to the end of any quarter or if this agreement
terminates before the end of any quarter, compensation for the period from
such date to the end of such quarter or from the end of the last quarter
ending prior to such termination to the date of termination shall be prorated
and shall be payable promptly at the end of such quater or after the date of
termination, as the case may be.


6. Upon the expiration or sooner termination of this agreement and/or in the
event of a breach of this agreement by the Corporation, the Corporation
covenants that it will at the request of SBAM to be evidenced by written
notice to the Corporation, forthwith change its corporate name so as to
eliminate all reference to "Salomon Brothers" and will not thereafter transact
any business in a corporate name using the words "Salomon Brothers" in any
form or combination whatsoever, or otherwise use the words "Salomon Brothers"
or any other reference to "Salomon Brothers" and for the purpose of requiring
such discontinuance the judgment of SBAM (or, if SBAM shall no longer be in
existence, Salomon Inc) as to whether this agreement has been breached by the
Corporation shall be final and conclusive. The exercise of its right to
require such discontinuance of use of name shall not deprive SBAM, or any
affiliate thereof which has "Salomon Brothers" in its name, of, but shall be
in addition to, any other rights or remedies to which it may be entitled in
law or equity by reason of any such breach of this agreement by the
Corporation; nor shall the omission of SBAM to request such discontinuance in
any case in which it shall be so deemed a waiver of its right to require such
discontinuance at any time thereafter, for the same or any subsequent breach.
It is agreed that the damage to SBAM, or any affiliate thereof which has
"Salomon Brothers" in its name, through any failure of the Corporation after
demand to discontinue the use of the name of "Salomon Brothers" would be
irreparable and impossible of ascertainment in terms of money, and the
Corporation consents that in any such case an injunction may issue against it
restraining it from the further use of such name.


7. The Board of Directors of the Corporation may include officers and/or
directors of SBAM, Salomon Brothers Inc, Salomon Inc or any of their
affiliates and its officers may be, in whole or in part, officers and/or
directors of SBAM, Salomon Brothers Inc, Salomon Inc or any of their
affiliates. SBAM, Salomon Brothers Inc, Salomon Inc or any of their affiliates
may, nevertheless, deal freely with the Corporation as bankers or otherwise,
and no contract or transaction shall be invalidated or in any way affected by
those facts, even though the vote of director or directors or the action of
the officer or officers who are officers or directors of SBAM, Salomon
Brothers Inc, Salomon Inc or any of their affiliates shall have been necessary
to obligate the Corporation in such contract or transaction; and neither SBAM
nor Salomon Brothers Inc nor Salomon Inc nor any of their affiliates nor any
officer or director thereof shall be liable to the Corporation or to any
stockholder or creditor thereof or to any other person by reason of such
contract or transaction or for any loss resulting therefrom or for any profit
derived therefrom, provided that such contract or transaction shall, at the
time at which it was entered into, have been a reasonable one to have been
entered into and shall have been on terms that at that time were fair. Nothing
contained in this Article 7, however, shall validate, authorize or apply to
any act prohibited by the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or shall
protect any director or officer of the Corporation or any officer or director
of SBAM, Salomon Brothers Inc, Salomon Inc or any of their affiliates against
any liability to the Corporation or to its security holders to which he would
otherwise be subject by reason of wilful misfeasance, bad faith, gross
negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of his
office or under this agreement.


8. This agreement, unless sooner terminated as provided in this agreement,
shall remain in effect for twelve months from the date hereof and thereafter
shall continue automatically for a period of one year so long as such
continuance is specifically approved annually by the Board of Directors of the
Corporation or by vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of
the


B-4-3





Corporation and, in either case, by the vote of a majority of directors who
are not parties to this agreement or interested persons of any such party cast
in person at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on such approval;
provided, however, that this agreement may be terminated at any time, without
the payment of any penalty, by the Board of Directors of the Corporation or by
vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Corporation on
sixty days' written notice to SBAM or by SBAM on sixty days' written notice to
the Corporation.


9. The services of SBAM to the Corporation hereunder are not to be deemed
exclusive, and SBAM shall continue to be free to act as investment adviser to
others.


10. This agreement may be amended by mutual consent, but this agreement as
amended must be approved by the Board of Directors of the Corporation (by vote
including a majority of directors who are not parties to such agreement or
interested persons of any such party), or by vote of a majority of the
outstanding voting securities of the Corporation given at any meeting of the
stockholders, the notice of which shall have stated the proposed amendment to
be one of the objects of the meeting, and otherwise as may be required by the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, provided that the compensation
payable to SBAM pursuant to Article 5 hereof may not be increased except by a
vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Corporation.


11. This agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of any corporation or
association with which or into which the Corporation shall be consolidated or
merged or any corporation or association acquiring substantially all of the
assets of the Corporation.


12. This agreement shall terminate automatically in the event of its
assignment.


IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this agreement as of the
day and year first above written.


Very truly yours,

8. In consideration of the services to be rendered by the Investment Manager
under this agreement, the Fund shall pay the Investment Manager a monthly fee
in United States dollars on the first business day of each month for the
previous month at an annual rate of [0.70%]/1/7/ of the Fund's average
weekly net assets, commencing on the date hereof. If the fee payable to the
Investment Manager pursuant to this paragraph 8 begins to accrue before the
end of any month or if this agreement terminates before the end of any month,
the fee for the period from such date to the end of such month or from the
beginning of such month to the date of termination, as the case may be, shall
be prorated according to the proportion which such period bears to the full
month in which such effectiveness or termination occurs. For purposes of
calculating each such monthly fee, the value of the Fund's net assets shall be
computed at the time and in the manner specified in the Registration
Statement.


9. The Investment Manager shall exercise its best judgment in rendering the
services in accordance with the terms of this agreement. The Investment
Manager shall not be liable for any error of judgment or mistake of law or for
any act or omission or any loss suffered by the Fund in connection with the
matters to which this agreement relates, provided that nothing herein shall be
deemed to protect or purport to protect the Investment Manager against any
liability to the Fund or its shareholders to which the Investment Manager
would otherwise be subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith or
gross negligence on its part in the performance of its duties or from reckless
disregard by it of its obligations and duties under this agreement ("disabling
conduct"). The Fund will indemnify the Investment Manager against, and hold it
harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses
(including reasonable counsel fees and expenses), including any amounts paid
in satisfaction of judgments, in compromise or as fines or penalties, not
resulting from disabling conduct by the Investment Manager. Indemnification
shall be made only following: (i) a final decision on the merits by a court or
other body before whom the proceeding was brought that the Investment Manager
was not liable by reason of disabling conduct, or (ii) in the absence of such
a decision, a reasonable determination, based upon a review of the facts, that
the Investment Manager was not liable by reason of disabling conduct by (a)
the vote of a majority of a quorum of directors of the Fund who are neither
"interested persons" of the Fund nor parties to the proceeding ("disinterested
non-party directors"), or (b) an independent legal counsel in a written
opinion. The Investment Manager shall be entitled to advances from the Fund
for payment of the reasonable expenses incurred by it in connection with the
matter as to which it is seeking indemnification in the manner and to the
fullest extent permissible under law. The Investment Manager shall provide to
the Fund a written affirmation of its good faith belief that the standard of
conduct necessary for indemnification by the Fund has been met and a written
undertaking to repay any such advance if it should ultimately be determined
that the standard of conduct has not been met. In addition, at least one of
the following additional conditions shall be met: (a) the Investment Manager
shall provide security in form and amount acceptable to the Fund for its
undertaking; (b) the Fund is insured against losses arising by reason of the
advance; or (c) a majority of a quorum of disinterested non-party directors,
or independent legal counsel, in a written opinion, shall have determined,
based on a review of facts readily available to the Fund at the time the
advance is proposed to be made, that there is reason to believe that the
Investment Manager will ultimately be found to be entitled to indemnification.


10. This agreement shall continue in effect until      /1/8/ and thereafter
for successive annual periods, provided that such continuance is specifically
approved at least annually (a) by the vote of a majority of the Fund's
outstanding voting securities (as defined in the 1940 Act) or by the Fund's
Board of Directors and (b) by the vote, cast in person at a meeting called for

the Investment Manager, or any affiliate of the Investment Manager, or any
employee of the Investment Manager, to engage in any other business or to
devote time and attention to the management or other aspects of any other
business, whether of a similar or dissimilar nature, or to render services of
any kind to any other corporation, firm, individual or association. [Nothing

and authorized as an investment adviser under the [1940 Act]/1//8/, the
Investment Adviser agrees to maintain effective all requisite registrations,
authorizations and licenses, as the case may be, until the termination of this

Adviser shall not be liable for any error of judgment or mistake of law or for
any act or omission or any loss suffered by the Fund [or the Investment
Manager]/1/9/ in connection with the matters to which this agreement
relates, provided that nothing herein shall be deemed to protect or purport to
protect the Investment Adviser against any liability to the Fund or [the
Investment Manager]/2/0/ to which the Investment Adviser would otherwise be
subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence on its
part in the performance of its duties or from reckless disregard by it of its
obligations and duties under this agreement ("disabling conduct"). The Fund
will indemnify the Investment Adviser against, and hold it harmless from, any
and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses (including reasonable
counsel fees and expenses), including any amounts paid in satisfaction of
judgments, in compromise or as fines or penalties, not resulting from
disabling conduct by the Investment Adviser. Indemnification [pursuant to the
foregoing sentence]/2/1/ shall be made only following: (i) a final decision
on the merits by a court or other body before whom the proceeding was brought
that the Investment Adviser was not liable by reason of disabling conduct, or

(ii) in the absence of such a decision, a reasonable determination, based upon
a review of the facts, that the Investment Adviser was not liable by reason of
disabling conduct by (a) the vote of a majority of a quorum of directors of
the Fund who are neither "interested persons" of the Fund nor parties to the
proceeding ("disinterested non-party directors") or (b) an independent legal
counsel in a written opinion. The Investment Adviser shall be entitled to
advances from the Fund for payment of the reasonable expenses incurred by it
in connection with the matter as to which it is seeking indemnification in the
manner and to the fullest extent permissible under law. [Prior to any such
advance, the]/2/2/ Investment Adviser shall provide to the Fund a written
affirmation of its good faith belief that the standard of conduct necessary
for indemnification by the Fund has been met and a written undertaking to
repay any such advance if it should ultimately be determined that the standard
of conduct has not been met. In addition, at least one of the following
additional conditions shall be met: (a) the Investment Adviser shall provide
security in form and amount acceptable to the Fund for its undertaking; (b)
the Fund is insured against losses arising by reason of the advance; or (c) a
majority of a quorum of disinterested non-party directors, or independent
legal counsel, in a written opinion, shall have determined, based on a review
of facts readily available to the Fund at the time the advance is proposed to
be made, that there is reason to believe that the Investment Adviser will
ultimately be found to be entitled to indemnification.


11. This agreement shall continue in effect until          /2/3/ and
thereafter for successive annual periods, provided that such continuance is
specifically approved at least annually (a) by the vote of a majority of the
Fund's outstanding voting securities (as defined in the 1940 Act) or by the
Fund's Board of Directors and (b) by the vote, cast in person at a meeting
called for the purpose, of a majority of the Fund's directors who are not

contemplated by this agreement), including reasonable counsel fees and
expenses and any amounts paid in satisfaction of judgments, in compromise or
as fines or penalties, not resulting from disabling conduct by the Subadviser.
Indemnification shall be made only following: (i) a final decision on the
merits by a court or other body before whom the proceeding was brought that
the Subadviser was not liable by reason of disabling conduct, or (ii) in the
absence of such a decision, a reasonable determination, based upon a review of
the facts, that the Subadviser was not liable by reason of disabling conduct
by (a) the vote of a majority of a quorum of directors of the Company who are
neither "interested persons" of the Company nor parties to the proceeding
("disinterested non-party directors"), or (b) an independent legal counsel in
a written opinion. To the extent the Investment Manager receives the same from
the Fund, the Subadviser shall be entitled to advances from the Investment
Manager for payment of the reasonable expenses incurred by it in connection
with the matter as to which it is seeking indemnification in the manner and to
the fullest extent permissible under law. The Subadviser shall provide to the
Investment Manager, who in turn will provide to the Fund, a written
affirmation of the Subadviser's good faith belief that the standard of conduct
necessary for indemnification has been met and a written undertaking to repay
any such advance if it should ultimately be determined that the standard of
conduct has not been met. In addition, at least one of the following
additional conditions shall be met: (a) the Subadviser shall provide security
in form and amount acceptable to the Investment Manager for its undertaking;

(b) the Fund is insured against losses arising by reason of the advance; or

(c) a majority of a quorum of disinterested non-party directors, or
independent legal counsel, in a written opinion, shall have determined, based
on a review of facts readily available to the Fund at the time the advance is
proposed to be made, that there is reason to believe that the Subadviser will
ultimately be found to be entitled to indemnification.


E-2





7. In consideration of the services to be rendered by the Subadviser under
this agreement, the Investment Manager shall pay the Investment Adviser, in
respect of each quarter of its service, a lump sum fee in such amount as shall
be agreed between the parties hereto from time to time. Such agreement may be
recorded in an agreement substantially in the form of Attachment A hereto. The
quarterly fee referred to in the preceding sentence shall be paid by the
Investment Manager to the Subadviser in arrears. Any amount payable to the
Subadviser under this agreement shall be computed in U.S. dollars. The fee due
for any quarter during which this agreement remains in effect for less than a
full quarter will be determined on a pro rata basis.


8. This agreement shall continue in effect until two years from the date
hereof and thereafter for successive annual periods, provided that such
continuance is specifically approved at least annually (a) by the vote of a
majority of the Fund's outstanding voting securities (as defined in the 1940
Act) or by the Company's Board of Directors and (b) by the vote, cast in
person at a meeting called for the purpose, of a majority of the Company's
directors who are not parties to this agreement or "interested persons" (as
defined in the 1940 Act) of any such party. This agreement may be terminated
at any time, without the payment of any penalty, (i) by a vote of a majority
of the Fund's outstanding voting securities (as defined in the 1940 Act), (ii)
by a vote of a majority of the Company's entire Board of Directors on 60 days'
written notice to the Investment Manager and the Subadviser or (iii) by either
the Subadviser or the Investment Manager on 60 days' written notice to the
other party and the Company. This agreement shall terminate automatically in
the event of its assignment (as defined in the 1940 Act). Termination of this
agreement shall not relieve either the Investment Manager nor the Subadviser
from any liability or obligation in respect of any matters, undertakings or
conditions which shall not have been done, observed or performed prior to such
termination. The respective agreements, covenants, indemnities and other
statements set forth in Section 6 hereof shall remain in full force and effect
regardless of any termination or cancellation of this agreement. All property
of the Fund shall be returned to the Fund as soon as reasonably practicable
after the termination of this agreement.


9. Upon expiration or earlier termination of this agreement, the Company
shall, if reference to "Salomon Brothers" is made in the corporate name of the
Company or in the name of the Fund and if the Investment Manager requests in
writing, as promptly as practicable change its corporate name and the name of
the Fund so as to eliminate all reference to "Salomon Brothers", and
thereafter the Company and the Fund shall cease transacting business in any
corporate name using the words "Salomon Brothers" or any other reference to
the Investment Manager or "Salomon Brothers". The foregoing rights of the
Investment Manager and obligations of the Company shall not deprive the
Investment Manager, or any affiliate thereof which has "Salomon Brothers" in
its name, of, but shall be in addition to, any other rights or remedies to
which the Investment Manager and any such affiliate may be entitled in law or
equity by reason of any breach of this agreement by the Company, and the
failure or omission of the Investment Manager to request a change of the
Company's or the Fund's name or a cessation of the use of the name of "Salomon
Brothers" as described in this paragraph 10 shall not under any circumstances
be deemed a waiver of the right to require such change or cessation at any
time thereafter for the same or any subsequent breach.


10. Except to the extent necessary to perform the Investment Manager's
obligations under this agreement, nothing herein shall be deemed to limit or
restrict the right of the Investment Manager, or any affiliate of the
Investment Manager, or any employee of the Investment Manager, to engage in
any other business or to devote time and attention to the management or other
aspects of any other business, whether of a similar or dissimilar nature, or
to render services of any kind to any other corporation, firm, individual or
association.


E-3





11. Each of the parties hereto undertakes to notify the other of any material
change in any information supplied in, or pursuant to, this agreement within a
reasonable time after such change. The Subadviser undertakes (i) to notify the
Investment Manager of any change in its directors within a reasonable time
after such change and (ii) to provide, on demand, such financial and other
information relating to itself or its business as the Investment Manager may
from time to time reasonably require. The Investment Manager acknowledges that
the Subadviser may be required by law or the rules of any governmental or
other regulatory authority to disclose information relating to the Fund.


12. This agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York.


IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this agreement to be
executed by their officers designated below as of the date hereinabove
written.

Letter from the chairman
 

 
Dear
Shareholder,
 
Economic growth in the U.S. was mixed during the 12-month reporting
period ended July 31, 2008. Looking back, third quarter 2007 U.S. gross
domestic product (GDP)i growth was a very strong 4.8%. However,
continued weakness in the housing market, an ongoing credit crunch and soaring
oil and food prices then took their toll on the economy as fourth quarter 2007
GDP declined 0.2%. The economy then expanded 0.9% during the first quarter of
2008, and the preliminary estimate for second quarter GDP growth was 3.3%. In
recent months, the economy was supported by strong exports and consumer
spending, the latter of which was aided by the governments tax rebate checks.
 
While the economy may not fall into a recession, it is a moot point for
many Americans, as the job market continues to weaken and energy and food
prices remain elevated. In terms of the employment picture, the U.S. Department
of Labor reported that payroll employment declined in each of the first seven
months of 2008, and the unemployment rate rose to 5.7% in July, its highest
level since March 2004. After oil reached a record $147 a barrel on July 11,
2008, it fell to $123 as of July 31, 2008, which represented an
approximate 60% increase from the price as of July 31, 2007.
 
Ongoing issues related to the housing and subprime mortgage markets and
seizing credit markets prompted the Federal Reserve Board (Fed)ii to take aggressive and, in some cases, unprecedented actions.
Beginning in September 2007, the Fed reduced the federal funds rateiii from 5.25% to 4.75%. This marked the first such reduction since June 2003.
The Fed then reduced the federal funds rate on six additional occasions through
April 2008, bringing the federal funds rate to 2.00%. The Fed then shifted
gears in the face of mounting inflationary prices and a weakening U.S. dollar.
At its latest meetings that took place in June and August (after the
reporting period ended), the Fed held rates steady. In conjunction with its August meeting,
the Fed stated: Economic activity expanded in the second quarter, partly
reflecting growth in consumer spending and exports. However, labor markets have
softened further and financial markets remain under considerable stress. 
Inflation has been high, spurred by the earlier

Letter from the chairman continued
 
increases in the prices of energy and some other commodities, and some
indicators of inflation expectations have been elevated. The Committee expects
inflation to moderate later this year and next year, but the inflation outlook
remains highly uncertain.
 
In
addition to the interest rate cuts, the Fed took several actions to improve
liquidity in the credit markets. In March 2008, the Fed established a new
lending program allowing certain brokerage firms, known as primary dealers, to
also borrow from its discount window. The Fed also increased the maximum term
for discount window loans from 30 to 90 days. Then, in mid- March, the Fed
played a major role in facilitating the purchase of Bear Stearns by JPMorgan
Chase.
 
During the 12-month reporting period ended July 31, 2008, both
short- and long-term Treasury yields experienced periods of extreme volatility.
Investors were initially focused on the subprime segment of the mortgage-
backed market. These concerns broadened, however, to include a wide range of
financial institutions and markets. As a result, other fixed-income instruments
also experienced increased price volatility. This turmoil triggered several
flights to quality, causing Treasury yields to move lower (and their prices
higher), while riskier segments of the market saw their yields move higher (and
their prices lower). Treasury yields then rose in April, May and early June 2008,
as oil prices hit record levels. However, an additional credit crunch in mid-June resulted
in another flight to quality, with Treasury yields again moving lower. Overall,
during the 12 months ended July 31, 2008, two-year Treasury yields fell
from 4.56% to 2.52%. Over the same time frame, 10-year Treasury yields moved
from 4.78% to 3.99%. Looking at the 12-month period as a whole, the overall
bond market, as measured by the Lehman Brothers U.S. Aggregate Indexiv, returned 6.15%.
 
Periods of increased investor risk aversion caused the high-yield bond
market to produce weak results over the 12 months ended July 31, 2008.
During that period, the Citigroup High Yield Market Indexv returned -0.50%. While high-yield bond prices rallied on several
occasions, it was not enough to overcome several flights to quality that served
to drag down the sector.
 
Despite periods of increased investor risk aversion, the emerging debt
markets posted a positive return over the 12 months ended July 31, 2008.
During that period, the JPMorgan Emerging Markets Bond Index Global (EMBI
Global)vi returned 7.23%. Overall solid demand,
an expanding global economy, increased domestic spending and the Feds numerous
rate cuts supported the emerging market debt asset class.
 
Please read on for a more detailed look at prevailing economic and
market conditions during the Funds reporting period and to learn how those
conditions have affected Fund performance.

Fund overview
 
Q. What is the Funds investment
strategy?
 
A. The Funds investment objective is to manage a portfolio of
fixed-income securities so as to return $10 per share (the initial public
offering price per share) to investors on or about November 30, 2008,
while providing high monthly income.
 
Western Asset Management Company (Western Asset), the Funds
subadviser, utilizes a fixed-income team approach, with decisions derived from
interaction among various investment management sector specialists. The sector
teams are comprised of Western Assets senior portfolio managers, research
analysts and an in-house economist. Under this team approach, management of
client fixed-income portfolios will reflect a consensus of interdisciplinary
views within the Western Asset organization.
 
Q. What were the overall market
conditions during the Funds reporting period?
 
A. During the fiscal year, the U.S. bond market experienced periods of increased
volatility. Changing perceptions regarding the economy, inflation and future
Federal Reserve Board (Fed)i monetary policy caused bond prices to
fluctuate. Two- and 10-year Treasury yields began the reporting period at 4.56%
and 4.78%, respectively. Treasury yields then moved lower and their prices
moved higheras concerns regarding the subprime mortgage market and a severe
credit crunch triggered a massive flight to quality. Investors were drawn to
the relative safety of Treasuries, while increased investor risk aversion
caused other segments of the bond market to falter.
 
As conditions in the credit market worsened in August 2007,
central banks around the world took action by injecting approximately $500
billion of liquidity into the financial system. Additionally, the Fed began
lowering the federal funds rateii in
September 2007. While this initially helped ease the credit crunch,
continued subprime mortgage write-offs and weak economic data triggered
additional flights to quality in November 2007 and the first quarter of
2008.
 
Treasury
yields then moved higher in April, May and early June, as inflationary
pressures increased. Over this period, riskier fixed-income asset classes, such
as high-yield bonds and emerging market debt rallied. However, the credit
crunch resumed in mid-June 2008, resulting in another flight to quality,
with Treasury yields moving lower. Yields were then relatively stable in July.

Fund overview continued
 
As of July 31, 2008, two- and 10-year Treasury yields were 2.52%
and 3.99%, respectively. While the Fed attempted to stimulate growth by cutting
short- term interest rates from 5.25% to 2.00% from September 2007 through
April 2008, it held rates steady at its meetings in June and August.
 
Q. How did we respond to these
changing market conditions?
 
A. Market conditions were challenging in the 12-month reporting period, which
affected the Funds performance. Many asset prices remained well below, what we
believe to be, their fundamental values as a result of market fears, and we
underestimated the degree to which the entire financial superstructure would
decline. Despite the difficult market environment, we believed that our focus
on spread sectors, such as emerging markets, agency pass-through mortgages and
corporate bonds was still valid.
 
Performance review
 
For the 12 months ended July 31, 2008, Western Asset 2008
Worldwide Dollar Government Term Trust Inc. returned 4.87% based on its net
asset value (NAV)iii and 5.63% based on its New York Stock
Exchange (NYSE) market price per share. The Funds unmanaged benchmark, the
JPMorgan Emerging Markets Bond Index Global (EMBI Global)iv,
returned 7.23% for the same period. The Lipper Global Income Closed-End Funds
Category Averagev returned 3.64% over the same time
frame. Please note that Lipper performance returns are based on each funds
NAV.
 
During this 12-month period, the Fund made distributions to
shareholders totaling $0.76 per share. The performance table shows the Funds
12-month total return based on its NAV and market price as of July 31,
2008. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Q. What were the leading
contributors to performance?
 
A. The Funds allocation to agency mortgage-backed securities contributed to
performance. Issue selection of emerging market debt also contributed to
performance as certain issues, such as Polish and Russian U.S. dollar-
denominated sovereign debt, performed better than the benchmark.
 
Q. What were the leading detractors
from performance?
 
A. Market volatility over the reporting period increased sharply as the subprime
mortgage market fallout persisted. The Funds use of derivatives, which were
employed to hedge durationvi and yield curvevii exposure,
detracted from performance. The Funds exposure to investment grade credit
detracted from performance as spreads widened. Relative to the benchmark, the
Funds underweight to emerging market debt also detracted from performance.
During the fiscal year, the emerging market sector performed well due to strong
local economic fundamentals and country ratings upgrades.
 
Q. Were there any significant
changes to the Fund during the reporting period?
 
A. In anticipation of the Funds liquidation on or about November 30,
2008, we reduced its exposure to both the emerging market debt and mortgage
sectors. We slowly increased its allocation to cash and decreased the overall
portfolio duration.

RISKS: An investment in the Fund is subject to risks, including the
possible loss of the entire principal amount that you invest. Your shares, at
any point, may be worth less than what you invested, even after taking into
account the reinvestment of Fund dividends and distributions. The Fund may
invest in foreign securities that are subject to certain risks of overseas
investing, including currency fluctuations and changes in political and
economic conditions, which could result in significant market fluctuations.
These risks are magnified in emerging or developing markets. The Fund also may
invest in derivatives, such as options and futures, which can be illiquid and
harder to value, especially in declining markets. A small investment in certain
derivatives potentially may have a large impact on the Funds performance.

  Asset 2008 Worldwide Dollar Government Term Trust Inc. 2008 Annual Report



 




 
Notes to financial statements
 
1. Organization and significant
accounting policies
 
Western
Asset 2008 Worldwide Dollar Government Term Trust Inc. (the Fund) was
incorporated in Maryland on May 24, 1993 and is registered as a
non-diversified, closed-end management investment company under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended, (the 1940 Act). The investment objective of
the Fund is to manage a portfolio of fixed income securities so as to return
$10 per share to investors on or about November 30, 2008 while providing
high monthly income. No assurance can be given that the Funds investment
objective will be achieved.
 
In accordance with the Funds charter documents and approval by its
Board of Directors, the Fund intends to liquidate on or about November 30,
2008. Accounting rules require that financial statements for entities in
liquidation, or for which liquidation appears imminent, be prepared on a
liquidation basis of accounting. As U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles (GAAP) for investment companies are materially consistent with the
liquidation basis of accounting, the financial statements have been prepared in
conformity with GAAP for investment companies.
 
The
Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing substantially all
(at least 90%) of its assets, under normal conditions, in securities issued or
guaranteed by the U.S. government, its agencies or instrumentalities,
securities issued or guaranteed by foreign governments (sovereign bonds) and
collateralized in full as to principal due at their maturity by U.S. government
securities and zero-coupon obligations of municipal issuers. The market prices
of the securities in which the Fund invests are expected to fluctuate with changes
in interest rates and the perceived credit quality of such assets. The Funds
investments in sovereign bonds may be affected by political, social, economic
or diplomatic changes in such countries and the Funds investment in such
securities increases the risk that the Fund will return less than $10 per share
in the year 2008. In addition, the Funds investment in mortgage-backed
securities is subject to the risk that rapid principal repayment, including
prepayment, may have an adverse effect on the yield to maturity of such
securities.
 
The following are significant accounting policies consistently followed
by the Fund and are in conformity with GAAP. Estimates and assumptions are
required to be made regarding assets, liabilities and changes in net assets
resulting from operations when financial statements are prepared. Changes in
the economic environment, financial markets and any other parameters used in
determining these estimates could cause actual results to differ.
 
(a) Investment valuation. Debt securities are valued at the mean
between the bid and asked prices
provided by an independent pricing service that are based on transactions in
debt obligations, quotations from bond dealers, market transactions in
comparable securities and various other relationships between securities.
Equity securities for which market quotations are available are valued at the
last sale price or official closing price on the primary market or
 



Western Asset 2008 Worldwide Dollar Government Term
  Trust Inc. 2008 Annual Report  


13



 




 
Notes to financial statements continued
 
exchange on which they trade. Publicly traded foreign government debt
securities are typically traded internationally in the over-the-counter market,
and are valued at the mean between the bid and asked prices as of the close of
business of that market. When prices are not readily available, or are
determined not to reflect fair value, such as when the value of a security has
been significantly affected by events after the close of the exchange or market
on which the security is principally traded, but before the Fund calculates its
net asset value, the Fund may value these investments at fair value as
determined in accordance with the procedures approved by the Funds Board of
Directors. Short-term obligations with maturities of 60 days or less are valued
at amortized cost, which approximates fair value.
 
(b) Repurchase agreements. When entering into repurchase agreements, it
is the Funds policy that its
custodian or a third party custodian take possession of the underlying
collateral securities, the market value of which, at all times, at least equals
the principal amount of the repurchase transaction, including accrued interest.
To the extent that any repurchase transaction exceeds one business day, the
value of the collateral is marked-to-market to ensure the adequacy of the
collateral. If the seller defaults, and the market value of the collateral
declines or if bankruptcy proceedings are commenced with respect to the seller
of the security, realization of the collateral by the Fund may be delayed or
limited.
 
(c) Financial
futures contracts. The
Fund may enter into financial futures contracts
typically to hedge a portion of the portfolio. Upon entering into a financial
futures contract, the Fund is required to deposit cash or securities as initial
margin, equal in value to a certain percentage of the contract amount (initial
margin deposit). Additional securities are also segregated up to the current
market value of the financial futures contracts. Subsequent payments, known as
variation margin, are made or received by the Fund each day, depending on the
daily fluctuations in the value of the underlying financial instruments. For
foreign currency denominated futures contracts, variation margins are not
settled daily. The Fund recognizes an unrealized gain or loss equal to the
fluctuation in the value. When the financial futures contracts are closed, a
realized gain or loss is recognized equal to the difference between the
proceeds from (or cost of) the closing transactions and the Funds basis in the
contracts.
 
The
risks associated with entering into financial futures contracts include the
possibility that a change in the value of the contract may not correlate with
the changes in the value of the underlying financial instruments. In addition,
investing in financial futures contracts involves the risk that the Fund could
lose more than the initial margin deposit and subsequent payments required for
a futures transaction. Risks may also arise upon entering into these contracts
from the potential inability of the counterparties to meet the terms of their
contracts.

  Western
  Asset 2008 Worldwide Dollar Government Term Trust Inc. 2008 Annual Report



 




 
(d) Securities
traded on a to-be-announced basis. The Fund may trade securities
on a to-be-announced (TBA) basis. In a TBA transaction, the Fund commits to
purchasing or selling securities which have not yet been issued by the issuer
and for which specific information is not known, such as the face amount and
maturity date and the underlying pool of investments in U.S. government agency
mortgage pass-through securities. Securities purchased on a TBA basis are not settled
until they are delivered to the Fund, normally 15 to 45 days after purchase.
Beginning on the date the Fund enters into a TBA transaction, cash, U.S.
government securities or other liquid high-grade debt obligations are
segregated in an amount equal in value to the purchase price of the TBA
security. These securities are subject to market fluctuations and their current
value is determined in the same manner as for other securities.
 
(e) Stripped
securities. The Fund
invests in Stripped Securities, a term used
collectively for stripped fixed income securities. Stripped
securities can be principal only securities (PO), which are debt obligations
that have been stripped of unmatured interest coupons, or interest only
securities (IO), which are unmatured interest coupons that have been stripped
from debt obligations. As is the case with all securities, the market value of
Stripped Securities will fluctuate in response to changes in economic
conditions, interest rates and the markets perception of the securities.
However, fluctuations in response to interest rates may be greater in Stripped
Securities than for debt obligations of comparable maturities that pay interest
currently. The amount of fluctuation increases with a longer period of
maturity.
 
The yield to maturity on IOs is sensitive to the rate of principal
repayments (including prepayments) on the related underlying debt obligation
and principal payments may have a material effect on yield to maturity. If the
underlying debt obligation experiences greater than anticipated prepayments of
principal, the Fund may not fully recoup its initial investment in IOs.
 
(f) Written options. When the Fund writes an option, an amount
equal to the premium received by
the Fund is recorded as a liability, the value of which is marked-to-market
daily to reflect the current market value of the option written. If the option
expires, the Fund realizes a gain from investments equal to the amount of the
premium received. When a written call option is exercised, the difference
between the premium received plus the option exercise price and the Funds
basis in the underlying security (in the case of a covered written call
option), or the cost to purchase the underlying security (in the case of an
uncovered written call option), including brokerage commission, is treated as a
realized gain or loss. When a written put option is exercised, the amount of
the premium received is added to the cost of the security purchased by the Fund
from the exercise of the written put option to form the Funds basis in the
underlying security purchased. The writer or buyer of an option traded on an
exchange can liquidate the position before the exercise of the option by
entering into a closing transaction. The cost of a closing transaction is
deducted from the original premium received resulting in a realized gain or
loss to the Fund.
 



Western Asset 2008 Worldwide Dollar Government Term
  Trust Inc. 2008 Annual Report

Notes to financial statements continued
 
The risk in writing a covered
call option is that the Fund may forego the opportunity of profit if the market
price of the underlying security increases and the option is exercised. The
risk in writing a put option is that the Fund may incur a loss if the market
price of the underlying security decreases and the option is exercised. The
risk in writing a call option is that the Fund is exposed to the risk of loss
if the market price of the underlying security increases. In addition, there is
the risk that the Fund may not be able to enter into a closing transaction
because of an illiquid secondary market.
 
(g) Mortgage dollar rolls. The Fund may enter into dollar rolls in which
the Fund sells mortgage-backed
securities for delivery in the current month, realizing a gain or loss, and
simultaneously contracts to repurchase substantially similar (same type, coupon
and maturity) securities to settle on a specified future date. During the roll
period, the Fund forgoes interest paid on the securities. The Fund is
compensated by the interest earned on the cash proceeds of the initial sale and
by the lower repurchase price at the specified future date. The Fund maintains
a segregated account, the dollar value of which is at least equal to its
obligations with respect to dollar rolls.
 
The
Fund executes its mortgage dollar rolls entirely in the TBA market, where the
Fund makes a forward commitment to purchase a security and, instead of
accepting delivery, the position is offset by a sale of the security with a
simultaneous agreement to repurchase at a future date.
 
The
risk of entering into a mortgage dollar roll is that the market value of the
securities the Fund is obligated to repurchase under the agreement may decline
below the repurchase price. In the event the buyer of securities under a
mortgage dollar roll files for bankruptcy or becomes insolvent, the Funds use
of proceeds of the dollar roll may be restricted pending a determination by the
other party, or its trustee or receiver, whether to enforce the Funds
obligation to repurchase the securities.
 
(h) Credit default swaps. The Fund may enter into credit default swap (CDS) contracts for investment purposes, to
manage its credit risk or to add leverage. CDS agreements involve one party
making a stream of payments to another party in exchange for the right to
receive a specified return in the event of a default by a third party,
typically corporate issuers or sovereign issuers of an emerging country, on a
specified obligation. The Fund may use a CDS to provide a measure of protection
against defaults of the issuers (i.e., to reduce risk where a Fund has exposure
to the sovereign issuer) or to take an active long or short position with
respect to the likelihood of a particular issuers default. As a seller of
protection, the Fund generally receives an upfront payment or a fixed rate of
income throughout the term of the swap provided that there is no credit event.
If the Fund is a seller of protection and a credit event occurs, as defined
under the terms of that particular swap agreement, the Fund will pay to the
buyer of the protection an amount up to the notional value of the swap, and in
certain instances take delivery of the security. As the seller, the Fund would
effectively add leverage to its portfolio because, in addition to its total net
assets, the Fund would be subject to investment exposure on the notional amount
of the swap. As a buyer of protection, the Fund generally receives an amount up
to the notional value of the swap if a credit event occurs.

Payments
received or made at the beginning of the measurement period are reflected as
such on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. These upfront payments are
recorded as realized gain or loss on the Statement of Operations and are
amortized over the life of the swap. A liquidation payment received or made at
the termination of the swap is recorded as realized gain or loss on the
Statement of Operations.
 
Entering
into a CDS swaps involves, to varying degrees, elements of credit, market and
documentation risk in excess of the related amounts recognized on the Statement
of Assets and Liabilities. Such risks involve the possibility that there will
be no liquid market for these agreements, that the counterparty to the
agreements may default on its obligation to perform or disagree as to the
meaning of the contractual terms in the agreement and that there will be
unfavorable changes in net interest rates.
 
(i) Swaptions. The Fund may write swaption contracts to manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and to
enhance portfolio yield. Swaption contracts written by the Fund represent an
option that gives the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to enter
into a previously agreed upon swap contract on a future date. If a written call
swaption is exercised, the writer enters a swap and is obligated to pay the
fixed rate and receive a floating rate in exchange. If a written put swaption
is exercised, the writer enters a swap and is obligated to pay the floating
rate and receive a fixed rate in exchange. Swaptions are marked-to-market daily
based upon quotations from market makers.
 
When
the Fund writes a swaption, an amount equal to the premium received by the Fund
is recorded as a liability, the value of which is marked-to-market daily to
reflect the current market value of the swaption written. Changes in the value
of the swaption are reported as unrealized gains or losses in the Statements of
Operations. If the swaption expires, the Fund realizes a gain equal to the
amount of the premium received. When a written swaption is exercised, the
premium received is added to the basis of the swap agreement entered.
 
Entering
into a swaption contract involves, to varying degrees, the elements of credit,
market and interest rate risk associated with both option contracts and swap
contracts. To reduce credit risk from potential counterparty default, the Fund
enters into swaption contracts with counterparties whose creditworthiness has
been evaluated by the Investment Manager. The Fund bears the market risk
arising from any change in index values or interest rates.
 
(j) Credit and market risk. The Fund invests in high yield and emerging
market instruments that are
subject to certain credit and market risks. The yields of high yield and
emerging market debt obligations reflect, among other things, perceived credit
and market risks. The Funds investment in securities rated below investment
grade typically involves risks not associated with higher rated securities
including, among others, greater risk related to timely and ultimate payment of
interest and principal, greater market price volatility and less liquid
secondary market trading. The consequences of political, social, economic or

Notes to financial statements continued
 
diplomatic
changes may have disruptive effects on the market prices of investments held by
the Fund. The Funds investment in non-dollar denominated securities may also
result in foreign currency losses caused by devaluations and exchange rate
fluctuations.
 
Investments
in securities (such as those issued by Structured Investment Vehicles, or SIVs)
which are collateralized by residential real estate mortgages are subject to
certain credit and liquidity risks. When market conditions result in an
increase in default rates of the underlying mortgages and the foreclosure
values of underlying real estate properties are materially below the
outstanding amount of these underlying mortgages, collection of the full amount
of accrued interest and principal on these investments may be doubtful. Such
market conditions may significantly impair the value of these investments
resulting in a lack of correlation between their credit ratings and values.
 
(k) Other risks. Consistent with its objective to seek high
current income, the Fund may
invest in instruments whose values and interest rates are linked to foreign
currencies, interest rates, indices or some other financial indicator. The
value at maturity or interest rates for these instruments will increase or
decrease according to the change in the indicator to which they are indexed.
These securities are generally more volatile in nature, and the risk of loss of
principal is greater.
 
(l) Security transactions and investment income. Security transactions are accounted for on a trade date basis.
Interest income, adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of
discount, is recorded on the accrual basis. Dividend income is recorded on the
ex-dividend date. The cost of investments sold is determined by use of the
specific identification method. To the extent any issuer defaults on an
expected interest payment, the Funds policy is to generally halt any
additional interest income accruals and consider the realizability of interest
accrued up to the date of default.
 
(m) Distributions to shareholders. Distributions from net investment income for the Fund, if any, are declared and
paid on a monthly basis. Distributions of net realized gains, if any, are
declared at least annually. Distributions are recorded on the ex-dividend date
and are determined in accordance with income tax regulations, which may differ
from GAAP.
 
(n) Federal and other taxes. It is the Funds policy to comply with the
federal income and excise tax
requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, applicable to
regulated investment companies. Accordingly, the Fund intends to distribute
substantially all of its taxable income and net realized gains, if any, to
shareholders each year. Therefore, no federal income tax provision is required
in the Funds financial statements.
 
Management
has analyzed the Funds tax positions taken on federal income tax returns for
all open tax years and has concluded that as of July 31, 2008, no
provision for income tax would be required in the Funds financial statements.

  Asset 2008 Worldwide Dollar Government Term Trust Inc. 2008 Annual Report



 




 
The
Funds federal and state income and federal excise tax returns for tax years
for which the applicable statutes of limitations have not expired are subject
to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and state departments of
revenue.
 
(o) Reclassification. GAAP requires that certain components of net
assets be adjusted to reflect
permanent differences between financial and tax reporting. These
reclassifications have no effect on net assets or net asset values per share.
During the current year, the following reclassifications have been made:
 



 


Undistributed net


Accumulated net


 




 


investment income


realized gain


 




(a)


$545,284


$(545,284)


 



 



(a)


Reclassifications
  are primarily due to differences between book and tax amortization of premium
  on fixed income securities, income from mortgage backed securities treated as
  capital gains for tax purposes and book/tax differences in the treatment of
  swap contracts.



 
2.
Investment management agreement and other transactions with affiliates
 
Legg
Mason Partners Fund Advisor, LLC (LMPFA) is the Funds investment manager and
Western Asset Management Company (Western Asset) is the Funds subadviser.

(Legg Mason).
 
LMPFA
provides administrative and certain oversight services to the the Fund. The
Fund pays LMPFA an investment management fee payable monthly and calculated at
an aggregate annual rate of 0.75% of the Funds average weekly net assets up to
$250 million and 0.725% of the Funds average weekly net assets in excess of
$250 million.
 
LMPFA
has delegated to Western Asset the day-to-day portfolio management of the Fund.
For its services, LMPFA pays Western Asset 70% of the net management fee it

was as follows:
 



 


 


2008


 


2007


 




Distributions paid from:

  difference between book-basis and tax-basis unrealized
  appreciation/(depreciation) is attributable primarily to the difference
  between book and tax amortization methods for premiums on fixed income
  securities.



 
6. Recent accounting
pronouncement
 
On
September 20, 2006, the Financial Accounting Standard Board (FASB)
released Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurements(FAS 157). FAS 157 establishes an
authoritative definition of fair value,
sets out a framework for measuring fair value, and requires additional
disclosures about fair value measurements. The application of FAS 157 is
required for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and interim
periods within those fiscal years. Management has determined that there is no
material impact to the Funds valuation policies as a result of adopting FAS
157. The Fund will implement the disclosure requirements beginning with its October 31,
2008 Form N-Q.
 
7. Subsequent event
 
On
September 7, 2008, the Federal Housing Finance Agency placed Fannie Mae
and Freddie Mac into conservatorship. As of its fiscal year end, the Fund had a
significant percentage of its portfolio invested in mortgage-backed and other
securities issued by these entities. The value of the Funds holdings in
securities issued by these entities has not been adversely impacted. As of September 25,
2008, the Funds net asset value was $10.20 per share.

Report
of independent registered public accounting firm
 
The Board of Directors and Shareholders
Western Asset 2008 Worldwide Dollar
Government Term Trust Inc.:
 
We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities,
including the schedule of investments, of Western Asset 2008 Worldwide Dollar
Government Term Trust Inc., as of July 31, 2008, and the related statement
of operations for the year then ended, the statements of changes in net assets
for each of the years in the two-year period then ended and the financial
highlights for each of the years in the four-year period then ended. These
financial statements and financial highlights are the responsibility of the
Funds management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and financial highlights based on our audits. The financial
highlights for the year ended July 31, 2004 were audited by other
independent registered public accountants whose report thereon, dated September 22,
2004, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial highlights.
 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements and financial highlights are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our procedures
included confirmation of securities owned as of July 31, 2008, by
correspondence with the custodian. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Western Asset 2008 Worldwide Dollar Government Term Trust Inc. as
of July 31, 2008, and the results of its operations for the year then
ended, the changes in its net assets for each of the years in the two-year
period then ended, and the financial highlights for each of the years in the
four-year period then ended, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles.
 
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on the going-
concern basis of accounting, which, for this Fund, is substantially the same as
liquidating basis. As more fully described in Note 1 of the Notes to the
Financial Statements, on or about November 30, 2008 the Fund will
liquidate under a plan of liquidation. As a result of the liquidation, proceeds
will be paid to the Funds shareholders on that date.

Dividend reinvestment plan
(unaudited)
 
Pursuant
to certain rules of the SEC, the following additional disclosure is
provided.
 
Pursuant
to the Funds Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the Plan), stockholders may elect
to have all distributions, including returns of capital, if any, automatically
reinvested by American Stock Transfer & Trust Company (the Plan
Agent) in Fund shares pursuant to the Plan. Each registered stockholder will
receive from the Fund, as soon as practicable, an authorization card to be
signed and returned if the stockholder elects to participate in the Plan.
Stockholders who do not participate in the Plan will receive all distributions
in cash paid by check in dollars mailed directly to the stockholder by the
custodian, as dividend disbursing agent. In the case of stockholders, such as
banks, brokers or nominees, that hold shares for others who are the beneficial
owners, the Plan Agent will administer the Plan on the basis of the number of
shares certified from time to time by the stockholders as representing the
total amount registered in such stockholders names and held for the account of
beneficial owners who are participants in the Plan. Investors that own shares
registered in the name of a bank, broker-dealer or other nominee should consult
with such nominee as to the participation in the Plan through such nominee, and
may be required to have their shares registered in their own names in order to
participate in the Plan.
 
The
Plan Agent serves as agent for the stockholders in administering the Plan.
After the Fund declares a distribution, the Plan Agent will, as agent for the
participants, receive the cash payment and use it to buy Fund shares in the
open market, on the New York Stock Exchange or elsewhere, for the participants
accounts. The Fund will not issue any new shares in connection with the Plan.
 
The
Plan Agent maintains all stockholder accounts in the Plan and furnishes written
confirmations of all transactions in an account, including information needed
by stockholders for personal and tax records. Shares in the account of each
Plan participant will be held by the Plan Agent in the name of the participant,
and each stockholders proxy will include those shares purchased pursuant to
the Plan.
 
There
is no charge to participants for reinvesting distributions. The Plan Agents
fees for the reinvestment of distributions will be paid by the Fund. However,
each participant will pay a pro rata share of brokerage commissions incurred
with respect to the Plan Agents open market purchases in connection with the
reinvestment of distributions. Brokerage charges for purchasing small amounts
of stock for individual accounts through the Plan are expected to be less than
the usual brokerage charges for such transactions because the Plan Agent will
be purchasing stock for all participants in blocks and prorating the lower
commission thus attainable.
 
The
reinvestment of distributions under the Plan will not relieve participants of
any federal income tax that may be payable on such distributions.

Western
  Asset 2008 Worldwide Dollar Government Term Trust Inc.







 
Experience
under the Plan may indicate that changes are desirable. Accordingly, the Fund
and the Plan Agent reserve the right to terminate the Plan as applied to any
distribution paid subsequent to written notice of the termination sent to
members of the Plan at least 30 days before the record date for such
distribution. The Plan also may be amended by the Fund or the Plan Agent, but (except
when necessary or appropriate to comply with applicable law, rules or
policies of a regulatory authority) only by at least 30 days written notice to
participants in the Plan. All correspondence concerning the Plan should be
directed to the Plan Agent at 59 Maiden Lane, New York New York 10038.

ITEM 2.                                                  CODE OF ETHICS.
 
The
registrant has adopted a code of ethics that applies to the registrants
principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting
officer or controller.
 
ITEM 3.  AUDIT COMMITTEE
FINANCIAL EXPERT.
 
The Board of Directors of the registrant has
determined that William R. Hutchinson, a member of the Boards Audit Committee,
possesses the technical attributes identified in Instruction 2(b) of Item
3 to Form N-CSR to qualify as an audit committee financial expert, and
has designated Mr. Hutchinson as the Audit Committees financial expert. Mr. Hutchinson
is an independent Director pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of Item 3 to Form N-CSR.
 
Item 4.  Principal Accountant Fees and Services
 
a) Audit Fees. The
aggregate fees billed in the last two fiscal years ending July 31, 2007
and July 31, 2008 (the Reporting Periods) for professional services
rendered by the Registrants principal accountant (the Auditor) for the audit
of the Registrants annual financial statements, or services that are normally
provided by the Auditor in connection with the statutory and regulatory filings
or engagements for the Reporting Periods, were $56,000 in 2007 and $56,000 in
2008.
 
b) Audit-Related Fees.
There were no fees billed in the Reporting Periods for assurance and related
services by the Auditor that are reasonably related to the performance of the
audit of the Registrants financial statements and are not reported under
paragraph (a) this Item 4.
 
In addition, there were no Audit-Related
Fees billed in the Reporting Period for assurance and related services by the
Auditor to the Registrants investment adviser (not including any sub-adviser
whose role is primarily portfolio management and is subcontracted with or
overseen by another investment adviser), and any entity controlling, controlled
by or under common control with the investment adviser that provides ongoing
services to the Western
Asset 2008 Worldwide Dollar Government Term Trust Inc. (service
affiliates), that were reasonably related to the performance of the annual
audit of the service affiliates. Accordingly, there were no such fees that
required pre-approval by the Audit Committee for the Reporting Periods (prior
to July 6, 2003 services provided by the Auditor were not required to be
pre-approved).
 
(c) Tax Fees. The aggregate fees billed in
the Reporting Periods for professional services rendered by the Auditor for tax
compliance, tax advice and tax planning (Tax Services) were $5,150 in 2007
and $2,650 in 2008. These services consisted of (i) review or preparation
of U.S. federal, state, local and excise tax returns; (ii) U.S. federal,
state and local tax planning, advice and assistance regarding statutory,
regulatory or administrative developments, and (iii) tax advice regarding
tax qualification matters and/or treatment of various financial instruments
held or proposed to be acquired or held.
 
There were no fees billed
for tax services by the Auditors to service affiliates during the Reporting
Periods that required pre-approval by the Audit Committee.
 
d) All Other Fees.
There were no other fees billed in the Reporting Periods for products and
services provided by the Auditor, other than the services reported in
paragraphs (a) through (c) of this Item for the Western Asset 2008
Worldwide Dollar Government Term Trust Inc..
 
All Other Fees. There
were no other non-audit services rendered by the Auditor to Legg Mason Partners
Fund Advisor, LLC (LMPFA) and any entity controlling, controlled by or under
common control with LMPFA that provided ongoing services to Western Asset 2008
Worldwide Dollar Government Term Trust Inc. requiring pre-approval by the Audit
Committee in the Reporting Period.
 
(e) Audit Committees
preapproval policies and procedures described in paragraph  (c) (7) of Rule 2-01 of
Regulation S-X.
 





 
(1) The Charter for
the Audit Committee (the Committee) of the Board of each registered
investment company (the Fund) advised by LMPFA or one of their affiliates
(each, an Adviser) requires that the Committee shall approve (a) all
audit and permissible non-audit services to be provided to the Fund and (b) all
permissible non-audit services to be provided by the Funds independent
auditors to the Adviser and any Covered Service Providers if the engagement
relates directly to the operations and financial reporting of the Fund.  The Committee duly implements policies and
procedures by which such services are approved other than by the full
Committee.
 
The Committee
shall not approve non-audit services that the Committee believes duly impairs
the independence of the auditors.  As of
the date of the approval of this Audit Committee Charter, permissible non-audit
services include any professional services (including tax services), that are
not prohibited services as described below, provided to the Fund by the
independent auditors, other than those provided to the Fund in connection with
an audit or a review of the financial statements of the Fund.  Permissible non-audit services July not
include: (i) bookkeeping or other services related to the accounting
records or financial statements of the Fund; (ii) financial information
systems design and implementation; (iii) appraisal or valuation services,
fairness opinions or contribution-in-kind reports; (iv) actuarial
services; (v) internal audit outsourcing services; (vi) management
functions or human resources; (vii) broker or dealer, investment adviser
or investment banking services; (viii) legal services and expert services
unrelated to the audit; and (ix) any other service the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board determines, by regulation, is impermissible.
 
Pre-approval by
the Committee of any permissible non-audit services is not required so long as:
(i) the aggregate amount of all such permissible non-audit services
provided to the Fund, the Adviser and any service providers controlling,
controlled by or under common control with the Adviser that provide ongoing
services to the Fund (Covered Service Providers) constitutes not more than 5%
of the total amount of revenues paid to the independent auditors during the
fiscal year in which the permissible non-audit services are provided to (a) the
Fund, (b) the Adviser and (c) any entity controlling, controlled by
or under common control with the Adviser that provides ongoing services to the
Fund during the fiscal year in which the services are provided that would have
to be approved by the Committee; (ii) the permissible non-audit services
were not recognized by the Fund at the time of the engagement to be non-audit
services; and (iii) such services are promptly brought to the attention of
the Committee and approved by the Committee (or its delegate(s)) prior to the
completion of the audit.
 
(2) For the
Western Asset 2008 Worldwide Dollar Government Term Trust Inc. the percentage
of fees that were approved by the audit committee, with respect to:
Audit-Related Fees were 100% and 0% for 2007 and 2008; Tax Fees were 100% and
0% for 2007 and 2008; and Other Fees were 100% and 0% for 2007 and 2008.
 
(f) N/A
 
(g) Non-audit fees
billed by the Auditor for services rendered to Western Asset 2008 Worldwide
Dollar Government Term Trust Inc., LMPFA and any entity controlling, controlled
by, or under common control with LMPFA that provides ongoing services to
Western Asset 2008 Worldwide Dollar Government Term Trust Inc. during the
reporting period were $0 in 2008.
 
(h) Yes.  Western Asset 2008 Worldwide Dollar
Government Term Trust Inc.s Audit
Committee has considered whether the provision of non-audit services that were
rendered to Service Affiliates, which were not pre-approved (not requiring
pre-approval), is compatible with maintaining the Accountants
independence.  All services provided by
the Auditor to the Western Asset 2008 Worldwide Dollar Government Term
Trust Inc. or to Service Affiliates,
which were required to be pre-approved, were pre-approved as required.

COMPANIES.
 
Proxy Voting Guidelines and Procedures
 
Legg Mason Partners Fund
Advisor, LLC (LMPFA) delegates the responsibility for voting proxies for the
fund to the subadviser through its contracts with the subadviser. The
subadviser will use its own proxy voting policies and procedures to vote
proxies. Accordingly, LMPFA does not expect to have proxy-voting responsibility
for the fund. Should LMPFA become responsible for voting proxies for any
reason, such as the inability of the subadviser to provide investment advisory
services, LMPFA shall utilize the proxy voting guidelines established by the
most recent subadviser to vote proxies until a new subadviser is retained.
 
The subadvisers Proxy
Voting Policies and Procedures govern in determining how proxies relating to
the funds portfolio securities are voted and are provided below.  Information regarding how each fund voted
proxies (if any) relating to portfolio securities during the most recent
12-month period ended June 30 is available without charge (1) by
calling 888-425-6432, (2) on the funds website at
http://www.leggmason.com/individualinvestors 
and (3) on the SECs website at http://www.sec.gov.
 
Background
 
Western Asset Management
Company (WA) and Western Asset Management Company Limited (WAML) (together Western
Asset) have adopted and implemented policies and procedures that we believe
are reasonably designed to ensure that proxies are voted in the best interest
of clients, in accordance with our fiduciary duties and SEC Rule 206(4)-6
under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Advisers Act). Our authority to
vote the proxies of our clients is established through investment management
agreements or comparable documents, and our proxy voting guidelines have been
tailored to reflect these specific contractual obligations. In addition to SEC
requirements governing advisers, our proxy voting policies reflect the
long-standing fiduciary standards and responsibilities for ERISA accounts.
Unless a manager of ERISA assets has been expressly precluded from voting
proxies, the Department of Labor has determined that the responsibility for
these votes lies with the Investment Manager.
 
In exercising its voting
authority, Western Asset will not consult or enter into agreements with
officers, directors or employees of Legg Mason Inc. or any of its affiliates
(except that WA and WAML may so consult and agree with each other) regarding
the voting of any securities owned by its clients.
 





 
Policy
 
Western Assets proxy voting
procedures are designed and implemented in a way that is reasonably expected to
ensure that proxy matters are handled in the best interest of our clients.
While the guidelines included in the procedures are intended to provide a
benchmark for voting standards, each vote is ultimately cast on a case-by-case
basis, taking into consideration Western Assets contractual obligations to our
clients and all other relevant facts and circumstances at the time of the vote
(such that these guidelines may be overridden to the extent Western Asset deems
appropriate).
 
Procedures
 
Responsibility and Oversight
 
The Western Asset Compliance
Department (Compliance Department) is responsible for administering and
overseeing the proxy voting process. The gathering of proxies is coordinated
through the Corporate Actions area of Investment Support (Corporate Actions).
Research analysts and portfolio managers are responsible for determining
appropriate voting positions on each proxy utilizing any applicable guidelines
contained in these procedures.
 
Client Authority
 
Prior to August 1,
2003, all existing client investment management agreements (IMAs) will be
reviewed to determine whether Western Asset has authority to vote client
proxies. At account start-up, or upon amendment of an IMA, the applicable
client IMA are similarly reviewed. If an agreement is silent on proxy voting,
but contains an overall delegation of discretionary authority or if the account
represents assets of an ERISA plan, Western Asset will assume responsibility
for proxy voting. The Client Account Transition Team maintains a matrix of
proxy voting authority.
 
Proxy Gathering
 
Registered owners of record,
client custodians, client banks and trustees (Proxy Recipients) that receive
proxy materials on behalf of clients should forward them to Corporate Actions.
Prior to August 1, 2003, Proxy Recipients of existing clients will be
reminded of the appropriate routing to Corporate Actions for proxy materials
received and reminded of their responsibility to forward all proxy materials on
a timely basis. Proxy Recipients for new clients (or, if Western Asset becomes
aware that the applicable Proxy Recipient for an existing client has changed,
the Proxy Recipient for the existing client) are notified at start-up of
appropriate routing to Corporate Actions of proxy materials received and
reminded of their responsibility to forward all proxy materials on a timely
basis. If Western Asset personnel other than Corporate Actions receive proxy
materials, they should promptly forward the materials to Corporate Actions.
 
Proxy Voting
 
Once proxy materials are
received by Corporate Actions, they are forwarded to the Compliance Department
for coordination and the following actions:
 
a.
Proxies are reviewed to determine accounts impacted.
 
b.
Impacted accounts are checked to confirm Western Asset voting authority.
 
c.
Compliance Department staff reviews proxy issues to determine any material
conflicts of interest. (See conflicts of interest section of these procedures
for further information on determining material conflicts of interest.)
 





 
d.
If a material conflict of interest exists, (i) to the extent reasonably
practicable and permitted by applicable law, the client is promptly notified,
the conflict is disclosed and Western Asset obtains the clients proxy voting
instructions, and (ii) to the extent that it is not reasonably practicable
or permitted by applicable law to notify the client and obtain such
instructions (e.g., the client is a mutual fund or other commingled vehicle or
is an ERISA plan client), Western Asset seeks voting instructions from an
independent third party.
 
e.
Compliance Department staff provides proxy material to the appropriate research
analyst or portfolio manager to obtain their recommended vote. Research
analysts and portfolio managers determine votes on a case-by-case basis taking
into account the voting guidelines contained in these procedures. For avoidance
of doubt, depending on the best interest of each individual client, Western
Asset may vote the same proxy differently for different clients. The analysts
or portfolio managers basis for their decision is documented and maintained by
the Compliance Department.
 
f.
Compliance Department staff votes the proxy pursuant to the instructions
received in (d) or (e) and returns the voted proxy as indicated in
the proxy materials.
 
Timing
 
Western Asset personnel act
in such a manner to ensure that, absent special circumstances, the proxy
gathering and proxy voting steps noted above can be completed before the
applicable deadline for returning proxy votes.
 
Recordkeeping
 
Western Asset maintains
records of proxies voted pursuant to Section 204-2 of the Advisers Act and
ERISA DOL Bulletin 94-2. These records include:
 
a.
A copy of Western Assets policies and procedures.
 
b.
Copies of proxy statements received regarding client securities.
 
c.
A copy of any document created by Western Asset that was material to making a
decision how to vote proxies.
 
d.
Each written client request for proxy voting records and Western Assets
written response to both verbal and written client requests.
 
e.
A proxy log including:
 
1.
Issuer name;
2.
Exchange ticker symbol of the issuers shares to be voted;
3.
Council on Uniform Securities Identification Procedures (CUSIP) number for
the shares to be voted;
4.
A brief identification of the matter voted on;
5.

Disclosure
 
Part II of both the WA Form ADV
and the WAML Form ADV contain a description of Western Assets proxy
policies. Prior to August 1, 2003, Western Asset will deliver Part II
of its revised Form ADV to all existing clients, along with a letter
identifying the new disclosure. Clients will be provided a copy of these
policies and procedures upon request. In addition, upon request, clients may
receive reports on how their proxies have been voted.
 
Conflicts of Interest
 
All proxies are reviewed by
the Compliance Department for material conflicts of interest. Issues to be
reviewed include, but are not limited to:
 
1.
Whether Western Asset (or, to the extent required to be considered by applicable
law, its affiliates) manages assets for the company or an employee group of the
company or otherwise has an interest in the company;
 
2.
Whether Western Asset or an officer or director of Western Asset or the
applicable portfolio manager or analyst responsible for recommending the proxy
vote (together, Voting Persons) is a close relative of or has a personal or
business relationship with an executive, director or person who is a candidate
for director of the company or is a participant in a proxy contest; and
 
3.
Whether there is any other business or personal relationship where a Voting
Person has a personal interest in the outcome of the matter before
shareholders.
 
Voting Guidelines
 
Western Assets substantive
voting decisions turn on the particular facts and circumstances of each proxy
vote and are evaluated by the designated research analyst or portfolio manager.
The examples outlined below are meant as guidelines to aid in the decision
making process.
 
Guidelines are grouped
according to the types of proposals generally presented to shareholders. Part I
deals with proposals which have been approved and are recommended by a companys
board of directors; Part II deals with proposals submitted by shareholders
for inclusion in proxy statements; Part III addresses issues relating to
voting shares of investment companies; and Part IV addresses unique
considerations pertaining to foreign issuers.
 
I. Board Approved Proposals
 
The vast majority of matters
presented to shareholders for a vote involve proposals made by a company itself
that have been approved and recommended by its board of directors. In view of
the enhanced corporate governance practices currently being implemented in
public companies, Western Asset generally votes in support of decisions reached
by independent boards of directors. More specific guidelines related to certain
board-approved proposals are as follows:
 





 
1. Matters relating to the
Board of Directors
 
Western Asset votes proxies
for the election of the companys nominees for directors and for board-approved
proposals on other matters relating to the board of directors with the
following exceptions:
 
a.
Votes are withheld for the entire board of directors if the board does not have
a majority of independent directors or the board does not have nominating,
audit and compensation committees composed solely of independent directors.
 
b.
Votes are withheld for any nominee for director who is considered an
independent director by the company and who has received compensation from the
company other than for service as a director.
 
c.
Votes are withheld for any nominee for director who attends less than 75% of
board and committee meetings without valid reasons for absences.
 
d.
Votes are cast on a case-by-case basis in contested elections of directors.
 
2.
Matters relating to Executive Compensation
 
Western Asset generally
favors compensation programs that relate executive compensation to a companys
long-term performance. Votes are cast on a case-by-case basis on board-approved
proposals relating to executive compensation, except as follows:
 
a.
Except where the firm is otherwise withholding votes for the entire board of
directors, Western Asset votes for stock option plans that will result in a
minimal annual dilution.
 
b.
Western Asset votes against stock option plans or proposals that permit
replacing or repricing of underwater options.
 
c.
Western Asset votes against stock option plans that permit issuance of options
with an exercise price below the stocks current market price.
 
d.
Except where the firm is otherwise withholding votes for the entire board of
directors, Western Asset votes for employee stock purchase plans that limit the
discount for shares purchased under the plan to no more than 15% of their
market value, have an offering period of 27 months or less and result in
dilution of 10% or less.
 
3.
Matters relating to Capitalization
 
The management of a companys
capital structure involves a number of important issues, including cash flows,
financing needs and market conditions that are unique to the circumstances of
each company. As a result, Western Asset votes on a case-by-case basis on
board-approved proposals involving changes to a companys capitalization except
where Western Asset is otherwise withholding votes for the entire board of
directors.
 
a.
Western Asset votes for proposals relating to the authorization of additional
common stock.
 
b.
Western Asset votes for proposals to effect stock splits (excluding reverse
stock splits).
 
c.
Western Asset votes for proposals authorizing share repurchase programs.
 





 
4.
Matters relating to Acquisitions, Mergers, Reorganizations and Other
Transactions
 
Western
Asset votes these issues on a case-by-case basis on board-approved
transactions.
 
5.
Matters relating to Anti-Takeover Measures
 
Western Asset votes against
board-approved proposals to adopt anti-takeover measures except as follows:
 
a.
Western Asset votes on a case-by-case basis on proposals to ratify or approve
shareholder rights plans.
 
b.
Western Asset votes on a case-by-case basis on proposals to adopt fair price
provisions.
 
6.
Other Business Matters
 
Western Asset votes for
board-approved proposals approving such routine business matters such as
changing the companys name, ratifying the appointment of auditors and
procedural matters relating to the shareholder meeting.
 
a.
Western Asset votes on a case-by-case basis on proposals to amend a companys
charter or bylaws.
 
b.
Western Asset votes against authorization to transact other unidentified,
substantive business at the meeting.
 
II. Shareholder Proposals
 
SEC regulations permit
shareholders to submit proposals for inclusion in a companys proxy statement.
These proposals generally seek to change some aspect of a companys corporate
governance structure or to change some aspect of its business operations.
Western Asset votes in accordance with the recommendation of the companys
board of directors on all shareholder proposals, except as follows:
 
1. Western Asset votes for
shareholder proposals to require shareholder approval of shareholder rights
plans.
 
2. Western Asset votes for
shareholder proposals that are consistent with Western Assets proxy voting
guidelines for board-approved proposals.
 
3. Western Asset votes on a
case-by-case basis on other shareholder proposals where the firm is otherwise
withholding votes for the entire board of directors.
 
III. Voting Shares of Investment Companies
 
Western Asset may utilize
shares of open or closed-end investment companies to implement its investment
strategies. Shareholder votes for investment companies that fall within the
categories listed in Parts I and II above are voted in accordance with those
guidelines.
 
1. Western Asset votes on a
case-by-case basis on proposals relating to changes in the investment objectives
of an investment company taking into account the original intent of the fund
and the role the fund plays in the clients portfolios.
 





 
2. Western Asset votes on a
case-by-case basis all proposals that would result in increases in expenses
(e.g., proposals to adopt 12b-1 plans, alter investment advisory arrangements
or approve fund mergers) taking into account comparable expenses for similar
funds and the services to be provided.
 
IV. Voting Shares of Foreign Issuers
 
In the event Western Asset
is required to vote on securities held in foreign issuers  i.e. issuers that
are incorporated under the laws of a foreign jurisdiction and that are not
listed on a U.S. securities exchange or the NASDAQ stock market, the following
guidelines are used, which are premised on the existence of a sound corporate
governance and disclosure framework. These guidelines, however, may not be
appropriate under some circumstances for foreign issuers and therefore apply
only where applicable.
 
1. Western Asset votes for
shareholder proposals calling for a majority of the directors to be independent
of management.
 
2. Western Asset votes for
shareholder proposals seeking to increase the independence of board nominating,
audit and compensation committees.
 
3. Western Asset votes for
shareholder proposals that implement corporate governance standards similar to
those established under U.S. federal law and the listing requirements of U.S.
stock exchanges, and that do not otherwise violate the laws of the jurisdiction
under which the company is incorporated.
 
4. Western Asset votes on a case-by-case basis on
proposals relating to (1) the issuance of common stock in excess of 20% of
a companys outstanding common stock where shareholders do not have preemptive
rights, or (2) the issuance of common stock in excess of 100% of a companys
outstanding common stock where shareholders have preemptive rights.

 The numbers above reflect the overall number of portfolios
managed by employees of Western Asset Management Company (Western Asset).  Mr. Leech and Mr. Walsh are
involved in the management of all the Firms portfolios, but they are not
solely responsible for particular portfolios. 
Western Assets investment discipline emphasizes a team approach that
combines the efforts of groups of specialists working in different market
sectors. They are responsible for overseeing implementation of Western Assets
overall investment ideas and coordinating the work of the various sector teams.
This structure ensures that client portfolios benefit from a consensus that
draws on the expertise of all team members.
 
(a)(3): Portfolio Manager Compensation 
With respect to the compensation of the
portfolio managers, the Advisers compensation system assigns each employee a
total compensation target and a respective cap, which are derived from annual
market surveys that benchmark each role with their job function and peer
universe.  This method is designed to
reward employees with total compensation reflective of the external market
value of their skills, experience, and ability to produce desired results.
 
Standard compensation includes competitive
base salaries, generous employee benefits, and a retirement plan.
 
In
addition, employees are eligible for bonuses. 
These are structured to closely align the interests of employees with
those of the Advisers, and are determined by the professionals job function
and performance as measured by a formal review process.  All bonuses are completely
discretionary.  One of the principal
factors considered is a portfolio managers investment performance versus
appropriate peer groups and benchmarks. 
Performance is reviewed on a 1, 3 and 5 year basis for compensation 
with 3 years having the most emphasis. Because portfolio managers are generally
responsible for multiple accounts (including the Portfolio) with similar
investment strategies, they are compensated on the performance of the aggregate
group of similar accounts, rather than a specific account, though relative
performance against the stated benchmark and its applicable Lipper peer group
is considered.  A smaller portion of a
bonus payment is derived from factors that include client service, business
development, length of service to the Adviser, management or supervisory
responsibilities, contributions to developing business strategy and overall
contributions to the Advisers business.
 
Finally, in order to attract and retain
top talent, all professionals are eligible for additional incentives in
recognition of outstanding performance. 
These are determined based upon the factors described above and include
Legg Mason, Inc. stock options and long-term incentives that vest over a
set period of time past the award date.
 





 
Potential Conflicts of Interest
 
Potential conflicts of interest may arise
in connection with the management of multiple accounts (including accounts
managed in a personal capacity).  These could include potential conflicts
of interest related to the knowledge and timing of a Portfolios trades,
investment opportunities and broker selection.  Portfolio managers may be
privy to the size, timing and possible market impact of a Portfolios trades.
 
It is possible that an investment
opportunity may be suitable for both a Portfolio and other accounts managed by
a portfolio manager, but may not be available in sufficient quantities for both
the Portfolio and the other accounts to participate fully.  Similarly,
there may be limited opportunity to sell an investment held by a Portfolio and
another account.  A conflict may arise where the portfolio manager may
have an incentive to treat an account preferentially as compared to a Portfolio
because the account pays a performance-based fee or the portfolio manager, the
Advisers or an affiliate has an interest in the account.  The Advisers
have adopted procedures for allocation of portfolio transactions and investment
opportunities across multiple client accounts on a fair and equitable basis
over time.  All eligible accounts that can participate in a trade share
the same price on a pro-rata allocation basis in an attempt to mitigate any
conflict of interest.  Trades are allocated among similarly managed
accounts to maintain consistency of portfolio strategy, taking into account
cash availability, investment restrictions and guidelines, and portfolio
composition versus strategy.
 
With respect to securities transactions
for the Portfolios, the Advisers determine which broker or dealer to use to
execute each order, consistent with their duty to seek best execution of the
transaction.  However, with respect to certain other accounts (such as
pooled investment vehicles that are not registered investment companies and
other accounts managed for organizations and individuals), the Advisers may be
limited by the client with respect to the selection of brokers or dealers or
may be instructed to direct trades through a particular broker or dealer. 
In these cases, trades for a Portfolio in a particular security may be placed
separately from, rather than aggregated with, such other accounts.  Having
separate transactions with respect to a security may temporarily affect the
market price of the security or the execution of the transaction, or both, to
the possible detriment of a Portfolio or the other account(s) involved. 
Additionally, the management of multiple Portfolios and/or other accounts may
result in a portfolio manager devoting unequal time and attention to the
management of each Portfolio and/or other account.
 
It is theoretically possible that
portfolio managers could use information to the advantage of other accounts
they manage and to the possible detriment of a Portfolio.  For example, a
portfolio manager could short sell a security for an account immediately prior
to a Portfolios sale of that security.  To address this conflict, the
Advisers have adopted procedures for reviewing and comparing selected trades of
alternative investment accounts (which may make directional trades such as
short sales) with long only accounts (which include the Portfolios) for timing
and pattern related issues.  Trading decisions for alternative investment
and long only accounts may not be identical even though the same Portfolio
Manager may manage both types of accounts.  Whether the Adviser allocates
a particular investment opportunity to only alternative investment accounts or
to alternative investment and long only accounts will depend on the investment
strategy being implemented.  If, under the circumstances, an investment
opportunity is appropriate for both its alternative investment and long only
accounts, then it will be allocated to both on a pro-rata basis.
 
A portfolio manager may also face other
potential conflicts of interest in managing a Portfolio, and the description
above is not a complete description of every conflict of interest that could be
deemed to exist in managing both a Portfolio and the other accounts listed
above.
