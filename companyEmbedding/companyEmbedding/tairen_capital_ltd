   Hedge Funds-News-Tech  Tairen Capital’s Bets on Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA) and Other Tech Stocks Help It Score Big    Published on November 3, 2016 at 5:55 pm by  
                                Alexandr Oleinic
                                  in Hedge Funds,News,Tech         Page 1 of 2Next &gt&gtSee All           Larry Chen and Terry Zhang‘s Tairen Capital is one of more than 700 hedge funds that Insider Monkey tracks as part of its small-cap strategy. During the third quarter, Tairen had a pretty good run, registering a return of 28.52%, based on our calculations, which takes into account the fund’s long positions from its last 13F filing in companies valued at over $1.0 billion. The most gains came from its investment in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE:BABA), as Tairen boosted its stake by nearly 1,300% in the second quarter and profited from a 30% surge the stock registered between July and September. In this article, we are going to take a closer look at some of Tairen’s top picks and will see how the smart money industry traded them. However, it’s important to point out that the actual returns of Tairen can be different from what we calculated. A 13F filing doesn’t reveal all of the fund’s investments, omitting short bets, investments in derivatives and other instruments. Moreover, we take into account the positions as they were held at the beginning of a quarter, while funds usually make changes to their holdings during a quarter. Nevertheless, even a rough approximation of a fund’s performance can give us an idea about the stock-picking skills of an individual fund. As stated earlier, Tairen gained 28.52% in the third quarter, but it is still down by over 20% year-to-date. The fund held an equity portfolio valued at $467.27 million at the end of June, with 62% invested in the technology stocks. Further below, we will discuss Tairen’s largest position as well as a number of stocks in which the fund initiated stakes during the second quarter. After it boosted its stake in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE:BABA) by nearly 1,300% during the second quarter, Tairen Capital held over 1.38 million shares at the end of June. The move was very timely as the stock gained over 33% in the following three months. Meanwhile, at the end of the second quarter, a total of 69 of the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were bullish on this stock, a change of 3% from one quarter earlier.  According to publicly-available hedge fund and institutional investor holdings data compiled by Insider Monkey, Jim Davidson, Dave Rouxáand, and Glenn Hutchins’s Silver Lake Partners has the most valuable position in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE:BABA), worth close to $1.30 billion, accounting for 27.2% of its total 13F portfolio as of the end of June. On Silver Lake Partners’s heels is Andreas Halvorsen of Viking Global, with a $320.6 million position; the fund has 1.4% of its 13F portfolio invested in the stock. Remaining members of the smart money with similar optimism about Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE:BABA) included Rob Citrone’s Discovery Capital Management, Ken Fisher‘s Fisher Asset Management and Cliff Asness’s AQR Capital Management. In Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Tairen initiated a stake containing 28,700 shares during the second quarter and consecutively saw the stock gain 17% in the third quarter. With earnings season ahead and a number of other developments, investors expect Amazon’s stock to grow further this year. Heading into the third quarter of 2016, a total of 145 of the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were bullish on this stock, a change of 9% from one quarter earlier. Viking Global amassed the largest position in Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN): worth $2.35 billion and comprising 10% of its 13F portfolio. Moreover, Scopus Asset Management, managed by Alexander Mitchell, assembled the most valuable call position in Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). Scopus Asset Management had $500.9 million invested in the company at the end of the quarter. Israel Englander’s Millennium Management also initiated a $294.6 million position during the quarter.

Consensus Ratings for Baozun (NASDAQ:BZUN) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?)

Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy).

Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 1 Buy RatingConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 3.00)Consensus Price Target: $36.00 (6.86% upside)

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.

No sell buffer

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).

                          Stock prices used are the "total returns" stock price and will include
                          dividends, spinoffs, splits, and other adjustments.  Because of this, stock
                          prices shown here will likely not
                          match a stock's actual closing stock price on the same date.
