HIGH INCOME STRATEGY 


PORTFOLIO INVESTMENT STRATEGY
This strategy is managed with a target of 100% high yield corporate and convertible bonds (with residual cash).

 
PORTFOLIO OBJECTIVES


To generate a high level of income, which typically produces most of the portfolio’s return
To generate additional returns through selling more bonds for a profit than for a loss
To offer a discipline with a low correlation to most relative indices (the portfolio performs differently than indices of the same asset class) 

There is no assurance that manager will achieve or maintain these objectives. 
 
SMHCA HIGH YIELD INVESTMENT PROCESS 
 
How SMHCA Breaks Down The High Yield Universe 
>>Hover over each discipline for more detail 






Credit Risk Reduction -
SMHCA conducts financial analysis, looking for inherent value and tangible assets to support the debt, and reduce credit risk. 



Maximizing Returns for the risk - 
SMHCA selects securities that provide an adequate yield over treasuries. We do this by avoiding overpriced securities and overpriced markets and by looking for the best relative values in the bonds. 



Reduction of Market Risk - 
The BofA Merrill Lynch U.S. High Yield Cash Pay Index currently has over 2000 individual securities. It would be virtually impossible for any investor to replicate this portfolio. SMHCA avoids being "the market" and reduces the correlation to index returns. Statistically, most of the diversification of a portfolio has been shown to come from less than the first 20 holdings. By keeping a focused portfolio of generally 40 issuers or less, we reduce market or "systemic" risk.
