(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto and other financial information included elsewhere in this report.  Certain statements contained in this report, including, without limitation, statements containing the words "believes," "anticipates," "expects" and words of similar import, constitute "forward looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including our ability to create, sustain, manage or forecast our growth; our ability to attract and retain key personnel; changes in our business strategy or development plans; competition; business disruptions; adverse publicity; and international, national and local general economic and market conditions.  GENERAL  Throughout this report, the terms "we," "us," "our," "ProGreen" and the "Company" refer to ProGreen US, Inc., a Delaware corporation and, unless the context indicates otherwise, includes our subsidiaries.  The Company was incorporated in Florida on April 23, 1998 and reincorporated in Delaware on December 12, 2008. Effective September 11, 2009, we changed our name from Diversified Product Inspections, Inc. to Progreen US, Inc. to reflect the change in our business operations from the conduct of investigations and laboratory analyses operations to the purchase of income producing properties and changed our name effective July 22, 2016 to Progreen US, Inc., to reflect initiation of development operations in Baja Mexico.  OUR BUSINESS  The purchase of a condominium unit on July 28, 2009 initiated our planned new business operations directed at purchasing income-producing residential real estate apartment homes, condominiums and houses in the State of Michigan. Our business model since our initial property purchases has been to acquire, refurbish and upgrade existing properties into more environmentally sustainable, energy efficient, comfortable and healthier living spaces so that they meet standards that exceed what is often the norm for most single family homes, condominiums and apartments. Once a property has been acquired, refurbished and rented, the property would be put back on the market, but now as a fully managed investment property, with a favorable environmental profile and yield. These investment properties are marketed exclusively by ProGreen Realty LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of ProGreen and managed by Progreen Properties Management LLC, another wholly owned subsidiary.  On July 19, 2013, the Company entered into an Investment Agreement with American Residential Fastigheter AB ("AMREFA"), which provided for 100% property acquisition and refurbishment financing by in the form of property loans, and that the properties would show a minimum initial return of 9.5% per annum and then be sold income producing investment properties, managed by ProGreen. Effective December 22, 2014 the Company entered into an interim operating agreement (the "Interim PAJV Operating Agreement") with American Residential GAP, LLC ("ARG" or "ARG LLC") to form PAJV LLC ("PAJV"), a Michigan limited liability company. AMREFA is ARG's sole member. The Company and ARG each owned 50% of PAJV. There were no capital contributions. During the year ended April 30, 2015 the Company sold its remaining property under development in the amount of $73,688 to PAJV. The selling price was $75,000. Our agreement with AMREFA was restructured through a March 15, 2015, amendment to the Investment Agreement with AMREFA, superseding the December 2014 Interim PAJV Operating Agreement. The amendment provided for ARG LLC (the U.S. real estate subsidiary of AMREFA) to fund 100% of all financing requirements for real estate projects, which would be owned by specific joint ventures or ARG LLC, with Progreen handling everything from acquisition to sale and receiving a profit participation payment for a return on the property above 9.5%.  Purchase of Investment Properties from AMREFA  On March 8, 2016, the Company restructured its working arrangements with AMREFA through entry into a purchase agreement, amended March 16, 2016, with AMREFA for the purchase of a 100% interest in AMREFA's U.S. subsidiary, ARG LLC, which holds real estate properties in Birmingham, Michigan, that were purchased by AMREFA and which the Company managed for AMREFA. The Company paid the purchase price by the issuance to AMREFA of 8,093,541 shares of a new Series B Preferred Stock; however, at April 30, 2016 the shares had not been issued and we recorded a note payable to AMREFA in the amount $1,157,270 including a present value discount of $127,730.  The Company believes that the AMREFA transactions will contribute substantially to our financial liquidity in our real estate operations in Michigan.  Baja California Joint Venture Agreement  In connection with expanding our real estate development operations to include Baja California, Mexico, on February 12, 2016, we signed a definitive joint venture agreement with INMOBILIARIA CONTEL S.R.L.C.V. for the first tract of land of approximately 300 acres for agriculture use, as well as a Debt Mortgage Guarantee for the initial amount of $300,000 for the joint venture.  The agreement provides for Contel to contribute the land to the JV at extremely low cost and favorable terms, as well as handling all planning, permits, preparation and construction, in order for the property to be marketed as prime farm land. Progreen will be responsible for providing the financing. Resulting profits from the resale of the property as developed farm land will be split equally between the two parties. Work on this first tract of land has already commenced, which will include clearing and levelling of the land, construction of a large water reservoir and piping for irrigation. Water pumps will be powered by solar energy for sustainability. We anticipate completing the work over the coming two months, in order to offer the land for sale for this season's farming.  We have established Procon Baja JV, our joint venture subsidiary with Contel. Procon is owned by Progreen (51%) and Contel (49%) jointly. The company is managed by a board of Managing Directors consisting of three members. Two will be representing Progreen and one representing Contel. At least two Managing Directors' approval will be needed for management decisions or approvals of financial transactions, giving Progreen operational control. This joint venture involves approximately 1,900 acres, with some 500-800 acres suitable for farming, depending on the amount of water that could be extracted through the drilling of fresh water wells.  Increase in Authorized Common Stock  On February 9, 2016, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation increasing the number of authorized shares of common stock from 250,000,000, par value $.0001 per share to 1,500,000,000, par value $.0001 per share.  FINANCIAL CONDITION  At April 30, 2016, we had total assets of $1,796,000 compared to total assets of $164,000 at April 30, 2015. The increase in total assets was primarily due to:  These increases in assets were offset by: a decrease in accounts receivables in the amount of $26,000 relating to a decrease of $25,000 in amounts due to Progreen Construction for work performed under the Company's agreement with ARG LLC and a decrease of $1,000 in amounts due from tenants for properties managed by Progreen Management. Also, other receivable related party decreased $1,100, the note receivable - rental property in the amount of approximately $2,100 was written off as it was deemed uncollectible, prepaid expenses decreased approximately $3,300, deposits decreased $4,100 as the office space lease expired and was replaced with a new lease with a $1,000 deposit, property and equipment decreased approximately $13,000 due to the sale of a vehicle and current year depreciation expense.  At April 30, 2016, we had stockholders' deficit of $1,297,000 compared to a deficit of $1,032,000 as of April 30, 2015. The increase in stockholders' deficit was mainly due to net operating losses of $852,000 which was offset by compensation expense relating to RSUs of approximately $11,500, an amount received from a subscriber under a stock subscription agreement of approximately $54,000, stock issued under convertible debenture of approximately $156,000, a derivative liability of $312,000 and stock issued under service agreements of approximately $53,500 in the year ended April 30, 2016.  Costs incurred in the renovation of the properties that enhance the value or extend the life of the properties are capitalized. The Company also incurred professional fees in implementing its business plan and preparing to sell properties in the future. During the current year, the Company acquired thirteen rental properties in the amount of 1,007,000 and one property under development in the amount of $294,000. No costs to develop were incurred in fiscal 20116. The Company owned thirteen and no rental properties as of April 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company held one and no properties under development as of April 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Going Concern  The Company's financial statements for the year ended April 30, 2016, have been prepared on a going concern basis which contemplates the realization of assets and settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The Company has incurred losses from operations since its change of ownership, management and line of business on April 30, 2009. Management recognizes successful business operations and the Company's transition to attaining profitability are dependent upon obtaining additional financing and achieving a level of revenue adequate to support its cost structure. These conditions raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of uncertainties.  The Company will require additional funding to execute its future strategic business plan. Successful business operations and its transition to attaining profitability are dependent upon obtaining additional financing and achieving a level of revenue adequate to support its cost structure. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.  Cash  Cash increased approximately $91,000 for the year ended April 30, 2016. Cash used in operating activities was approximately $364,000 for the year ended April 30, 2016, as compared with cash used in operating activities of approximately $308,000 in fiscal 2015. During fiscal 2016, the Company invested approximately $110,000 in Contel, which was offset by proceeds from the sale of properties of $10,000 and by cash received in the ARG acquisition of approximately $72,000.  The Company received $68,000 in proceeds from two convertible debentures, received approximately $138,000 from a line of credit as result of the ARG acquisition, received advances from related parties in the amount of $259,000 and received $54,000 from a subscriber due under a stock subscription agreement and repaid $7,700 on obligations under capital leases and repaid $28,200 in notes payable.  Rental properties and properties under development  The Company owned thirteen and no rental properties as of April 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Rental properties totaled $1,007,000 and $0 at April 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The Company held one and no properties under development as of April 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Properties under development totaled $294,000 and $0 at April 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Note receivable - rental property  On August 21, 2012 the Company sold one property with a sales price of $60,000 of which $10,000 was financed by the Company which is recorded as a note receivable with a balance of $0 and $2,100 as of April 30, 2016 and April 30, 2015, respectively. During the current fiscal year management determined the note is uncollectible and it was written off in full. The amount of $2,100 was charged to bad debt expense in the year ended April 30, 2016.  Business Combination  On March 8, 2016, the Company restructured its working arrangements with AMREFA through entry into a purchase agreement, amended March 16, 2016, with AMREFA for the purchase of a 100% interest in AMREFA's U.S. subsidiary, ARG LLC (ARG), which holds real estate properties in Birmingham, Michigan, that were purchased by AMREFA and which the Company managed for AMREFA. The Company recorded Goodwill in the amount of $180,000 in connection with the purchase of ARG.  Note Receivable - Related Party  On February 12, 2016, the Company signed a definitive joint venture agreement with INMOBILIARIA CONTEL S.R.L.C.V. ("Contel") to form a joint venture ("Baja Joint Venture"), in connection with expanding real estate development operations to include Baja California, Mexico. The property acquired by the Baja Joint Venture will be developed for seeding purposes and eventually sold to a third party. The Company is committed to a contribution up to the amount of $350,000. The Company accepts a share of the Baja Joint Venture's profits and losses and is entitled to recover all contribution upon completion of the sale of the property. In April 2016 the Company contributed $110,000 to Baja Joint Venture. Note Receivable - Related Partytotaled $110,000 and $0 as of April 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Year Ended April 30, 2016 Compared to Year Ended April 30, 2015  During the year ended April 30, 2016, we incurred a net loss of $852,000 compared to a net loss of $407,000 for the year ended April 30, 2015. The increase in our loss for the year ended April 30, 2016 over the comparable period of the prior year is due to a decrease in our revenue of approximately $273,000, an decrease of approximately $121,000 in operating expenses and an increase in net other expenses of approximately $295,000.  The decrease of approximately $273,000 in revenue in the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 is due to: Proceeds from the sale of properties decreased to $0 as compared to $200,000 during the prior fiscal year. The Company sold two properties in the fiscal year ended April 30, 2015 and there were no such sales during the current fiscal year. Proceeds from the sale of properties, related party decreased to $0 as compared to $75,000 during the fiscal year ended April 30, 2015 due to a decrease in proceeds from the sale of one property in the amount of $75,000 to PAJV, a related party in the prior fiscal year. There were no such sales during the current year.  Commission revenue decreased to $0 as compared to approximately $83,000 during the fiscal year ended April 30, 2015. The Company received commissions on the sale of three Company owned properties and on one managed property in the fiscal year ended April 30, 2015. There were no such commissions earned during the current fiscal year.  Revenue also decreased due to a decrease in revenue from construction services, related party from approximately $24,000 in the fiscal year ended April 30, 2015 to $0 in the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016, as a result of the Company's services to PAJV, a related party. Effective March 15, 2015 the Company is no longer an owner in PAJV, thus there were no such sales in the current fiscal year.  The decrease in revenue was partially offset by an increase in construction services revenue which increased from $92,000 in the fiscal year ended April 30, 2015 to approximately $177,000 in the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016, as a result of the Company's formation of the construction company subsidiary and its services to ARG LLC. Rental revenue increased from $0 in the fiscal year ended April 30, 2015 to approximately $24,000 in the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016, as a result of the Company's rental properties acquired in connection with the ARG purchase.  There have been fluctuations in certain expenses in the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016, as compared to the fiscal year ended April 30, 2015. In fiscal year ended April 30, 2016 cost of properties sold decreased to $0 as compared to approximately $170,000 in the year ended April 30, 2015 due to the sale of no properties in the current year. In the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016 cost of properties sold, related party decreased to $0 as compared to approximately $74,000 in the fiscal year ended April 30, 2015 due to the sale of one property to PAJV in the prior fiscal year. There were no properties sold to PAJV in the current fiscal year.  Cost of construction services increased from $84,000 in the year ended April 30, 2015 to approximately $178,000 in the year ended April 30, 2016, as a result of the Company's formation of the construction company subsidiary and its services to ARG LLC. In the year ended April 30, 2016 cost of construction services, related party decreased from approximately $22,000 in the year ended April 30, 2015 to $0 in the year ended April 30, 2016. The costs incurred in the prior period related to the Company's services to PAJV, a related party. Effective March 15, 2015 the Company is no longer an owner in PAJV, thus there were no such costs in the current fiscal year.  Selling, general and administrative expense decreased approximately $32,000 for the year ended April 30, 2016 as compared to the comparable prior year mainly due to the following:  Compensation expense decreased approximately $21,200 for the year ended April 30, 2016 as compared to the comparable prior year. This decrease is attributable to a former Director's expired restricted stock units ("RSUs") and to the full vesting of a portion of other RSUs in June of fiscal 2016.  The reserve for rent guarantee decreased to a recovery of approximately $10,000 for the year ended April 30, 2016 as compared to expense of approximately $5,800 in the same period in fiscal 2015 as there were no sales of rental properties in the current year and the rental guarantees on two prior period property sales expired with no payment required resulting in a credit of approximately $10,000.  Selling, general and administrative expense also decreased approximately $6,200 due to decreased Company activity in the current year.  These decreases were partially offset by increases in certain expenses: Rental operating costs increased approximately $7,300 and depreciation expense increased approximately $4,600, for the year ended April 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in fiscal 2015 due to the acquisition of rental properties in the ARG purchase.  Professional fees increased approximately $83,000 for the year ended April 30, 2016 as compared to the comparable prior year mainly due to increased consulting and legal fees paid in connection with activities relating to the Company's funding sources and ongoing search for equity and financing sources for the year ended April 30, 2016.  Interest expense increased approximately $132,000 for the year ended April 30, 2016 as compared to the comparable prior year mainly due to increased debt and convertible debt during the current year and the related interest and amortization of debt discounts for the year ended April 30, 2016.  Gain on sale of asset increased from $0 in the comparable prior year to approximately $8,100 for the year ended April 30, 2016 due to the sale of a vehicle in the current year.  Derivatives loss increased from $0 in the comparable prior year to approximately $171,000 for the year ended April 30, 2016 due to the derivatives loss on the tainting of convertible debt in the current year.  LIQUIDITY  At April 30, 2016, we had total assets of approximately $1,796,000 compared to total assets of approximately $164,000 at April 30, 2015. The increase in total assets was primarily due to: an increase in cash of $91,000, the acquisition of rental properties in the amount $1,007,000 and properties under development in the amount of $294,000 as a result of the ARG purchase, which also resulted in the Goodwill of $180,000. Note Receivable- Related Party increased $110,000 as a result of Progreen's investment in Contel.  These increases in assets were offset by: a decrease in accounts receivables in the amount of $26,000 relating to a decrease of $25,000 in amounts due to Progreen Construction for work performed under the Company's agreement with ARG LLC and a decrease of $1,000 in amounts due from tenants for properties managed by Progreen Management. Also, other receivable related party decreased $1,100, the note receivable - rental property in the amount of approximately $2,100 was written off as it was deemed uncollectible, prepaid expenses decreased approximately $3,300, deposits decreased $4,100 as the lease expired and was replaced with a new lease with a $1,000 deposit, property and equipment decreased approximately $12,000 due to the sale of a vehicle and current year depreciation expense.  Cash increased approximately $91,000 for the year ended April 30, 2016. Cash used in operating activities was approximately $364,000 for the year ended April 30, 2016, as compared with cash used in operating activities of approximately $308,000 in fiscal 2015. During fiscal 2016, the Company invested approximately $110,000 in Contel, which was offset by proceeds from the sale of properties of $10,000 and by cash received in the ARG acquisition of approximately $72,000.  The Company received $68,000 in proceeds from two convertible debentures, received approximately $138,000 from a line of credit as result of the ARG acquisition, received advances from related parties in the amount of $259,000 and received $54,000 from a subscriber due under a stock subscription agreement and repaid $7,700 on obligations under capital leases and repaid $28,200 in notes payable.  At April 30, 2016, we had stockholders' deficit of approximately $1,297,000.  We have limited working capital. EIG Venture Capital Ltd. ("EIG"), a company controlled by our Chief Executive Officer, Jan Telander, agreed to invest $1,000,000 through the purchase of 97,751,710 shares of common stock for $0.01023 per share in three tranches. On July 21, 2009, the Company entered into a Subscription Agreement with EIG Venture Capital, Ltd. ("EIG"), an investment company controlled by Jan Telander, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and controlling stockholder for the sale by the Company to EIG of an aggregate of 97,751,710 shares of the Company's Common Stock, at a fixed price of $0.01023 per share, in three tranches: the Phase I tranche consisted of 5,767,350 shares of Common Stock to be purchased by EIG on or before July 16, 2009; the Phase II tranche of 43,108,504 shares to be purchased by EIG on or before December 31, 2009; and the Phase III tranche of 48,875,855 shares of Common Stock to be purchased by EIG on or before July 16, 2010. On June 1, 2010, the Company received $400,000 of the Phase III tranche and issued 39,100,684 shares to EIG. Under a December 1, 2009 Amendment to the Subscription Agreement, EIG paid penalty interest at a rate of 13.5% per annum on the unpaid balance as of the final purchase date of the Phase III shares from that date to the date the shares were purchased. In December 2014, the Company received $50,000 of the remaining Phase III $100,000 purchase price balance and $59,120 of related interest. The remaining balance of the purchase price in the amount of $54,000 was received on July 3, 2015 to complete payment of the Phase III purchase price.  EIG on July 14, 2015, advanced the Company $46,000. In November 2015 EIG advanced the Company an additional $13,000.  Pursuant to an Instalment Payment Agreement entered into on June 25, 2015 with AMREFA, the Company refinanced its outstanding principal and interest on loans to the Company from AMREFA. This agreement replaced all outstanding notes by a single 8% promissory note in the principal amount of $289,246, due July 15, 2017, amortized by instalment payments of principal and interest commencing with an initial payment in July 2015 of $45,000, including accrued interest. EIG has guaranteed Progreen's obligations under the Instalment Payment Agreement.  During fiscal 2016 the Company issued common stock in settlement of all convertible debentures.  In the current fiscal year, to continue purchasing properties for renovation, the Company is looking to AMREFA and other financing sources to provide the necessary capital. With any purchases of larger apartment complex properties, we estimate that we will be required to find investment partners to provide financing in the range of $5 million to $25 million over the next 12-24 months.  Restructure of Rupes Futura and AMREFA Debt  On February 9, 2016, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized a new series of preferred stock, the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, with a stated value of $1.00 per share, and we filed a Certificate of Designations for the Series A Preferred Stock with the Secretary of State of Delaware on February 17, 2016. Also, effective on February 9, 2016, our Board approved and the Company entered into two agreements with the Company's largest stockholder, EIG, to reduce the amount of the Company's outstanding debt, and improve our balance sheet. First, EIG assumed all of the Company's obligations under the 13.5% convertible debenture of the Company due to Rupes Futura AB (Sweden), which has agreed to assumption of the convertible debenture obligations by EIG. The outstanding principal of the debenture, together with two years of accumulated unpaid interest, totaled $608,031, and EIG was compensated by the issuance of shares of Series A Preferred Stock with a total stated value equal to that of the principal and accrued interest of the debt assumed. Second, the Company negotiated a debt conversion agreement effective February 9, 2016 with EIG, under which $59,000 of non-interest bearing advances made to the Company by EIG in July and November 2015 were converted into shares of Series A Preferred Stock with a total stated value of $59,000.  Subscription Agreements for Shares of Series A Preferred Stock  In February 2016, the Company entered into subscription agreements with three stockholders, Jan Telander, the Company's President and CEO; Ulf Telander, the CEO of EIG; and Frederic Telander, the CEO of SolTech Energy Sweden AB, providing for the investment in the Company by each of the three stockholders of $100,000 through the purchase of 100,000 shares each of Series A Preferred Stock. During the last quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company received $200,000 as payment for 200,000 of the shares. The shares were issued subsequent to April 30, 2016 thus the Company recorded an amount due stockholders in the amount of $200,000. The remaining 100,000 shares in the amount of $100,000 were purchased subsequent to April 30, 2016.

BLOOMFIELD TOWNSHIP, MI – May 23, 2017 – ProGreen US, Inc. (ProGreen), (OTCQB: PGUS), www.ProGreenUS.com, @ProGreenUS, is a US company engaged primarily with investments in agricultural and real estate projects in Baja California, Mexico, both through its joint venture partnership with Inmobiliaria Contel S.R.L.C.V. (Contel) and through its majority-owned Mexican subsidiary Procon Baja JV (Procon), www.CieloMarBaja.com.

 
 
 



About ProGreen US, Inc. & CEO Jan Telander
ProGreen US, Inc. (ProGreen), (OTCQB: PGUS), www.ProGreenUS.com, @ProGreenUS, is a US company engaged primarily with investments in agricultural and real estate projects in Baja California, Mexico, both through its joint venture partnership with Inmobiliaria Contel S.R.L.C.V. (Contel) and through its majority-owned Mexican subsidiary Procon Baja JV (Procon). Until 2016, the company was called ProGreen Properties, Inc., and was engaged in the business of acquiring, refurbishing and upgrading residential real estate into modern affordable homes, some being aimed at the local real estate market and some sold to European Property Investors.

 
 


 

February 23, 2017 AMA conference call with CEO Jan Telander

 
 
 



The company’s name was changed effective July 22, 2016 to ProGreen US, Inc., “…to better reflect the expansion of the company’s business activities going forward, investment in agriculture land in Baja California, further planning for residential and commercial real estate developments in the area, with integration of advanced solar technology.” The ticker symbol was also changed, from PGEI to PGUS. Prior to ProGreen, Jan Telander, the Chief Executive Officer, had been a property developer in Spain for nearly 40 years, had built several developments with his brother, Ulf, having built and sold over 500 properties. Jan was also a co-founder of the Swedish solar products manufacturer, SolTech Energy Sweden AB (SOLT:FN Stockholm).

 
 
 
 





Agricultural – Business Unit
Joint venture (JV) agreements between ProGreen and Contel provide for Contel to contribute the land to the joint venture, as well as handling all planning, permits, preparation and construction, in order for the property to be worked, leased or sold as prime farm land. ProGreen is responsible for providing the financing. Under the JV agreement, ProGreen receives with priority the return of the financed amount, from all revenue received, after which the profits are split equally between the two parties.

 
 


 
 
 



Through the JV agreements with Contel, ProGreen controls nearly 14,000 acres of agricultural land in Baja – 2,200 acres plus a 3-year option on the remaining 11,500 acres. Of the total agricultural land, ProGreen expects between 4,000 to 5,000 acres may be suitable for farming, depending on the availability of water. Some of the large remainder of the land – which could be 9,000 to 10,000 acres – could potentially be used for commercial and residential real estate in direct support of the farming operations and for the local economy and industry that may develop over time as a result of these operations.
Four wells have been drilled on the first tract, producing an abundance of water. Contel has begun their growing operation with a first produce purchase agreement for $1.1 to $1.3 million (USD) for red chile peppers – from Agricola El Consuela, an exporter/importer to the U.S. market – which is being grown on the first 100 acres. The profit margin on this first crop is expected to be in the range of 55-60%. ProGreen has stated goals for Contel to increase the growing operation to 400 acres in 2018, 800 acres in 2019, and 1,200 acres in 2020.

 
 
 
 




Real Estate – Business Unit
ProGreen, through its Mexican subsidiary, Procon, has acquired a tract of land on the Bay of El Rosario in Baja California that covers a total area of approximately 5,000 acres with 4.5+ miles of oceanfront. A Master Plan is being created for a very large resort-type retirement and vacation community with the name “Cielo Mar” that will cover all of this land. Translated into English, Cielo means “heaven” and Mar means “sea”, the Cielo Mar planned community thus being “heaven by the sea.” The first phase of the development of the master plan is underway.

 

Management Team for Cielo Mar Development
Alejandro Espinoza Arroyo will be joining Procon as General Manager for the Cielo Mar development in April of this year. He is currently working as a consultant to Procon, overseeing the production of the topographical plan that is required for creating the Master Plan. Alejandro is an accomplished Civil Engineer who has managed 750 construction projects and 500 public tenders, covering a diverse range of development work for the Municipality of Ensenada, which takes up the majority of the state of Baja California. He was also the Plan Manager for Housing and Topography for all of the area within the municipalities of Tijuana, Tecate, and Rosarito Beaches for several years. In addition to his years of service as a large-scale Plan Manager and Project Manager, Alejandro is a well-known chronicler and historian of El Rosario, Baja California and the surrounding region.

 
 
 




Cielo Mar – The Community
Cielo Mar is planned as a totally green, all-solar gated community, and will likely include the following, (which can be confirmed only when the master plan is completed):

Single Family Residences – est. 7,000 lots
Condominium Developments, Several – est. 3,000 units
Hotels, several – est. 3,000 rooms
Marina – for leisure craft
Golf Courses – 3 expected
Sports & Tennis Center
Bike, Hiking & Walking Trails
Green Areas & Parks
Museum
Equestrian Center
Beach Club
Commercial Center
Fiber Optic High Speed Internet
Water Reservoirs

Cielo Mar Pre-Sales Lot Reservation Offer
We are now offering pre-sales reservations to interested parties for lots in Cielo Mar. Once the master plan has been finalized and published, these reservations will be transferred into purchase agreements. This early offer represents deep discounts, available to first owners in Cielo Mar. Early buyers will in effect be investors in the project and therefore offered exceptional pricing and other special advantages, including first choice among lots in the first execution phase of the development.

About Contel
Jan Telander, President and CEO of ProGreen, has a partnership interest and participates in the management of Contel, which was formed in early 2016. Contel is a partnership between Jan and Flavio Contreras Espinoza, representing an extended family of Mexican land owners. The intent with Jan’s interest in Contel was to provide a suitable entity with which to involve ProGreen for the development of properties in Baja. ProGreen cannot own agricultural properties under Mexican law, though Jan’s partnership interest in Contel provides a level of control with final signing authority, per the partnership agreement.
 
About Procon Baja JV
Procon is ProGreen’s joint venture subsidiary with Contel, and is owned by ProGreen (51%) and Contel (49%) jointly. The company is managed by a board of Managing Directors consisting of three members, two representing ProGreen and one representing Contel. At least two Managing Directors approval is needed for management decisions or major financial transactions, giving ProGreen full operational control. Procon is the holding company for the real estate land acquired for the Cielo Mar development.

 
 
 
 




Business Development Timeline
 
The Baja California, Mexico Map Image to the left shows the key location references for the Business Development Timeline below. The planned community, Cielo Mar, and the agricultural land controlled by the company are in relatively close proximity to El Rosario, approximately 150 miles south of Ensenada. The first ProGreen Farm, Arenoso, is on the main road called the Transpeninsular Highway, Highway 1.
The Business Development Timeline below shows from the bottom starting in 2015 how both the Real Estate and the Agricultural business segments have developed until now, and looking forward. The Baja projects began with early investigation and due diligence into an opportunity presented by Mexican land owners with whom the company made contact, regarding options for monetizing their land.

We anticipate to increase this activity substantially over time. Goals for the next 12-18 months  *  Create a substantial revenue stream from our agriculture land developments in Baja  *  Commence property developments in Baja as well as in the US.  *  Enter into a formal agreement with Soltech Energy Sweden AB and apply their solar technology to suitable properties developed by ProGreen in the US and Baja.  *  Broaden our shareholder base through regular communication and interaction with shareholders and the investment community at large.  *  Get the company moved up to OTCQB and move the company toward a Nasdaq listing.  Transparency towards our shareholders True transparency of the company's activities and progress in respect to shareholders, we see as essential to attract long term investors and create shareholder loyalty. Keep the public well informed with an open line of communication, channeled mainly through our new website ProGreenUS.com, with attached Twitter feed, message board, ticker news, press releases, and share structure (updated first week of every month). We will also expand our exposure to the public through other suitable social media, webinars and investor presentations, reflecting the mission of transparency as well as growth of the company, to serve as a true barometer of PROGREEN. The new PROGREEN Over the past 6 months we have been working very hard with turning the company around and some significant progress has been made. February 13. A joint venture agreement was executed with INMOBILIARIA CONTEL S.R.L.C.V. (CONTEL) for the first tract of land of approximately 300 acres for agriculture use in Baja California, Mexico. The land has since been developed and prepared for active farming with three wells providing an abundance of water (700 Gallons/minute) and is now being actively shown and marketed to potential buyers, with several parties showing serious interest. February 17. The earlier outstanding Convertible Debenture of $476,000, was assumed by EIG Venture Capital Ltd., the company's main shareholder, in exchange for Preferred Stock in the company. February 22. The company signed a capital injection commitment for a total of $300,000 from Jan Telander, CEO of the Company, Ulf Telander, CEO of EIG Venture Capital Ltd., and Frederic Telander, CEO of Soltech Energy Sweden AB, clearly demonstrating confidence and belief in the future of the company. March 8. The acquisition of American Residential Gap LLC (ARG) was finalized, bringing its 14 properties on to PROGREEN's books, adding a net asset value of $1,285,000 to the balance sheet. The acquisition was a pure paper transaction with full payment being made by issuance of Special Preferred Stock to American Residential Fastigheter AB (ARG's previous sole member), convertible into common stock by March 8, 2017. The conversion price will be based on the average market price for the 20 preceding trading days of March 8, 2017. The Preferred Stock can also be paid off in cash. March 28. The last of the "toxic" convertibles with institutional lenders, was fully converted. May 14. A second Joint Venture Agreement was signed with CONTEL for two parcels of land, 235 Ha (588 acres) and 529 Ha (1323 acres) respectively. The land will be prepared and developed for agriculture use, to be leased to growers of produce. June 17. PROCON BAJA JV was formed in Ensenada, Mexico, as a holding company for the JV signed on May 14. The company is owned by PROGREEN to 51% and CONTEL 49%, and will be managed by a board of Managing Directors consisting of three members, with two representing PROGREEN. At all times, at least two directors' approval will be needed for management decisions or financial transactions, giving PROGREEN, in effect, full operational control. As a majority shareholder, PROGREEN will be able to reflect its assets in Baja on the balance sheet. June 23. PROGREEN signs definitive agreement with Tangiers Global, for a $5 million Equity Line. A maximum of 100 million shares will be registered in a S-1 Registration Statement for this funding. A note for $22,000 was also issued to cover the cost of the registration statement. The Note is convertible into common stock after six months, at a fixed price of $0.03. Tangiers was also issue 4 million warrants as commitment fee, with a strike price of $0.02. New direction in Michigan With steadily rising property prices here in Michigan, we find that rents cannot keep up at the same rate, resulting in lower yielding properties, if based on present values. This has led us to a change of direction. Many potential home buyers are still today unable to obtain conventional mortgages and are therefore practically excluded from the property market. We have concluded that offering our rental properties for sale with seller financing, can be very beneficial for the company. We are able to obtain higher prices than with conventional financing, with very limited competition in the market place of properties with this type of financing. Recently sold two of our properties were sold with land contracts and a third is expected to close in July. Outlook for the rest of 2016 We have now commenced work in Baja on the second JV tract of land of some 1900 acres, with 500-800 estimated to be suitable as prime agriculture land. Initially we will be preparing the access road (6 miles), clearing land and drilling wells. PROGREEN is currently also looking at a number of different options, to find a suitable builder/contractor to partner up with for investment opportunities with solar technology and energy efficiency. We have an established a relationship with Soltech Energy Sweden AB, and are aiming to implement their Solar Shingle Technology in future building projects. It is our goal to up-list off of the pink sheets to the OTCQB in the near future and show investors that we are building a strong company with a clean balance sheet as well as a steady revenue streams.
