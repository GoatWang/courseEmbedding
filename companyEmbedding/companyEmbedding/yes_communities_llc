GIC Reportedly In Talks To Buy Yes
Jun 28 16
GIC Pte. Ltd. is in talks to buy Yes Communities, Inc. in a $2 billion deal, according to people familiar with the matter. GIC is in talks to buy Yes from Stockbridge Capital Group, LLC, the people said. The deal has not been finalized, and the talks could still break down, the people said. If completed, the deal would highlight the appeal of manufactured housing, a niche residential real-estate business that has been stigmatized to an extreme, according to some investors by its association with trailer parks. If GIC’s purchase of Yes goes through at the price being negotiated, GIC would get an initial yield from the company of slightly more than 6%, people familiar with the matter said. Gary McDaniel, Chief Executive of Yes, declined to comment. Executives with GIC and Stockbridge didn’t return calls seeking comment.

You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.

Our Culture Inspires Residents to say "YES!"



Watch Video




 



YES! is the Manufactured Housing Institute's "Community Operator of the Year" 8 Years Running!


Say YES! to
Spacious Homes
Imagine your own home nestled in the perfect spot, with your own yard, a place for your pet to play and your own parking spot. At YES! Communities you'll be welcomed to keep a pet, decorate as you see fit or start your own flower or vegetable garden. Our homes are comfortable, attractive and built to fit all types of lifestyles with 1, 2, 3 and 4 bedroom models available.


Say YES! to Pets
We know that your pets are a part of your family and we welcome them to our communities. Pets can enjoy your spacious yard and at some of our communities, we even have dog parks!  Learn more about our pet policy on the About YES! page.


Say YES! to Community
We offer our residents a sense of community with organized events for all ages, amenities such as pools, clubhouses, and playgrounds that you will not typically find in an apartment. We even offer activity centers at some communities for children and adults!


Say YES! to Customer Service
Saying YES! to our residents has never been about delivering a baseline of customer service, rather it is about providing them with personalized and professional support that goes above and beyond what they expect. We are not only saying YES! to our customers, we are giving them more than they ever imagined!




 




What Makes YES! Different?


We pride ourselves on offering residents an experience they cannot find anywhere else, the YES! Experience. This means saying YES! when other communities say no.
