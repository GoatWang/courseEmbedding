Fannie and Freddie.Yesterday the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit handed down an odd decision in a lawsuit over the government's nationalization of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The key issue is what's called the "Third Amendment," the 2012 transaction by which the government converted its previous bailout of Fannie and Freddie -- which paid a 10 percent dividend that in practice ate up more than all of their profits -- into an effective nationalization by which all of their profits were automatically "swept" to the government. This amendment was controversial, and for good reason; it seemed like an unfair re-trading of the deal that Fannie and Freddie had made with the government. People who had invested in the companies' preferred shares, hoping they'd be worth something when the companies returned to profitability, were understandably aggrieved, and sued.They faced an uphill battle, though, because the statute that authorized the bailout, the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008, says that "no court may take any action to restrain or affect the exercise of powers or functions" of the government "as a conservator or a receiver" for Fannie or Freddie. The bulk of the D.C. Circuit opinion is devoted to finding that this means what it says, and that therefore the court can't undo the profit sweep in the Third Amendment. The shareholders, and the very strange dissenting opinion, argue that this provision doesn't apply because the government wasn't really acting as a conservator: A conservator is supposed to conserve the business, not liquidate it, and by giving all of the profits to the Treasury, the government was engaged in a "de facto liquidation" of the entities.








This strikes me as a confusion about what an entity is. Fannie and Freddie haven't been liquidated. They've been "conserved" quite nicely. Too nicely: Lots of people wish they would have been wound up by now, but here they are.Of course the shareholders have been zeroed, but no one thought that the government was supposed to conserve Fannie and Freddie on behalf of the shareholders. If you think of a corporation as essentially a relationship between a business and its shareholders, then the actions of the government seem like an obvious failure of conservatorship. But there's no particular reason to think of Fannie and Freddie that way. And as enterprises, as businesses, as functioning mortgage-market entities, they've been "conserved" just fine.But then there's a second part of the opinion, sending the case back to the district court to consider whether Fannie and Freddie, in signing the Third Amendment, violated the "implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing" by throwing their preferred shareholders under the bus. The preferred shareholders sort of had a right to dividends: The decision to pay dividends or not was in the "sole discretion" of Fannie's or Freddie's board, but the dividends were expected in the ordinary course if the enterprises were profitable and well capitalized. And there's a background obligation for companies like Fannie and Freddie to, in essence, treat their shareholders fairly with respect to those dividends, and if they don't the shareholders can sue for damages. (Which, unlike undoing the Third Amendment, is not prohibited by HERA -- although damages in lieu of dividends might come to much the same thing.) So the court sent the case back "for the district court to evaluate it under the correct legal standard, namely, whether the Third Amendment violated the reasonable expectations of the parties at the various times the class plaintiffs purchased their shares."




That seems awfully squishy, and open to interpretation based on your prior preferences. If you think the Third Amendment was a lawless seizure of private property for the government, then this decision offers a lot of hope that the shareholders will get their money back. If you think the government's dealings with Fannie and Freddie were a juddering but basically reasonable effort to respond to a massive crisis at government-backed enterprises, then you probably don't think that the government violated any obligation of good faith and fair dealing. The fact that the district judge dismissed this case once suggests that he's more in the latter camp, but who knows. In any case, the common and preferred shares of Fannie and Freddie fell yesterday, suggesting that shareholders were hoping for better from this decision.One of the strangest parts of the decision is the caption: It's Perry Capital LLC v. Mnuchin, because Steven Mnuchin, the new Treasury Secretary, is now the government official responsible for the Fannie and Freddie mess. But he had nothing to do with the Third Amendment, or the initial bailout, or with any of the enterprises' long bitter history. He was also, at last disclosure, an investor in a hedge fund that owns Fannie and Freddie shares, though he planned to divest. He has been a little coy about the administration's plans for Fannie and Freddie, but my suspicion is that the shareholders' best chance to recover will come from negotiating with Mnuchin, not suing him.




Kraftilever.The Financial Times has a fascinating recap of this past weekend's failed Kraft Heinz Co. bid for Unilever, which has a little something for everyone. For instance, if you are interested in short-termism and long-termism, Unilever Chief Executive Officer Paul Polman and Kraft Heinz's backers at 3G Capital offer a nice contrast:By investing in its brands and promoting initiatives such as environmental sustainability, Mr Polman has sacrificed short-term profits for longevity. In contrast, 3G has rapidly transformed the consumer industry by slashing costs, cutting jobs and raising profit margins.There is the tactical chess game between bidder and target that, when written down, sounds a little thin:The group studied 3G-backed takeovers and concluded Kraft Heinz would try to seem as friendly as possible and then increase its bid in increments until there was sufficient pressure from Unilever investors. This was 3G’s modus operandi. “We didn’t want to get in that situation, so we needed to hit them early. Our best chance was to get them off the pitch early,” said another person involved in the company’s defence.That is: Kraft Heinz would be polite and try to bid enough to buy Unilever without overpaying, and Unilever's best bet to get rid of them was to say no. Those tactics ... do not seem ... like ... rocket science? And yet Unilever engaged an army of advisers. Some of this is just, if you are fighting an existential battle for survival, more advice can't hurt. But some of it is also: You can't run a multinational corporation on your CEO's knee-jerk aversion to selling to a rival. The more banks you can get to analyze Kraft Heinz's bid and opine that it's unfair, the firmer ground you're on when you say no. There is a fiduciary-process focus that probably protects shareholders (here, Unilever's bankers "came to understand what the US company was attempting to pull off": Synergies on the packaged-food business "were enough to justify a big premium for the whole company," giving Kraft Heinz "the rest of Unilever effectively for no premium"), though there's always a suspicion that the bankers are just telling the CEO what he wants to hear to confirm his initial knee-jerk reaction.Speaking of advisers, being a consumer-goods giant has some advantages in M&A:Back in London on Saturday, as Mr Polman tapped into his network of contacts, he was informed that Finsbury was working with Kraft Heinz on PR. Within seconds, Mr Polman blasted off an email to Sir Martin Sorrell, the founder and chief executive of WPP, the advertising company that counts Unilever as one of its most important clients. Finsbury, which is majority owned by WPP, was removed from the Kraft Heinz side by the end of the day.The story of how the news broke even implicates the Second Law of Insider Trading:But by last Wednesday, some investors and journalists had been notified about unusually high options trading in Unilever’s US-listed shares.That law is of course: "If you have inside information about an upcoming merger, don't buy short-dated out-of-the-money call options on the target," but breaking it is apparently irresistible.1-or-30!It seems to be a real thing, including at Gotham Asset Management:The firm is in talks with some investors for its Gotham Neutral Strategies hedge fund about charging one fee: the greater of a 1 percent management fee or 30 percent of returns that exceed the fund’s benchmark, according to two people familiar with the matter. The equity fund currently charges 1.5 percent of assets in management fees and 20 percent of profits, one of the people said.And it's catching on:As of mid-February, at least 16 multi-billion-dollar hedge funds worldwide are either in the process of implementing or have implemented the 1-or-30 fee structure that was introduced to the industry in the fourth quarter of 2016, Jonathan Koerner of Albourne Partners said in a telephone interview on Feb. 16.One basic point to make here is that those fees are just lower. If you consistently return double your benchmark, a performance fee of 20 percent of profits will be higher than a performance fee of 30 percent of profits in excess of the benchmark. (The breakeven is when you return triple your benchmark.) And of course a management fee of 1.5 percent of assets will be higher than a management fee of zero, because you just get the performance fee. This structure isn't cheaper in all scenarios, and if you're a consistently amazing hedge fund manager you might prefer it to 2 and 20. But if you're really that consistently amazing, you can just go ahead and charge 3 and 50. In most cases, the 1-or-30 is not so much a reshuffling of fees to better align incentives as it is a fee cut.This of course makes sense: The main complaint about hedge fund fees is just that they're too high. Cutting from 2 and 20 to 1 and 10 would lower them, but it would also be a little embarrassing and set a bad precedent. The name of the game, in so much of financial services, is "fee discipline." Raising one of the numbers, in a way that likely lowers the overall fees, lets the managers save some face.Numeraire!Ah this is cute:Numerai has distributed Numeraire—1,000,000 tokens in all—to 12,000 participating scientists. The higher the scientists sit on the leaderboard, the more Numeraire they receive. But it’s not really a currency they can use to pay for stuff. It’s a way of betting that their machine learning models will do well on the live market. If their trades succeed, they get their Numeraire back as well as a payment in bitcoin—a kind of dividend. If their trades go bust, the company destroys their Numeraire, and they don’t get paid.The new system encourages the data scientists to build models that work on live trades, not just test data. The value of Numeraire also grows in proportion to the overall success of the hedge fund, because Numerai will pay out more bitcoin to data scientists betting Numeraire as the fund grows.Numerai is one of several quant-crowdsourcing firms, "a hedge fund in which an artificially intelligent system chooses all the trades" and "several thousand anonymous data scientists compete to create the best trading algorithms" to populate that AI system. Like lots of hedge funds, it has an incentive-based compensation system for its analysts/portfolio managers/scientists/whatever. And like lots of incentive-based compensation systems, this one has components both for individual performance (you get more compensation the better you do) and firm performance (the value of your compensation grows in proportion to the overall success of the hedge fund), and can be clawed back if your trades go bust. Again, this is pretty standard. Hedge funds can pay analysts in the form of a share in the hedge fund itself: The better they do, the bigger share they get; the better the fund does, the more their share is worth; if they go bust, they forfeit their share. There are nuances, but this is essentially a solved problem in hedge-fund compensation.But you can always just call it a cryptocurrency, and have it pay dividends in bitcoin, and set it up on the Ethereum blockchain, because blockchain blockchain blockchain blockchain blockchain. In the future, all equity will be renamed "cryptocurrency." Why buy shares in Uber Technologies Inc. when you can buy Ubercoins, which allow you to participate in the profits of Uber and which trade on the blockchain, the blockchaaaaaaain? Blockchain! Anyway I appreciate, and am also annoyed by, the little joke in the name "Numeraire." I submit to you that Numeraire is no one's numéraire.Slang.Here is an article about how SecDB, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s proprietary trade database/pricing model/general repository of knowledge, is actually a little on the antiquated side:“You have to understand that SecDB is an amazing platform with tons of genius ideas, but that it’s 26 or 27 years old,” says one former Goldman insider. “There were a lot of technology choices that were great for the business in the 1990s and 2000s, but things are different now. Back then, for example, you might have had a couple of hundreds of thousands of trades a day, but now – in electronic FX trading – you might have a million trades a day. How do you scale a system that was built to work with 100,000s of thousand of trades to millions? This is the problem for GS.”One particular problem is that SecDB was built before the rise of the Python programming language, and is mostly written in Slang, Goldman's proprietary language. This makes it more difficult for Goldman to use open-source software for things like machine learning, and also makes it harder to hire and train programmers. I mention this mostly because I like the fact that Goldman has a proprietary language called Slang. (Disclosure: I used to work at Goldman, and I liked that fact then too, though I cannot claim to be much of a Slang programmer.)Auto lending.Will the next financial crisis come from a bubble in auto lending? Ehh, I don't know, I think it would be a little too cute to have two U.S. financial crises in a row that are both precipitated by securitized loans to consumers to finance durable-goods purchases. Financial crises usually show more creativity than that. The next crisis will probably be in something weird, like clearinghouse collateral or bond market illiquidity. But "the country’s auto debt hit a record in the fourth quarter of 2016, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, when a rush of year-end car shopping pushed vehicle loans to a dubious peak of $1.16 trillion," and "delinquencies among lower-rated borrowers have risen to the highest level since 2009," so if you want to worry about it go ahead.While I have you here, though, I should say that a reader pointed out a glaring omission in my discussion of auto lending and smart contracts yesterday: self-driving cars! In the fairly near future, if you borrow money to buy a car, and you miss a payment, the car will just tootle on back to the dealer's lot. There'll be no GPS tracking or ignition override or anything messy like that; the car will just execute the contract itself. The future will be amazing, but also kind of tough.People are worried about unicorns.I enjoyed this Benedict Evans post contrasting Snapchat with Facebook and Google, in part because it has echoes of the active/passive debate in investing. I mean, he uses those terms: Snap is "a swing from passive consumption ('I'm bored - what's in the newsfeed?') to creation (hence opening the app into the camera)." But more fundamentally, Evans talks about the big internet companies as being indexes of human behavior, reflecting their users' preferences rather than shaping them. He says that Instagram is following Facebook and Google and becoming "another index, or mirror - moving towards the behaviour of billions of people instead of the behaviour of millions of people, and to surfing users rather than prescribing for them." Snapchat, on the other hand, is not an index. "Instead of asking where metrics, data and algorithms take us," Evans writes, "Snap is looking for creation":So, one question for Snapchat is whether you can get to a billion users without being an index, no matter how many new things you create? Is the risk not that it gets overtaken by Facebook but that it can't generalise enough? That's obviously a specific concern with the specific character of the user experience today ('too hard for anyone over 25'), but it's also a much more basic question with the character of the product vision - can you scale from having insight and product vision around 150m people to having them for everyone? Meanwhile, Snap Inc. seems to be having a tough time on the roadshow for its initial public offering ("They sort of danced around the issue with user growth," says one investor), which of course means that the deal will be many times oversubscribed, upsized, and priced above the offering range. "At a meeting open to all Uber Technologies Inc. employees on Tuesday, Travis Kalanick apologized for cultural failings at his company after a former employee alleged she was harassed and discriminated against while working there." Here is a Recode deep dive into human resources at Uber. Here is the story of a Hong Kong IPO that "rose 543 percent on its public market debut," which is too much. And: unicorn lattes.People are worried about bond market liquidity.Here is a QuickTake Q&A on "Why Biggest U.S. Creditors Are Selling Treasuries," which is liquidity-ish.Things happen.
