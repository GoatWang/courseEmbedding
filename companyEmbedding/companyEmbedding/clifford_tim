Tim Clifford




Tim Clifford is a native New Yorker who has taught English for the last 18 years in New York City schools. His experience has given him insight into teaching writing skills to diverse populations. As a middle-school English teacher, he felt the need for resources specifically targeted to students in this age group, and so he decided to fill the gap by writing his first book, The Middle School Writing Toolkit. He is also the author of Crafting Opinion and Persuasive Papers (Maupin House), three books from Rourke's Let's Explore Science series, and three volumes from Rourke's World of Science Encyclopedia.    Tim is a graduate of SUNY/New Paltz, where he earned his B.A. in English. He earned a Masters degree in English/Secondary Education from the City University of New York at Queens College.
