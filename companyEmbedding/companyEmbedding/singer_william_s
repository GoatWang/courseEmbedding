Bill Singer: Political Maverick Now Practices Law Of Clout - tribunedigital-chicagotribune




 



Bill Singer: Political Maverick Now Practices Law Of CloutMarch 31, 1985|By Paul Galloway.Bill Singer looks terrific these days--trim, well-tailored, prosperous. At 44 he never has been in better health. Almost every morning he jogs in Lincoln Park, and last fall he went the distance in the Chicago marathon.He weighs 150 pounds, which is 30 pounds less than he weighed a decade ago when he was alderman of the 43d Ward and, as the standard-bearer for the city`s independent movement, became the final candidate to challenge Richard J. Daley, who was seeking an unprecedented sixth term as mayor.Singer was a political wunderkind who in 1969, as a 29-year-old novice, had upset the Daley machine in a special North Side aldermanic election. Three years later he and the Rev. Jesse Jackson led a group of insurgents in a bitter dispute over seats to the Democratic National Convention, successfully replacing Daley and his delegates.For most realists Singer was just another sacrificial lamb, but for many liberals the 1975 mayoral race was the match-up they had been waiting for: It was David against Goliath, right versus wrong, the sunlight of reform breaking through the dark clouds of patronage, the future versus the past.Except that, as expected, it came out differently from the original version. This time Goliath decked David. It wasn`t even close, something like 2-to-1. It was the first election Singer had lost, and it was to be Daley`s last hurrah. Within two years he was dead.Much, to put it mildly, has happened since. There have been new alignments, great upheavals and stunning surprises. Two reform candidates have been elected mayor since Daley`s death, and neither has been William S. Singer.He has always been a presence, and an influential one, has always been active, but in the years since his defeat by Daley he has changed more than his weight, in 1980 making a decision that startled some people and sharply altered the course of his career.He joined Kirkland & Ellis, with its 300 lawyers one of the largest and most successful law firms in the nation and a symbol of establishment influence. He is a partner there, representing, among others, some very large, very successful corporate clients.Says Singer: ``When it happened, half the people said, `My God, how could Bill Singer go to Kirkland & Ellis?` And the other half said, `My God, how could Kirkland & Ellis take Bill Singer?` ``The result has been a transformation from political maverick to power broker, from an outsider at City Hall to a well-connected insider who has considerable clout on a number of issues.One is cable television. As head of an independent study commission on cable TV, Singer was instrumental in drafting the city`s highly praised guidelines, and he remains in a highly important position as chairman of the Cable Access Corp., which, with a guaranteed budget of $1 million a year from cable franchise holders, has jurisdiction over public-access channels and programming.At City Hall his main clout is Ald. Edward Vrdolyak (10th), a political opponent from the Daley days and arch-villain for many of Singer`s former allies.They are an unlikely, but effective, duo, having worked together on several ordinances, two of the most notable of which are a bill mandating residential smoke detectors and the cable TV legislation. They are close friends, talking regularly, arguing, offering advice, each probably trying to use the other.Some of the old troops in the army of reform are downright shell-shocked by this alliance. In 10 years of surprises Singer has become one of the biggest. It`s as though David not only had defected to the Philistines but also, even worse, had become buddy-buddy with Goliath himself, today`s Goliath being, of course, Vrdolyak.One such former comrade is James Chapman, state chairman of the Independent Voters of Illinois-Independent Precinct Organization and a supporter of Mayor Washington.``I go back to 1968 with Bill,`` Chapman says. ``If it weren`t for him, I wouldn`t have had the involvement I`ve had with independent politics. I still consider him a friend. I have fond and deep memories, but now we find ourselves on extremely different sides of the political fence. I wish he weren`t with Vrdolyak, which clearly splits us philosophically.``Another former supporter is Don Rose, a left-liberal-reform political operative and consultant, whose assessment of Singer is harsh.``I think Bill Singer is one of the clearest examples of a sellout,``Rose says. ``When he moved to Kirkland & Ellis he began to get a taste of power and money. After his mayoralty defeat he was still riding high and still looked on as the leader of the independent movement, but he began to move in the social set with the liberal uppercrust. He developed a high-living style. For the last five or six years, he`s liked playing both sides.``Leon Despres, a former independent alderman from the South Side who served in the City Council with Singer, sees no abandonment of principles, no defection.1 | 2 | 3 |  Next
