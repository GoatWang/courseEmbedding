SPX Corporation (NYSE: SPXC) is a diversified, global supplier of infrastructure equipment in heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC), and detection and measurement markets, and a strong presence in power and energy markets. With operations in about 20 countries and approximately $1.7 billion in revenue for 2015.
History[edit]
SPX was founded in 1912 in Muskegon, Michigan, as the Piston Ring Company.[1] The company designed and manufactured original equipment components for Detroit’s largest car companies, and quickly earned a reputation for quality products[citation needed] serving the rapidly developing automobile industry.
After acquiring Accuralite Company in 1931, the company changed its name to "Sealed Power Corporation" and also started manufacturing piston rings, pistons and cylinder sleeves for various military applications. By the 1950s, the company had distributors in every state and in more than 40 countries. At the time, Sealed Power products were used as original equipment in more than 80 percent of American-made cars and trucks.[1]
By 1988, and after a number of strategic acquisitions to further diversify the company into a replacement parts and specialty service tool manufacturer, the company changed its name to SPX Corporation. For the next 10 years, they remained a U.S.-centric automotive component manufacturer with nearly $1 billion in sales.[1]
In 1998, a series of additional acquisitions and "focused organic growth" helped SPX diversify even further into flow technologies and thermal equipment and services.[1]
In 2012, SPX sold its Service Solutions business for approximately 1.15 billion dollars to Robert Bosch GmbH.[2]
On October 29, 2014, SPX announced that its Board of Directors had unanimously approved a plan for a tax-free spin-off of its Flow Technology reportable segment, its Hydraulic Technologies business, and certain segments of its corporate subsidiaries. The spin-off transaction was completed on September 26, 2015.

                    SPX SAYS REVENUE ROSE MORE THAN EXPECTED                
SPX Corporation, a maker of power transformers, broadcast antennas and industrial equipment, said that fourth-quarter revenue rose about 10 percent from the year-earlier period, helped by acquisitions and rising demand. SPX said it previously forecast a 6 percent increase. Full-year profit from continuing operations was at least $3.40 a share, in line with estimates, the company said. In 2002, SPX reported a profit of $3.33 a share, excluding a change in accounting. Excluding acquisitions, sales in the fourth quarter would have risen about 6 percent, the company said. Fourth-quarter sales climbed 18 percent at SPX's service-solutions business and 12 percent at the flow-technology unit, the company said. SPX is based in Charlotte, N.C.

Microsoft has agreed to pay $60 million to the Imagexpo unit of the SPX Corporation to end a legal fight over a patent for real-time conferencing software. A jury in Richmond, Va., in November told Microsoft to pay Imagexpo $62.3 million for impermissibly using the company's patented technology in the NetMeeting Whiteboard features in Microsoft programs. That amount could have been tripled, because the jury determined that Microsoft's use of the Imagexpo's invention was intentional.

The Computer Network Technology Corporation, which provides software and hardware for computer storage networks, agreed yesterday to buy the Inrange Technologies Corporation for about $190 million in cash, to add networking services.

The price is 4.1 percent above Inrange's closing price Friday of $2.22. The purchase will allow Computer Network to provide more products that help speed connections between computer and telecommunications networks, the company said. As a result of the acquisition, Computer Network will raise its 2003 profit forecast from the 17-cent average estimate of analysts polled by Thomson Financial, the chairman and chief executive officer, Thomas G. Hudson, said. Shares of Computer Network fell $1.95, or more than 27 percent, to $5.10. Inrange shares rose 6 cents, to $2.28. Computer Network plans to cut an undisclosed number of sales, information technology and administrative jobs as part of the purchase, Mr. Hudson said, without being more specific.

                    SNAP-ON, A TOOLS CONCERN, TO PAY SPX $44 MILLION                
Snap-On Inc. said it would pay $44 million to a rival, the SPX Corporation, after a federal arbitrator decided it had improperly used SPX's patented technology for equipment that tests car engines. Snap-On, which makes tools for the automotive maintenance industry, said it would set aside $27.9 million, or 48 cents a share, against fourth-quarter earnings to pay the after-tax cost of the arbitration award. The dispute started in 1996, when Snap-On, which is based in Pleasant Prairie, Wis., accused SPX of infringing its patents and improperly hiring away an executive from the Sun Electric Corporation, a company that Snap-On bought in 1992. SPX, of Muskegon, Mich., countersued, accusing Snap-On of infringing on its patents.

                    Metro Business; SPX Drops Offer for Echlin                
The SPX Corporation yesterday withdrew its hostile takeover bid for rival auto-parts maker Echlin Inc. of Branford, Conn., two days after Echlin agreed to be bought by Dana Corporation in a friendly $4 billion acquisition. SPX, a Muskegon, Mich., maker of auto parts, had announced its bid in February. Echlin tried to thwart SPX, first through the Connecticut Legislature and then in Federal court.











                    Dana Offers $3.6 Billion in Stock for Echlin                
The Dana Corporation, one of the largest domestic makers of automotive parts and supplies, made a friendly $3.6 billion acquisition offer yesterday for its competitor Echlin Inc., topping a hostile $3.1 billion bid from the SPX Corporation. If approved by shareholders and regulators, the offer could end a battle for control of Echlin that began when SPX, which is based in Muskegon, Mich., began a takeover attempt in February. Then, SPX, which sells auto parts and diagnostic equipment, offered holders $48 a share in cash and stock after Echlin management spurned friendly overtures last year.











                    Metro Business; SPX Begins Echlin Offer                
The SPX Corporation formally began yesterday its exchange offer to take over Echlin Inc., the auto parts maufacturer based in Branford, Conn. Under the terms of the offer, Echlin shareholders would receive $12 in cash plus 0.4796 of an SPX share for each share of Echlin stock tendered. Based on the $72.375 a share closing price of SPX stock yesterday, the deal is valued at $46.71 a share, or a total of about $3 billion. Echlin stock closed yesterday at $47.315.











                    SPX Is Seeking Vote On Its Bid for Echlin                
The SPX Corporation asked a Federal court in Connecticut today to force Echlin Inc. to set a date by April 24 for a special meeting of shareholders to vote on new directors who favor SPX's hostile $3 billion takeover bid. Echlin recently said that a Coopers & Lybrand audit showed that only about 2 percent of the Echlin shares claimed by SPX represented ''valid'' demands for a special meeting that needs a minimum of 35 percent shareholder backing. SPX said it had the support of more than 43 percent of Echlin's outstanding shares.

SPX, a Muskegon, Mich., maker of auto parts, had announced its bid in February. Echlin tried to thwart SPX, first through the Connecticut Legislature and then in Federal court.











                    Dana Offers $3.6 Billion in Stock for Echlin                
The Dana Corporation, one of the largest domestic makers of automotive parts and supplies, made a friendly $3.6 billion acquisition offer yesterday for its competitor Echlin Inc., topping a hostile $3.1 billion bid from the SPX Corporation. If approved by shareholders and regulators, the offer could end a battle for control of Echlin that began when SPX, which is based in Muskegon, Mich., began a takeover attempt in February. Then, SPX, which sells auto parts and diagnostic equipment, offered holders $48 a share in cash and stock after Echlin management spurned friendly overtures last year.











                    Metro Business; SPX Begins Echlin Offer                
The SPX Corporation formally began yesterday its exchange offer to take over Echlin Inc., the auto parts maufacturer based in Branford, Conn. Under the terms of the offer, Echlin shareholders would receive $12 in cash plus 0.4796 of an SPX share for each share of Echlin stock tendered. Based on the $72.375 a share closing price of SPX stock yesterday, the deal is valued at $46.71 a share, or a total of about $3 billion. Echlin stock closed yesterday at $47.315.











                    SPX Is Seeking Vote On Its Bid for Echlin                
The SPX Corporation asked a Federal court in Connecticut today to force Echlin Inc. to set a date by April 24 for a special meeting of shareholders to vote on new directors who favor SPX's hostile $3 billion takeover bid. Echlin recently said that a Coopers & Lybrand audit showed that only about 2 percent of the Echlin shares claimed by SPX represented ''valid'' demands for a special meeting that needs a minimum of 35 percent shareholder backing. SPX said it had the support of more than 43 percent of Echlin's outstanding shares.

                NANCY PIERCE            






SPX Corp. (NYSE:SPW) plans to spin off its dominant flow technology operations and create a stand-alone company from that business, leaving the remaining company as an infrastructure business focused mainly on power-industry products and services.
Plans call for the headquarters of both companies to remain in Charlotte, housed in the current SPX building. It is unclear whether either company will retain the SPX name. SPX officials have not yet decided what either business will be called.

"We ... believe this action will create significant value for our shareholders, customers and employees," SPX Chairman and CEO Chris Kearney told analysts during a conference call Wednesday. "We believe the spinoff will provide both companies greater flexibility to focus on and pursue their respective growth strategies."
Chief Financial Officer Jeremy Smeltser told analysts the deal is expected to be completed as soon as late July, although the transition could take as long as a year. The company expects to incur one-time costs of $60 million to $80 million because of the separation.
Leadership plan
Kearney will be chairman and chief executive of the new flow company. That will be the larger of the two new businesses, with annual revenue projected around $3 billion and earnings before taxes, interest, depreciation and amortization estimated at around $365 million.
Gene Lowe, now president of SPX's thermal segment, will be CEO of the Infrastructure company. He has been with SPX since 2008. Michael Mancuso, former chief financial officer of General Dynamics and an SPX board member since 2005, will be chairman of that company's board.
The infrastructure company would have revenue close to $2 billion and EBITDA around $130 million.
"The action accelerates our goal of creating a pure-play flow company that will be well-positioned as a leading provider of flow technologies across three broad end markets," Kearney said. "The remainder of SPX, the future infrastructure company, will also be well-positioned as a global infrastructure platform with market-leading positions."
Kearney and his team have been saying for several years now that SPX's future was in the flow operations, which provide processing systems for the food and beverage industry and pumps, valves and other key components for the oil, gas and electric power industries. The question has long been what would happen to SPX's other divisions.

Activist investors




 


When Kearney took over as CEO in 2004, SPX was at the start of divesting a number of businesses from a company that had grown into a sometimes-unwieldy conglomerate. The company has been focused for some time now on three basic units — flow technology, thermal equipment and industrial products. The last two units will form the new infrastructure company.
Kearney and Smeltser emphasized that the spinoff was the next logical step for the company. The company had been focusing on expanding its flow and thermal operations through late 2012. Then activist investment firm Relational Investors stepped in and started buying up large shares in SPX, criticizing what it called management's "growth at any costs" strategy.
SPX dropped out of negotiations for a major acquisition at that time (though the company never acknowledged the negotiations). It worked with Relational on strategy, even at one point offering to put members of Relational's choosing on the SPX board.
SPX focused more tightly on enhancing returns. And the spinoff appears designed to further that goal. Breaking the company in two divisions makes each piece freer to pursue individual growth strategies.
Clear plays
The separation also makes each company a clearer investment play in different industries.
One analyst on the call even suggested that the flow business could become an acquisition target, though Kearney and Smeltser emphasized that both new companies are being set up with capital and debt structures to be successful stand-alone businesses.
The considerations that led to the decision to divide the company appear similar to those that have Charlotte-based The Babcock & Wilcox Co. contemplating a similar move.
B&W (NYSE:BWC) is looking at separating its power-industry operations from its government contracting lines of business. Again in that case, there have been significant acquisitions by activist investors pressing for greater attention to shareholder returns. B&W, like SPX, has focused more on streamlining operations and is expected to disclose additional information about a possible separation of its basic business lines next week, when it announces its third-quarter earnings.
