ukdeNicole Richie's $3.5 Million Home Is Just As Bold As She Is Erin FitzpatrickPhoto: Matt Baron/BEImages.One peek at Nicole Richie and Joel Madden's Laurel Canyon home, and you immediately wonder why anyone would ever want to leave. But, Trulia reports that the stylish couple is moving on to greener pastures and selling the house for $3.5 million. The reason? Reportedly, it's to live closer to Madden's brother Benji and wife Cameron Diaz in Beverly Hills. (Okay, maybe bonding with family is a good enough excuse to ditch the stunning abode.) The four-bedroom, five-bathroom house they're leaving behind boasts a cool, loft-style living room with sky-high ceilings. The over-5,000-square-foot home also has a killer backyard oasis with a pool. Click through to take a peek at the property, and get ready for some serious real estate envy. 1 of 9Photo: Courtesy of MLS. The unassuming exterior belies the house's next-level details.

Laurel J. Richie, the W.N.B.A. president, is stepping down after more than four years on the job.The league said in a news release Wednesday that Richie was leaving to pursue other opportunities, including work for nonprofit institutions and being an advocate for girls and young women.Beginning next week, Mark Tatum, the deputy commissioner of the N.B.A., will oversee the W.N.B.A. until a new president is hired.“The league’s quality of play and depth of talent have never been better,” Tatum said in a statement. “We remain steadfast in our commitment to achieving growth in fan interest and future business performance reflective of the extraordinary state of the on-court product.”Richie assumed her role with the league in May 2011, becoming the first African-American to lead a major sports league.

Richie’s departure comes about six weeks after N.B.A. Commissioner Adam Silver made public comments about the state of the W.N.B.A., indicating he thought that the league “would have broken through by now” and that it was “not where we hoped it would be.”The league closed out its 19th season with a stellar, five-game W.N.B.A. Finals, which the Minnesota Lynx won and garnered strong ratings.Yet the W.N.B.A. experienced its lowest average attendance in the league’s history. Some of that was because San Antonio moved arenas while its home court was being renovated.Richie faced several challenges this past year, including the star Brittney Griner being arrested for domestic violence and then her brief marriage to her fellow All-Star Glory Johnson. Griner and Johnson were suspended seven games.Diana Taurasi was paid by her Russian team to skip the W.N.B.A. season. Candace Parker missed the first half of the season to rest.Richie also oversaw the Tulsa Shock’s move to Dallas this year and the purchase of the Los Angeles Sparks by Guggenheim Partners and Magic Johnson Enterprises in 2014.

"The league's quality of play and depth have never been better. We remain steadfast in our commitment to achieving growth in fan interest and future business performance reflective of the extraordinary state of the on-court product."Laurel Richie had been president of the WNBA for five seasons. David Sherman/NBAE/Getty ImagesRichie's departure comes weeks after NBA commissioner Adam Silver made public comments about the state of the league, indicating he thought it "would have broken through by now" and that it is "not where we hoped it would be.""I'm sorry she's leaving," Silver said Wednesday. "She did an excellent job over the last five years, but there remains a lot of work to do. Obviously, I made comments not so long ago about my disappointment. It was not about Laurel in anyway, but where the WNBA stands in its 19th year as we go into its 20th year."My comments were directed at my disappointment having been someone with Val Ackerman and Gary Stevenson who wrote the original business plan for the WNBA. I thought we'd be further along, predicted we'd be further along. Sold to owners in the WNBA and NBA on premise that we'd be further along by now."Silver said it was Richie's choice to leave."Being a commissioner myself, especially in a league where you're battling every minute of every day for an audience for market share, it can wear you down," he said.The league just closed out a tumultuous season that included star Diana Taurasi sitting out after being paid by her Russian team to skip the WNBA schedule; Brittney Griner being arrested for domestic violence, and then her well-publicized marriage to and divorce from fellow WNBA player Glory Johnson; and the Tulsa Shock franchise moving to Dallas.Ratings for the WNBA Finals series between Minnesota, which won its third title, and Indiana were strong, but the league experienced its lowest average attendance in its 19-year history, averaging 7,318 fans per game.The WNBA's 2016 season is expected to be pivotal, as the longest-running women's professional sports league celebrates its 20th anniversary, the return of Taurasi and the presumed entrance of UConn star Breanna Stewart, who probably will be the No. 1 pick in the draft next April."While I'm still in shock, I am thankful for what Laurel has done in her time with the WNBA," Fever star Tamika Catchings said. "Wish her nothing but luck in her future endeavors."Information from The Associated Press was used in this report.

        WNBA president Laurel Richie calls league a 'terrific product'

Laurel Richie has a big task - getting the public to buy into something she never did.A former marketing executive for the Girl Scouts of the USA, Richie was named WNBA president last week despite not having a strong sports background."I am learning along the way," she said during a media teleconference Tuesday. " ... I have been a viewer of (WNBA) games, not necessarily an attender of games."But it was Richie's three decades of marketing experience that led to her being chosen to replace Donna Orender, who announced her retirement in December."We found somebody who was ... culturally adept at understanding what impact the game and the players could have on the community, the global community," said NBA commissioner David Stern, who also participated in the call. "My own basketball background was ripping up my ACL in a lawyers' league. So I don't think it's essential to have played the game at a high level at all."Although funded by the NBA, the WNBA is seeking to break even for the first time in its 15-year history. The season begins in five weeks, and the Tulsa Shock's opener is June 4 at San Antonio."Our teams are doing better than they've ever done," Stern said. "I don't have the specific results in front of me, and many of them are still a bit at a minus. ... We're getting to a point where we think this may be the season where it's break even and better for all of our teams."In 2010, the Shock's first year in Tulsa after relocating from Detroit, attendance at the BOK Center averaged 4,829, the second-worst in the league. Overall, the WNBA averaged 7,834."What's great is sometimes in marketing you have a great product and sometimes you have a not-so-great product," Richie said. "In this case I feel like there's a terrific product to work with, and that makes the job so much easier."It's not without its challenges, but a lot easier than a tough sale."The first black person to become president of a pro sports league, Richie said the position is her dream job." ... My eyes are truly wide open to the challenges ahead," she said. "But I don't really feel daunted by that. I see tremendous opportunity to grow the game by building on what I believe is a very strong foundation."

Laurel J. Richie To Depart WNBA

November 4, 2015



 NEW YORK, Nov. 4 — The WNBA has announced that its President, Laurel J. Richie, will be leaving the league to pursue her other interests serving as a board member of several for-profit and not-for-profit institutions and continuing to be an advocate for girls and young women, effective Nov. 9, 2015.  NBA Deputy Commissioner Mark Tatum will oversee the WNBA on an interim basis, and a search for a new league president will commence immediately.
“We thank Laurel for her five seasons of service and commitment to the WNBA and wish her success in her future endeavors,” said Tatum.  “The league’s quality of play and depth of talent have never been better.  We remain steadfast in our commitment to achieving growth in fan interest and future business performance reflective of the extraordinary state of the oncourt product.”
Richie joined the WNBA in May 2011, becoming the first African-American to lead a major sports league.  She has been recognized as one of the Most Influential African-Americans in Sports by Black Enterprise Magazine, a “Game Changer” by Sports Business Journal, and a “Shot Caller” by Black Girls Rock.
Richie took the helm of the WNBA at a critical time for the league.  During her five seasons, she made important contributions to strengthen the league and its 12 teams, to provide increased visibility for the players, and to celebrate the diversity of the WNBA fanbase.




On Richie’s watch, the WNBA entered into an eight-year Collective Bargaining Agreement with the players (the longest term for such an agreement in the history of the WNBA) and extended its partnership with ESPN through 2025.
Richie’s strategic focus on team marquee partnerships resulted in a record 10 teams with marquee partners (more than twice the number from when she started), which in turn played a pivotal role in increasing the number of teams turning a profit.  Working closely with league staff and team owners, she oversaw the recent transition of the Tulsa Shock to the Dallas Wings, as well as the purchase of the Los Angeles Sparks by Guggenheim Partners and Magic Johnson Enterprises.
Richie led the development of “WNBA PRIDE” in 2014, making the WNBA the first professional sports league to establish an integrated marketing, media, grassroots and social responsibility program for the LGBT community.
“I am proud of what the WNBA has been able to accomplish during my tenure and am grateful for the opportunity to play my part in setting the stage for the 20th season and beyond,” Richie said.  “I was fortunate to work with some very special people, from owners, to league and team staff, to the passionate fans of the WNBA, to the incredibly talented WNBA athletes.  I will forever be a fan of the WNBA and a champion for all it stands for.”

WNBA president Laurel Richie resigns, Mark Tatum interim replacement






















Share

WNBA president Laurel J. Richie has resigned her position, the league announced Wednesday, and will be replaced on an interim basis by NBA deputy commissioner Mark Tatum. 
Richie joined the league in May 2011, following a career as vice president and chief marketing officer for Girl Scouts of the USA. 
“We thank Laurel for her five seasons of service and commitment to the WNBA and wish her success in her future endeavors,” Tatum said in a statement. “The league’s quality of play and depth of talent have never been better. We remain steadfast in our commitment to achieving growth in fan interest and future business performance reflective of the extraordinary state of the on-court product.”
The league said Richie is leaving her position “to pursue her other interests serving as a board member of several for-profit and not-for-profit institutions and continuing to be an advocate for girls and young women.”
The WNBA announced earlier this week that the Tulsa Shock will be known as the Dallas Wings when they relocate next season. The league’s membership stayed stable at 12 teams during ​Richie’s tenure and the Tulsa franchise was the only one to relocate.
