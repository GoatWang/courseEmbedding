Cadence Design Systems, Inc.


                  To keep pace with market demand for more performance and functionality in today’s mobile phones, digital cameras, computers, automotive systems and other electronics products, manufacturers pack billions of transistors onto a single chip. This massive integration parallels the shift to ever-smaller process geometries, where the chip’s transistors and other physical features can be smaller than the wavelength of light used to print them.

Designing and manufacturing semiconductor devices with such phenomenal scale, complexity and technological challenges would not be possible without electronic design automation (EDA). It is essential for everything from verifying that the myriad transistors do what the designer intended to dealing with physical effects on electrons traveling miles of wires with widths sometimes measuring less than 100 nanometers.

Cadence Design Systems is a leading global EDA company. Cadence customers use our software, hardware, and services to overcome a range of technical and economic hurdles.

Our technologies help customers create mobile devices with longer battery life. Designers of ICs for game consoles and other consumer electronics speed their products to market using our hardware simulators to run software on a ‘virtual’ chip—long before the actual chip exists. We bridge the traditional gap between chip designers and fabrication facilities, so that manufacturing challenges can be addressed early in the design stage. And our custom IC design platform enables designers to harmonize the divergent worlds of analog and digital design to create some of the most advanced mixed-signal system on chip (SoC) designs. These are just a few of the many essential Cadence solutions that drive the success of leading IC and electronic systems companies

Todd Brooks - Engineering Supervisor

Todd Brooks, Engineering Supervisor


As an engineering supervisor at Ford and a deployed U.S. Navy Reserve Force intelligence supervisor, Todd has two serious careers. Thankfully, they both compliment each other in many ways.







        
            SCROLL TO EXPLORE
        






            “I learned what it really means to have a second family when I was called to duty… While deployed my Ford team sent me care packages, not only for me, but also with stuffed animals and books for the kids I met while working with families out in the southern towns in Iraq.”
        






                    Todd Brooks

                    Engineering Supervisor, Ford Motor Company








In the Navy and at Ford, Todd is working in a high tech field with global implications. Both of his jobs demand strong leadership skills, good mentoring relationships, the ability to think strategically and a constant drive to push oneself and grow personally.
At Ford, Todd has been leading great teams for over 20 years. On his last project, Todd’s team worked on a technology upgrade to meet upcoming emissions and fuel economy regulations. They developed equipment to take exhaust measurements and help powertrain engineers make the entire Ford product line as clean and efficient as possible.
Todd’s environmentally conscious work is well aligned with his hobby flying sailplanes. In addition to his two careers, Todd serves as flight director for the Sandhill Soaring Club. In one of the club’s composite gliders, he can take to the skies for hours on end flying on nothing but updrafts of warm air. For flight enthusiasts, it’s the ultimate in environmentally friendly sport.
But when he’s not soaring on currents of rising air, Todd is working on some tough problems on the job. He’s led teams to create police cruiser crash safety guards in under 30 hours. He’s succeeded in a difficult transition from his previous role as operations supervisor to his current position as engineering supervisor. And now that he’s deployed overseas again, Todd’s ability to step up and overcome challenges is clearer than ever.
