ENERGY FUNDS

EIG's energy funds focus on providing hybrid debt and structured equity financing solutions to energy projects and companies on a global basis. The funds target directly negotiated private transactions with mid- and large-cap energy companies and projects with an emphasis on transactions underpinned by hard assets, such as proven oil and gas reserves, pipelines, gathering systems, processing facilities, liquefied natural gas terminals, power plants, alternative energy and similar opportunities. The funds have the ability to invest in U.S. dollars, Euros, Pounds Sterling, Canadian dollars and Australian dollars.






HARBOUR ENERGY LTD

EIG and The Noble Group (“Noble”), have joined together to form a new company, Harbour Energy, Ltd. (“Harbour”), which focuses on making control and near control investments in upstream and midstream companies, primarily outside of the United States. Harbour operates at the confluence of three major trends in the global energy industry – new sources of supply, changing trade patterns and changes in the commodity trading industry causing traditional financial intermediaries to exit and independent physical energy trading houses to gain in importance. Harbour is entirely managed by EIG but benefits from Noble’s industry leading expertise in energy trading, logistics and risk management.






CREDIT/DIRECT LENDING

Since 2001, EIG's credit/direct lending vehicles have targeted higher credit quality project finance instruments. These vehicles provide senior and high yield loans to energy and infrastructure projects and companies on a global basis. EIG believes that an ability to make senior, longer duration investments provides a competitive advantage, given that many energy and infrastructure assets have long useful lives and often are supported by stable, contracted cash flows.

Since 1982, EIG has been one of the leading providers of institutional capital to the global energy industry, providing financing solutions across the balance sheet for companies and projects in the oil & gas, midstream, infrastructure, power and renewables sectors globally. EIG has invested more than $23.5 billion in more than 315 portfolio investments in 36 countries. The firm’s deep sector expertise and internal technical capabilities permit EIG to structure creative solutions for our industry partners in complex situations.
Our investment approach, which emphasizes capital preservation and the opportunity to participate in the upside of projects we finance, seeks to generate returns for our investors over multiple business and commodity cycles. Across the funds we manage, EIG has the capability to invest at any place in the capital structure of an energy project or company, from common equity to senior debt. EIG funds typically invest in hybrid debt or structured equity securities but have the flexibility to work with our partners to craft a customized solution to their financing challenge. We typically seek to commit a minimum of $100 million to a project or company and have the capacity to commit $1 billion or more to a single transaction.
EIG is an independent partnership with a distinct culture focused on teamwork, integrity and transparency. We operate as a single investment team and all of our senior professionals have capital committed to our funds. Our senior team has over 440 years of investing experience primarily focused on energy and related infrastructure. The firm has more than 110 employees operating from offices in Washington, DC, Houston, Hong Kong, London, Sydney, Seoul and Rio de Janeiro.
