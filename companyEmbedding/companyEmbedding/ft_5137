Frame Size Information
If you look on the inside of the arm of your glasses you find will something that looks like: 52 [] 16 135.
This is information on the size of your glasses: the lens diameter, the bridge width and the arm length, all measured in millimetres.



The Eye Width, or Lens Diameter, is the width of the lens (in mm), measured from the bridge. (In this example, the Eye Width is 52.)
The Bridge Width is the gap above your nose between the lenses. It should be comfortable. Too tight, and the glasses could pinch your nose; too loose and the glasses will not be stable on your face. (In this example, the Bridge Width is 16.)
The Temple Length, or Arm Length, is usually one of three standards ďż˝ 135, 140 or 145mm. The arm should be long enough to sit comfortably over your ears. Glasses with straight arms do not always have this measurement indicated. (In this example, the Temple Length is 135.)

For the day of 07/28/2017 














Debra Carter (Central New Jersey)






 "I was extremely satisfied with the price, the fantastic customer service, the selection!  I was concerned with certain details of the frame so Customer Service actually called the manufacturer to reassure me while I waited - she went out of her way.  The item was shipped promptly, was beautiful and just exactly as described; I was extremely pleased with the service, price and sunglasses!" 













Freda (Augusta, GA)






 "I am very pleased with my transaction.  Not only did I receive a great deal on my glasses (about $100 cheaper than everywhere else with FREE shipping too), but shipping was super fast as well!  I was a little skeptical about ordering from this site, but I will definitely recommend EZ Contacts to everyone I know!  " 













 adelia (connecticut)






 "The Ray-Ban RB3407 are trendy and classic at the same time. I love the change-up from the classic aviator which I also own. Good buy and better price! IT is my second purchase .and I'll be back "

                    Orlando is a city in the U.S. state of Florida and the county seat of Orange County. Located in Central Florida, it is the center of the Orlando metropolitan area, which had a population of 2,387,138, according to U.S. Census Bureau figures released in March 2016, making it the 24th-largest metropolitan area[9] in the United States, the sixth-largest metropolitan area in the Southern United States, and the third-largest metropolitan area in Florida. As of 2015, Orlando had an estimated city-proper population of 270,934, making it the 73rd-largest city in the United States, the fourth-largest city in Florida, and the state's largest inland city.

The City of Orlando is nicknamed "The City Beautiful," and its symbol is the fountain at Lake Eola. Orlando is also known as "The Theme Park Capital of the World" and in 2014 its tourist attractions and events drew more than 62 million visitors.[10] The Orlando International Airport (MCO) is the thirteenth-busiest airport in the United States and the 29th-busiest in the world.[11] Buddy Dyer is Orlando's mayor.

As one of the world's most visited tourist destinations, Orlando's famous attractions form the backbone of its tourism industry: Walt Disney World, located approximately 21 miles (34 km) southwest of Downtown Orlando in Bay Lake, opened by the Walt Disney Company in 1971; the Universal Orlando Resort, opened in 1999 as a major expansion of Universal Studios Florida. With the exception of Walt Disney World, most major attractions are located along International Drive. The city is also one of the busiest American cities for conferences and conventions; the Orange County Convention Center is the second-largest convention facility in the United States.

Like other major cities in the Sun Belt, Orlando grew rapidly during the 1980s and into the first decade of the 21st century, mostly due to the success of Walt Disney World, which was opened on October 1, 1971. Orlando is home to the University of Central Florida, which is the largest university campus in the United States in terms of enrollment as of 2015. In 2010, Orlando was listed as a "Gamma¿" level of world-city in the World Cities Study Group's inventory. Orlando ranks as the fourth-most popular American city based on where people want to live according to a 2009 Pew Research Center study

                    El Paso Robles is an old town that settled it's first winery approximately 200 years ago.  Downtown Paso Robles is maybe two city blocks with a cute park right in the center.  There is always something going on in downtown almost every weekend.  Sometimes it is a movie night, or the lavender festival or maybe the olive festival.  If there isn't something to find your interests, head to the lake just outside of town.

                    The outskirts of El Paso de Robles (Pass of the Oaks), or Paso Robles, is covered with very old large oak trees with views of wine grapes that seem to stretch for miles. There are many beautiful wineries and vineyards to visit and have wine tastings or event at. Many of them also have downtown tasting rooms. The town is a mix of new and old style. With many wonderful dining choices downtown next to the park and the movie theater. They put on heritage days, wine and food festivals, a large Fourth of July Celebration, and Christmas parade. The town has grown quite a bit since I was younger but has still kept its charm. And of course there is the biggest event of San Luis Obispo County our California Mid-State Fair! It is 1 and a half weeks of rodeo events, rides, livestock shows, shopping, concerts, and family events such as talent shows, zoo to you, and face painting. They have also added wine tastings and wine competitions. If you are looking for something to do to get out of the heat there is Lake Nacimiento, Lake San Antonio, and The Ravine Water Park. While the summer event never seem to end the winter and spring are calmer and more relaxed.
