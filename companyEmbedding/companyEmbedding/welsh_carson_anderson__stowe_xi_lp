Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe ("WCAS") was formed in 1979
and focuses on investing in two growth industries:
(i) healthcare and (ii) technology and
technology-enabled services, primarily in the United States. WCAS
has a current portfolio of approximately 25 companies and has
organized 16 limited partnerships with total capital of over $22
billion, consisting of 12 Equity Partnerships and 4 Subordinated
Debt Partnerships. We are currently investing an equity fund,
Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe XII, L.P.
  
 Our strategy is to (i) buy growth businesses, (ii) partner with
outstanding management teams and (iii) build value for our
investors through a combination of operational improvements,
internal growth initiatives and strategic acquisitions. WCAS
differentiates itself from other private equity firms by our
industry specialization, investment track record, growth oriented
and operational focus, repeat management teams and the continuity
and financial commitment of our firm.
  
 WCAS emphasizes strong alignment of interests with our Limited
Partners. The WCAS General Partners and other WCAS professionals
represent the second largest investor in WCAS XI and are one of the
largest investors in WCAS XII with a $180 million commitment to the
Partnership. Our investors include prominent public and private
pension funds, banks, insurance companies, university endowments,
sovereign wealth funds and other institutional investors. Most of
our investors have participated in several WCAS Partnerships.

Healthcare
 
WCAS seeks to invest in market-leading healthcare companies that
(i) reduce healthcare costs, (ii) increase quality of care or
service, (iii) enable payors and/or providers to improve
efficiencies and (iv) demonstrate proven business models with
strong unit-level economics.  We have found that by targeting
highly fragmented, complex or inefficient sectors with a
combination of capital, strong management, and strategic vision, we
can create operating models and businesses that deliver substantial
value to patients, providers, payors and shareholders.
 
Some examples of healthcare sectors in which we invest include
facilities, providers, payors and medical technology.  In
addition, we invest in healthcare information technology, which
leverages both our healthcare and technology expertise.
 
Technology
 
WCAS defines technology and technology-enabled services to
include a very large and dynamic universe of companies that provide
services to other companies.  We focus on business-to-business
models where a target company's client base consists of other
businesses (and not consumers). We target investments in companies
with (i) attractive organic and acquisition-related growth
opportunities, (ii) strong recurring revenue and free cash flow,
(iii) high operating leverage and (iv) defensible market positions.
 We believe that our portfolio companies deliver value to
their customers by enabling greater growth, improved productivity
and quality as well as higher cost efficiency.  
 
The technology universe includes a number of attractive
subsectors and a wide range of diverse business models. Some
examples of technology sectors in which we invest include payment
processing, financial technology and software.

The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Morgan Stanley advised Alert Logic. Stifel, Nicolaus & Co.  provided financial advice to Welsh, Carson.
PRESS RELEASE
HOUSTON, TX – August 20, 2013 – Alert Logic (www.alertlogic.com), the recognized leader in Security-as-a-Service solutions for the cloud, and Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe (“Welsh Carson”), a leading private equity firm, have entered into a transaction in which Welsh Carson and Alert Logic’s executive management will own a majority shareholder interest in Alert Logic. Selling shareholders include Updata Partners, Covera Ventures, Mercury Fund, OCA Ventures, Access Venture Partners, and Industry Ventures.
Alert Logic’s existing management team, led by chairman, president and CEO, Gray Hall, will continue to operate the business. “Our partnership with Welsh Carson allows Alert Logic to continue increasing the scale of our business to meet the high demand for IT security in the cloud and in virtualized enterprise data centers,” said Hall. “Our strategic focus remains intact and this transaction brings improved access to capital and other resources, positioning us to expand our geographic footprint, strengthen our team and further accelerate growth in our market-leading cloud security offerings.” 





In connection with this transaction, Welsh Carson is also investing additional primary capital in the business.  These new funds will be used to accelerate growth through both geographic and product line expansion. Geographic expansion is intended to include international markets over the next few years.
Alert Logic specializes in providing a portfolio of Security-as-a-Service solutions for customers of hosting and cloud service providers. More than half of the largest managed hosting and cloud service providers use Alert Logic to secure their customer environments, making Alert Logic the market leader for securing infrastructure in hosted and cloud environments.
 
“Alert Logic is uniquely positioned to capture the rapidly growing market demand for securing IT infrastructure in the cloud.  We do not believe that any other company has Alert Logic’s ability to deploy such a broad portfolio of security solutions in any cloud environment, a multi-tenant SaaS delivery platform that has been proven to scale to big data proportions, or a large established channel of leading cloud and hosting service provider partners,” said Michael Donovan, a Welsh Carson General Partner. “These unique assets combined with a strong management team make Alert Logic an ideal platform for capturing market share in one of the fastest-growing segments of the global IT industry.”
 
Alert Logic announced last month that it recorded $10.1 million in GAAP revenue for the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2013, representing a 43 percent increase over the same period in 2012. The Company is currently operating at an annual revenue run-rate of more than $43 million from more than 2,200 customers.  Achieving this scale while maintaining this rapid growth rate validates Alert Logic’s ability to address the unique security requirements of customers of cloud service providers. 





Alert Logic’s Security-as-a-Service solutions provide customers four distinct advantages: market-leading security tools, a fully-managed SaaS delivery model, integrated 24×7 Security Operations Center (SOC) services to monitor and provide expert guidance, and the ability to deploy wherever a customer has IT infrastructure, including the cloud.
The transaction is expected to close by the end of August. Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC served as exclusive financial advisor to Alert Logic on this transaction and Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Inc. served as the exclusive advisor to Welsh Carson.
