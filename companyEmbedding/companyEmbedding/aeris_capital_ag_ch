Our Return Policy
If you need to return your merchandise
for any reason, please notify
MyPilotStore within 30 days of receipt. You can do this by entering the
MyPilotStore Web site and filling out the  merchandise return
form.  No returns will be accepted if the  merchandise return
form has not been completed.

General Return Policy: 


Items must be in new and original condition.
Item must be returned 
  within thirty (30) days of receipt of goods unless otherwise noted below.
All returns must include a 
  Return Merchandise Authorization Number (RMA#) (request 
	RMA#). 

  
All returns must be 100 percent
    complete and contain ALL original 
  manufacturer boxes and manufacturer packing
    materials.
Returns must have original UPC codes on the manufacturer
    boxes and contain all manuals, blank warranty cards and other accessories and documentation 
  that was originally provided by the manufacturer. 
Items Damaged in 
	Transit: All damage claims must be reported to us within 7 days of 
	receiving the merchandise.  Please save all of the shipping boxes if 
	the item(s) were damaged in shipping.  The shipping companies 
	(UPS/FedEx) will come out to inspect the merchandise and the boxes in which 
	they were shipped. 
Please call or email our customer service department for 
	any Damaged / Defective items and we will work to make sure 
	the problem is promptly resolved.
You are responsible for 
  the return shipping.
Items returned that are 
  not in the original or damaged manufacturer packaging are subject to a minimum 15% restocking fee.
Please allow approximately 
  10 business days for your return to be processed once it has arrived at the 
  warehouse.
Holiday Purchases:  
	Items purchased after November 15th can be returned through January 10 of 
	the following year (or 30 days, whichever is later) for 
  credit or exchange unless otherwise noted below.

Product /Category 
Specific Return Policy:
SOFTWARE / VIDEO:  Opened Software and Videos
    may be exchanged within 30 days of your product's shipping date, for the same item
    only. No refunds are available for these items, if opened. 
CHARTS:  Because of the time 
  sensitive nature, none of the FAA, NavCanada, or Jeppesen charts can be returned.  
  Jeppesen chart subscriptions that are cancelled after the first set has been 
  shipped will receive a pro-rated refund based on the time remaining. 
MAGAZINES:  Magazine subscriptions 
  cannot be cancelled or returned once they have been sent to the publisher.  
	Any address changes should be directed to the publisher.
CLOSEOUTS:  Closeout items are marked 
	as "all sales final" and cannot be returned under any circumstance.  Any 
	defects should be directed to the manufacturer under warranty service.
SPECIAL ORDER:  Products specifically 
	noted as "Special Order" cannot be returned for credit.  
CUSTOM MADE:
	 Custom made products 
	such as Seat Covers, Cabin Covers, Sun Shades, or Model Airplanes cannot 
	be returned or cancelled once they have been sent to be custom 
	manufactured.
APPAREL/CREW SHIRTS:  Any
	Van Heusen 
	or crew shirt that is not returned in the original folded condition will be 
	subject to a minimum $6.00 re-stocking fee.  Any garnment that has been 
	laudered is not returnable.
BUNDLES:  Some products are bundled together and 
	sold as one item (i.e. Flight Simulator bundles).  In these cases, 
	substitutions cannot be made and returns can only be accepted as a complete 
	bundle with all pieces originally shipped.  
GARMIN GPS:  
	Garmin GPS units that have not been opened can be returned for a full refund 
	within 30 days from the date of shipment receipt.  Non-defective Garmin 
	GPS units which have been opened are subject to a partial refund of 
	90% of the sale price.  If the software update has been used, the unit 
	is no longer eligible for a refund.
SPOT / SPOT PHONE:  Once the SPOT Satellite 
	Tracker or the SPOT Global Phone have been activated, they are no longer 
	eligible for return.
FLIGHT SIMULATOR 
	HARDWARE:  Flight Simulator Hardware from CH Products or 
	Saitek that have not been opened can be returned for a full refund within 30 
	days from the date of shipment receipt.  Non-defective Flight Simulator 
	Hardware from CH Products or Saitek which have been opened are 
	subject to a partial refund of no more than 85% of the sale price.   
ADVANCED COCKPIT PANEL:  This item cannot be 
	returned once any of the break-away tabs have been removed.
RELIEFBAND, TRAVELJOHN, LITTLEJOHN:  For sanitary 
	and hygiene reasons, we are unable to accept a return on these items once 
	they have been opened.  
GIFT CARD:  Once a gift card has been issued, 
	it may not be returned.  There are no expiration dates on gift cards.

Calculating Your Refund
When the item is returned in
its original condition with all original packaging, your credit card will be credited for the price of the
purchase and any taxes, excluding shipping costs and re-stocking fees. If the return is due to a  MyPilotStore error, the return shipping charges will be waived. 
Many times we charge a 
discounted shipping cost for the original shipment.  If you return an item 
and the outbound shipping cost was greater than you paid, the difference will 
be deducted from your return.  For example, if we charged you $4.95 for 
shipping and our actual shipping cost was $8.50 we will deduct $3.55 ($8.50 
minus $4.95) from the value of the return.

If you need clarification on 
this return policy, please
email us at service@MyPilotStore.com.
