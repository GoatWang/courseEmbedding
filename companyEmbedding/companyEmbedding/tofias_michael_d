If the company isn't reporting the account correctly, you can submit a dispute to the credit bureaus asking them to correct it.

If you were a grad victim you don't need to fill out a fraud package. Google it. And send it to the credit bureaus.

I live on a fixed income. Its very difficult. My father and I are fairly comfortable, but due to the 40+ derogatory items on my credit report, which are all medically related. Lexington law, if you can afford their services, have done soo much for me. In only two months time, they removed 25+ items off my report. Unfortunately I'm unable to continue working with them, due to the roughly $100/mo fee, which is a bit too high for me.… read more

Who is taking it?  If you are just paying taxes and insurance no one can take it from you if you send a letter of intentions and pay what you can every month.  You might put the home up for a fast sale and with the money move into something affordable while paying the six thousand.

Are there really companies you can pay that guarantee to raise your credit score in 2 months or less or they'll double your money back?

and Michael D. Tofias. Messrs. Rexroad and Tofias are referred to as the “Reporting Persons.”   The Reporting Persons have entered into a Joint
Filing, Group and Solicitation agreement (the “Joint Agreement”), a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 1.   (b)Residence or Business Address  The address of the principal business and principal
office of Mr. Rexroad is 970 Reserve Drive, Suite 115, Roseville, CA 95678.   The address of the principal business and principal
office of Mr. Tofias is 25 Cambridge Drive, Short Hills, NJ 07078.   (c)Present Principal Occupation or Employment and the Name, Principal Business and Address of any Corporation or Other Organization

Persons has been convicted in a criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations or similar misdemeanors).   (e)Civil Proceedings   During the past five years, neither of the Reporting
Persons has been a party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or administrative body of competent jurisdiction and as a result of
such proceeding such person was or is subject to a judgment, decree or final order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting
or mandating activities subject to, federal or state securities laws or finding any violation with respect to such laws.   (f)Citizenship   Each of the Reporting Persons are both citizens
of the United States of America.    Page 4 of 9    Item 3. Source and Amount of Funds or Other Consideration.  All
of the shares of Common Stock to which this Statement relates were purchased by the Reporting Persons using their personal funds.
The aggregate purchase price of the 670,743 shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by Mr. Rexroad was $510,899. The
aggregate purchase price of the 1,568,123 shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by Mr. Tofias was $114,495.45.   Item 4. Purpose of Transaction.  The Reporting Persons purchased the shares of
Common Stock for investment purposes.   In pursuing such investment purposes, the Reporting
Persons may further, from time to time, purchase, hold, vote, trade, dispose or otherwise deal in the Common Stock at times, and
in such manner, as they deem advisable to benefit from, among other things, (1) changes in the market prices of the Common Stock;
(2) changes in the Issuer’s operations, business strategy or prospects; or (3) from the sale or merger of the Issuer. To
evaluate such alternatives, the Reporting Persons will closely monitor the Issuer’s operations, prospects, business development,
management, competitive and strategic matters, capital structure, and prevailing market conditions, as well as other economic,
securities markets and investment considerations. Consistent with their investment research methods and evaluation criteria, the
Reporting Persons may discuss such matters with the management or Board of Directors of the Issuer (the “Board”), other
stockholders, industry analysts, existing or potential strategic partners or competitors, investment and financing professionals,
sources of credit, and other investors. Such evaluations and discussions may materially affect, and result in, among other things,
the Reporting Persons (1) modifying their ownership of the Common Stock; (2) exchanging information with the Issuer pursuant to
appropriate confidentiality or similar agreements; (3) proposing changes in the Issuer’s operations, governance or capitalization;
(4) pursuing a transaction that would result in the acquisition of a controlling interest in the Issuer; or (5) pursuing or supporting
one or more of the other actions described in subsections (a) through (j) of Item 4 of Schedule 13D.   In addition to the information disclosed in
this Statement, the Reporting Persons reserve the right to (1) formulate other plans and proposals; (2) take any actions with respect
to their investment in the Issuer, including any or all of the actions set forth in subsections (a) through (j) of Item 4 of Schedule
13D; and (3) acquire additional shares of Common Stock or dispose of some or all of the shares of Common Stock beneficially owned
by them, in each case in the open market, through privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. The Reporting Persons may at
any time reconsider and change their plans or proposals relating to the foregoing.   On August 25, 2016, the Reporting Persons
(under the name Concerned Stockholders of Surge Components, Inc.) submitted a letter to the Issuer (the
“Nomination Letter”) nominating the Reporting Persons for election to the Board at the Issuer’s 2016 Annual
Meeting of Stockholders (the “2016 Annual Meeting”). In the Nomination Letter, the Reporting Persons reserved the
right to further nominate, substitute or add additional persons in the event that (1) the Issuer purports to increase the
number of directorships; (2) the Issuer makes or announces any changes to its by-laws or takes or announces any other action
that purports to have, or if consummated would purport to have, the effect of disqualifying any of the Reporting Persons
as nominees; or (3) any of the Reporting Persons is unable or becomes unwilling for any reason to serve as a director of
the Issuer. The Reporting Persons also submitted stockholder proposals for consideration at 2016 Annual Meeting proposing:
(1) that the Board take all necessary steps (other than steps that must be taken by stockholders) to eliminate the
classification of the Board and to require that all directors be elected on an annual basis; and (2) the repeal of each
provision or amendment to the Issuer’s by-laws adopted by the Board after February 18, 2016, which is the date of the last
publicly available amendment to the Issuer’s by-laws, without the approval of stockholders.    Page 5 of 9     Item 5. Interest in Securities of the Issuer.  (a) and (b)          The responses of the Reporting
Persons to rows 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 13 on the cover pages of this this Statement are incorporated herein by reference. As of the
close of business on August 25, 2016, the Reporting Persons beneficially owned 2,238,866 shares of Common Stock, representing approximately
22.2% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock. The percentage in this paragraph relating to beneficial ownership of Common Stock
is based on 10,098,276 shares of Common Stock outstanding as of June 8, 2016, as reported in the Registration Statement on Form
S-8 filed by the Issuer with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 8, 2016.   Of the shares of Common Stock beneficially
owned by Mr. Rexroad, 30,500 are held by his spouse.   (c)          Except as set forth in Schedule A, none
of the Reporting Persons has effected any transactions in the Common Stock in the last 60 days.   (d)          No other person is known to the Reporting
Persons to have the right to receive or the power to direct the receipt of dividends from, or the proceeds from the sale of, the
shares of Common Stock covered by this Statement.   (e)          Not applicable.   Item 6. Contracts, Arrangements, Understandings or Relationships With Respect to Securities of the Issuer.  Except for the Joint Agreement and other than
as described in this Statement, to the knowledge of the Reporting Persons, there are no contracts, arrangements, understandings
or relationships (legal or otherwise) among the Reporting Persons or between the Reporting Persons and any other persons with respect
to any securities of the Issuer, including but not limited to transfer or voting of any of the securities, finder’s fees,
joint ventures, loan or option arrangements, puts or calls, guarantees of profits, division of profits or loss, or the giving or
withholding of proxies.   Item 7. Material to be Filed as Exhibits.  The following documents are filed as exhibits:    Exhibit
        Number  Description1 Joint Filing, Group and Solicitation Agreement.     Page 6 of 9    SIGNATURES   After reasonable inquiry and to the best of
