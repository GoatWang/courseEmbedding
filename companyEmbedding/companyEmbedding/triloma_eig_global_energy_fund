ORLANDO, Fla. and WASHINGTON, Feb. 23, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Triloma Financial Group ("Triloma") and EIG Global Energy Partners ("EIG") today announced the formation of Triloma EIG Global Energy Fund (the "Fund"), an unlisted investment company that will invest primarily in a global portfolio of privately originated energy company and project debt. The Fund will be managed by Triloma Energy Advisors and EIG Credit Management Company, and will seek to raise capital with the issuance of common stock through a best effort, continuous public offering with Triloma Securities, member FINRA/SIPC, serving as the managing dealer. 
"Our creation of this Fund with EIG represents a significant milestone in Triloma's strategy of identifying unique alternative investment opportunities and creating longstanding joint ventures with experienced and proven investment partners," said Larry Goff, Chief Executive Officer of Triloma Securities. "Partnering with EIG allows us to provide individual investors with unparalleled access to energy investment opportunities with one of the oldest and preeminent energy investors in the world."
"The energy sector is a voracious consumer of capital and is tailor-made for specialists like EIG that can provide privately-negotiated financial solutions," said R. Blair Thomas, Chief Executive Officer of EIG. "Current market volatility only serves to increase the opportunity set as generalists exit the space and companies find themselves with funding gaps caused by lower commodity prices and commercial banks pulling back due to regulatory and market pressure. Our 33-years of experience in this space give us confidence that now is an attractive time to create the Fund to take advantage of current market dynamics. Triloma's team has a strong distribution and asset management platform and extensive experience with publicly registered investment programs, and will allow us to attract a broader range of investors to our platform." 
Barry Goff, Managing Director of Triloma, said: "We believe energy companies and projects are underserved by traditional sources of financing. In order to take full advantage of the current market environment, it is essential to have experience investing across many commodity cycles and the in-house technical capabilities necessary to successfully navigate the complexities in the energy sector. EIG's experience and expertise will allow us to take advantage of investment opportunities throughout the energy value chain on a global basis."

Triloma EIG Energy Income Fund

                                      Energy is one of the largest components of GDP globally, characterized by dynamic international capital and trade flows. The global and interconnected nature of the energy markets require active management and industry expertise to manage these complex investments.
                                    

                                      Expand Your Portfolio
                                    

                                      Triloma EIG Energy Income Fund (the “Perpetual Fund”) provides investors the opportunity to access a global portfolio of privately originated energy company and project debt. We believe an investment allocation in tangible real assets has long been recognized as a way to add complementary diversification to a portfolio concentrated in stocks and bonds. Under normal circumstances, the Perpetual Fund will invest at least 80 percent of its total assets in debt and equity investments of energy companies and projects. Through an investment focused on energy companies and projects, investors may gain access to a core real assets category with the potential for attractive income and a low correlation with other asset classes.

                                    The Perpetual Fund’s investment objective is primarily to provide shareholders with current income; as secondary investment objectives, the Fund will seek to provide capital preservation and, to a lesser extent, long-term capital appreciation. While there can be no assurance that the Perpetual Fund will achieve its investment objectives, we believe investing in senior and subordinated debt of energy companies and projects offers opportunities for risk-adjusted returns and income generation. Further, a portfolio broadly allocated among issuers, energy industry sub-sectors and geographies may reduce the risk of a downturn in any single investment having a disproportionate adverse impact on the portfolio value.
                                    

                                      The Perpetual Fund will provide increased interim liquidity through a share repurchase program allowing it to be externally managed and continuously offered indefinitely. Pursuant to its share repurchase program, it intends to conduct quarterly tender offers on approximately 20 percent of its weighted average number of outstanding shares in any 12-month period.
                                    

                                      The Perpetual Fund is managed by Triloma Energy Advisors and EIG Credit Management Company.
                                    

                                      Differentiated by Global Opportunities
                                    

                                      The Perpetual Fund will invest on a global basis primarily in companies and projects located in the United States, Canada, Western Europe, Australia and Latin America. The Perpetual Fund intends to invest a significant portion of its assets in companies and projects located outside the United States. The Perpetual Fund expects that a substantial portion of its portfolio will consist of senior and subordinated debt, which may take the form of corporate or project loans or bonds, may be secured or unsecured and may, in some cases, be accompanied by yield enhancements. The portfolio is expected to include primarily floating-rate investments that provide protection in rising interest rate and inflationary environments. The Perpetual Fund’s primary areas of focus will be the upstream, midstream, and power sub-sectors of the energy industry. However, EIG has the experience and technical expertise to invest across the energy value chain on a global basis. The Perpetual Fund’s advisors broadly define the targeted energy company and project investment sub-sectors as follows: (i) upstream; (ii) midstream; (iii) downstream; (iv) power; (v) renewables; (vi) resources; (vii) infrastructure and (viii) other energy.

Triloma EIG Energy Income Fund

                                        Investing in the Triloma EIG Energy Income Fund (the “Perpetual Fund”) involves risks, including the risk that a shareholder may receive little or no return on its investment or that shareholder may lose part or all of its investment. The following is a list of some of the important risks factors that prospective investors should consider prior to making a decision to invest in the Perpetual Fund. The list is not intended to be comprehensive or exhaustive. Various other risks also apply; therefore, current and prospective shareholders should read and fully understand the prospectus, which is available here.
                                    
Liquidity Risks

An investment in the Perpetual Fund is not suitable for an investor who needs access to the money they invest;
A shareholder should consider that they may not have access to the money they invest for an indefinite period of time;
Unlike most closed-end funds, the shares are not listed on any securities exchange, and shareholders should not expect to be able to sell their shares regardless of how the Perpetual Fund performs;
If a shareholder is able to sell their shares, the shareholder may receive less than their purchase price and the then-current net asset value per share;
Although the Perpetual Fund has implemented a share repurchase program, it may be discontinued at any time and only 5 percent of outstanding shares will be eligible for repurchase per quarter;

Energy Sector Risks

The Perpetual Fund’s investments in energy companies expose the Perpetual Fund to risks associated with adverse economic, environmental or regulatory occurrences affecting the energy sector, and a downturn in the energy sector could have a larger impact on the Perpetual Fund than on funds that are broadly diversified across many sectors and industries;
Energy companies are subject to significant foreign, federal, state and local regulation in virtually every aspect of their operations, and their profitability could be adversely affected by changes in the regulatory environment;
There is an inherent risk that energy companies may incur environmental costs and liabilities due to the nature of their businesses and the substances they handle, and the possibility exists that stricter laws, regulations or enforcement policies could significantly increase the compliance costs of energy companies and the cost of any remediation that may become necessary;
Some energy companies may be subject to construction risk, development risk, acquisition risk or other risks arising from their strategies to expand operations through new construction or development activities, expanding operations through acquisitions, or securing additional long-term contracts;

Investment Risks

The Perpetual Fund’s investments in various types of debt securities and instruments may be secured, unsecured, rated or unrated, are subject to non-payment risk, and may be speculative in nature;
Increases in interest rates may cause the Perpetual Fund’s investments in fixed-rate debt securities to decline in value;
Generally, investments in debt securities with longer-term maturities are subject to greater volatility than investments in shorter-term obligations;
Subordinated investments in debt have lower priority in right of payment to any higher-ranking obligations of the borrower, and the cash flows and assets of the borrower may be insufficient to meet scheduled payments after giving effect to any higher-ranking obligations of the borrower;
During periods of declining interest rates, borrowers or issuers may exercise their option to prepay principal earlier than scheduled, which could reduce income and returns;
Below investment grade instruments (commonly referred to as “high-yield” securities or “junk bonds”) may be particularly susceptible to economic downturns, which could cause losses. Most investments in which the Perpetual Fund invests will not be rated by any rating agency and, if they were rated, they would be rated as below investment grade quality. Investments rated below investment grade quality are generally regarded as having predominantly speculative characteristics and may carry a greater risk with respect to a borrower’s capacity to pay interest and repay principal;
The Perpetual Fund’s investments in securities and other obligations of companies that are experiencing distress involve a substantial degree of risk, require a high level of analytical sophistication for successful investment and require active monitoring;
The Perpetual Fund’s investments in expectation of a specific event or catalyst can result in losses if the event or catalyst fails to occur or it does not have the expected effect or does not occur in the expected timeframe;
The Perpetual Fund may invest in illiquid and restricted securities that may be difficult to dispose of at a fair price;
The valuation of securities or instruments that lack a central trading place (such as fixed-income securities or instruments) may carry greater risk than those which trade on an exchange;
The value of convertible securities may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates, as well as the market price and volatility of the underlying security;
The value of equity securities may fluctuate in response to factors affecting the particular company in which the Perpetual Fund invests, as well as broader market and economic conditions;
The Perpetual Fund’s investments in derivatives have risks, including the imperfect correlation between the value of such instruments and the underlying assets of the Perpetual Fund;
Leverage could create the opportunity for higher income and returns for shareholders, but can magnify the effect of any losses;
Triloma, EIG and certain of their affiliates have conflicts of interest in connection with the management of the Perpetual Fund;
The Perpetual Fund is a recently organized, non-diversified, closed-end investment company with no operating history;

Non-U.S. Investment Risks

The Perpetual Fund may be materially adversely affected by market, economic and political conditions globally and in the jurisdictions and sectors in which the Perpetual Fund invests;
Investments in certain securities or other instruments of non-U.S. issuers or borrowers (“Non-U.S. Securities”) may involve factors not typically associated with investing in the U.S. or other developed countries;
Non-U.S. Securities may be traded in undeveloped, inefficient and less liquid markets and may experience greater price volatility, illiquidity and changes in value than U.S. securities;
Changes in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of and returns on foreign denominated investments;
Credit intermediation involving entities and activities outside the regular banking system (e.g., the “shadow banking system”) could result in increased regulatory and operating costs, which could adversely affect the implementation of the Perpetual Fund’s investment strategies and its income and returns;

Legal and Regulatory Risks

To qualify and remain eligible for the special tax treatment accorded to regulated investment companies (“RIC”) and their shareholders under the Internal Revenue Code, the Perpetual Fund must meet certain source-of-income, asset diversification and annual distribution requirements, and failure to do so could result in the loss of RIC status;
The Perpetual Fund’s distributions may be funded from unlimited amounts of offering proceeds or borrowings, which may constitute a return of capital and reduce the amount of capital available to the Perpetual Fund for investment. Any capital returned to shareholders through distributions will be distributed after payment of fees and expenses. Distributions may also be funded in significant part from the waiver of certain expenses that will be subject to future repayment by the Perpetual Fund, thus reducing the amounts available for distribution to future shareholders; and
Legal and regulatory changes, such as those implemented in connection with The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, as amended (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), could occur, which may materially adversely affect the Perpetual Fund.

Accordingly, the Perpetual Fund should be considered a speculative investment that entails substantial risks, and a prospective investor should invest in the Perpetual Fund only if they can sustain a complete loss of their investment.

1The public offering price is effective as of the weekly close beginning July 26, 2017. Pursuant to the terms of the prospectus, the public offering price is subject to change based on fluctuations in net asset value (NAV). Please refer to the Perpetual Fund’s current prospectus as amended and supplemented for disclosures related to the public offering price.
                        

2Beginning August 1, 2017. The current annualized distribution rate is calculated by dividing the annualized distributions by the current public offering price. The Perpetual Fund’s distributions will be funded from unlimited amounts of offering proceeds or borrowings, which could constitute a return of capital and reduce the amount of capital available to the Perpetual Fund for investment. There is no assurance that distributions will be sustained at current levels.
                        

3For illustrative purposes only. The objectives are not guarantees, predictions or projections of future performance and there is no assurance they will be met.

                    Triloma Continues Growth, Signs Lease for Additional Office Space
                




                  ORLANDO, Fla. (March 15, 2017) – Triloma, a Winter Park, Florida-based private investment management firm, announced today it has leased an additional 9,500 square feet of space in its current downtown Winter Park office building, bringing its total office space to over 17,000 square feet.
                


                    “Having this additional space available will allow us to accommodate our growing team,” explained managing director, Mike Wood. “More importantly, it affirms our commitment to Winter Park, and we’re excited for what the future holds for us here.”
                  

                    To accommodate its rapidly growing team, Triloma has expanded its offices three times since initially leasing 1,763 square feet of space on Park Avenue in late 2013. One of the ways the firm seeks to promote a healthy work/life balance for its associates is by keeping daily commutes as short as possible, which ultimately led Triloma to its current building just a block away on New York Avenue.
                  

                    Triloma now has 58 associates, each averaging 16 years of investment industry experience. The firm has two public investment offerings currently available, and will continue to offer a series of private investment opportunities this year. Additionally, Triloma intends to introduce new products for 2017 in response to the ever-changing investment and regulatory environments.
                  

                    This announcement comes on the heels of Triloma reporting more than $200 million in equity capital raised in 2016, as well as plans for continued growth and increased involvement in industry advocacy in 2017.

                    Triloma Announces 2015 Growth Activity
                




Investment firm exceeds equity raising goals in its first year of operations

                  ORLANDO, Fla. (Feb. 17, 2016) – Triloma Securities (“Triloma”) announced today the results of its syndication activity in 2015. The firm, which commenced broker-dealer operations on April 23, 2015, surpassed its equity raising goals for the year in just over eight months.
                


                    In 2015, Triloma raised more than $117 million in equity in 12 offerings, marking one of the quickest sponsor launches in the alternative investment industry to-date. As part of its capital raising efforts, Triloma signed 57 selling agreements with 23
                    different retail broker-dealer firms throughout the year, with investment offerings in energy, seniors housing and land development.
                  

                    “When we founded Triloma, our goal was to create a company where we could improve the lives of our investors, partners and associates,” said Larry Goff, chief executive officer of Triloma Securities. “As we look back at an extraordinary first year for
                    our firm, we have exceeded that goal. We are also proud to have three outstanding investment partners, and to have added to our team some of the brightest and most experienced professionals in our industry.”
                  

                    In the last year, Triloma and its affiliate, Triloma Financial Group, have grown from 9 to 46 associates. These associates include industry veterans who average 15 years of experience in the investment industry. To accommodate this strategic
                    growth, the company relocated to a larger office in Winter Park, Florida.
                  

                    Plans for continued growth in 2016 are well underway, as Triloma prepares to expand its presence in the broker-dealer community.

Returns reflect temporary contractual fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements. Had the ETF incurred all expenses and fees, investment returns would have been reduced. Investment returns and ETF share values will fluctuate so that investors' shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. ETF returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV.The "Net Asset Value" (NAV) of a VanEck Vectors Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) is determined at the close of each business day, and represents the dollar value of one share of the fund; it is calculated by taking the total assets of the fund, subtracting total liabilities, and dividing by the total number of shares outstanding. The NAV is not necessarily the same as the ETF 's intraday trading value. VanEck Vectors ETF investors should not expect to buy or sell shares at NAV.

Returns reflect temporary contractual fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements. Had the ETF incurred all expenses and fees, investment returns would have been reduced. Investment returns and ETF share values will fluctuate so that investors' shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. ETF returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV.The "Net Asset Value" (NAV) of a VanEck Vectors Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) is determined at the close of each business day, and represents the dollar value of one share of the fund; it is calculated by taking the total assets of the fund, subtracting total liabilities, and dividing by the total number of shares outstanding. The NAV is not necessarily the same as the ETF 's intraday trading value. VanEck Vectors ETF investors should not expect to buy or sell shares at NAV.

Triloma Financial Group and EIG Global Energy Partners have launched Triloma EIG Global Energy Fund, a  joint venture that will invest in energy debt. Triloma Energy Advisors and EIG Credit Management Company will manage the fund.
PRESS RELEASE
ORLANDO, Fla. and WASHINGTON, Feb. 23, 2015 /PRNewswire/ — Triloma Financial Group (“Triloma”) and EIG Global Energy Partners (“EIG”) today announced the formation of Triloma EIG Global Energy Fund (the “Fund”), an unlisted investment company that will invest primarily in a global portfolio of privately originated energy company and project debt. The Fund will be managed by Triloma Energy Advisors and EIG Credit Management Company, and will seek to raise capital with the issuance of common stock through a best effort, continuous public offering with Triloma Securities, member FINRA/SIPC, serving as the managing dealer.
“Our creation of this Fund with EIG represents a significant milestone in Triloma’s strategy of identifying unique alternative investment opportunities and creating longstanding joint ventures with experienced and proven investment partners,” said Larry Goff, Chief Executive Officer of Triloma Securities. “Partnering with EIG allows us to provide individual investors with unparalleled access to energy investment opportunities with one of the oldest and preeminent energy investors in the world.” 





“The energy sector is a voracious consumer of capital and is tailor-made for specialists like EIG that can provide privately-negotiated financial solutions,” said R. Blair Thomas, Chief Executive Officer of EIG. “Current market volatility only serves to increase the opportunity set as generalists exit the space and companies find themselves with funding gaps caused by lower commodity prices and commercial banks pulling back due to regulatory and market pressure. Our 33-years of experience in this space give us confidence that now is an attractive time to create the Fund to take advantage of current market dynamics. Triloma’s team has a strong distribution and asset management platform and extensive experience with publicly registered investment programs, and will allow us to attract a broader range of investors to our platform.”
Barry Goff, Managing Director of Triloma, said: “We believe energy companies and projects are underserved by traditional sources of financing. In order to take full advantage of the current market environment, it is essential to have experience investing across many commodity cycles and the in-house technical capabilities necessary to successfully navigate the complexities in the energy sector. EIG’s experience and expertise will allow us to take advantage of investment opportunities throughout the energy value chain on a global basis.”
About Triloma EIG Global Energy Fund
Triloma EIG Global Energy Fund (the “Fund”) is an unlisted investment company that will primarily invest in a global portfolio of privately originated energy company and project debt. Its investment objective will be to provide shareholders with current income, capital preservation and, to a lesser extent, long term capital appreciation. The Fund will be managed by Triloma Energy Advisors and EIG Credit Management Company, and will offer individuals an opportunity to invest in U.S. and non-U.S. energy companies and projects in many instances alongside institutional investors. Investments will be made through a series of feeder funds each of which will invest substantially all of the net proceeds its raises from its public offering in the Fund.

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The Energy Select Sector Index (IXETR) is provided by S&P Dow Jones Indices and includes domestic companies from the energy sector which includes the following industries: oil, gas and consumable fuels; and energy equipment and services.  One cannot directly invest in an index.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 0.95%.  The Funds’ Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with each Fund, under which Rafferty has contractually agreed to cap all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse each Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2018, to the extent that the Fund’s Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.95% of the Fund’s daily net assets other than the following:  taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production Select Industry Index (SPSIOPTR) is provided by Standard & Poor’s Index Provider and includes domestic companies from the oil and gas exploration and production sub-industry. The Index is designed to measure the performance of a sub-industry or group of sub-industries determined based on the Global Industry Classification Standards (GICS). One cannot directly invest in an index.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 0.95%.  The Funds’ Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with each Fund, under which Rafferty has contractually agreed to cap all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse each Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2018, to the extent that the Fund’s Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.95% of the Fund’s daily net assets other than the following:  taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The Energy Select Sector Index (IXETR) is provided by S&P Dow Jones Indices and includes domestic companies from the energy sector which includes the following industries: oil, gas and consumable fuels; and energy equipment and services.  One cannot directly invest in an index.

If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.

Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The Energy Select Sector Index (IXETR) is provided by S&P Dow Jones Indices and includes domestic companies from the energy sector which includes the following industries: oil, gas and consumable fuels; and energy equipment and services.  One cannot directly invest in an index.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 0.95%.  The Funds’ Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with each Fund, under which Rafferty has contractually agreed to cap all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse each Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2018, to the extent that the Fund’s Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.95% of the Fund’s daily net assets other than the following:  taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production Select Industry Index (SPSIOPTR) is provided by Standard & Poor’s Index Provider and includes domestic companies from the oil and gas exploration and production sub-industry. The Index is designed to measure the performance of a sub-industry or group of sub-industries determined based on the Global Industry Classification Standards (GICS). One cannot directly invest in an index.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 0.95%.  The Funds’ Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with each Fund, under which Rafferty has contractually agreed to cap all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse each Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2018, to the extent that the Fund’s Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.95% of the Fund’s daily net assets other than the following:  taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.
