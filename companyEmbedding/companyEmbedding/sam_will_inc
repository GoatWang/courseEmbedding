CHARLOTTE, N.C., July 19, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- LendingTree® (NASDAQ:   TREE), the nation's leading online loan marketplace, today announced that Sam Mischner has been promoted to Chief Sales Officer and Head of Mortgage.  Previously, Mischner served as SVP, Sales and GM, Mortgage.








In the newly-formed role of Chief Sales Officer and Head of Mortgage, Mischner will lead the company's sales strategy and operations.

"We're proud to have Sam on our team and look forward to what his leadership in this role will bring to LendingTree, its customers and partners."

Our emphasis on lender success enables us to not only grow our existing network, but also to add more lenders to the LendingTree platform. As the mortgage business continues to diversify, innovate and shift online, I am thrilled to help lead the team as we scale and look to gain market share."

He helped diversify revenue into other verticals, implemented a culture shift to focus on lender success and worked to find solutions with mutually beneficial results for both lenders and LendingTree. 
Mischner began his career in the mortgage industry as a loan officer before founding his own mortgage company, which he merged and later sold. He then joined Strategic Lending Group and started and scaled a mortgage division for their bank holding company. He was responsible for running sales, marketing, operations and technology.

Lane Masters, Inc. is a company 
        founded in 1996 by Sam Baca. He is considered to be the foremost authority 
        on lane conditioning and is past lane director for the P.B.A. Lane Masters 
        proudly announces their new and innovative line of lane conditioning products. 
        These products are specifically designed to eliminate the problems inherent 
        in today's lane maintenance. Lane Masters' High Image lane conditioners 
        are guaranteed to create stable oil patterns for all of your play, including 
        second shift league bowling. Along with your newly acquired oil pattern 
        stability, these products will reduce ball calls, out of ranges and massive 
        oil carry down. 
Other lane oil companies have 
        recently been producing heavier lane conditioners in an attempt to solve 
        the high friction problems of today's environment. Their lack of success 
        only reaffirms our theory that the standard use of lane oils needs the 
        assistance of special additives to help it achieve protection of the lane 
        and long term dressing pattern stability. After years of research, we 
        have discovered the additives that give the oil the stability that your 
        center deserves. 
Our special formula contains 
        ingredients that are exclusive to only our lane conditioning products. 
        Another important advantage provided by Legends Oil, is the noticeable 
        difference in the cleanliness of your lanes. You will see reduction in 
        the attraction of dust, dirt, hair, cosmetic particles along with countless 
        other atmospheric impurities being transferred to the lane. Sam Baca is 
        eagerly looking forward to helping you give your customers the clean, 
        equitable and long lasting lane conditions that they deserve. 
Call: 1-888-LANE OIL (1-888-526-3645) 
        and Sam will help you and your lane maintenance personnel finalize a lane 
        conditioning program worthy of your bowling centers goals. 



 
 



Sam 
        Baca
  President 


Sam Baca started studying 
        lanes maintenance the same day he delivered his first bowling ball. In 
        his novice howling years there were still expert lane men, so he felt 
        fortunate to befriend Dave, the laneman at the center where he developed 
        his bowling skills. Sam studied lane resurfacing techniques, surface coatings 
        and lane conditioner applications. Sam did this because he believed it 
        would give him the winning edge when he became a pro bowler. After six 
        years of pro competition on the PBA Tour he took an executive position 
        with the Professional Bowlers Association, as Regional Activity Director. 
        During the PBA winter tour of 1971, the lefty-righty controversy developed 
        and Sam was appointed to the new position of PBA Director of Lane Maintenance. 
        The PBA lane maintenance program he pioneered in 1971 still exists. Sam 
        left the PBA staff in 1976, but stayed in contact and assisted them when 
        needed. The conditioner has been successfully tested on all lane surfaces 
        and its' ability to holdup during high lineage events was documented on 
        both professional tours, PBA and LPBT. Finally, lane conditioning products 
        developed by lane men for the modern bowling game. 
Two PBA Championship Titles: 
        Dallas Open, Dallas, Texas 1965 Ebonite Open, Edison, N.J. 1967

        Lane maintenance consultant for proprietors, lane men and tournament organization 
        since 1971

        improve the sport never seem to stop! 








 
 



 

The Lane Masters Company has 
        "set the standards" for which all lane maintenance companies must follow. 
        What does this mean? It means we produce the finest lane maintenance products 
        produced in the world today and back all the products with free twenty-four 
        hour technical support. The Lane Masters Company was the first bowling 
        manufacturing company to offer superior customer support 24 hours a day, 
        three hundred and sixty-five days a year, at no charge to our valued customer. 
        All other lane oil manufacturers either do not have twenty-four hour technical 
        support or they charge you when you call. 
The bottom line is that our 
        Legends Product Line combined with "Recommended Procedures for Exceptional 
        Conditions" (for every lane machine and lane surface) will produce results. 
        The proof is in the scoring. The highest scores ever recorded by the American 
        Bowling Congress (including the first sanctioned 900), The Professional 
        Bowlers Association, The Professional Women's Bowling Association, The 
        ABC Masters, The WIBC, The NABI, and over 200 tournaments are proof that 
        Legends lane conditioning products hold up and afford the bowler consistent 
        stable lane conditions like never before. The system works, the scores 
        prove it, and it all comes with a money back guarantee.
It's just that simple! Call 
        1-888-Lane Oil (1-888-526-3645) today and get your bowlers raving about 
        the great conditions in your center. Conditions that last from your early 
        leagues through your late leagues without breaking down.
 IT ALL COMES WITH A MONEY 
        BACK GUARANTEE! WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE? 
We get the job done or you 
        do not pay. No other company has a money back guarantee on lane oil, not 
        Brunswick, DBA or AMF will guarantee their customers will be satisfied 
        with their lane oils. Lane Masters has a money back guarantee, because 
        we get the job done, period. The Lane Masters Company looks forward to 
        a possible business relationship with your bowling center and will do 
        everything in their power to serve you with the kind of superior service 
        and quality products you deserve. Please call me personally, mention that 
        you have visited our website and I will make you a special deal on your 
        first order. 
Sincerely,
Johnie K. Jones 
        Vice President
