First Week of February 2018 Options Trading For United Bankshares

Investors in United Bankshares Inc (Symbol: UBSI) saw new options become available this week, for the February 2018 expiration. One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 228 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At Stock Options Channel  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the UBSI options chain for the new February 2018 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.    The put contract at the $35.00 strike price has a current bid of 10 cents. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $35.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $34.90 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of UBSI, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $39.70/share today. Because the $35.00 strike represents an approximate 12% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 76%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 0.29% return on the cash commitment, or 0.46% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost  .    Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for United Bankshares Inc, and highlighting in green where the $35.00 strike is located relative to that history:       Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $40.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.70. If an investor was to purchase shares of UBSI stock at the current price level of $39.70/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a "covered call," they are committing to sell the stock at $40.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 5.04% if the stock gets called away at the February 2018 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if UBSI shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for United Bankshares Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing UBSI's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $40.00 strike highlighted in red:    Considering the fact that the $40.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 50%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 4.28% boost of extra return to the investor, or 6.85% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost  .    The implied volatility in the put contract example is 24%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 26%. Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $39.70) to be 24%.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL  CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA The following data should be read in conjunction with the unaudited consolidated financial statements and management's discussion and analysis that follows: As of or for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 2016 SIGNIFICANT RATIOS (Unaudited) Net income to: Average assets (a) 0.88 % 0.86 % Average shareholders' equity (a) 7.64 % 7.20 % Net interest margin (a) 3.51 % 3.53 % Efficiency ratio (b) 73.19 % 75.82 % Average shareholders' equity to average assets 11.51 % 11.94 % Loans to deposits (end of period) 71.45 % 68.35 % Allowance for loan losses to loans (end of period) 0.78 % 1.02 %  Book value per share $ 22.64 $ 22.34  (a) Net income to average assets, net income to average shareholders' equity and net interest margin are presented on an annualized basis. Net interest margin is calculated using fully-tax equivalent net interest income as a percentage of average interest earning assets.  (b) Efficiency ratio is a ratio of non-interest expense as a percentage of fully tax equivalent net interest income plus non-interest income.  Introduction  United Bancshares, Inc. (the "Corporation"), an Ohio corporation, is a bank holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, and is subject to regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the "Federal Reserve Board"). The Corporation was incorporated and organized in 1985. The executive offices of the Corporation are located at 100 S. High Street, Columbus Grove, Ohio 45830. The Corporation is a one-bank holding company, as that term is defined by the Federal Reserve Board.  The Union Bank Company (the "Bank"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Corporation, is engaged in the business of commercial banking. The Bank is an Ohio state-chartered bank, which serves Allen, Delaware, Hancock, Marion, Putnam, Sandusky, and Wood counties in Ohio, with office locations in Bowling Green, Columbus Grove, Delaware, Delphos, Findlay, Gibsonburg, Kalida, Leipsic, Lima, Marion, Ottawa and Pemberville, Ohio.  The Bank offers a full range of commercial banking services, including checking accounts, savings and money market accounts, time certificates of deposit, automatic teller machines, commercial, consumer, agricultural, residential mortgage and home equity loans, credit card services, safe deposit box rentals, and other personalized banking services. The Bank has formed UBC Investments, Inc. ("UBC") to hold and manage its securities portfolio. The operations of UBC are located in Wilmington, Delaware. The Bank has also formed UBC Property, Inc. to hold and manage certain other real estate owned.  On March 22, 2017 United Bancshares, Inc. ("United") and Benchmark Bancorp, Inc. ("Benchmark") entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") pursuant to which United will purchase from Benchmark all of the issued and outstanding shares of Benchmark and whereby Benchmark will merge with and into United (the "Merger") with United being the surviving entity. Immediately following the Merger, Benchmark Bank, an Ohio banking corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Benchmark, will merge with and into The Union Bank Company, an Ohio banking corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of United, with The Union Bank Company as the surviving entity (the "Bank Merger"). The Boards of Directors of United and Benchmark have approved the Merger, Bank Merger and the Merger Agreement. At the effective time and as a result of the Merger, a shareholder of Benchmark will receive approximately $8.59 per share, subject to certain adjustments. The all-cash transaction is valued at $29.5 million. The Merger is expected to close in the third quarter of 2017, pending adoption of the Merger Agreement by the shareholders of Benchmark, the satisfaction of various closing conditions, including the receipt of all necessary bank regulatory approvals, the accuracy of the representations and warranties of each party (subject to certain exceptions), the performance in all material respects by each party of its obligations under the Agreement, and other conditions customary for transactions of this type.  When or if used in the Corporation's Securities and Exchange Commission filings or other public or shareholder communications, or in oral statements made with the approval of an authorized executive officer, the words or phrases:  The Corporation cautions readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward looking statements, which speak only as of the date made, and advises readers that various factors, including regional and national economic conditions, substantial changes in the levels of market interest rates, credit and other risks associated with lending and investing activities, and competitive and regulatory factors could affect the Corporation's financial performance and could cause the Corporation's actual results for future periods to differ materially from those anticipated or projected. The Corporation does not undertake, and specifically disclaims any obligation, to update any forward looking statements to reflect occurrences or unanticipated events or circumstances after the date of such statements.  The Corporation is registered as a Securities Exchange Act of 1934 reporting company.  The following discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial statements of the Corporation is presented to provide insight into management's assessment of the financial results.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Overview of the Income Statement  For the quarter ended March 31, 2017, the Corporation reported net income of $1,394,000, or $0.43 basic earnings per share. This compares to the first quarter of 2016 net income of $1,308,000, or $0.40 basic earnings per share. The increase in operating results for the first quarter of 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016 was primarily attributable to increases in interest income of $223,000 and non-interest income of $141,000 offset by increases in interest expense of $95,000, non-interest expenses of $77,000, and provision for income taxes of $56,000. Additionally, the quarter ended March 31, 2017 was positively impacted by a credit for loan and lease losses of $350,000 compared to a $400,000 credit for loan and lease losses for the first quarter of 2016.  Net Interest Income  Net interest income is the amount by which income from interest-earning assets exceeds interest incurred on interest-bearing liabilities. Interest-earning assets consist principally of loans and investment securities while interest-bearing liabilities include interest-bearing deposit accounts and borrowed funds. Net interest income remains the primary source of revenue for the Corporation. Changes in market interest rates, as well as changes in the mix and volume of interest-bearing assets and interest-bearing liabilities impact net interest income. Net interest income was $4,859,000 for the first quarter of 2017, compared to $4,731,000 for the same period of 2016, an increase of $128,000 (2.7%).  The increase in net interest income was largely attributable to an increase in interest income for the three months ended March 31, 2017 of $223,000, as compared to the same period in 2016, including a $145,000 increase in interest income from loans and leases and an $83,000 increase in interest income from securities.  Net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income (adjusted to reflect tax-exempt interest income on a taxable equivalent basis) by average interest-earning assets. The resulting percentage serves as a measurement for the Corporation in comparing its results with those of past periods as well as those of peer institutions. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, the net interest margin (on a taxable equivalent basis) was 3.51% compared with 3.53% for the same period in 2016.  Interest-bearing deposits comprised 92.9% of average interest-bearing liabilities for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to 96.4% for the same period in 2016.  Provision (Credit) for Loan and Lease Losses  The Corporation's provision (credit) for loan and lease losses is determined based upon management's calculation of the allowance for loan and lease losses and is reflective of management's assessment of the quality of the portfolio and overall management of the inherent credit risk of the loan and lease portfolio. Changes in the provision (credit) for loan and lease losses are dependent, among other things, on loan and lease delinquencies, collateral position, portfolio risks and general economic conditions in the Corporation's lending markets. A $350,000 credit for loan and lease losses was recognized during the three month period ended March 31, 2017 compared to a $400,000 credit for loan and lease losses during the three months ended March 31, 2016. See "Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses" under Financial Condition for further discussion relating to the provision for loan and lease losses.  Non-Interest Income  The Corporation's non-interest income is largely generated from activities related to the origination, servicing and gain on sales of fixed rate mortgage loans; customer deposit account fees; earnings on life insurance policies; income arising from sales of investment products to customers; and occasional security sale transactions. Income related to customer deposit accounts and life insurance policies provides a relatively steady flow of income while the other sources are more volume or transaction related and consequently can vary from quarter to quarter. For the quarter ended March 31, 2017, non-interest income was $1,260,000 compared to $1,119,000 for the first quarter of 2016, a $141,000 (12.6%) increase.  Gain on sales of loans amounted to $117,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, compared to $69,000 for the first quarter of 2016, an increase of $48,000 (69.6%). The increase in gain on sales of loans resulted primarily from the increase in volume of loans sold and the related mortgage servicing right adjustments.  Gain on sales of securities amounted to $82,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 compared to $120,000 for the same period in 2016, a decrease of $38,000 (31.7%).  Other operating income increased $131,000 (14.1%) for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The increase in other operating income was largely attributable to the change in fair value of mortgage servicing rights between the comparable quarters. During the quarter ended March 31, 2017, the fair value of the servicing rights asset increased $10,000 with minimal change in the level of the serviced loan portfolio. During the quarter ended March 31, 2016, the fair value of the serving rights asset decreased $151,000 primarily due to an increase in prepayment speeds caused by a decrease in mortgage loan interest rates.  Non-Interest Expenses  For the quarter ended March 31, 2017, non-interest expenses were $4,633,000, compared to $4,556,000 for the first quarter of 2016, a $77,000 (1.7%) increase. The increase in non-interest expenses for the three month period ended March 31, 2017 was primarily attributed to increases in salaries and benefits expense, premises and equipment, advertising and promotion, media and Ohio financial institutions tax, offset by decreases in FDIC assessment and loan closing fees expenses.  Maintaining acceptable levels of non-interest expenses and operating efficiency are key performance indicators for the Corporation in its strategic initiatives. The financial services industry uses the efficiency ratio (total non-interest expense as a percentage of the aggregate of fully-tax equivalent net interest income and non-interest income) as a key indicator of performance. For the quarter ended March 31, 2017, the Corporation's efficiency ratio improved to 73.19%, compared 75.82% for the same period of 2016.  Provision for Income Taxes  The provision for income taxes for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 was $442,000 (effective rate of 24.1%) compared to $386,000 (effective rate of 22.8%) for the comparable 2016 period.  FINANCIAL CONDITION  Overview of Balance Sheet  Total assets amounted to $640.5 million at March 31, 2017, compared to $633.1 million at December 31, 2016, an increase of $7.4 million (1.2%). The increase in total assets was primarily the result of an increase of $5.8 million (1.6%) in net loans and leases, $1.1 million (8.1%) in cash and cash equivalents, and $1.1 million (8.1%) in premises and equipment. Deposits during this same period increased $9.3 million, or 1.8%.  Shareholders' equity increased from $72.6 million at December 31, 2016 to $74.0 million at March 31, 2017. This increase was primarily the result of net income of $1,394,000 and a $371,000 decrease in unrealized securities losses, net of tax, offset by dividends paid of $393,000. The decrease in unrealized securities losses during the three month period ended March 31, 2017, was the result of customary and expected changes in the bond market. Net unrealized gains and losses on securities are reported as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in the consolidated balance sheets.  Cash and Cash Equivalents  Cash and cash equivalents totaled $15.3 million at March 31, 2017 and $14.2 million at December 31, 2016, including interest-bearing deposits in other banks of $6.7 million at March 31, 2017 and $4.3 million at December 31, 2016. Management believes the current level of cash and cash equivalents is sufficient to meet the Corporation's present liquidity and performance needs especially considering the availability of other funding sources. Total cash and cash equivalents fluctuate on a daily basis due to transactions in process and corresponding liquidity sources and uses. Management believes the Corporation's liquidity needs in the near term will be satisfied by the current level of cash and cash equivalents, readily available access to traditional and non-traditional funding sources, and the portions of the investment and loan portfolios that will mature within one year. These sources of funds should enable the Corporation to meet cash obligations and off-balance sheet commitments as they come due. In addition, the Corporation has access to various sources of additional borrowings by virtue of long-term assets that can be used as collateral for such borrowings.  Securities  Management monitors the earnings performance and liquidity of the securities portfolio on a regular basis through Asset/Liability Committee (ALCO) meetings. As a result, all securities, except FHLB stock, have been designated as available-for-sale and may be sold if needed for liquidity, asset-liability management or other reasons. Such securities are reported at fair value, with any net unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of shareholders' equity, net of related incomes taxes.  The amortized cost and fair value of available-for-sale securities as of March 31, 2017 totaled $190.9 million and $190.2 million, respectively, resulting in a net unrealized loss before tax of $750,000 and a corresponding after-tax decrease in shareholders' equity of $495,000.  Loans and Leases  The Corporation's primary lending areas are Northwestern, West Central, and Central Ohio. Gross loans and leases totaled $381.5 million at March 31, 2017, compared to $376.1 million at December 31, 2016, an increase of $5.4 million (1.4%).  There are also unrecognized financial instruments at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 which relate to commitments to extend credit and letters of credit. The contract amount of such financial instruments approximated $94.1 million at March 31, 2017 and $91.0 million at December 31, 2016.  Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses The following table presents a summary of activity in the allowance for loan and lease losses for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016: (in thousands) 2017 2016 Balance, beginning of period $ 3,345 $ 3,834 Credit for loan and lease losses (350 ) (400 ) Charge offs (127 ) (18 ) Recoveries 106 234 Net (charge offs) recoveries (21 ) 216 Balance, end of period $ 2,974 $ 3,650  The allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of gross loans and leases was .78% at March 31, 2017, .89% at December 31, 2016, and 1.02% at March 31, 2016. Regular provisions are made in amounts sufficient to maintain the balance in the allowance for loan and lease losses at a level considered by management to be adequate for losses within the portfolio. Even though management uses all available information to assess possible loan and lease losses, future additions or reductions to the allowance may be required as changes occur in economic conditions and specific borrower circumstances. The regulatory agencies that periodically review the Corporation's allowance for loan and lease losses may also require additions to the allowance or the charge-off of specific loans and leases based upon the information available to them at the time of their examinations.  Loans and leases on non-accrual status amounted to $5.2 million and $6.0 million at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. Non-accrual loans and leases as a percentage of outstanding loans amounted to 1.4% at March 31, 2017 and 1.6% at December 31, 2016.  The Corporation considers a loan or lease to be impaired when it becomes probable that the Corporation will be unable to collect under the contractual terms of the loan or lease, as the case may be, based on current information and events. Impaired loans and leases, all consisting of commercial and commercial real estate credits, amounted to $2.5 million at March 31, 2017 and $2.9 million at December 31, 2016. All impaired loans and leases at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 had specific reserves, with such reserves amounting to $642,000 and $1.0 million at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively, and included in the Corporation's allowance for loan and lease losses.  In addition to impaired loans, the Corporation had other potential problem credits of $8.1 million at March 31, 2017 and $9.7 million at December 31, 2016. The Corporation's credit administration department continues to closely monitor these credits.  The Corporation provides pooled reserves for potential problem loans and leases using loss rates calculated considering historic net loan charge-off experience. The Corporation has experienced $127,000 of loan charge-offs during the first three months of 2017 compared to annual loan charge-offs of $160,000 in 2016, $639,000 in 2015, and $497,000 in 2014, with most of the charge-offs coming from the commercial and commercial real estate loan portfolios. The Corporation also provides general reserves for the remaining portion of its loan portfolio not considered to be problem or potential problem loans. These general reserves are also calculated considering, among other things, the historic net charge-off experience for the relative loan type.  Funding Sources  The Corporation considers a number of alternatives, including but not limited to, deposits, as well as short-term and long-term borrowings when evaluating funding sources. Deposits, including customer deposits, brokered certificates of deposit, and public funds deposits continue to be the most significant source of funds for the Corporation, totaling $534.0 million, or 95.0% of the Corporation's outstanding funding sources at March 31, 2017. Total deposits increased $9.3 million during the three months ended March 31, 2017.  Non-interest bearing deposits remain a smaller portion of the funding source for the Corporation than for most of its peers. Non-interest bearing deposits comprised 18.4% of total deposits at March 31, 2017, compared to 18.7% at December 31, 2016.  In addition to traditional deposits, the Corporation maintains both short-term and long-term borrowing arrangements. Other borrowings consisted of FHLB borrowings totaling $15.4 million at March 31, 2017 and $18.8 million at December 31, 2016. The Corporation also has outstanding junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures of $12.8 million at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. Management plans to maintain access to various borrowing alternatives as an appropriate funding source.  Shareholders' Equity  Shareholders' equity increased from $72.6 million at December 31, 2016 to $74.0 million at March 31, 2017, principally due to net income of $1,394,000 and a $371,000 decrease in unrealized securities losses, net of tax, net of dividends paid.  The changes in unrealized securities gains or losses during the three month periods ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 were the result of customary and expected changes in the bond market.  The Corporation and Bank met all regulatory capital requirements as of March 31, 2017, and the Bank is considered "well capitalized" under regulatory and industry standards of risk-based capital.  Liquidity and Interest Rate Sensitivity  The objective of the Corporation's asset/liability management function is to maintain consistent growth in net interest income through management of the Corporation's balance sheet liquidity and interest rate exposure based on changes in economic conditions, interest rate levels, and customer preferences.  The Corporation manages interest rate risk to minimize the impact of fluctuating interest rates on earnings. The Corporation uses simulation techniques that attempt to measure the volatility of changes in the level of interest rates, basic banking interest rate spreads, the shape of the yield curve, and the impact of changing product growth patterns. The primary method of measuring the sensitivity of earnings of changing market interest rates is to simulate expected cash flows using varying assumed interest rates while also adjusting the timing and magnitude of non-contractual deposit re-pricing to more accurately reflect anticipated pricing behavior. These simulations include adjustments for the lag in prime loan re-pricing and the spread and volume elasticity of interest-bearing deposit accounts, regular savings and money market deposit accounts.  The principal function of interest rate risk management is to maintain an appropriate relationship between those assets and liabilities that are sensitive to changing market interest rates. The Corporation closely monitors the sensitivity of its assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis and projects the effect of various interest rate changes on its net interest margin. Interest sensitive assets and liabilities are defined as those assets or liabilities that mature or re-price within a designated time frame.  Management believes the Corporation's current mix of assets and liabilities provides a reasonable level of risk related to significant fluctuations in net interest income and the resulting volatility of the Corporation's earning base. The Corporation's management reviews interest rate risk in relation to its effect on net interest income, net interest margin, and the volatility of the earnings base of the Corporation.  Effects of Inflation on Financial Statements  All of the Corporation's assets relate to commercial banking operations and are generally monetary in nature. Therefore, they are not impacted by inflation to the same degree as companies in capital-intensive industries in a replacement cost environment. During a period of rising prices, a net monetary asset position results in loss of purchasing power and conversely a net monetary liability position results in an increase in purchasing power. In the commercial banking industry, monetary assets typically exceed monetary liabilities. The Corporation has not experienced a significant level of inflation or deflation during the three month period ended March 31, 2017. However, because of the depressed national real estate market and sluggish local economy, the Corporation has experienced declines in the value of collateral securing commercial and non-commercial real estate loans. Management continues to closely monitor these trends in calculating the Corporation's allowance for loan and lease losses.  ITEM 3  Apr 27, 2017  (c) 1995-2017 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc.
