We …
 … provide resources, expertise, and opportunities to help you tell your story.
…  make the creative and production process understandable, manageable, and yes, even fun.    
…  blend pragmatic efficiency with sophisticated and creative thinking
…  keep an open mind and encourage expansive and ambitious ideas. 
We are at our best when producing projects that have complex and compelling content. Much of our work tends to fall into three categories, People, Places and Ideas; Health and Wellness; and Education and Training.  Click on the videos above for a sampling of some of our work.


Renaissance Media was founded and is led by veteran producer, writer and director, Tom Dudzinski.  Prior to Renaissance Media, Tom was an Executive Producer at KRMA-TV (now Rocky Mountain PBS) in Denver, CO, where he managed numerous nationally distributed educational series, as well as the award-winning national PBS television series, “A House For All Seasons”.  This 1980’s award-winning television series pioneered the exploration on television of energy-efficient home design, construction and sustainable living.   Before coming to Denver, Tom worked at Nashville’s PBS station, WDCN-TV, where he produced and directed numerous national educational and music programs. 
Tom’s work has been recognized with numerous distinguished awards including regional Emmy Awards, Telly Awards, New York International Film Festival, Cine Golden Eagle, among others.

… is more than information. To truly affect change, you must transform information into ideas, and ideas into action.


 
Video can be a powerful tool to tell your story. It can also be an extraordinary waste of time and resources.  Video is only as good as the story it tells.  
 

Great stories can  … convey the wisdom and passion of those who truly know and care about a subject.
… transform the abstract into the concrete. 
… give people the information, inspiration and motivation to do things a bit differently.  


But for as powerful as video can be, it’s only a piece of the puzzle.  Your full story unfolds when it is integrated into a comprehensive communication strategy that reaches people wherever they are.
