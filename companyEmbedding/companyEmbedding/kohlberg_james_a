Kohlberg & Company is a private equity firm that focuses on leveraged buyout transactions founded by industry pioneer Jerome Kohlberg, Jr.
Today, the firm invests in a variety of transactions including leveraged carveouts (buyouts of divisions from larger companies), take private transactions and acquisitions of privately held companies. The firm focuses on companies facing operational or financial challenges, particularly middle-market companies. As of the end of 2007, Kohlberg & Company had raised six private equity funds since its inception, with approximately $3.7 billion of investor commitments. Kohlberg's previous funds totaled $306 million (1988), $165 million (1994), $320 million (1997), $576 million (2000) and $800 million (2004), respectively.
Additionally, Kohlberg also operates a series of debt investment funds under the banner of Katonah Debt Advisors, which it founded in 2000 as Katonah Capital. As of the end of 2007, Katonah Capital, and its successor, Katonah Debt Advisors had raised approximately $3.5 billion through 9 collateralized debt obligation funds. In 2006, the firm completed an initial public offering for Kohlberg Capital Corporation (NASDAQ: KCAP) to provide senior debt and mezzanine financing.
Kohlberg has approximately 25 investment professionals based in Mt. Kisco, New York, New York City, and Palo Alto, California.

History[edit]
The firm was founded in 1987,[1] when Jerome Kohlberg, Jr. resigned from Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. over differences in strategy. Kohlberg did not favor the larger buyouts (including Beatrice Companies (1985) and Safeway (1986) ), highly leveraged transactions or hostile takeovers being pursued increasingly by KKR.,[2][3] typified by their 1989 takeover of RJR Nabisco. Instead, Kohlberg chose to return to his roots, acquiring smaller, middle-market companies, and in 1987 he formed a new private equity firm Kohlberg & Company along with his son James, at that time a KKR executive. Their intent was to concentrate on transactions that could generate returns through revenue growth and operating improvements using only moderate leverage.[2]
Jerome Kohlberg retired from Kohlberg & Company in 1994.[4]
Funds[edit]
Kohlberg Investors VII, with a valuation of $1.6 billion, closed in April 2013.[1]
Kohlberg Investors VIII, with a valuation of $2.2 billion and more than 70 investors, closed in December 2016.[1]

Lawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development - Wikipedia





















 







Lawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
  (Redirected from Kohlberg's stages of moral development)

					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Lawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development constitute an adaptation of a psychological theory originally conceived by the Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget. Kohlberg began work on this topic while a psychology graduate student at the University of Chicago[1] in 1958, and expanded upon the theory throughout his life.
The theory holds that moral reasoning, the basis for ethical behavior, has six identifiable developmental stages, each more adequate at responding to moral dilemmas than its predecessor.[2] Kohlberg followed the development of moral judgment far beyond the ages studied earlier by Piaget,[3] who also claimed that logic and morality develop through constructive stages.[2] Expanding on Piaget's work, Kohlberg determined that the process of moral development was principally concerned with justice, and that it continued throughout the individual's lifetime,[4] a notion that spawned dialogue on the philosophical implications of such research.[5][6]
The six stages of moral development are grouped into three levels: pre-conventional morality, conventional morality, and post-conventional morality.
For his studies, Kohlberg relied on stories such as the Heinz dilemma, and was interested in how individuals would justify their actions if placed in similar moral dilemmas. He then analyzed the form of moral reasoning displayed, rather than its conclusion,[6] and classified it as belonging to one of six distinct stages.[7][8][9]
There have been critiques of the theory from several perspectives. Arguments include that it emphasizes justice to the exclusion of other moral values, such as caring;[10] that there is such an overlap between stages that they should more properly be regarded as separate domains; or that evaluations of the reasons for moral choices are mostly post hoc rationalizations (by both decision makers and psychologists studying them) of essentially intuitive decisions.[11]
Nevertheless, an entirely new field within psychology was created as a direct result of Kohlberg's theory, and according to Haggbloom et al.'s study of the most eminent psychologists of the 20th century, Kohlberg was the 16th most frequently cited psychologist in introductory psychology textbooks throughout the century, as well as the 30th most eminent overall.[12]
Kohlberg's scale is about how people justify behaviors and his stages are not a method of ranking how moral someone's behavior is. There should, however, be a correlation between how someone scores on the scale and how they behave, and the general hypothesis is that moral behaviour is more responsible, consistent and predictable from people at higher levels.[13]

Stages[edit]
Kohlberg's six stages can be more generally grouped into three levels of two stages each: pre-conventional, conventional and post-conventional.[7][8][9] Following Piaget's constructivist requirements for a stage model, as described in his theory of cognitive development, it is extremely rare to regress in stages—to lose the use of higher stage abilities.[14][15] Stages cannot be skipped; each provides a new and necessary perspective, more comprehensive and differentiated than its predecessors but integrated with them.[14][15]

Level 1 (Pre-Conventional)



1. Obedience and punishment orientation



(How can I avoid punishment?)




2. Self-interest orientation



(What's in it for me?)
(Paying for a benefit)










Level 2 (Conventional)






3. Interpersonal accord and conformity



(Social norms)
(The good boy/girl attitude)




4. Authority and social-order maintaining orientation



(Law and order morality)










Level 3 (Post-Conventional)






5. Social contract orientation
6. Universal ethical principles



(Principled conscience)









The understanding gained in each stage is retained in later stages, but may be regarded by those in later stages as simplistic, lacking in sufficient attention to detail.
Pre-conventional[edit]
The pre-conventional level of moral reasoning is especially common in children, although adults can also exhibit this level of reasoning. Reasoners at this level judge the morality of an action by its direct consequences. The pre-conventional level consists of the first and second stages of moral development and is solely concerned with the self in an egocentric manner. A child with pre-conventional morality has not yet adopted or internalized society's conventions regarding what is right or wrong but instead focuses largely on external consequences that certain actions may bring.[7][8][9]
In Stage one (obedience and punishment driven), individuals focus on the direct consequences of their actions on themselves. For example, an action is perceived as morally wrong because the perpetrator is punished. "The last time I did that I got spanked, so I will not do it again." The worse the punishment for the act is, the more "bad" the act is perceived to be.[16] This can give rise to an inference that even innocent victims are guilty in proportion to their suffering. It is "egocentric", lacking recognition that others' points of view are different from one's own.[17] There is "deference to superior power or prestige".[17]
An example of obedience and punishment driven morality would be a child refusing to do something because it is wrong and that the consequences could result in punishment. For example, a child's classmate tries to dare the child to skip school. The child would apply obedience and punishment driven morality by refusing to skip school because he would get punished.
Stage two (self-interest driven) expresses the "what's in it for me" position, in which right behavior is defined by whatever the individual believes to be in their best interest but understood in a narrow way which does not consider one's reputation or relationships to groups of people. Stage two reasoning shows a limited interest in the needs of others, but only to a point where it might further the individual's own interests. As a result, concern for others is not based on loyalty or intrinsic respect, but rather a "You scratch my back, and I'll scratch yours" mentality.[2] The lack of a societal perspective in the pre-conventional level is quite different from the social contract (stage five), as all actions at this stage have the purpose of serving the individual's own needs or interests. For the stage two theorist, the world's perspective is often seen as morally relative.
An example of self-interest driven is when a child is asked by his parents to do a chore. The child asks, "what's in it for me?" The parents offer the child an incentive by giving a child an allowance to pay them for their chores. The child is motivated by self-interest to do chores.
Conventional[edit]
The conventional level of moral reasoning is typical of adolescents and adults. To reason in a conventional way is to judge the morality of actions by comparing them to society's views and expectations. The conventional level consists of the third and fourth stages of moral development. Conventional morality is characterized by an acceptance of society's conventions concerning right and wrong. At this level an individual obeys rules and follows society's norms even when there are no consequences for obedience or disobedience. Adherence to rules and conventions is somewhat rigid, however, and a rule's appropriateness or fairness is seldom questioned.[7][8][9]
In Stage three (good intentions as determined by social consensus), the self enters society by conforming to social standards. Individuals are receptive to approval or disapproval from others as it reflects society's views. They try to be a "good boy" or "good girl" to live up to these expectations,[2] having learned that being regarded as good benefits the self. Stage three reasoning may judge the morality of an action by evaluating its consequences in terms of a person's relationships, which now begin to include things like respect, gratitude, and the "golden rule". "I want to be liked and thought well of; apparently, not being naughty makes people like me." Conforming to the rules for one's social role is not yet fully understood. The intentions of actors play a more significant role in reasoning at this stage; one may feel more forgiving if one thinks that "they mean well".[2]
In Stage four (authority and social order obedience driven), it is important to obey laws, dictums, and social conventions because of their importance in maintaining a functioning society. Moral reasoning in stage four is thus beyond the need for individual approval exhibited in stage three. A central ideal or ideals often prescribe what is right and wrong. If one person violates a law, perhaps everyone would—thus there is an obligation and a duty to uphold laws and rules. When someone does violate a law, it is morally wrong; culpability is thus a significant factor in this stage as it separates the bad domains from the good ones. Most active members of society remain at stage four, where morality is still predominantly dictated by an outside force.[2]
Post-Conventional[edit]
The post-conventional level, also known as the principled level, is marked by a growing realization that individuals are separate entities from society, and that the individual’s own perspective may take precedence over society’s view; individuals may disobey rules inconsistent with their own principles. Post-conventional moralists live by their own ethical principles—principles that typically include such basic human rights as life, liberty, and justice. People who exhibit post-conventional morality view rules as useful but changeable mechanisms—ideally rules can maintain the general social order and protect human rights. Rules are not absolute dictates that must be obeyed without question. Because post-conventional individuals elevate their own moral evaluation of a situation over social conventions, their behavior, especially at stage six, can be confused with that of those at the pre-conventional level.[citation needed]
Some theorists have speculated that many people may never reach this level of abstract moral reasoning.[7][8][9]
In Stage five (social contract driven), the world is viewed as holding different opinions, rights, and values. Such perspectives should be mutually respected as unique to each person or community. Laws are regarded as social contracts rather than rigid edicts. Those that do not promote the general welfare should be changed when necessary to meet “the greatest good for the greatest number of people".[8] This is achieved through majority decision and inevitable compromise. Democratic government is ostensibly based on stage five reasoning.
In Stage six (universal ethical principles driven), moral reasoning is based on abstract reasoning using universal ethical principles. Laws are valid only insofar as they are grounded in justice, and a commitment to justice carries with it an obligation to disobey unjust laws. Legal rights are unnecessary, as social contracts are not essential for deontic moral action. Decisions are not reached hypothetically in a conditional way but rather categorically in an absolute way, as in the philosophy of Immanuel Kant.[18] This involves an individual imagining what they would do in another’s shoes, if they believed what that other person imagines to be true.[19] The resulting consensus is the action taken. In this way action is never a means but always an end in itself; the individual acts because it is right, and not because it avoids punishment, is in their best interest, expected, legal, or previously agreed upon. Although Kohlberg insisted that stage six exists, he found it difficult to identify individuals who consistently operated at that level.[15]
Further stages[edit]
In Kohlberg's empirical studies of individuals throughout their life Kohlberg observed that some had apparently undergone moral stage regression. This could be resolved either by allowing for moral regression or by extending the theory. Kohlberg chose the latter, postulating the existence of sub-stages in which the emerging stage has not yet been fully integrated into the personality.[8] In particular Kohlberg noted a stage 4½ or 4+, a transition from stage four to stage five, that shared characteristics of both.[8] In this stage the individual is disaffected with the arbitrary nature of law and order reasoning; culpability is frequently turned from being defined by society to viewing society itself as culpable. This stage is often mistaken for the moral relativism of stage two, as the individual views those interests of society that conflict with their own as being relatively and morally wrong.[8] Kohlberg noted that this was often observed in students entering college.[8][15]
Kohlberg suggested that there may be a seventh stage—Transcendental Morality, or Morality of Cosmic Orientation—which linked religion with moral reasoning.[20] Kohlberg's difficulties in obtaining empirical evidence for even a sixth stage,[15] however, led him to emphasize the speculative nature of his seventh stage.[5]
Theoretical assumptions (philosophy)[edit]
Kohlberg's stages of moral development are based on the assumption that humans are inherently communicative, capable of reason, and possess a desire to understand others and the world around them. The stages of this model relate to the qualitative moral reasonings adopted by individuals, and so do not translate directly into praise or blame of any individual's actions or character. Arguing that his theory measures moral reasoning and not particular moral conclusions, Kohlberg insists that the form and structure of moral arguments is independent of the content of those arguments, a position he calls "formalism".[6][7]
Kohlberg's theory centers on the notion that justice is the essential characteristic of moral reasoning. Justice itself relies heavily upon the notion of sound reasoning based on principles. Despite being a justice-centered theory of morality, Kohlberg considered it to be compatible with plausible formulations of deontology[18] and eudaimonia.
Kohlberg's theory understands values as a critical component of the right. Whatever the right is, for Kohlberg, it must be universally valid across societies (a position known as "moral universalism"):[7] there can be no relativism. Moreover, morals are not natural features of the world; they are prescriptive. Nevertheless, moral judgments can be evaluated in logical terms of truth and falsity.
According to Kohlberg, someone progressing to a higher stage of moral reasoning cannot skip stages. For example, an individual cannot jump from being concerned mostly with peer judgments (stage three) to being a proponent of social contracts (stage five).[15] On encountering a moral dilemma and finding their current level of moral reasoning unsatisfactory, however, an individual will look to the next level. Realizing the limitations of the current stage of thinking is the driving force behind moral development, as each progressive stage is more adequate than the last.[15] The process is therefore considered to be constructive, as it is initiated by the conscious construction of the individual, and is not in any meaningful sense a component of the individual's innate dispositions, or a result of past inductions.
Formal elements[edit]

Progress through Kohlberg's stages happens as a result of the individual's increasing competence, both psychologically and in balancing conflicting social-value claims. The process of resolving conflicting claims to reach an equilibrium is called "justice operation". Kohlberg identifies two of these justice operations: "equality", which involves an impartial regard for persons, and "reciprocity", which means a regard for the role of personal merit. For Kohlberg, the most adequate result of both operations is "reversibility", in which a moral or dutiful act within a particular situation is evaluated in terms of whether or not the act would be satisfactory even if particular persons were to switch roles within that situation (also known colloquially as "moral musical chairs").[6]
Knowledge and learning contribute to moral development. Specifically important are the individual's "view of persons" and their "social perspective level", each of which becomes more complex and mature with each advancing stage. The "view of persons" can be understood as the individual's grasp of the psychology of other persons; it may be pictured as a spectrum, with stage one having no view of other persons at all, and stage six being entirely socio-centric.[6] Similarly, the social perspective level involves the understanding of the social universe, differing from the view of persons in that it involves an appreciation of social norms.
Examples of applied moral dilemmas[edit]
Kohlberg established the Moral Judgement Interview in his original 1958 dissertation.[4] During the roughly 45-minute tape recorded semi-structured interview, the interviewer uses moral dilemmas to determine which stage of moral reasoning a person uses. The dilemmas are fictional short stories that describe situations in which a person has to make a moral decision. The participant is asked a systemic series of open-ended questions, like what they think the right course of action is, as well as justifications as to why certain actions are right or wrong. The form and structure of these replies are scored and not the content; over a set of multiple moral dilemmas an overall score is derived.[4][9]
A dilemma that Kohlberg used in his original research was the druggist's dilemma: Heinz Steals the Drug In Europe.[5]
Criticisms[edit]
One criticism of Kohlberg's theory is that it emphasizes justice to the exclusion of other values, and so may not adequately address the arguments of those who value other moral aspects of actions. Carol Gilligan has argued that Kohlberg's theory is overly androcentric.[10] Kohlberg's theory was initially developed based on empirical research using only male participants; Gilligan argued that it did not adequately describe the concerns of women.[21] Kohlberg stated that women tend to get stuck at level 3, focusing on details of how to maintain relationships and promote the welfare of family and friends. Men are likely to move on to the abstract principles, and thus have less concern with the particulars of who is involved.[22] Consistent with this observation, Gilligan's theory of moral development does not focus on the value of justice. She developed an alternative theory of moral reasoning based on the ethics of caring.[10] Critics such as Christina Hoff Sommers, however, argued that Gilligan's research is ill-founded, and that no evidence exists to support her conclusion.[23]
Kohlberg's stages are not culturally neutral, as demonstrated by its application to a number of different cultures.[1] Although they progress through the stages in the same order, individuals in different cultures seem to do so at different rates.[24] Kohlberg has responded by saying that although different cultures do indeed inculcate different beliefs, his stages correspond to underlying modes of reasoning, rather than to those beliefs.[1][25]
Another criticism of Kohlberg’s theory is that people frequently demonstrate significant inconsistency in their moral judgements.[26] This often occurs in moral dilemmas involving drinking and driving and business situations where participants have been shown to reason at a subpar stage, typically using more self-interest driven reasoning (i.e., stage two) than authority and social order obedience driven reasoning (i.e., stage four).[26][27] Kohlberg’s theory is generally considered to be incompatible with inconsistencies in moral reasoning.[26] Carpendale has argued that Kohlberg’s theory should be modified to focus on the view that the process of moral reasoning involves integrating varying perspectives of a moral dilemma rather than simply fixating on applying rules.[27] This view would allow for inconsistency in moral reasoning since individuals may be hampered by their inability to consider different perspectives.[26] Krebs and Denton have also attempted to modify Kohlberg’s theory to account for a multitude of conflicting findings, but eventually concluded that the theory is not equipped to take into consideration how most individuals make moral decisions in their everyday lives.[28]
Other psychologists have questioned the assumption that moral action is primarily a result of formal reasoning. Social intuitionists such as Jonathan Haidt, for example, argue that individuals often make moral judgments without weighing concerns such as fairness, law, human rights, or abstract ethical values. Thus the arguments analyzed by Kohlberg and other rationalist psychologists could be considered post hoc rationalizations of intuitive decisions; moral reasoning may be less relevant to moral action than Kohlberg's theory suggests.[11]
Continued relevance[edit]
Kohlberg's body of work on the stages of moral development has been utilized by others working in the field. One example is the Defining Issues Test (DIT) created in 1979 by James Rest,[29] originally as a pencil-and-paper alternative to the Moral Judgement Interview.[30] Heavily influenced by the six-stage model, it made efforts to improve the validity criteria by using a quantitative test, the Likert scale, to rate moral dilemmas similar to Kohlberg's.[31] It also used a large body of Kohlbergian theory such as the idea of "post-conventional thinking".[32][33] In 1999 the DIT was revised as the DIT-2;[30] the test continues to be used in many areas where moral testing is required,[34] such as divinity, politics, and medicine.[35][36][37]

History[edit]
The firm was founded in 1987,[1] when Jerome Kohlberg, Jr. resigned from Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. over differences in strategy. Kohlberg did not favor the larger buyouts (including Beatrice Companies (1985) and Safeway (1986) ), highly leveraged transactions or hostile takeovers being pursued increasingly by KKR.,[2][3] typified by their 1989 takeover of RJR Nabisco. Instead, Kohlberg chose to return to his roots, acquiring smaller, middle-market companies, and in 1987 he formed a new private equity firm Kohlberg & Company along with his son James, at that time a KKR executive. Their intent was to concentrate on transactions that could generate returns through revenue growth and operating improvements using only moderate leverage.[2]
Jerome Kohlberg retired from Kohlberg & Company in 1994.[4]

Lawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development - Wikipedia





















 







Lawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
  (Redirected from Kohlberg's stages of moral development)

					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Lawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development constitute an adaptation of a psychological theory originally conceived by the Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget. Kohlberg began work on this topic while a psychology graduate student at the University of Chicago[1] in 1958, and expanded upon the theory throughout his life.
The theory holds that moral reasoning, the basis for ethical behavior, has six identifiable developmental stages, each more adequate at responding to moral dilemmas than its predecessor.[2] Kohlberg followed the development of moral judgment far beyond the ages studied earlier by Piaget,[3] who also claimed that logic and morality develop through constructive stages.[2] Expanding on Piaget's work, Kohlberg determined that the process of moral development was principally concerned with justice, and that it continued throughout the individual's lifetime,[4] a notion that spawned dialogue on the philosophical implications of such research.[5][6]
The six stages of moral development are grouped into three levels: pre-conventional morality, conventional morality, and post-conventional morality.
For his studies, Kohlberg relied on stories such as the Heinz dilemma, and was interested in how individuals would justify their actions if placed in similar moral dilemmas. He then analyzed the form of moral reasoning displayed, rather than its conclusion,[6] and classified it as belonging to one of six distinct stages.[7][8][9]
There have been critiques of the theory from several perspectives. Arguments include that it emphasizes justice to the exclusion of other moral values, such as caring;[10] that there is such an overlap between stages that they should more properly be regarded as separate domains; or that evaluations of the reasons for moral choices are mostly post hoc rationalizations (by both decision makers and psychologists studying them) of essentially intuitive decisions.[11]
Nevertheless, an entirely new field within psychology was created as a direct result of Kohlberg's theory, and according to Haggbloom et al.'s study of the most eminent psychologists of the 20th century, Kohlberg was the 16th most frequently cited psychologist in introductory psychology textbooks throughout the century, as well as the 30th most eminent overall.[12]
Kohlberg's scale is about how people justify behaviors and his stages are not a method of ranking how moral someone's behavior is. There should, however, be a correlation between how someone scores on the scale and how they behave, and the general hypothesis is that moral behaviour is more responsible, consistent and predictable from people at higher levels.[13]

Stages[edit]
Kohlberg's six stages can be more generally grouped into three levels of two stages each: pre-conventional, conventional and post-conventional.[7][8][9] Following Piaget's constructivist requirements for a stage model, as described in his theory of cognitive development, it is extremely rare to regress in stages—to lose the use of higher stage abilities.[14][15] Stages cannot be skipped; each provides a new and necessary perspective, more comprehensive and differentiated than its predecessors but integrated with them.[14][15]

Level 1 (Pre-Conventional)



1. Obedience and punishment orientation



(How can I avoid punishment?)




2. Self-interest orientation



(What's in it for me?)
(Paying for a benefit)










Level 2 (Conventional)






3. Interpersonal accord and conformity



(Social norms)
(The good boy/girl attitude)




4. Authority and social-order maintaining orientation



(Law and order morality)










Level 3 (Post-Conventional)






5. Social contract orientation
6. Universal ethical principles



(Principled conscience)









The understanding gained in each stage is retained in later stages, but may be regarded by those in later stages as simplistic, lacking in sufficient attention to detail.
Pre-conventional[edit]
The pre-conventional level of moral reasoning is especially common in children, although adults can also exhibit this level of reasoning. Reasoners at this level judge the morality of an action by its direct consequences. The pre-conventional level consists of the first and second stages of moral development and is solely concerned with the self in an egocentric manner. A child with pre-conventional morality has not yet adopted or internalized society's conventions regarding what is right or wrong but instead focuses largely on external consequences that certain actions may bring.[7][8][9]
In Stage one (obedience and punishment driven), individuals focus on the direct consequences of their actions on themselves. For example, an action is perceived as morally wrong because the perpetrator is punished. "The last time I did that I got spanked, so I will not do it again." The worse the punishment for the act is, the more "bad" the act is perceived to be.[16] This can give rise to an inference that even innocent victims are guilty in proportion to their suffering. It is "egocentric", lacking recognition that others' points of view are different from one's own.[17] There is "deference to superior power or prestige".[17]
An example of obedience and punishment driven morality would be a child refusing to do something because it is wrong and that the consequences could result in punishment. For example, a child's classmate tries to dare the child to skip school. The child would apply obedience and punishment driven morality by refusing to skip school because he would get punished.
Stage two (self-interest driven) expresses the "what's in it for me" position, in which right behavior is defined by whatever the individual believes to be in their best interest but understood in a narrow way which does not consider one's reputation or relationships to groups of people. Stage two reasoning shows a limited interest in the needs of others, but only to a point where it might further the individual's own interests. As a result, concern for others is not based on loyalty or intrinsic respect, but rather a "You scratch my back, and I'll scratch yours" mentality.[2] The lack of a societal perspective in the pre-conventional level is quite different from the social contract (stage five), as all actions at this stage have the purpose of serving the individual's own needs or interests. For the stage two theorist, the world's perspective is often seen as morally relative.
An example of self-interest driven is when a child is asked by his parents to do a chore. The child asks, "what's in it for me?" The parents offer the child an incentive by giving a child an allowance to pay them for their chores. The child is motivated by self-interest to do chores.
Conventional[edit]
The conventional level of moral reasoning is typical of adolescents and adults. To reason in a conventional way is to judge the morality of actions by comparing them to society's views and expectations. The conventional level consists of the third and fourth stages of moral development. Conventional morality is characterized by an acceptance of society's conventions concerning right and wrong. At this level an individual obeys rules and follows society's norms even when there are no consequences for obedience or disobedience. Adherence to rules and conventions is somewhat rigid, however, and a rule's appropriateness or fairness is seldom questioned.[7][8][9]
In Stage three (good intentions as determined by social consensus), the self enters society by conforming to social standards. Individuals are receptive to approval or disapproval from others as it reflects society's views. They try to be a "good boy" or "good girl" to live up to these expectations,[2] having learned that being regarded as good benefits the self. Stage three reasoning may judge the morality of an action by evaluating its consequences in terms of a person's relationships, which now begin to include things like respect, gratitude, and the "golden rule". "I want to be liked and thought well of; apparently, not being naughty makes people like me." Conforming to the rules for one's social role is not yet fully understood. The intentions of actors play a more significant role in reasoning at this stage; one may feel more forgiving if one thinks that "they mean well".[2]
In Stage four (authority and social order obedience driven), it is important to obey laws, dictums, and social conventions because of their importance in maintaining a functioning society. Moral reasoning in stage four is thus beyond the need for individual approval exhibited in stage three. A central ideal or ideals often prescribe what is right and wrong. If one person violates a law, perhaps everyone would—thus there is an obligation and a duty to uphold laws and rules. When someone does violate a law, it is morally wrong; culpability is thus a significant factor in this stage as it separates the bad domains from the good ones. Most active members of society remain at stage four, where morality is still predominantly dictated by an outside force.[2]
Post-Conventional[edit]
The post-conventional level, also known as the principled level, is marked by a growing realization that individuals are separate entities from society, and that the individual’s own perspective may take precedence over society’s view; individuals may disobey rules inconsistent with their own principles. Post-conventional moralists live by their own ethical principles—principles that typically include such basic human rights as life, liberty, and justice. People who exhibit post-conventional morality view rules as useful but changeable mechanisms—ideally rules can maintain the general social order and protect human rights. Rules are not absolute dictates that must be obeyed without question. Because post-conventional individuals elevate their own moral evaluation of a situation over social conventions, their behavior, especially at stage six, can be confused with that of those at the pre-conventional level.[citation needed]
Some theorists have speculated that many people may never reach this level of abstract moral reasoning.[7][8][9]
In Stage five (social contract driven), the world is viewed as holding different opinions, rights, and values. Such perspectives should be mutually respected as unique to each person or community. Laws are regarded as social contracts rather than rigid edicts. Those that do not promote the general welfare should be changed when necessary to meet “the greatest good for the greatest number of people".[8] This is achieved through majority decision and inevitable compromise. Democratic government is ostensibly based on stage five reasoning.
In Stage six (universal ethical principles driven), moral reasoning is based on abstract reasoning using universal ethical principles. Laws are valid only insofar as they are grounded in justice, and a commitment to justice carries with it an obligation to disobey unjust laws. Legal rights are unnecessary, as social contracts are not essential for deontic moral action. Decisions are not reached hypothetically in a conditional way but rather categorically in an absolute way, as in the philosophy of Immanuel Kant.[18] This involves an individual imagining what they would do in another’s shoes, if they believed what that other person imagines to be true.[19] The resulting consensus is the action taken. In this way action is never a means but always an end in itself; the individual acts because it is right, and not because it avoids punishment, is in their best interest, expected, legal, or previously agreed upon. Although Kohlberg insisted that stage six exists, he found it difficult to identify individuals who consistently operated at that level.[15]
Further stages[edit]
In Kohlberg's empirical studies of individuals throughout their life Kohlberg observed that some had apparently undergone moral stage regression. This could be resolved either by allowing for moral regression or by extending the theory. Kohlberg chose the latter, postulating the existence of sub-stages in which the emerging stage has not yet been fully integrated into the personality.[8] In particular Kohlberg noted a stage 4½ or 4+, a transition from stage four to stage five, that shared characteristics of both.[8] In this stage the individual is disaffected with the arbitrary nature of law and order reasoning; culpability is frequently turned from being defined by society to viewing society itself as culpable. This stage is often mistaken for the moral relativism of stage two, as the individual views those interests of society that conflict with their own as being relatively and morally wrong.[8] Kohlberg noted that this was often observed in students entering college.[8][15]
Kohlberg suggested that there may be a seventh stage—Transcendental Morality, or Morality of Cosmic Orientation—which linked religion with moral reasoning.[20] Kohlberg's difficulties in obtaining empirical evidence for even a sixth stage,[15] however, led him to emphasize the speculative nature of his seventh stage.[5]
Theoretical assumptions (philosophy)[edit]
Kohlberg's stages of moral development are based on the assumption that humans are inherently communicative, capable of reason, and possess a desire to understand others and the world around them. The stages of this model relate to the qualitative moral reasonings adopted by individuals, and so do not translate directly into praise or blame of any individual's actions or character. Arguing that his theory measures moral reasoning and not particular moral conclusions, Kohlberg insists that the form and structure of moral arguments is independent of the content of those arguments, a position he calls "formalism".[6][7]
Kohlberg's theory centers on the notion that justice is the essential characteristic of moral reasoning. Justice itself relies heavily upon the notion of sound reasoning based on principles. Despite being a justice-centered theory of morality, Kohlberg considered it to be compatible with plausible formulations of deontology[18] and eudaimonia.
Kohlberg's theory understands values as a critical component of the right. Whatever the right is, for Kohlberg, it must be universally valid across societies (a position known as "moral universalism"):[7] there can be no relativism. Moreover, morals are not natural features of the world; they are prescriptive. Nevertheless, moral judgments can be evaluated in logical terms of truth and falsity.
According to Kohlberg, someone progressing to a higher stage of moral reasoning cannot skip stages. For example, an individual cannot jump from being concerned mostly with peer judgments (stage three) to being a proponent of social contracts (stage five).[15] On encountering a moral dilemma and finding their current level of moral reasoning unsatisfactory, however, an individual will look to the next level. Realizing the limitations of the current stage of thinking is the driving force behind moral development, as each progressive stage is more adequate than the last.[15] The process is therefore considered to be constructive, as it is initiated by the conscious construction of the individual, and is not in any meaningful sense a component of the individual's innate dispositions, or a result of past inductions.
Formal elements[edit]

Progress through Kohlberg's stages happens as a result of the individual's increasing competence, both psychologically and in balancing conflicting social-value claims. The process of resolving conflicting claims to reach an equilibrium is called "justice operation". Kohlberg identifies two of these justice operations: "equality", which involves an impartial regard for persons, and "reciprocity", which means a regard for the role of personal merit. For Kohlberg, the most adequate result of both operations is "reversibility", in which a moral or dutiful act within a particular situation is evaluated in terms of whether or not the act would be satisfactory even if particular persons were to switch roles within that situation (also known colloquially as "moral musical chairs").[6]
Knowledge and learning contribute to moral development. Specifically important are the individual's "view of persons" and their "social perspective level", each of which becomes more complex and mature with each advancing stage. The "view of persons" can be understood as the individual's grasp of the psychology of other persons; it may be pictured as a spectrum, with stage one having no view of other persons at all, and stage six being entirely socio-centric.[6] Similarly, the social perspective level involves the understanding of the social universe, differing from the view of persons in that it involves an appreciation of social norms.
Examples of applied moral dilemmas[edit]
Kohlberg established the Moral Judgement Interview in his original 1958 dissertation.[4] During the roughly 45-minute tape recorded semi-structured interview, the interviewer uses moral dilemmas to determine which stage of moral reasoning a person uses. The dilemmas are fictional short stories that describe situations in which a person has to make a moral decision. The participant is asked a systemic series of open-ended questions, like what they think the right course of action is, as well as justifications as to why certain actions are right or wrong. The form and structure of these replies are scored and not the content; over a set of multiple moral dilemmas an overall score is derived.[4][9]
A dilemma that Kohlberg used in his original research was the druggist's dilemma: Heinz Steals the Drug In Europe.[5]
Criticisms[edit]
One criticism of Kohlberg's theory is that it emphasizes justice to the exclusion of other values, and so may not adequately address the arguments of those who value other moral aspects of actions. Carol Gilligan has argued that Kohlberg's theory is overly androcentric.[10] Kohlberg's theory was initially developed based on empirical research using only male participants; Gilligan argued that it did not adequately describe the concerns of women.[21] Kohlberg stated that women tend to get stuck at level 3, focusing on details of how to maintain relationships and promote the welfare of family and friends. Men are likely to move on to the abstract principles, and thus have less concern with the particulars of who is involved.[22] Consistent with this observation, Gilligan's theory of moral development does not focus on the value of justice. She developed an alternative theory of moral reasoning based on the ethics of caring.[10] Critics such as Christina Hoff Sommers, however, argued that Gilligan's research is ill-founded, and that no evidence exists to support her conclusion.[23]
Kohlberg's stages are not culturally neutral, as demonstrated by its application to a number of different cultures.[1] Although they progress through the stages in the same order, individuals in different cultures seem to do so at different rates.[24] Kohlberg has responded by saying that although different cultures do indeed inculcate different beliefs, his stages correspond to underlying modes of reasoning, rather than to those beliefs.[1][25]
Another criticism of Kohlberg’s theory is that people frequently demonstrate significant inconsistency in their moral judgements.[26] This often occurs in moral dilemmas involving drinking and driving and business situations where participants have been shown to reason at a subpar stage, typically using more self-interest driven reasoning (i.e., stage two) than authority and social order obedience driven reasoning (i.e., stage four).[26][27] Kohlberg’s theory is generally considered to be incompatible with inconsistencies in moral reasoning.[26] Carpendale has argued that Kohlberg’s theory should be modified to focus on the view that the process of moral reasoning involves integrating varying perspectives of a moral dilemma rather than simply fixating on applying rules.[27] This view would allow for inconsistency in moral reasoning since individuals may be hampered by their inability to consider different perspectives.[26] Krebs and Denton have also attempted to modify Kohlberg’s theory to account for a multitude of conflicting findings, but eventually concluded that the theory is not equipped to take into consideration how most individuals make moral decisions in their everyday lives.[28]
Other psychologists have questioned the assumption that moral action is primarily a result of formal reasoning. Social intuitionists such as Jonathan Haidt, for example, argue that individuals often make moral judgments without weighing concerns such as fairness, law, human rights, or abstract ethical values. Thus the arguments analyzed by Kohlberg and other rationalist psychologists could be considered post hoc rationalizations of intuitive decisions; moral reasoning may be less relevant to moral action than Kohlberg's theory suggests.[11]
Continued relevance[edit]
Kohlberg's body of work on the stages of moral development has been utilized by others working in the field. One example is the Defining Issues Test (DIT) created in 1979 by James Rest,[29] originally as a pencil-and-paper alternative to the Moral Judgement Interview.[30] Heavily influenced by the six-stage model, it made efforts to improve the validity criteria by using a quantitative test, the Likert scale, to rate moral dilemmas similar to Kohlberg's.[31] It also used a large body of Kohlbergian theory such as the idea of "post-conventional thinking".[32][33] In 1999 the DIT was revised as the DIT-2;[30] the test continues to be used in many areas where moral testing is required,[34] such as divinity, politics, and medicine.[35][36][37]

Lawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
  (Redirected from Kohlberg's stages of moral development)

					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Lawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development constitute an adaptation of a psychological theory originally conceived by the Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget. Kohlberg began work on this topic while a psychology graduate student at the University of Chicago[1] in 1958, and expanded upon the theory throughout his life.
The theory holds that moral reasoning, the basis for ethical behavior, has six identifiable developmental stages, each more adequate at responding to moral dilemmas than its predecessor.[2] Kohlberg followed the development of moral judgment far beyond the ages studied earlier by Piaget,[3] who also claimed that logic and morality develop through constructive stages.[2] Expanding on Piaget's work, Kohlberg determined that the process of moral development was principally concerned with justice, and that it continued throughout the individual's lifetime,[4] a notion that spawned dialogue on the philosophical implications of such research.[5][6]
The six stages of moral development are grouped into three levels: pre-conventional morality, conventional morality, and post-conventional morality.
For his studies, Kohlberg relied on stories such as the Heinz dilemma, and was interested in how individuals would justify their actions if placed in similar moral dilemmas. He then analyzed the form of moral reasoning displayed, rather than its conclusion,[6] and classified it as belonging to one of six distinct stages.[7][8][9]
There have been critiques of the theory from several perspectives. Arguments include that it emphasizes justice to the exclusion of other moral values, such as caring;[10] that there is such an overlap between stages that they should more properly be regarded as separate domains; or that evaluations of the reasons for moral choices are mostly post hoc rationalizations (by both decision makers and psychologists studying them) of essentially intuitive decisions.[11]
Nevertheless, an entirely new field within psychology was created as a direct result of Kohlberg's theory, and according to Haggbloom et al.'s study of the most eminent psychologists of the 20th century, Kohlberg was the 16th most frequently cited psychologist in introductory psychology textbooks throughout the century, as well as the 30th most eminent overall.[12]
Kohlberg's scale is about how people justify behaviors and his stages are not a method of ranking how moral someone's behavior is. There should, however, be a correlation between how someone scores on the scale and how they behave, and the general hypothesis is that moral behaviour is more responsible, consistent and predictable from people at higher levels.[13]

Stages[edit]
Kohlberg's six stages can be more generally grouped into three levels of two stages each: pre-conventional, conventional and post-conventional.[7][8][9] Following Piaget's constructivist requirements for a stage model, as described in his theory of cognitive development, it is extremely rare to regress in stages—to lose the use of higher stage abilities.[14][15] Stages cannot be skipped; each provides a new and necessary perspective, more comprehensive and differentiated than its predecessors but integrated with them.[14][15]

Level 1 (Pre-Conventional)



1. Obedience and punishment orientation



(How can I avoid punishment?)




2. Self-interest orientation



(What's in it for me?)
(Paying for a benefit)










Level 2 (Conventional)






3. Interpersonal accord and conformity



(Social norms)
(The good boy/girl attitude)




4. Authority and social-order maintaining orientation



(Law and order morality)










Level 3 (Post-Conventional)






5. Social contract orientation
6. Universal ethical principles



(Principled conscience)









The understanding gained in each stage is retained in later stages, but may be regarded by those in later stages as simplistic, lacking in sufficient attention to detail.
Pre-conventional[edit]
The pre-conventional level of moral reasoning is especially common in children, although adults can also exhibit this level of reasoning. Reasoners at this level judge the morality of an action by its direct consequences. The pre-conventional level consists of the first and second stages of moral development and is solely concerned with the self in an egocentric manner. A child with pre-conventional morality has not yet adopted or internalized society's conventions regarding what is right or wrong but instead focuses largely on external consequences that certain actions may bring.[7][8][9]
In Stage one (obedience and punishment driven), individuals focus on the direct consequences of their actions on themselves. For example, an action is perceived as morally wrong because the perpetrator is punished. "The last time I did that I got spanked, so I will not do it again." The worse the punishment for the act is, the more "bad" the act is perceived to be.[16] This can give rise to an inference that even innocent victims are guilty in proportion to their suffering. It is "egocentric", lacking recognition that others' points of view are different from one's own.[17] There is "deference to superior power or prestige".[17]
An example of obedience and punishment driven morality would be a child refusing to do something because it is wrong and that the consequences could result in punishment. For example, a child's classmate tries to dare the child to skip school. The child would apply obedience and punishment driven morality by refusing to skip school because he would get punished.
Stage two (self-interest driven) expresses the "what's in it for me" position, in which right behavior is defined by whatever the individual believes to be in their best interest but understood in a narrow way which does not consider one's reputation or relationships to groups of people. Stage two reasoning shows a limited interest in the needs of others, but only to a point where it might further the individual's own interests. As a result, concern for others is not based on loyalty or intrinsic respect, but rather a "You scratch my back, and I'll scratch yours" mentality.[2] The lack of a societal perspective in the pre-conventional level is quite different from the social contract (stage five), as all actions at this stage have the purpose of serving the individual's own needs or interests. For the stage two theorist, the world's perspective is often seen as morally relative.
An example of self-interest driven is when a child is asked by his parents to do a chore. The child asks, "what's in it for me?" The parents offer the child an incentive by giving a child an allowance to pay them for their chores. The child is motivated by self-interest to do chores.
Conventional[edit]
The conventional level of moral reasoning is typical of adolescents and adults. To reason in a conventional way is to judge the morality of actions by comparing them to society's views and expectations. The conventional level consists of the third and fourth stages of moral development. Conventional morality is characterized by an acceptance of society's conventions concerning right and wrong. At this level an individual obeys rules and follows society's norms even when there are no consequences for obedience or disobedience. Adherence to rules and conventions is somewhat rigid, however, and a rule's appropriateness or fairness is seldom questioned.[7][8][9]
In Stage three (good intentions as determined by social consensus), the self enters society by conforming to social standards. Individuals are receptive to approval or disapproval from others as it reflects society's views. They try to be a "good boy" or "good girl" to live up to these expectations,[2] having learned that being regarded as good benefits the self. Stage three reasoning may judge the morality of an action by evaluating its consequences in terms of a person's relationships, which now begin to include things like respect, gratitude, and the "golden rule". "I want to be liked and thought well of; apparently, not being naughty makes people like me." Conforming to the rules for one's social role is not yet fully understood. The intentions of actors play a more significant role in reasoning at this stage; one may feel more forgiving if one thinks that "they mean well".[2]
In Stage four (authority and social order obedience driven), it is important to obey laws, dictums, and social conventions because of their importance in maintaining a functioning society. Moral reasoning in stage four is thus beyond the need for individual approval exhibited in stage three. A central ideal or ideals often prescribe what is right and wrong. If one person violates a law, perhaps everyone would—thus there is an obligation and a duty to uphold laws and rules. When someone does violate a law, it is morally wrong; culpability is thus a significant factor in this stage as it separates the bad domains from the good ones. Most active members of society remain at stage four, where morality is still predominantly dictated by an outside force.[2]
Post-Conventional[edit]
The post-conventional level, also known as the principled level, is marked by a growing realization that individuals are separate entities from society, and that the individual’s own perspective may take precedence over society’s view; individuals may disobey rules inconsistent with their own principles. Post-conventional moralists live by their own ethical principles—principles that typically include such basic human rights as life, liberty, and justice. People who exhibit post-conventional morality view rules as useful but changeable mechanisms—ideally rules can maintain the general social order and protect human rights. Rules are not absolute dictates that must be obeyed without question. Because post-conventional individuals elevate their own moral evaluation of a situation over social conventions, their behavior, especially at stage six, can be confused with that of those at the pre-conventional level.[citation needed]
Some theorists have speculated that many people may never reach this level of abstract moral reasoning.[7][8][9]
In Stage five (social contract driven), the world is viewed as holding different opinions, rights, and values. Such perspectives should be mutually respected as unique to each person or community. Laws are regarded as social contracts rather than rigid edicts. Those that do not promote the general welfare should be changed when necessary to meet “the greatest good for the greatest number of people".[8] This is achieved through majority decision and inevitable compromise. Democratic government is ostensibly based on stage five reasoning.
In Stage six (universal ethical principles driven), moral reasoning is based on abstract reasoning using universal ethical principles. Laws are valid only insofar as they are grounded in justice, and a commitment to justice carries with it an obligation to disobey unjust laws. Legal rights are unnecessary, as social contracts are not essential for deontic moral action. Decisions are not reached hypothetically in a conditional way but rather categorically in an absolute way, as in the philosophy of Immanuel Kant.[18] This involves an individual imagining what they would do in another’s shoes, if they believed what that other person imagines to be true.[19] The resulting consensus is the action taken. In this way action is never a means but always an end in itself; the individual acts because it is right, and not because it avoids punishment, is in their best interest, expected, legal, or previously agreed upon. Although Kohlberg insisted that stage six exists, he found it difficult to identify individuals who consistently operated at that level.[15]
Further stages[edit]
In Kohlberg's empirical studies of individuals throughout their life Kohlberg observed that some had apparently undergone moral stage regression. This could be resolved either by allowing for moral regression or by extending the theory. Kohlberg chose the latter, postulating the existence of sub-stages in which the emerging stage has not yet been fully integrated into the personality.[8] In particular Kohlberg noted a stage 4½ or 4+, a transition from stage four to stage five, that shared characteristics of both.[8] In this stage the individual is disaffected with the arbitrary nature of law and order reasoning; culpability is frequently turned from being defined by society to viewing society itself as culpable. This stage is often mistaken for the moral relativism of stage two, as the individual views those interests of society that conflict with their own as being relatively and morally wrong.[8] Kohlberg noted that this was often observed in students entering college.[8][15]
Kohlberg suggested that there may be a seventh stage—Transcendental Morality, or Morality of Cosmic Orientation—which linked religion with moral reasoning.[20] Kohlberg's difficulties in obtaining empirical evidence for even a sixth stage,[15] however, led him to emphasize the speculative nature of his seventh stage.[5]
Theoretical assumptions (philosophy)[edit]
Kohlberg's stages of moral development are based on the assumption that humans are inherently communicative, capable of reason, and possess a desire to understand others and the world around them. The stages of this model relate to the qualitative moral reasonings adopted by individuals, and so do not translate directly into praise or blame of any individual's actions or character. Arguing that his theory measures moral reasoning and not particular moral conclusions, Kohlberg insists that the form and structure of moral arguments is independent of the content of those arguments, a position he calls "formalism".[6][7]
Kohlberg's theory centers on the notion that justice is the essential characteristic of moral reasoning. Justice itself relies heavily upon the notion of sound reasoning based on principles. Despite being a justice-centered theory of morality, Kohlberg considered it to be compatible with plausible formulations of deontology[18] and eudaimonia.
Kohlberg's theory understands values as a critical component of the right. Whatever the right is, for Kohlberg, it must be universally valid across societies (a position known as "moral universalism"):[7] there can be no relativism. Moreover, morals are not natural features of the world; they are prescriptive. Nevertheless, moral judgments can be evaluated in logical terms of truth and falsity.
According to Kohlberg, someone progressing to a higher stage of moral reasoning cannot skip stages. For example, an individual cannot jump from being concerned mostly with peer judgments (stage three) to being a proponent of social contracts (stage five).[15] On encountering a moral dilemma and finding their current level of moral reasoning unsatisfactory, however, an individual will look to the next level. Realizing the limitations of the current stage of thinking is the driving force behind moral development, as each progressive stage is more adequate than the last.[15] The process is therefore considered to be constructive, as it is initiated by the conscious construction of the individual, and is not in any meaningful sense a component of the individual's innate dispositions, or a result of past inductions.
Formal elements[edit]

Progress through Kohlberg's stages happens as a result of the individual's increasing competence, both psychologically and in balancing conflicting social-value claims. The process of resolving conflicting claims to reach an equilibrium is called "justice operation". Kohlberg identifies two of these justice operations: "equality", which involves an impartial regard for persons, and "reciprocity", which means a regard for the role of personal merit. For Kohlberg, the most adequate result of both operations is "reversibility", in which a moral or dutiful act within a particular situation is evaluated in terms of whether or not the act would be satisfactory even if particular persons were to switch roles within that situation (also known colloquially as "moral musical chairs").[6]
Knowledge and learning contribute to moral development. Specifically important are the individual's "view of persons" and their "social perspective level", each of which becomes more complex and mature with each advancing stage. The "view of persons" can be understood as the individual's grasp of the psychology of other persons; it may be pictured as a spectrum, with stage one having no view of other persons at all, and stage six being entirely socio-centric.[6] Similarly, the social perspective level involves the understanding of the social universe, differing from the view of persons in that it involves an appreciation of social norms.
Examples of applied moral dilemmas[edit]
Kohlberg established the Moral Judgement Interview in his original 1958 dissertation.[4] During the roughly 45-minute tape recorded semi-structured interview, the interviewer uses moral dilemmas to determine which stage of moral reasoning a person uses. The dilemmas are fictional short stories that describe situations in which a person has to make a moral decision. The participant is asked a systemic series of open-ended questions, like what they think the right course of action is, as well as justifications as to why certain actions are right or wrong. The form and structure of these replies are scored and not the content; over a set of multiple moral dilemmas an overall score is derived.[4][9]
A dilemma that Kohlberg used in his original research was the druggist's dilemma: Heinz Steals the Drug In Europe.[5]
Criticisms[edit]
One criticism of Kohlberg's theory is that it emphasizes justice to the exclusion of other values, and so may not adequately address the arguments of those who value other moral aspects of actions. Carol Gilligan has argued that Kohlberg's theory is overly androcentric.[10] Kohlberg's theory was initially developed based on empirical research using only male participants; Gilligan argued that it did not adequately describe the concerns of women.[21] Kohlberg stated that women tend to get stuck at level 3, focusing on details of how to maintain relationships and promote the welfare of family and friends. Men are likely to move on to the abstract principles, and thus have less concern with the particulars of who is involved.[22] Consistent with this observation, Gilligan's theory of moral development does not focus on the value of justice. She developed an alternative theory of moral reasoning based on the ethics of caring.[10] Critics such as Christina Hoff Sommers, however, argued that Gilligan's research is ill-founded, and that no evidence exists to support her conclusion.[23]
Kohlberg's stages are not culturally neutral, as demonstrated by its application to a number of different cultures.[1] Although they progress through the stages in the same order, individuals in different cultures seem to do so at different rates.[24] Kohlberg has responded by saying that although different cultures do indeed inculcate different beliefs, his stages correspond to underlying modes of reasoning, rather than to those beliefs.[1][25]
Another criticism of Kohlberg’s theory is that people frequently demonstrate significant inconsistency in their moral judgements.[26] This often occurs in moral dilemmas involving drinking and driving and business situations where participants have been shown to reason at a subpar stage, typically using more self-interest driven reasoning (i.e., stage two) than authority and social order obedience driven reasoning (i.e., stage four).[26][27] Kohlberg’s theory is generally considered to be incompatible with inconsistencies in moral reasoning.[26] Carpendale has argued that Kohlberg’s theory should be modified to focus on the view that the process of moral reasoning involves integrating varying perspectives of a moral dilemma rather than simply fixating on applying rules.[27] This view would allow for inconsistency in moral reasoning since individuals may be hampered by their inability to consider different perspectives.[26] Krebs and Denton have also attempted to modify Kohlberg’s theory to account for a multitude of conflicting findings, but eventually concluded that the theory is not equipped to take into consideration how most individuals make moral decisions in their everyday lives.[28]
Other psychologists have questioned the assumption that moral action is primarily a result of formal reasoning. Social intuitionists such as Jonathan Haidt, for example, argue that individuals often make moral judgments without weighing concerns such as fairness, law, human rights, or abstract ethical values. Thus the arguments analyzed by Kohlberg and other rationalist psychologists could be considered post hoc rationalizations of intuitive decisions; moral reasoning may be less relevant to moral action than Kohlberg's theory suggests.[11]
Continued relevance[edit]
Kohlberg's body of work on the stages of moral development has been utilized by others working in the field. One example is the Defining Issues Test (DIT) created in 1979 by James Rest,[29] originally as a pencil-and-paper alternative to the Moral Judgement Interview.[30] Heavily influenced by the six-stage model, it made efforts to improve the validity criteria by using a quantitative test, the Likert scale, to rate moral dilemmas similar to Kohlberg's.[31] It also used a large body of Kohlbergian theory such as the idea of "post-conventional thinking".[32][33] In 1999 the DIT was revised as the DIT-2;[30] the test continues to be used in many areas where moral testing is required,[34] such as divinity, politics, and medicine.[35][36][37]

Lawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
  (Redirected from Kohlberg's stages of moral development)

					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Lawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development constitute an adaptation of a psychological theory originally conceived by the Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget. Kohlberg began work on this topic while a psychology graduate student at the University of Chicago[1] in 1958, and expanded upon the theory throughout his life.
The theory holds that moral reasoning, the basis for ethical behavior, has six identifiable developmental stages, each more adequate at responding to moral dilemmas than its predecessor.[2] Kohlberg followed the development of moral judgment far beyond the ages studied earlier by Piaget,[3] who also claimed that logic and morality develop through constructive stages.[2] Expanding on Piaget's work, Kohlberg determined that the process of moral development was principally concerned with justice, and that it continued throughout the individual's lifetime,[4] a notion that spawned dialogue on the philosophical implications of such research.[5][6]
The six stages of moral development are grouped into three levels: pre-conventional morality, conventional morality, and post-conventional morality.
For his studies, Kohlberg relied on stories such as the Heinz dilemma, and was interested in how individuals would justify their actions if placed in similar moral dilemmas. He then analyzed the form of moral reasoning displayed, rather than its conclusion,[6] and classified it as belonging to one of six distinct stages.[7][8][9]
There have been critiques of the theory from several perspectives. Arguments include that it emphasizes justice to the exclusion of other moral values, such as caring;[10] that there is such an overlap between stages that they should more properly be regarded as separate domains; or that evaluations of the reasons for moral choices are mostly post hoc rationalizations (by both decision makers and psychologists studying them) of essentially intuitive decisions.[11]
Nevertheless, an entirely new field within psychology was created as a direct result of Kohlberg's theory, and according to Haggbloom et al.'s study of the most eminent psychologists of the 20th century, Kohlberg was the 16th most frequently cited psychologist in introductory psychology textbooks throughout the century, as well as the 30th most eminent overall.[12]
Kohlberg's scale is about how people justify behaviors and his stages are not a method of ranking how moral someone's behavior is. There should, however, be a correlation between how someone scores on the scale and how they behave, and the general hypothesis is that moral behaviour is more responsible, consistent and predictable from people at higher levels.[13]

Stages[edit]
Kohlberg's six stages can be more generally grouped into three levels of two stages each: pre-conventional, conventional and post-conventional.[7][8][9] Following Piaget's constructivist requirements for a stage model, as described in his theory of cognitive development, it is extremely rare to regress in stages—to lose the use of higher stage abilities.[14][15] Stages cannot be skipped; each provides a new and necessary perspective, more comprehensive and differentiated than its predecessors but integrated with them.[14][15]

Level 1 (Pre-Conventional)



1. Obedience and punishment orientation



(How can I avoid punishment?)




2. Self-interest orientation



(What's in it for me?)
(Paying for a benefit)










Level 2 (Conventional)






3. Interpersonal accord and conformity



(Social norms)
(The good boy/girl attitude)




4. Authority and social-order maintaining orientation



(Law and order morality)










Level 3 (Post-Conventional)






5. Social contract orientation
6. Universal ethical principles



(Principled conscience)









The understanding gained in each stage is retained in later stages, but may be regarded by those in later stages as simplistic, lacking in sufficient attention to detail.
Pre-conventional[edit]
The pre-conventional level of moral reasoning is especially common in children, although adults can also exhibit this level of reasoning. Reasoners at this level judge the morality of an action by its direct consequences. The pre-conventional level consists of the first and second stages of moral development and is solely concerned with the self in an egocentric manner. A child with pre-conventional morality has not yet adopted or internalized society's conventions regarding what is right or wrong but instead focuses largely on external consequences that certain actions may bring.[7][8][9]
In Stage one (obedience and punishment driven), individuals focus on the direct consequences of their actions on themselves. For example, an action is perceived as morally wrong because the perpetrator is punished. "The last time I did that I got spanked, so I will not do it again." The worse the punishment for the act is, the more "bad" the act is perceived to be.[16] This can give rise to an inference that even innocent victims are guilty in proportion to their suffering. It is "egocentric", lacking recognition that others' points of view are different from one's own.[17] There is "deference to superior power or prestige".[17]
An example of obedience and punishment driven morality would be a child refusing to do something because it is wrong and that the consequences could result in punishment. For example, a child's classmate tries to dare the child to skip school. The child would apply obedience and punishment driven morality by refusing to skip school because he would get punished.
Stage two (self-interest driven) expresses the "what's in it for me" position, in which right behavior is defined by whatever the individual believes to be in their best interest but understood in a narrow way which does not consider one's reputation or relationships to groups of people. Stage two reasoning shows a limited interest in the needs of others, but only to a point where it might further the individual's own interests. As a result, concern for others is not based on loyalty or intrinsic respect, but rather a "You scratch my back, and I'll scratch yours" mentality.[2] The lack of a societal perspective in the pre-conventional level is quite different from the social contract (stage five), as all actions at this stage have the purpose of serving the individual's own needs or interests. For the stage two theorist, the world's perspective is often seen as morally relative.
An example of self-interest driven is when a child is asked by his parents to do a chore. The child asks, "what's in it for me?" The parents offer the child an incentive by giving a child an allowance to pay them for their chores. The child is motivated by self-interest to do chores.
Conventional[edit]
The conventional level of moral reasoning is typical of adolescents and adults. To reason in a conventional way is to judge the morality of actions by comparing them to society's views and expectations. The conventional level consists of the third and fourth stages of moral development. Conventional morality is characterized by an acceptance of society's conventions concerning right and wrong. At this level an individual obeys rules and follows society's norms even when there are no consequences for obedience or disobedience. Adherence to rules and conventions is somewhat rigid, however, and a rule's appropriateness or fairness is seldom questioned.[7][8][9]
In Stage three (good intentions as determined by social consensus), the self enters society by conforming to social standards. Individuals are receptive to approval or disapproval from others as it reflects society's views. They try to be a "good boy" or "good girl" to live up to these expectations,[2] having learned that being regarded as good benefits the self. Stage three reasoning may judge the morality of an action by evaluating its consequences in terms of a person's relationships, which now begin to include things like respect, gratitude, and the "golden rule". "I want to be liked and thought well of; apparently, not being naughty makes people like me." Conforming to the rules for one's social role is not yet fully understood. The intentions of actors play a more significant role in reasoning at this stage; one may feel more forgiving if one thinks that "they mean well".[2]
In Stage four (authority and social order obedience driven), it is important to obey laws, dictums, and social conventions because of their importance in maintaining a functioning society. Moral reasoning in stage four is thus beyond the need for individual approval exhibited in stage three. A central ideal or ideals often prescribe what is right and wrong. If one person violates a law, perhaps everyone would—thus there is an obligation and a duty to uphold laws and rules. When someone does violate a law, it is morally wrong; culpability is thus a significant factor in this stage as it separates the bad domains from the good ones. Most active members of society remain at stage four, where morality is still predominantly dictated by an outside force.[2]
Post-Conventional[edit]
The post-conventional level, also known as the principled level, is marked by a growing realization that individuals are separate entities from society, and that the individual’s own perspective may take precedence over society’s view; individuals may disobey rules inconsistent with their own principles. Post-conventional moralists live by their own ethical principles—principles that typically include such basic human rights as life, liberty, and justice. People who exhibit post-conventional morality view rules as useful but changeable mechanisms—ideally rules can maintain the general social order and protect human rights. Rules are not absolute dictates that must be obeyed without question. Because post-conventional individuals elevate their own moral evaluation of a situation over social conventions, their behavior, especially at stage six, can be confused with that of those at the pre-conventional level.[citation needed]
Some theorists have speculated that many people may never reach this level of abstract moral reasoning.[7][8][9]
In Stage five (social contract driven), the world is viewed as holding different opinions, rights, and values. Such perspectives should be mutually respected as unique to each person or community. Laws are regarded as social contracts rather than rigid edicts. Those that do not promote the general welfare should be changed when necessary to meet “the greatest good for the greatest number of people".[8] This is achieved through majority decision and inevitable compromise. Democratic government is ostensibly based on stage five reasoning.
In Stage six (universal ethical principles driven), moral reasoning is based on abstract reasoning using universal ethical principles. Laws are valid only insofar as they are grounded in justice, and a commitment to justice carries with it an obligation to disobey unjust laws. Legal rights are unnecessary, as social contracts are not essential for deontic moral action. Decisions are not reached hypothetically in a conditional way but rather categorically in an absolute way, as in the philosophy of Immanuel Kant.[18] This involves an individual imagining what they would do in another’s shoes, if they believed what that other person imagines to be true.[19] The resulting consensus is the action taken. In this way action is never a means but always an end in itself; the individual acts because it is right, and not because it avoids punishment, is in their best interest, expected, legal, or previously agreed upon. Although Kohlberg insisted that stage six exists, he found it difficult to identify individuals who consistently operated at that level.[15]
Further stages[edit]
In Kohlberg's empirical studies of individuals throughout their life Kohlberg observed that some had apparently undergone moral stage regression. This could be resolved either by allowing for moral regression or by extending the theory. Kohlberg chose the latter, postulating the existence of sub-stages in which the emerging stage has not yet been fully integrated into the personality.[8] In particular Kohlberg noted a stage 4½ or 4+, a transition from stage four to stage five, that shared characteristics of both.[8] In this stage the individual is disaffected with the arbitrary nature of law and order reasoning; culpability is frequently turned from being defined by society to viewing society itself as culpable. This stage is often mistaken for the moral relativism of stage two, as the individual views those interests of society that conflict with their own as being relatively and morally wrong.[8] Kohlberg noted that this was often observed in students entering college.[8][15]
Kohlberg suggested that there may be a seventh stage—Transcendental Morality, or Morality of Cosmic Orientation—which linked religion with moral reasoning.[20] Kohlberg's difficulties in obtaining empirical evidence for even a sixth stage,[15] however, led him to emphasize the speculative nature of his seventh stage.[5]
Theoretical assumptions (philosophy)[edit]
Kohlberg's stages of moral development are based on the assumption that humans are inherently communicative, capable of reason, and possess a desire to understand others and the world around them. The stages of this model relate to the qualitative moral reasonings adopted by individuals, and so do not translate directly into praise or blame of any individual's actions or character. Arguing that his theory measures moral reasoning and not particular moral conclusions, Kohlberg insists that the form and structure of moral arguments is independent of the content of those arguments, a position he calls "formalism".[6][7]
Kohlberg's theory centers on the notion that justice is the essential characteristic of moral reasoning. Justice itself relies heavily upon the notion of sound reasoning based on principles. Despite being a justice-centered theory of morality, Kohlberg considered it to be compatible with plausible formulations of deontology[18] and eudaimonia.
Kohlberg's theory understands values as a critical component of the right. Whatever the right is, for Kohlberg, it must be universally valid across societies (a position known as "moral universalism"):[7] there can be no relativism. Moreover, morals are not natural features of the world; they are prescriptive. Nevertheless, moral judgments can be evaluated in logical terms of truth and falsity.
According to Kohlberg, someone progressing to a higher stage of moral reasoning cannot skip stages. For example, an individual cannot jump from being concerned mostly with peer judgments (stage three) to being a proponent of social contracts (stage five).[15] On encountering a moral dilemma and finding their current level of moral reasoning unsatisfactory, however, an individual will look to the next level. Realizing the limitations of the current stage of thinking is the driving force behind moral development, as each progressive stage is more adequate than the last.[15] The process is therefore considered to be constructive, as it is initiated by the conscious construction of the individual, and is not in any meaningful sense a component of the individual's innate dispositions, or a result of past inductions.
Formal elements[edit]

Progress through Kohlberg's stages happens as a result of the individual's increasing competence, both psychologically and in balancing conflicting social-value claims. The process of resolving conflicting claims to reach an equilibrium is called "justice operation". Kohlberg identifies two of these justice operations: "equality", which involves an impartial regard for persons, and "reciprocity", which means a regard for the role of personal merit. For Kohlberg, the most adequate result of both operations is "reversibility", in which a moral or dutiful act within a particular situation is evaluated in terms of whether or not the act would be satisfactory even if particular persons were to switch roles within that situation (also known colloquially as "moral musical chairs").[6]
Knowledge and learning contribute to moral development. Specifically important are the individual's "view of persons" and their "social perspective level", each of which becomes more complex and mature with each advancing stage. The "view of persons" can be understood as the individual's grasp of the psychology of other persons; it may be pictured as a spectrum, with stage one having no view of other persons at all, and stage six being entirely socio-centric.[6] Similarly, the social perspective level involves the understanding of the social universe, differing from the view of persons in that it involves an appreciation of social norms.
Examples of applied moral dilemmas[edit]
Kohlberg established the Moral Judgement Interview in his original 1958 dissertation.[4] During the roughly 45-minute tape recorded semi-structured interview, the interviewer uses moral dilemmas to determine which stage of moral reasoning a person uses. The dilemmas are fictional short stories that describe situations in which a person has to make a moral decision. The participant is asked a systemic series of open-ended questions, like what they think the right course of action is, as well as justifications as to why certain actions are right or wrong. The form and structure of these replies are scored and not the content; over a set of multiple moral dilemmas an overall score is derived.[4][9]
A dilemma that Kohlberg used in his original research was the druggist's dilemma: Heinz Steals the Drug In Europe.[5]
Criticisms[edit]
One criticism of Kohlberg's theory is that it emphasizes justice to the exclusion of other values, and so may not adequately address the arguments of those who value other moral aspects of actions. Carol Gilligan has argued that Kohlberg's theory is overly androcentric.[10] Kohlberg's theory was initially developed based on empirical research using only male participants; Gilligan argued that it did not adequately describe the concerns of women.[21] Kohlberg stated that women tend to get stuck at level 3, focusing on details of how to maintain relationships and promote the welfare of family and friends. Men are likely to move on to the abstract principles, and thus have less concern with the particulars of who is involved.[22] Consistent with this observation, Gilligan's theory of moral development does not focus on the value of justice. She developed an alternative theory of moral reasoning based on the ethics of caring.[10] Critics such as Christina Hoff Sommers, however, argued that Gilligan's research is ill-founded, and that no evidence exists to support her conclusion.[23]
Kohlberg's stages are not culturally neutral, as demonstrated by its application to a number of different cultures.[1] Although they progress through the stages in the same order, individuals in different cultures seem to do so at different rates.[24] Kohlberg has responded by saying that although different cultures do indeed inculcate different beliefs, his stages correspond to underlying modes of reasoning, rather than to those beliefs.[1][25]
Another criticism of Kohlberg’s theory is that people frequently demonstrate significant inconsistency in their moral judgements.[26] This often occurs in moral dilemmas involving drinking and driving and business situations where participants have been shown to reason at a subpar stage, typically using more self-interest driven reasoning (i.e., stage two) than authority and social order obedience driven reasoning (i.e., stage four).[26][27] Kohlberg’s theory is generally considered to be incompatible with inconsistencies in moral reasoning.[26] Carpendale has argued that Kohlberg’s theory should be modified to focus on the view that the process of moral reasoning involves integrating varying perspectives of a moral dilemma rather than simply fixating on applying rules.[27] This view would allow for inconsistency in moral reasoning since individuals may be hampered by their inability to consider different perspectives.[26] Krebs and Denton have also attempted to modify Kohlberg’s theory to account for a multitude of conflicting findings, but eventually concluded that the theory is not equipped to take into consideration how most individuals make moral decisions in their everyday lives.[28]
Other psychologists have questioned the assumption that moral action is primarily a result of formal reasoning. Social intuitionists such as Jonathan Haidt, for example, argue that individuals often make moral judgments without weighing concerns such as fairness, law, human rights, or abstract ethical values. Thus the arguments analyzed by Kohlberg and other rationalist psychologists could be considered post hoc rationalizations of intuitive decisions; moral reasoning may be less relevant to moral action than Kohlberg's theory suggests.[11]
Continued relevance[edit]
Kohlberg's body of work on the stages of moral development has been utilized by others working in the field. One example is the Defining Issues Test (DIT) created in 1979 by James Rest,[29] originally as a pencil-and-paper alternative to the Moral Judgement Interview.[30] Heavily influenced by the six-stage model, it made efforts to improve the validity criteria by using a quantitative test, the Likert scale, to rate moral dilemmas similar to Kohlberg's.[31] It also used a large body of Kohlbergian theory such as the idea of "post-conventional thinking".[32][33] In 1999 the DIT was revised as the DIT-2;[30] the test continues to be used in many areas where moral testing is required,[34] such as divinity, politics, and medicine.[35][36][37]

Lawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
  (Redirected from Kohlberg's stages of moral development)

					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Lawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development constitute an adaptation of a psychological theory originally conceived by the Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget. Kohlberg began work on this topic while a psychology graduate student at the University of Chicago[1] in 1958, and expanded upon the theory throughout his life.
The theory holds that moral reasoning, the basis for ethical behavior, has six identifiable developmental stages, each more adequate at responding to moral dilemmas than its predecessor.[2] Kohlberg followed the development of moral judgment far beyond the ages studied earlier by Piaget,[3] who also claimed that logic and morality develop through constructive stages.[2] Expanding on Piaget's work, Kohlberg determined that the process of moral development was principally concerned with justice, and that it continued throughout the individual's lifetime,[4] a notion that spawned dialogue on the philosophical implications of such research.[5][6]
The six stages of moral development are grouped into three levels: pre-conventional morality, conventional morality, and post-conventional morality.
For his studies, Kohlberg relied on stories such as the Heinz dilemma, and was interested in how individuals would justify their actions if placed in similar moral dilemmas. He then analyzed the form of moral reasoning displayed, rather than its conclusion,[6] and classified it as belonging to one of six distinct stages.[7][8][9]
There have been critiques of the theory from several perspectives. Arguments include that it emphasizes justice to the exclusion of other moral values, such as caring;[10] that there is such an overlap between stages that they should more properly be regarded as separate domains; or that evaluations of the reasons for moral choices are mostly post hoc rationalizations (by both decision makers and psychologists studying them) of essentially intuitive decisions.[11]
Nevertheless, an entirely new field within psychology was created as a direct result of Kohlberg's theory, and according to Haggbloom et al.'s study of the most eminent psychologists of the 20th century, Kohlberg was the 16th most frequently cited psychologist in introductory psychology textbooks throughout the century, as well as the 30th most eminent overall.[12]
Kohlberg's scale is about how people justify behaviors and his stages are not a method of ranking how moral someone's behavior is. There should, however, be a correlation between how someone scores on the scale and how they behave, and the general hypothesis is that moral behaviour is more responsible, consistent and predictable from people at higher levels.[13]

Stages[edit]
Kohlberg's six stages can be more generally grouped into three levels of two stages each: pre-conventional, conventional and post-conventional.[7][8][9] Following Piaget's constructivist requirements for a stage model, as described in his theory of cognitive development, it is extremely rare to regress in stages—to lose the use of higher stage abilities.[14][15] Stages cannot be skipped; each provides a new and necessary perspective, more comprehensive and differentiated than its predecessors but integrated with them.[14][15]

Level 1 (Pre-Conventional)



1. Obedience and punishment orientation



(How can I avoid punishment?)




2. Self-interest orientation



(What's in it for me?)
(Paying for a benefit)










Level 2 (Conventional)






3. Interpersonal accord and conformity



(Social norms)
(The good boy/girl attitude)




4. Authority and social-order maintaining orientation



(Law and order morality)










Level 3 (Post-Conventional)






5. Social contract orientation
6. Universal ethical principles



(Principled conscience)









The understanding gained in each stage is retained in later stages, but may be regarded by those in later stages as simplistic, lacking in sufficient attention to detail.
Pre-conventional[edit]
The pre-conventional level of moral reasoning is especially common in children, although adults can also exhibit this level of reasoning. Reasoners at this level judge the morality of an action by its direct consequences. The pre-conventional level consists of the first and second stages of moral development and is solely concerned with the self in an egocentric manner. A child with pre-conventional morality has not yet adopted or internalized society's conventions regarding what is right or wrong but instead focuses largely on external consequences that certain actions may bring.[7][8][9]
In Stage one (obedience and punishment driven), individuals focus on the direct consequences of their actions on themselves. For example, an action is perceived as morally wrong because the perpetrator is punished. "The last time I did that I got spanked, so I will not do it again." The worse the punishment for the act is, the more "bad" the act is perceived to be.[16] This can give rise to an inference that even innocent victims are guilty in proportion to their suffering. It is "egocentric", lacking recognition that others' points of view are different from one's own.[17] There is "deference to superior power or prestige".[17]
An example of obedience and punishment driven morality would be a child refusing to do something because it is wrong and that the consequences could result in punishment. For example, a child's classmate tries to dare the child to skip school. The child would apply obedience and punishment driven morality by refusing to skip school because he would get punished.
Stage two (self-interest driven) expresses the "what's in it for me" position, in which right behavior is defined by whatever the individual believes to be in their best interest but understood in a narrow way which does not consider one's reputation or relationships to groups of people. Stage two reasoning shows a limited interest in the needs of others, but only to a point where it might further the individual's own interests. As a result, concern for others is not based on loyalty or intrinsic respect, but rather a "You scratch my back, and I'll scratch yours" mentality.[2] The lack of a societal perspective in the pre-conventional level is quite different from the social contract (stage five), as all actions at this stage have the purpose of serving the individual's own needs or interests. For the stage two theorist, the world's perspective is often seen as morally relative.
An example of self-interest driven is when a child is asked by his parents to do a chore. The child asks, "what's in it for me?" The parents offer the child an incentive by giving a child an allowance to pay them for their chores. The child is motivated by self-interest to do chores.
Conventional[edit]
The conventional level of moral reasoning is typical of adolescents and adults. To reason in a conventional way is to judge the morality of actions by comparing them to society's views and expectations. The conventional level consists of the third and fourth stages of moral development. Conventional morality is characterized by an acceptance of society's conventions concerning right and wrong. At this level an individual obeys rules and follows society's norms even when there are no consequences for obedience or disobedience. Adherence to rules and conventions is somewhat rigid, however, and a rule's appropriateness or fairness is seldom questioned.[7][8][9]
In Stage three (good intentions as determined by social consensus), the self enters society by conforming to social standards. Individuals are receptive to approval or disapproval from others as it reflects society's views. They try to be a "good boy" or "good girl" to live up to these expectations,[2] having learned that being regarded as good benefits the self. Stage three reasoning may judge the morality of an action by evaluating its consequences in terms of a person's relationships, which now begin to include things like respect, gratitude, and the "golden rule". "I want to be liked and thought well of; apparently, not being naughty makes people like me." Conforming to the rules for one's social role is not yet fully understood. The intentions of actors play a more significant role in reasoning at this stage; one may feel more forgiving if one thinks that "they mean well".[2]
In Stage four (authority and social order obedience driven), it is important to obey laws, dictums, and social conventions because of their importance in maintaining a functioning society. Moral reasoning in stage four is thus beyond the need for individual approval exhibited in stage three. A central ideal or ideals often prescribe what is right and wrong. If one person violates a law, perhaps everyone would—thus there is an obligation and a duty to uphold laws and rules. When someone does violate a law, it is morally wrong; culpability is thus a significant factor in this stage as it separates the bad domains from the good ones. Most active members of society remain at stage four, where morality is still predominantly dictated by an outside force.[2]
Post-Conventional[edit]
The post-conventional level, also known as the principled level, is marked by a growing realization that individuals are separate entities from society, and that the individual’s own perspective may take precedence over society’s view; individuals may disobey rules inconsistent with their own principles. Post-conventional moralists live by their own ethical principles—principles that typically include such basic human rights as life, liberty, and justice. People who exhibit post-conventional morality view rules as useful but changeable mechanisms—ideally rules can maintain the general social order and protect human rights. Rules are not absolute dictates that must be obeyed without question. Because post-conventional individuals elevate their own moral evaluation of a situation over social conventions, their behavior, especially at stage six, can be confused with that of those at the pre-conventional level.[citation needed]
Some theorists have speculated that many people may never reach this level of abstract moral reasoning.[7][8][9]
In Stage five (social contract driven), the world is viewed as holding different opinions, rights, and values. Such perspectives should be mutually respected as unique to each person or community. Laws are regarded as social contracts rather than rigid edicts. Those that do not promote the general welfare should be changed when necessary to meet “the greatest good for the greatest number of people".[8] This is achieved through majority decision and inevitable compromise. Democratic government is ostensibly based on stage five reasoning.
In Stage six (universal ethical principles driven), moral reasoning is based on abstract reasoning using universal ethical principles. Laws are valid only insofar as they are grounded in justice, and a commitment to justice carries with it an obligation to disobey unjust laws. Legal rights are unnecessary, as social contracts are not essential for deontic moral action. Decisions are not reached hypothetically in a conditional way but rather categorically in an absolute way, as in the philosophy of Immanuel Kant.[18] This involves an individual imagining what they would do in another’s shoes, if they believed what that other person imagines to be true.[19] The resulting consensus is the action taken. In this way action is never a means but always an end in itself; the individual acts because it is right, and not because it avoids punishment, is in their best interest, expected, legal, or previously agreed upon. Although Kohlberg insisted that stage six exists, he found it difficult to identify individuals who consistently operated at that level.[15]
Further stages[edit]
In Kohlberg's empirical studies of individuals throughout their life Kohlberg observed that some had apparently undergone moral stage regression. This could be resolved either by allowing for moral regression or by extending the theory. Kohlberg chose the latter, postulating the existence of sub-stages in which the emerging stage has not yet been fully integrated into the personality.[8] In particular Kohlberg noted a stage 4½ or 4+, a transition from stage four to stage five, that shared characteristics of both.[8] In this stage the individual is disaffected with the arbitrary nature of law and order reasoning; culpability is frequently turned from being defined by society to viewing society itself as culpable. This stage is often mistaken for the moral relativism of stage two, as the individual views those interests of society that conflict with their own as being relatively and morally wrong.[8] Kohlberg noted that this was often observed in students entering college.[8][15]
Kohlberg suggested that there may be a seventh stage—Transcendental Morality, or Morality of Cosmic Orientation—which linked religion with moral reasoning.[20] Kohlberg's difficulties in obtaining empirical evidence for even a sixth stage,[15] however, led him to emphasize the speculative nature of his seventh stage.[5]
Theoretical assumptions (philosophy)[edit]
Kohlberg's stages of moral development are based on the assumption that humans are inherently communicative, capable of reason, and possess a desire to understand others and the world around them. The stages of this model relate to the qualitative moral reasonings adopted by individuals, and so do not translate directly into praise or blame of any individual's actions or character. Arguing that his theory measures moral reasoning and not particular moral conclusions, Kohlberg insists that the form and structure of moral arguments is independent of the content of those arguments, a position he calls "formalism".[6][7]
Kohlberg's theory centers on the notion that justice is the essential characteristic of moral reasoning. Justice itself relies heavily upon the notion of sound reasoning based on principles. Despite being a justice-centered theory of morality, Kohlberg considered it to be compatible with plausible formulations of deontology[18] and eudaimonia.
Kohlberg's theory understands values as a critical component of the right. Whatever the right is, for Kohlberg, it must be universally valid across societies (a position known as "moral universalism"):[7] there can be no relativism. Moreover, morals are not natural features of the world; they are prescriptive. Nevertheless, moral judgments can be evaluated in logical terms of truth and falsity.
According to Kohlberg, someone progressing to a higher stage of moral reasoning cannot skip stages. For example, an individual cannot jump from being concerned mostly with peer judgments (stage three) to being a proponent of social contracts (stage five).[15] On encountering a moral dilemma and finding their current level of moral reasoning unsatisfactory, however, an individual will look to the next level. Realizing the limitations of the current stage of thinking is the driving force behind moral development, as each progressive stage is more adequate than the last.[15] The process is therefore considered to be constructive, as it is initiated by the conscious construction of the individual, and is not in any meaningful sense a component of the individual's innate dispositions, or a result of past inductions.
Formal elements[edit]

Progress through Kohlberg's stages happens as a result of the individual's increasing competence, both psychologically and in balancing conflicting social-value claims. The process of resolving conflicting claims to reach an equilibrium is called "justice operation". Kohlberg identifies two of these justice operations: "equality", which involves an impartial regard for persons, and "reciprocity", which means a regard for the role of personal merit. For Kohlberg, the most adequate result of both operations is "reversibility", in which a moral or dutiful act within a particular situation is evaluated in terms of whether or not the act would be satisfactory even if particular persons were to switch roles within that situation (also known colloquially as "moral musical chairs").[6]
Knowledge and learning contribute to moral development. Specifically important are the individual's "view of persons" and their "social perspective level", each of which becomes more complex and mature with each advancing stage. The "view of persons" can be understood as the individual's grasp of the psychology of other persons; it may be pictured as a spectrum, with stage one having no view of other persons at all, and stage six being entirely socio-centric.[6] Similarly, the social perspective level involves the understanding of the social universe, differing from the view of persons in that it involves an appreciation of social norms.
Examples of applied moral dilemmas[edit]
Kohlberg established the Moral Judgement Interview in his original 1958 dissertation.[4] During the roughly 45-minute tape recorded semi-structured interview, the interviewer uses moral dilemmas to determine which stage of moral reasoning a person uses. The dilemmas are fictional short stories that describe situations in which a person has to make a moral decision. The participant is asked a systemic series of open-ended questions, like what they think the right course of action is, as well as justifications as to why certain actions are right or wrong. The form and structure of these replies are scored and not the content; over a set of multiple moral dilemmas an overall score is derived.[4][9]
A dilemma that Kohlberg used in his original research was the druggist's dilemma: Heinz Steals the Drug In Europe.[5]
Criticisms[edit]
One criticism of Kohlberg's theory is that it emphasizes justice to the exclusion of other values, and so may not adequately address the arguments of those who value other moral aspects of actions. Carol Gilligan has argued that Kohlberg's theory is overly androcentric.[10] Kohlberg's theory was initially developed based on empirical research using only male participants; Gilligan argued that it did not adequately describe the concerns of women.[21] Kohlberg stated that women tend to get stuck at level 3, focusing on details of how to maintain relationships and promote the welfare of family and friends. Men are likely to move on to the abstract principles, and thus have less concern with the particulars of who is involved.[22] Consistent with this observation, Gilligan's theory of moral development does not focus on the value of justice. She developed an alternative theory of moral reasoning based on the ethics of caring.[10] Critics such as Christina Hoff Sommers, however, argued that Gilligan's research is ill-founded, and that no evidence exists to support her conclusion.[23]
Kohlberg's stages are not culturally neutral, as demonstrated by its application to a number of different cultures.[1] Although they progress through the stages in the same order, individuals in different cultures seem to do so at different rates.[24] Kohlberg has responded by saying that although different cultures do indeed inculcate different beliefs, his stages correspond to underlying modes of reasoning, rather than to those beliefs.[1][25]
Another criticism of Kohlberg’s theory is that people frequently demonstrate significant inconsistency in their moral judgements.[26] This often occurs in moral dilemmas involving drinking and driving and business situations where participants have been shown to reason at a subpar stage, typically using more self-interest driven reasoning (i.e., stage two) than authority and social order obedience driven reasoning (i.e., stage four).[26][27] Kohlberg’s theory is generally considered to be incompatible with inconsistencies in moral reasoning.[26] Carpendale has argued that Kohlberg’s theory should be modified to focus on the view that the process of moral reasoning involves integrating varying perspectives of a moral dilemma rather than simply fixating on applying rules.[27] This view would allow for inconsistency in moral reasoning since individuals may be hampered by their inability to consider different perspectives.[26] Krebs and Denton have also attempted to modify Kohlberg’s theory to account for a multitude of conflicting findings, but eventually concluded that the theory is not equipped to take into consideration how most individuals make moral decisions in their everyday lives.[28]
Other psychologists have questioned the assumption that moral action is primarily a result of formal reasoning. Social intuitionists such as Jonathan Haidt, for example, argue that individuals often make moral judgments without weighing concerns such as fairness, law, human rights, or abstract ethical values. Thus the arguments analyzed by Kohlberg and other rationalist psychologists could be considered post hoc rationalizations of intuitive decisions; moral reasoning may be less relevant to moral action than Kohlberg's theory suggests.[11]
Continued relevance[edit]
Kohlberg's body of work on the stages of moral development has been utilized by others working in the field. One example is the Defining Issues Test (DIT) created in 1979 by James Rest,[29] originally as a pencil-and-paper alternative to the Moral Judgement Interview.[30] Heavily influenced by the six-stage model, it made efforts to improve the validity criteria by using a quantitative test, the Likert scale, to rate moral dilemmas similar to Kohlberg's.[31] It also used a large body of Kohlbergian theory such as the idea of "post-conventional thinking".[32][33] In 1999 the DIT was revised as the DIT-2;[30] the test continues to be used in many areas where moral testing is required,[34] such as divinity, politics, and medicine.[35][36][37]

Key Points

Lawrence Kohlberg expanded on the earlier work of cognitive theorist Jean Piaget to explain the moral development of children, which he believed follows a series of stages.
Kohlberg defined three levels of moral development: preconventional, conventional, and postconventional. Each level has two distinct stages.
During the preconventional level, a child's sense of morality is externally controlled. Children accept and believe the rules of authority figures, such as parents and teachers, and they judge an action based on its consequences.
During the conventional level, an individual's sense of morality is tied to personal and societal relationships. Children continue to accept the rules of authority figures, but this is now because they believe that this is necessary to ensure positive relationships and societal order.
During the postconventional level, a person's sense of morality is defined in terms of more abstract principles and values. People now believe that some laws are unjust and should be changed or eliminated.
Kohlberg's theory has been criticized for its cultural and gendered bias toward white, upper-class men and boys. It also fails to account for inconsistencies within moral judgments.

Lawrence Kohlberg expanded on the earlier work of cognitive theorist Jean Piaget to explain the moral development of children. Kohlberg believed that moral development, like cognitive development, follows a series of stages. He used the idea of moral dilemmas—stories that present conflicting ideas about two moral values—to teach 10 to 16 year-old boys about morality and values. The best known moral dilemma created by Kohlberg is the "Heinz" dilemma, which discusses the idea of obeying the law versus saving a life. Kohlberg emphasized that it is the way an individual reasons about a dilemma that determines positive moral development.After presenting people with various moral dilemmas, Kohlberg reviewed people’s responses and placed them in different stages of moral reasoning. According to Kohlberg, an individual progresses from the capacity for pre-conventional morality (before age 9) to the capacity for conventional morality (early adolescence), and toward attaining post-conventional morality (once Piaget's idea of formal operational thought is attained), which only a few fully achieve. Each level of morality contains two stages, which provide the basis for moral development in various contexts.



Kohlberg's stages of moral development
Kohlberg identified three levels of moral reasoning: pre-conventional, conventional, and post-conventional. Each level is associated with increasingly complex stages of moral development.


Level 1: PreconventionalThroughout the preconventional level, a child's sense of morality is externally controlled. Children accept and believe the rules of authority figures, such as parents and teachers.  A child with pre-conventional morality has not yet adopted or internalized society's conventions regarding what is right or wrong, but instead focuses largely on external consequences that certain actions may bring.Stage 1: Obedience-and-Punishment OrientationStage 1 focuses on the child's desire to obey rules and avoid being punished. For example, an action is perceived as morally wrong because the perpetrator is punished; the worse the punishment for the act is, the more "bad" the act is perceived to be.Stage 2: Instrumental OrientationStage 2 expresses the "what's in it for me?" position, in which right behavior is defined by whatever the individual believes to be in their best interest. Stage two reasoning shows a limited interest in the needs of others,  only to the point where it might further the individual's own interests. As a result, concern for others is not based on loyalty or intrinsic respect, but rather a "you scratch my back, and I'll scratch yours" mentality. An example would be when a child is asked by his parents to do a chore. The child asks "what's in it for me?" and the parents offer the child an incentive by giving him an allowance. Level 2: ConventionalThroughout the conventional level, a child's sense of morality is tied to personal and societal relationships. Children continue to accept the rules of authority figures, but this is now due to their belief that this is necessary to ensure positive relationships and societal order. Adherence to rules and conventions is somewhat rigid during these stages, and a rule's appropriateness or fairness is seldom questioned.Stage 3: Good Boy, Nice Girl OrientationIn stage 3, children want the approval of others and act in ways to avoid disapproval. Emphasis is placed on good behavior and people being "nice" to others. Stage 4: Law-and-Order OrientationIn stage 4, the child blindly accepts rules and convention because of their importance in maintaining a functioning society. Rules are seen as being the same for everyone, and obeying rules by doing what one is "supposed" to do is seen as valuable and important. Moral reasoning in stage four is beyond the need for individual approval exhibited in stage three. If one person violates a law, perhaps everyone would—thus there is an obligation and a duty to uphold laws and rules. Most active members of society remain at stage four, where morality is still predominantly dictated by an outside force.Level 3: PostconventionalThroughout the postconventional level, a person's sense of morality is defined in terms of more abstract principles and values. People now believe that some laws are unjust and should be changed or eliminated. This level is marked by a growing realization that individuals are separate entities from society and that individuals may disobey rules inconsistent with their own principles. Post-conventional moralists live by their own ethical principles—principles that typically include such basic human rights as life, liberty, and justice—and view rules as useful but changeable mechanisms, rather than absolute dictates that must be obeyed without question. Because post-conventional individuals elevate their own moral evaluation of a situation over social conventions, their behavior, especially at stage six, can sometimes be confused with that of those at the pre-conventional level. Some theorists have speculated that many people may never reach this level of abstract moral reasoning.Stage 5: Social-Contract OrientationIn stage 5, the world is viewed as holding different opinions, rights, and values. Such perspectives should be mutually respected as unique to each person or community. Laws are regarded as social contracts rather than rigid edicts. Those that do not promote the general welfare should be changed when necessary to meet the greatest good for the greatest number of people. This is achieved through majority decision and inevitable compromise. Democratic government is theoretically based on stage five reasoning. Stage 6: Universal-Ethical-Principal OrientationIn stage 6, moral reasoning is based on abstract reasoning using universal ethical principles. Generally, the chosen principles are abstract rather than concrete and focus on ideas such as equality, dignity, or respect. Laws are valid only insofar as they are grounded in justice, and a commitment to justice carries with it an obligation to disobey unjust laws. People choose the ethical principles they want to follow, and if they violate those principles, they feel guilty.   In this way, the individual acts because it is morally right to do so (and not because he or she wants to avoid punishment), it is in their best interest, it is expected, it is legal, or it is previously agreed upon. Although Kohlberg insisted that stage six exists, he found it difficult to identify individuals who consistently operated at that level.Critiques of Kohlberg's TheoryKohlberg has been criticized for his assertion that women seem to be deficient in their moral reasoning abilities when compared to men. Carol Gilligan (1982), a research assistant of Kohlberg, criticized her former mentor’s theory because it was based so narrowly on research using white, upper-class men and boys. She argued that women are not deficient in their moral reasoning and instead proposed that males and females reason differently: girls and women focus more on staying connected and maintaining interpersonal relationships. Kohlberg's theory has been criticized for emphasizing justice to the exclusion of other values, with the result that it may not adequately address the arguments of those who value other moral aspects of actions. Similarly, critics argue that Kohlberg's stages are culturally biased—that the highest stages in particular reflect a westernized ideal of justice based on individualistic thought. This is biased against those that live in non-Western societies that place less emphasis on  individualism.Another criticism of Kohlberg’s theory is that people frequently demonstrate significant inconsistency in their moral judgements. This often occurs in moral dilemmas involving drinking and driving or business situations where participants have been shown to reason at a lower developmental stage, typically using more self-interest driven reasoning (i.e., stage two) than authority and social order obedience driven reasoning (i.e., stage four). Critics argue that Kohlberg's theory cannot account for such inconsistencies.

CHAPTER SEVEN
KOHLBERG'S STAGES OF MORAL DEVELOPMENT
 
BIOGRAPHICAL INTRODUCTION
An outstanding example of research in
        the Piagetian tradition is the work of Lawrence Kohlberg. Kohlberg has
        focused on moral development and has proposed a stage theory of moral
        thinking which goes well beyond Piaget's initial formulations.
Kohlberg, who was born in 1927, grew up
        in Bronxville, New York, and attended the Andover Academy in
        Massachusetts, a private high school for bright and usually wealthy
        students. He did not go immediately to college, but instead went to help
        the Israeli cause, in which he was made the Second Engineer on an old
        freighter carrying refugees from parts of Europe to Israel. After this,
        in 1948, he enrolled at the University of Chicago, where he scored so
        high on admission tests that he had to take only a few courses to earn
        his bachelor's degree. This he did in one year. He stayed on at Chicago
        for graduate work in psychology, at first thinking he would become a
        clinical psychologist. However, he soon became interested in Piaget and
        began interviewing children and adolescents on moral issues. The result
        was his doctoral dissertation (1958a), the first rendition of his new
        stage theory.
Kohlberg is an informal, unassuming man
        who also is a true scholar; he has thought long and deeply about a wide
        range of issues in both psychology and philosophy and has done much to
        help others appreciate the wisdom of many of the "old
        psychologists," such as Rousseau, John Dewey, and James Mark
        Baldwin. Kohlberg has taught at the University of Chicago (1962-1968)
        and, since 1968, has been at Harvard University.
PIAGET'S STAGES OF MORAL JUDGMENT
Piaget studied many aspects of moral
        judgment, but most of his findings fit into a two-stage theory. Children
        younger than 10 or 11 years think about moral dilemmas one way; older
        children consider them differently. As we have seen, younger children
        regard rules as fixed and absolute. They believe that rules are handed
        down by adults or by God and that one cannot change them. The older
        child's view is more relativistic. He or she understands that it is
        permissible to change rules if everyone agrees. Rules are not sacred and
        absolute but are devices which humans use to get along cooperatively.
At approximately the same time--10 or 11
        years--children's moral thinking undergoes other shifts. In particular,
        younger children base their moral judgments more on consequences,
        whereas older children base their judgments on intentions. When, for
        example, the young child hears about one boy who broke 15 cups trying to
        help his mother and another boy who broke only one cup trying to steal
        cookies, the young child thinks that the first boy did worse. The child
        primarily considers the amount of damage--the consequences--whereas the
        older child is more likely to judge wrongness in terms of the motives
        underlying the act (Piaget, 1932, p. 137).
There are many more details to Piaget's
        work on moral judgment, but he essentially found a series of changes
        that occur between the ages of 10 and 12, just when the child begins to
        enter the general stage of formal operations.
Intellectual development, however, does
        not stop at this point. This is just the beginning of formal operations,
        which continue to develop at least until age 16. Accordingly, one might
        expect thinking about moral issues to continue to develop throughout
        adolescence. Kohlberg therefore interviewed both children and
        adolescents about moral dilemmas, and he did find stages that go well
        beyond Piaget's. He uncovered six stages, only the first three of which
        share many features with Piaget's stages.
KOHLBERG'S METHOD
Kohlberg's (1958a) core sample was
        comprised of 72 boys, from both middle- and lower-class families in
        Chicago. They were ages 10, 13, and 16. He later added to his sample
        younger children, delinquents, and boys and girls from other American
        cities and from other countries (1963, 1970).
The basic interview consists of a series
        of dilemmas such as the following:

Heinz Steals the Drug


In Europe, a woman was near death from
          a special kind of cancer. There was one drug that the doctors thought
          might save her. It was a form of radium that a druggist in the same
          town had recently discovered. The drug was expensive to make, but the
          druggist was charging ten times what the drug cost him to make. He
          paid $200 for the radium and charged $2,000 for a small dose of the
          drug. The sick woman's husband, Heinz, went to everyone he knew to
          borrow the money, but he could only get together about $ 1,000 which
          is half of what it cost. He told the druggist that his wife was dying
          and asked him to sell it cheaper or let him pay later. But the
          druggist said: "No, I discovered the drug and I'm going to make
          money from it." So Heinz got desperate and broke into the man's
          store to steal the drug-for his wife. Should the husband have done
          that? (Kohlberg, 1963, p. 19)

Kohlberg is not really interested in
        whether the subject says "yes" or "no" to this
        dilemma but in the reasoning behind the answer. The interviewer wants to
        know why the subject thinks Heinz should or should not have stolen the
        drug. The interview schedule then asks new questions which help one
        understand the child's reasoning. For example, children are asked if
        Heinz had a right to steal the drug, if he was violating the druggist's
        rights, and what sentence the judge should give him once he was caught.
        Once again, the main concern is with the reasoning behind the answers.
        The interview then goes on to give more dilemmas in order to get a good
        sampling of a subject's moral thinking.
Once Kohlberg had classified the various
        responses into stages, he wanted to know whether his classification was reliable.
        In particular, he. wanted to know if others would score the
        protocols in the same way. Other judges independently scored a sample of
        responses, and he calculated the degree to which all raters agreed. This
        procedure is called interrater reliability. Kohlberg found these
        agreements to be high, as he has in his subsequent work, but whenever
        investigators use Kohlberg's interview, they also should check for
        interrater reliability before scoring the entire sample.
KOHLBERG'S SIX STAGES
Level 1. Preconventional Morality
Stage 1. Obedience and Punishment
        Orientation. Kohlberg's stage 1 is similar to Piaget's first stage
        of moral thought. The child assumes that powerful authorities hand down
        a fixed set of rules which he or she must unquestioningly obey. To the
        Heinz dilemma, the child typically says that Heinz was wrong to steal
        the drug because "It's against the law," or "It's bad to
        steal," as if this were all there were to it. When asked to
        elaborate, the child usually responds in terms of the consequences
        involved, explaining that stealing is bad "because you'll get
        punished" (Kohlberg, 1958b).
Although the vast majority of children
        at stage 1 oppose Heinzs theft, it is still possible for a child to
        support the action and still employ stage 1 reasoning. For example, a
        child might say, "Heinz can steal it because he asked first and
        it's not like he stole something big; he won't get punished" (see
        Rest, 1973). Even though the child agrees with Heinzs action, the
        reasoning is still stage 1; the concern is with what authorities permit
        and punish.
Kohlberg calls stage 1 thinking "preconventional"
        because children do not yet speak as members of society. Instead, they
        see morality as something external to themselves, as that which the big
        people say they must do.
Stage 2. Individualism and
        Exchange. At this stage children recognize that there is not just
        one right view that is handed down by the authorities. Different
        individuals have different viewpoints. "Heinz," they might
        point out, "might think it's right to take the drug, the druggist
        would not." Since everything is relative, each person is
        free to pursue his or her individual interests. One boy said that
        Heinz might steal the drug if he wanted his wife to live, but that he
        doesn't have to if he wants to marry someone younger and better-looking
        (Kohlberg, 1963, p. 24). Another boy said Heinz might steal it because

maybe they had children and he might
          need someone at home to look after them. But maybe he shouldn't steal
          it because they might put him in prison for more years than he could
          stand. (Colby and Kauffman. 1983, p. 300)

What is right for Heinz, then, is what
        meets his own self-interests.
You might have noticed that children at
        both stages 1 and 2 talk about punishment. However, they perceive it
        differently. At stage 1 punishment is tied up in the child's mind with
        wrongness; punishment "proves" that disobedience is wrong. At
        stage 2, in contrast, punishment is simply a risk that one naturally
        wants to avoid.
Although stage 2 respondents sometimes
        sound amoral, they do have some sense of right action. This is a notion
        of fair exchange or fair deals. The philosophy is one of
        returning favors--"If you scratch my back, I'll scratch
        yours." To the Heinz story, subjects often say that Heinz was right
        to steal the drug because the druggist was unwilling to make a fair
        deal; he was "trying to rip Heinz off," Or they might say that
        he should steal for his wife "because she might return the favor
        some day" (Gibbs et al., 1983, p. 19).
Respondents at stage 2 are still said to
        reason at the preconventional level because they speak as isolated
        individuals rather than as members of society. They see individuals
        exchanging favors, but there is still no identification with the values
        of the family or community.
Level II. Conventional Morality
Stage 3. Good Interpersonal
        Relationships. At this stage children--who are by now usually
        entering their teens--see morality as more than simple deals. They
        believe that people should live up to the expectations of the family and
        community and behave in "good" ways. Good behavior means
        having good motives and interpersonal feelings such as love, empathy,
        trust, and concern for others. Heinz, they typically argue, was right to
        steal the drug because "He was a good man for wanting to save
        her," and "His intentions were good, that of saving the life
        of someone he loves." Even if Heinz doesn't love his wife, these
        subjects often say, he should steal the drug because "I don't think
        any husband should sit back and watch his wife die" (Gibbs et al.,
        1983, pp. 36-42; Kohlberg, 1958b).
If Heinzs motives were good, the
        druggist's were bad. The druggist, stage 3 subjects emphasize, was
        "selfish," "greedy," and "only interested in
        himself, not another life." Sometimes the respondents become so
        angry with the druggist that they say that he ought to be put in jail
        (Gibbs et al., 1983, pp. 26-29, 40-42). A typical stage 3 response is
        that of Don, age 13:

It was really the druggist's fault, he
          was unfair, trying to overcharge and letting someone die. Heinz loved
          his wife and wanted to save her. I think anyone would. I don't think
          they would put him in jail. The judge would look at all sides, and see
          that the druggist was charging too much. (Kohlberg, 1963, p. 25)

We see that Don defines the issue in
        terms of the actors' character traits and motives. He talks about the
        loving husband, the unfair druggist, and the understanding judge. His
        answer deserves the label "conventional "morality"
        because it assumes that the attitude expressed would be shared by the
        entire community"anyone" would be right to do what Heinz
        did (Kohlberg, 1963, p. 25).
As mentioned earlier, there are
        similarities between Kohlberg's first three stages and Piaget's two
        stages. In both sequences there is a shift from unquestioning obedience
        to a relativistic outlook and to a concern for good motives. For
        Kohlberg, however, these shifts occur in three stages rather than two.
Stage 4. Maintaining the Social
        Order. Stage 3 reasoning works best in two-person relationships with
        family members or close friends, where one can make a real effort to get
        to know the other's feelings and needs and try to help. At stage 4, in
        contrast, the respondent becomes more broadly concerned with society
as a whole. Now the emphasis is on obeying laws, respecting
        authority, and performing one's duties so that the social order is
        maintained. In response to the Heinz story, many subjects say they
        understand that Heinz's motives were good, but they cannot condone the
        theft. What would happen if we all started breaking the laws whenever we
        felt we had a good reason? The result would be chaos; society couldn't
        function. As one subject explained,

I don't want to sound like Spiro
          Agnew, law and order and wave the flag, but if everybody did as he
          wanted to do, set up his own beliefs as to right and wrong, then I
          think you would have chaos. The only thing I think we have in
          civilization nowadays is some sort of legal structure which people are
          sort of bound to follow. [Society needs] a centralizing framework.
          (Gibbs et al., 1983, pp. 140-41)

Because stage 4, subjects make moral
        decisions from the perspective of society as a whole, they think from a
        full-fledged member-of-society perspective (Colby and Kohlberg, 1983, p.
        27).
You will recall that stage 1 children
        also generally oppose stealing because it breaks the law. Superficially,
        stage 1 and stage 4 subjects are giving the same response, so we see
        here why Kohlberg insists that we must probe into the reasoning behind
        the overt response. Stage 1 children say, "It's wrong to
        steal" and "It's against the law," but they cannot
        elaborate any further, except to say that stealing can get a person
        jailed. Stage 4 respondents, in contrast, have a conception of the
        function of laws for society as a whole--a conception which far exceeds
        the grasp of the younger child.
Level III. Postconventional Morality
Stage 5. Social Contract and
        Individual Rights. At stage 4, people want to keep society
        functioning. However, a smoothly functioning society is not necessarily
        a good one. A totalitarian society might be well-organized, but it is
        hardly the moral ideal. At stage 5, people begin to ask, "What
        makes for a good society?" They begin to think about society in a
        very theoretical way, stepping back from their own society and
        considering the rights and values that a society ought to uphold. They
        then evaluate existing societies in terms of these prior considerations.
        They are said to take a "prior-to-society" perspective (Colby
        and Kohlberg, 1983, p. 22).
Stage 5 respondents basically believe
        that a good society is best conceived as a social contract into which
        people freely enter to work toward the benefit of all They recognize
        that different social groups within a society will have different
        values, but they believe that all rational people would agree on two
        points. First they would all want certain basic rights, such as
        liberty and life, to be protected Second, they would want some democratic
        procedures for changing unfair law and for improving society.
In response to the Heinz dilemma, stage
        5 respondents make it clear that they do not generally favor breaking
        laws; laws are social contracts that we agree to uphold until we can
        change them by democratic means. Nevertheless, the wifes right to
        live is a moral right that must be protected. Thus, stage 5 respondent
        sometimes defend Heinzs theft in strong language:

It is the husband's duty to save his
          wife. The fact that her life is in danger transcends every other
          standard you might use to judge his action. Life is more important
          than property.

This young man went on to say that
        "from a moral standpoint" Heinz should save the life of even a
        stranger, since to be consistent, the value of a life means any life.
        When asked if the judge should punish Heinz, he replied:

Usually the moral and legal
          standpoints coincide. Here they conflict. The judge should weight the
          moral standpoint more heavily but preserve the legal law in punishing
          Heinz lightly. (Kohlberg, 1976, p. 38)

Stage 5 subjects,- then, talk about
        "morality" and "rights" that take some priority over
        particular laws. Kohlberg insists, however, that we do not judge people
        to be at stage 5 merely from their verbal labels. We need to look at
        their social perspective and mode of reasoning. At stage 4, too,
        subjects frequently talk about the "right to life," but for
        them this right is legitimized by the authority of their social or
        religious group (e.g., by the Bible). Presumably, if their group valued
        property over life, they would too. At stage 5, in contrast, people are
        making more of an independent effort to think out what any society ought
        to value. They often reason, for example, that property has little
        meaning without life. They are trying to determine logically what a
        society ought to be like (Kohlberg, 1981, pp. 21-22; Gibbs et al., 1983,
        p. 83).
Stage 6: Universal Principles. Stage
        5 respondents are working toward a conception of the good society. They
        suggest that we need to (a) protect certain individual rights and (b)
        settle disputes through democratic processes. However, democratic
        processes alone do not always result in outcomes that we intuitively
        sense are just. A majority, for example, may vote for a law that hinders
        a minority. Thus, Kohlberg believes that there must be a higher
        stage--stage 6--which defines the principles by which we achieve
        justice.
Kohlberg's conception of justice follows
        that of the philosophers Kant and Rawls, as well as great moral leaders
        such as Gandhi and Martin Luther King. According to these people, the
        principles of justice require us to treat the claims of all parties in
        an impartial manner, respecting the basic dignity, of all people as
        individuals. The principles of justice are therefore universal; they
        apply to all. Thus, for example, we would not vote for a law that aids
        some people but hurts others. The principles of justice guide us toward
        decisions based on an equal respect for all.
In actual practice, Kohlberg says, we
        can reach just decisions by looking at a situation through one another's
        eyes. In the Heinz dilemma, this would mean that all parties--the
        druggist, Heinz, and his wife--take the roles of the others. To do this
        in an impartial manner, people can assume a "veil of
        ignorance" (Rawls, 1971), acting as if they do not know which role
        they will eventually occupy. If the druggist did this, even he would
        recognize that life must take priority over property; for he wouldn't
        want to risk finding himself in the wife's shoes with property valued
        over life. Thus, they would all agree that the wife must be saved--this
        would be the fair solution. Such a solution, we must note, requires not
        only impartiality, but the principle that everyone is given full and
        equal respect. If the wife were considered of less value than the
        others, a just solution could not be reached.
Until recently, Kohlberg had been
        scoring some of his subjects at stage 6, but he has temporarily stopped
        doing so, For one thing, he and other researchers had not been finding
        subjects who consistently reasoned at this stage. Also, Kohlberg has
        concluded that his interview dilemmas are not useful for distinguishing
        between stage 5 and stage 6 thinking. He believes that stage 6 has a
        clearer and broader conception of universal principles (which include
        justice as well as individual rights), but feels that his interview
        fails to draw out this broader understanding. Consequently, he has
        temporarily dropped stage 6 from his scoring manual, calling it a
        "theoretical stage" and scoring all postconventional responses
        as stage 5 (Colby and Kohlberg, 1983, p. 28).
Theoretically, one issue that
        distinguishes stage 5 from stage 6 is civil disobedience. Stage 5 would
        be more hesitant to endorse civil disobedience because of its commitment
        to the social contract and to changing laws through democratic
        agreements. Only when an individual right is clearly at stake does
        violating the law seem justified. At stage 6, in contrast, a commitment
        to justice makes the rationale for civil disobedience stronger and
        broader. Martin Luther King, for example, argued that laws are only
        valid insofar as they are grounded in justice, and that a commitment to
        justice carries with it an obligation to disobey unjust laws. King also
        recognized, of course, the general need for laws and democratic
        processes (stages 4 and 5), and he was therefore willing to accept the
        penalities for his actions. Nevertheless, he believed that the higher
        principle of justice required civil disobedience (Kohlberg, 198 1, p.
        43).
Summary
At stage 1 children think of what is
        right as that which authority says is right. Doing the right thing is
        obeying authority and avoiding punishment. At stage 2, children are no
        longer so impressed by any single authority; they see that there are
        different sides to any issue. Since everything is relative, one is free
        to pursue one's own interests, although it is often useful to make deals
        and exchange favors with others.
At stages 3 and 4, young people think as
        members of the conventional society with its values, norms, and
        expectations. At stage 3, they emphasize being a good person, which
        basically means having helpful motives toward people close to one At
        stage 4, the concern shifts toward obeying laws to maintain society as a
        whole.
At stages 5 and 6 people are less
        concerned with maintaining society for it own sake, and more concerned
        with the principles and values that make for a good society. At stage 5
        they emphasize basic rights and the democratic processes that give
        everyone a say, and at stage 6 they define the principles by which
        agreement will be most just.
THEORETICAL ISSUES
How Development Occurs
Kohlberg, it is important to remember,
        is a close follower of Piaget. Accordingly, Kohlberg's theoretical
        positions, including that on developmental change, reflect those of his
        mentor.
Kohlberg (e.g., 1968; 198 1, Ch. 3) says
        that his stages are not the product of maturation. That is, the stage
        structures and sequences do not simply unfold according to a genetic
        blueprint.
Neither, Kohlberg maintains, are his
        stages the product of socialization. That is, socializing agents (e.g.,
        parents and teachers) do not directly teach new forms of thinking.
        Indeed, it is difficult to imagine them systematically teaching each new
        stage structure in its particular place in the sequence.
The stages emerge, instead, from our own
        thinking about moral problems. Social experiences do promote
        development, but they do so by stimulating our mental processes. As we
        get into discussions and debates with others, we find our views
        questioned and challenged and are therefore motivated to come up with
        new, more comprehensive positions. New stages reflect these broader
        viewpoints (Kohlberg et al., 1975).
We might imagine, for example, a young
        man and woman discussing a new law. The man says that everyone should
        obey it, like it or not, because laws are vital to social organization
        (stage 4). The woman notes, however, that some well-organized societies,
        such as Nazi Germany, were not particularly moral. The man therefore
        sees that some evidence contradicts his view. He experiences some
        cognitive conflict and is motivated to think about the matter more
        fully, perhaps moving a bit toward stage 5.
Kohlberg also sometimes speaks of change
        occurring through role-taking opportunities, opportunities to consider
        others' viewpoints (e.g., 1976). As children interact with others, they
        learn how viewpoints differ and how to coordinate them in cooperative
        activities. As they discuss their problems and work out their
        differences, they develop their conceptions of what is fair and just.
Whatever the interactions are
        specifically like, they work best, Kohlberg says, when they are open and
        democratic. The less children feel pressured simply to conform to
        authority, the freer they are to settle their own differences and
        formulate their own ideas. We will discuss Kohlberg's efforts to induce
        developmental change in the section on implications for education.
The Stage Concept
Piaget, you will recall, proposed that
        true mental stages meet several criteria. They (1) are qualitatively
        different ways of thinking, (2) are structured wholes, (3) progress in
        an invariant sequence, (4) can be characterized as hierarchic
        integrations. and (5) are cross-cultural universals. Kohlberg has taken
        these criteria very seriously, trying to show how his stages meet them
        all. Let us consider these points one at a time.
1. Qualitative differences. It
        seems fairly clear that Kohlberg's stages are qualitatively different
        from one another. For example, stage 1 responses, which focus on
        obedience to authority, sound very different from stage 2 responses,
        which argue that each person is free to behave as he or she wishes. The
        two stages do not seem to differ along any quantitative dimension, they
        seem qualitatively different.
2. Structured wholes. By
        "structured wholes," Kohlberg means that the stages are not
        just isolated responses but are general patterns of thought that
        will consistently show up across many different kinds of issues. One
        gets a sense that this is true by reading through his scoring manual;
        one finds the same kinds of thinking reappearing on diverse items. For
        example, one item asks, "Why should a promise be kept?" As on
        the Heinz dilemma, children at stage 1 again speak in terms of obedience
        to rules, whereas those at stage 2 focus on exchanging favors that are
        in one's self-interest (e.g., "You never know when you're going to
        need that person to do something for you"). Similarly, as children
        proceed through the stages they keep giving responses that are similar
        to those to the Heinz dilemma (Gibbs et al., 1983, pp. 315-82).
In addition, Kohlberg and his co-workers
        (Colby et al., 1983) have obtained quantitative estimates of the extent
        to which subjects respond in terms of one particular stage. Since some
        subjects might be in transition between stages, one does not expect
        perfect consistency. Nevertheless, Kohlberg found that subjects scored
        at their dominant stage across nine dilemmas about two-thirds of the
        time. This seems to be a fair degree of consistency, suggesting the
        stages may reflect general modes of thought.
3. Invariant sequence. Kohlberg
        believes that his stages unfold in an invariant sequence. Children
        always go from stage 1 to stage 2 to stage 3 and so forth. They do not
        skip stages or move through them in mixed-up orders. Not all children
        necessarily reach the highest stages; they might lack intellectual
        stimulation. But to the extent they do go through the stages, they
        proceed in order.
Most of Kohlberg's evidence on his stage
        sequence comes from cross-sectional data. That is, he interviewed
        different children at various ages to see if the younger ones were at
        lower stages than the older ones. Stages 1 and 2 are primarily found at
        the youngest age, whereas the higher stages become more prevalent as age
        increases. Thus, the data support the stage sequence.
Cross-sectional findings, however, are
        inconclusive. In a cross-sectional study, different children are
        interviewed at each age, so there is no guarantee that any individual
        child actually moves through the stages in order. For example, there is
        no guarantee that a boy who is coded at stage 3 at age 13 actually
        passed through stages 1 and 2 in order when he was younger. More
        conclusive evidence must come from longitudinal studies, in which
        the same children are followed over time.
The first two major longitudinal studies
        (Kohlberg and Kramer, 1969; Holstein, 1973) began with samples of
        teenagers and then tested them at three-year intervals. These studies
        produced ambiguous results. In both, most subjects either remained at
        the same stage or moved up one stage, but there were also some who might
        have skipped a stage. Furthermore, these studies indicated that some
        subjects had regressed, and this finding also bothered Kohlberg, because
        he believes that movement through his stages should always be forward.
Kohlberg's response to these troublesome
        findings was to revise his scoring method. He had already become
        uncomfortable with his first (1958b) scoring manual, believing
        that it relied too heavily on the content of subjects' answers
        rather than their underlying reasoning. and he had made some
        improvements on it. So, when these longitudinal findings emerged, he
        decided to develop a much more precise and adequate scoring system and,
        to some extent, to revise his definitions of the stages.
To create the latest scoring manual,
        Kohlberg and his co-workers (Colby et al., 1983) worked with seven boys
        from his original (1958) sample who had been retested every three or
        four years for 20 years. It was during this work that Kohlberg decided
        to drop stage 6.
Kohlberg then examined the hypothesis of
        invariant sequence for 51 other boys from his original sample, who also
        had been retested at least twice (every three or four years) over the
        20-year period. This time, Kohlberg and his colleagues (Colby et al.,
        1983) found no stage-skipping, and only about 6 percent of the subjects
        showed signs of regressing. Four recent longitudinal studies have
        obtained similar results although, two have found somewhat more
        regression (up to 15 percent) (see Colby et al., 1983). In general,
        then, the new longitudinal studies seem to support the
        invariant-sequence hypothesis.
Kohlberg's new, longitudinal study has
        also changed the earlier picture of moral development in other ways.
        Stage 4 had become the dominant stage by age 16. In the new scoring
        system, however, it is more difficult to achieve the higher stages--the
        reasoning must be more clearly demonstrated--and Kohlberg finds that
        stage 4 does not become dominant until the boys are in their 20s and
        30s. Stage 5, too, only appears in the mid-20s and never becomes very
        prevalent.
4. Hierarchic integration. When
        Kohlberg says that his stages are hierarchically integrated, he means
        that people do not lose the insights gained at earlier stages, but
        integrate them into new, broader frameworks. For example, people at
        stage 4 can still understand stage 3 arguments, but they now subordinate
        them to wider considerations. They understand that Heinz had good
        motives for stealing, but they point out that if we all stole whenever
        we had a good motive, the social structure would break down. Thus stage
        4 subordinates a concern for motives to a wider concern for the society
        as a whole.
The concept of hierarchic integration is
        very important for Kohlberg because it enables him to explain the
        direction of his stage sequence. Since he is not a maturationist, he
        cannot simply say that the sequence is wired into the genes. So he wants
        to show how each new stage provides a broader framework for dealing with
        moral issues. Stage 4, as mentioned, transcends the limitations of stage
        3 and becomes more broadly concerned with social organization. Stage 5,
        in turn, sees the weakness of stage 4; a well-organized society is not
        necessarily a moral one. Stage 5 therefore considers the rights and
        orderly processes that make for a moral society. Each new stage retains
        the insights of the prior stage, but it recasts them into a broader
        framework. In this sense, each new stage is more cognitively adequate
        than the prior stage.
If Kohlberg is right about the
        hierarchic nature of his stages, we would expect that people would still
        be able to understand earlier stages but consider them inferior, In
        fact, when Rest (Rest et al., 1969; Rest, 1973) presented adolescents
        with arguments from different stages, this is what he found. They
        understood lower-stage reasoning, but they disliked it. What they
        preferred was the highest stage they heard, whether they fully
        understood it or not. This finding suggests, perhaps, that they had some
        intuitive sense of the greater adequacy of the higher stages.
Werner, we remember from Chapter 4,
        described hierarchic integration as a process that occurs alongside differentiation,
        and Kohlberg believes his stages represent increasingly
        differentiated structures as well. Kohlberg points out that the stage 5
        value on life, for example, has become differentiated from other
        considerations. Stage 5 respondents say that we ought to value life for
        its own sake, regardless of its value to authorities (stage 1), its
        usefulness to oneself (stage 2), the affection it arouses in us (stage
        3), or its value within a particular social order (stage 4). Stage 5
        subjects have abstracted this value from other considerations and now
        treat it as a purely moral ideal. Their thinking, Kohlberg says, is
        becoming like that of the moral philosophers in the Kantian tradition
        (1981, p. 171).
5. Universal sequence. Kohlberg,
        like all stage theorists, maintains that his stage sequence is
        universal; it is the same in all cultures. At first glance, this
        proposal might be surprising. Don't different cultures socialize their
        children differently, teaching them very different moral beliefs?
Kohlberg's response is that different
        cultures do teach different beliefs, but that his stages refer not to
        specific beliefs but to underlying modes of reasoning (Kohlberg and
        Gilligan, 197 1). For example, one culture might discourage physical
        fighting, while another encourages it more. As a result, children will
        have different beliefs about fighting, but they will still reason about
        it in the same way at the same stage. At stage 1, for example, one child
        might say that it is wrong to fight when insulted "because you will
        get punished for it, "while another says that "it is all right
        to fight; you won't get punished." The beliefs differ, but both
        children reason about them in the same underlying way, in terms of the
        physical consequences (punishment). They do so because this is what they
        can cognitively grasp. Later on, the first child might argue that
        fighting is bad "because if everyone fought all the time there
        would be anarchy," while the second child argues that "people
        must defend their honor, because if they don't everyone will be
        insulting everyone, and the whole society will break down." Once
        again, the specific beliefs differ, reflecting different cultural
        teachings, but the underlying reasoning is the same--in this case it is
        stage 4, where people can consider something as abstract as the social
        order. Children, regardless of their beliefs, will always move to stage
        4 thinking some time after stage 1 thinking because it is cognitively so
        much more sophisticated.
Kohlberg, then, proposes that his stage
        sequence will be the same in all cultures, for each stage is
        conceptually more advanced than the next. He and other researchers have
        given his interview to children and adults in a variety of cultures,
        including Mexico, Taiwan, Turkey, Israel, the Yucatan, Kenya, the
        Bahamas, and India. Most of the studies have been cross sectional, but a
        few have been longitudinal. Thus far, the studies have supported
        Kohlberg's stage sequence. To the extent that children move through the
        stages, they appear to move in order (Edwards, 1980).
At the same time, people in different
        cultures seem to move through the sequence at different rates and to
        reach different end-points. In the United States most urban middle-class
        adults reach stage 4, with a small percentage using some stage 5
        reasoning. In urban areas of other countries the picture is fairly
        similar. In the isolated villages and tribal communities of many
        countries, however, it is rare to find any adult beyond stage 3
        (Edwards, 1980).
Kohlberg (Nisan and Kohlberg, 1982)
        suggests that one can understand these findings in terms of Piagetian
        theory. Cultural factors, in this theory, do not directly shape the
        child's moral thought, but they do stimulate thinking. Social
        experiences can challenge children's ideas, motivating them to come up
        with new ones. In traditional villages, however, there may be little to
        challenge a stage 3 morality; the norms of care and empathy work very
        well in governing the face-to-face interactions of the group. Thus,
        there is little to stimulate thinking beyond this stage.
When, in contrast, young people leave
        the village and go off to the city, they witness the breakdown of
        interpersonal ties. They see that group norms of care and empathy have
        little impact on the impersonal interactions of city life, and they see
        the need for a formal legal structure to ensure moral conduct. They
        begin to think in terms of stage 4 morality. Furthermore, as Keniston
        (1971) notes, if young people attend the universities, they may take
        classes in which the teachers deliberately question the unexamined
        assumptions of their childhoods and adolescences. Thus they are
        stimulated to think about moral matters in new ways.
Moral Thought and Moral Behavior
Kohlberg's scale has to do with moral
        thinking, not moral action. As everyone knows, people who can talk at a
        high moral level may not behave accordingly. Consequently, we would not
        expect perfect correlations between moral judgment and moral action.
        Still, Kohlberg thinks that there should be some relationship.
As a general hypothesis, he proposes
        that moral behavior is more consistent, predictable. and responsible at
        the higher stages (Kohlberg et al., 1975), because the stages themselves
        increasingly employ more stable and general standards. For example,
        whereas stage 3 bases decisions on others' feelings, which can vary,
        stage 4 refers to set rules and laws. Thus, we can expect that moral
        behavior, too, will become more consistent as people move up the
        sequence. Generally speaking, there is some research support for this
        hypothesis (e.g., with respect to cheating), but the evidence is not
        clear-cut (Blasi, 1980; Brown and Herrnstein, 1975).
Some research has focused on the
        relationships between particular stages and specific kinds of behavior.
        For example, one might expect that juvenile delinquents or criminals
        would typically reason at stages 1 or 2, viewing morality as something
        imposed from without (stage 1) or as a matter of self-interest (stage
        2), rather than identifying with society's conventional expectations
        (stages 3 and 4). Again, some research supports this hypothesis, but
        there also are some ambiguous results (Blasi, 1980).
Several studies have examined the
        relationship between postconventional thinking and student protest. In a
        landmark study, Haan et al. (1968) examined the moral reasoning of those
        who participated in the Berkeley Free Speech Movement in 1964. Haan
        found that their thinking was more strongly postconventional than that
        of a matched sample of nonparticipants, but this f inding was not
        replicated for some other protests, apparently because moral principles
        were not at stake (Keniston, 1971, pp. 260-6 1).
Blasi (1980), after reviewing 75
        studies, concludes that overall there is a relationship between moral
        thought and action, but he suggests that we need to introduce other
        variables to clarify this relationship. One variable may simply be the
        extent to which individuals themselves feel the need to maintain
        consistency between their moral thoughts and actions (Blasi, 1980,
        Kohlberg and Candee, 1981).
Moral Thought and Other Forms of Cognition
Kohlberg has also tried to relate his
        moral stages to other forms of cognition. He has first analyzed his
        stages in terms of their underlying cognitive structures and has then
        looked for parallels in purely logical and social thought. For this
        purpose, he has analyzed his own stages in terms of implicit role-taking
        capacities, capacities to consider others' viewpoints (Kohlberg,
        1976; see also Selman, 1976, and Rest, 1983).
At first, at stage 1, children hardly
        seem to recognize that viewpoints differ. They assume that there is only
        one right view, that of authorities. At stage 2, in contrast, they
        recognize that people have different interests and viewpoints. They seem
        to be overcoming egocentrism; they see that perspectives are relative to
        the individual . They also begin to consider how individuals might
        coordinate their interests in terms of mutually beneficial deals.
At stage 3, people conceptualize
        role-taking as a deeper, more empathic process; one becomes concerned
        with the other's feelings. Stage 4, in turn, has a broader, society-wide
        conception of how people coordinate their roles through the legal
        system..
Stages 5 and 6, finally, take a more
        idealized look at how people might coordinate their interests. Stage 5
        emphasizes democratic processes, and stage 6 considers how all parties
        take one another's perspectives according to the principles of justice.
The moral stages, then, reflect expanded
        insights into how perspectives differ and might be coordinated. As such,
        the moral stages might be related to stages of logical and social
        thought which contain similar insights. So far, the empirical evidence
        suggests that advances in moral thinking may rest upon prior
        achievements in these other realms (Kohlberg, 1976; Kuhn et al., 1977).
        For example, children seem to advance to stage 2, overcoming their
        egocentrism in the moral sphere, only after they have made equivalent
        progress in their logical and social thought. If this pattern is
        correct, we can expect to find many individuals who are logical and even
        socially insightful but still underdeveloped in their moral judgment.
IMPLICATIONS FOR EDUCATION
Kohlberg would like to see people
        advance to the highest possible stage of moral thought. The best
        possible society would contain individuals who not only understand the
        need for social order (stage 4) but can entertain visions of universal
        principles, such as justice and liberty (stage 6) (Kohlberg, 1970).
How, then, can one promote moral
        development? Turiel (1966) found that when children listened to adults'
        moral judgments, the resulting change was slight. This is what Kohlberg
        might have expected, for he believes that if children are to reorganize
        their thinking, they must be more active.
Accordingly, Kohlberg encouraged another
        student, Moshe Blatt, to lead discussion groups in which children had a
        chance to grapple actively with moral issues (Blatt and Kohlberg, 1975).
        Blatt presented moral dilemmas which engaged the classes in a good deal
        of heated debate. He tried to leave much of the discussion to the
        children themselves, stepping in only to summarize, clarify, and
        sometimes present a view himself (p. 133). He encouraged arguments that
        were one stage above those of most of the class. In essence, he tried to
        implement one of Kohlberg's main ideas on how children move through the
        stages. They do so by encountering views which challenge their thinking
        and stimulate them to formulate better arguments (Kohlberg et al.,
        1975).
Blatt began a typical discussion by
        telling a story about a man named Mr. Jones who had a seriously injured
        son and wanted to rush him to the hospital. Mr. Jones had no car, so he
        approached a stranger, told him about the situation, and asked to borrow
        his car. The stranger, however, refused, saying he had an important
        appointment to keep. So Mr. Jones took the car by force. Blatt then
        asked whether Mr. Jones should have done that.
In the discussion that followed, one
        child, Student B, felt that Mr. Jones had a good cause for taking the
        car and also believed that the stranger could be charged with murder if
        the son died. Student C pointed out that the stranger violated no law.
        Student B still felt that the stranger's behavior was somehow wrong,
        even though he now realized that it was not legally wrong. Thus, Student
        B was in a kind of conflict. He had a sense of the wrongness of the
        stranger's behavior, but he could not articulate this sense in terms
        that would meet the objection. He was challenged to think about the
        problem more deeply.
In the end, Blatt gave him the answer.
        The stranger's behavior, Blatt said, was not legally wrong, but morally
        wrong--wrong according to God's laws (this was a Sunday School Class).
        At this point, Blatt was an authority teaching the "correct"
        view. In so doing, he might have robbed Student B of the chance to
        formulate spontaneously his own position. He might have done better to
        ask a question or to simply clarify the student's conflict (e.g,,
        "So it's not legally wrong, but you still have a sense that, it's
        somehow wrong. . ."). In any case, it seems clear that part of this
        discussion was valuable for this student. Since he himself struggled to
        formulate a distinction that could handle the objection, he could fully
        appreciate and assimilate a new view that he was looking for.
The Kohlberg-Blatt method of inducing
        cognitive conflict exemplifies Piaget's equilibration model. The child
        takes one view, becomes confused by discrepant information, and then
        resolves the confusion by forming a more advanced and comprehensive
        position. The method is also the dialectic process of Socratic teaching.
        The students give a view, the teacher asks questions which get them to
        see the inadequacies of their views, and they are then motivated to
        formulate better positions.
In Blatt's first experiment, the
        students (sixth graders) participated in 12 weekly discussion groups.
        Blatt found that over half the students moved up one full stage after
        the 12 weeks. Blatt and others have tried to replicate these findings,
        sometimes using other age groups and lengthier series of classes. As
        often happens with replications, the results have not been quite so
        successful; upward changes have been smaller--usually a third of a stage
        or less, Still, it generally seems that Socratic classroom discussions
        held over several months can produce changes that, while small, are
        significantly greater than those found in control groups who do not
        receive these experiences (Rest, 1983).
One of Blatt's supplementary findings
        was that those students who reported that they were most
        "interested" in the discussions made the greatest amount of
        change. This finding is in keeping with Piagetian theory. Children
        develop not because they are shaped through external reinforcements but
        because their curiosity is aroused. They become interested in
        information that does not quite fit into their existing cognitive
        structures and are thereby motivated to revise their thinking Another
        Kohlberg student--M. Berkowitz (1980)--is examining actual dialogues to
        see if those who become most challenged and involved in the tensions of
        moral debate are also those who move forward.
Although Kohlberg remains committed to
        the cognitive-conflict model of change, he has also become interested in
        other strategies. One is the "just Community" approach. Here
        the focus is not the individuals but groups. For example, Kohlberg and
        some of his colleagues (Power and Reimer, 1979) set up a special
        democratic high school group and actively encouraged the students to
        think of themselves as a community. Initially, little community feeling
        was present. The group's dominant orientation was stage 2; it treated
        problems such as stealing as purely individual matters. If a boy had
        something stolen, it was too bad for him. After a year, however, the
        group norms advanced to stage 3; the students now considered stealing to
        be a community issue that reflected on the degree of trust and care in
        the group.
It will be interesting to see if the
        just community approach can promote further advances in moral thinking.
        In the meantime, this approach has aroused some uneasiness among some of
        Kohlberg's associates. In particular, Reimer et al. (1983) have wondered
        whether Kohlberg, by explicitly encouraging the students to think of
        themselves as a community, is not practicing a form of indoctrination.
        Reimer says that he has talked to Kohlberg about this, and he has come
        away convinced that Kohlberg is committed to democratic groups in which
        students are encouraged "to think critically, to discuss
        assumptions, and. when they feel it is necessary, to challenge the
        teacher's suggestions" (p. 252). Thus, moral development remains a
        product of the students' own thinking.
EVALUATION
Kohlberg, a follower of Piaget, has
        offered a new, more detailed stage sequence for moral thinking. Whereas
        Piaget basically found two stages of moral thinking, the second of which
        emerges in early adolescence, Kohlberg has uncovered additional stages
        which develop well into adolescence and adulthood. He has suggested that
        some people even reach a postconventional level of moral thinking where
        they no longer accept their own society as given but think reflectively
        and autonomously about what a good society should be.
The suggestion of a postconventional
        morality is unusual in the social sciences. Perhaps it took a cognitive
        developmentalist list to suggest such a thing. For whereas most social
        scientists have been impressed by the ways in which societies mold and
        shape children's thinking, cognitive-developmentalists are more
        impressed by the capacities for independent thought. If children engage
        in enough independent thinking, Kohlberg suggests, they will eventually
        begin to formulate conceptions of rights, values, and principles by
        which they evaluate existing social arrangements. Perhaps some will even
        advance to the kinds of thinking that characterize some of the great
        moral leaders and philosophers who have at times advocated civil
        disobedience in the name of universal ethical principles.
Kohlberg's theory has provoked a good
        deal of criticism. Not everyone, first of all, is enthusiastic about the
        concept of a postconventional morality. Hogan (1973, 1975), for example,
        feels that it is dangerous for people to place their own principles
        above society and the law. It may be that many psychologists react to
        Kohlberg in a similar way, and that this reaction underlies many of the
        debates over the scientific merits of his research.
Others have argued that Kohlberg's
        stages are culturally biased. Simpson (1974), for example, says that
        Kohlberg has developed a stage model based on the Western philosophical
        tradition and has then applied this model to non-Western cultures
        without considering the extent to which they have different moral
        outlooks.
This criticism may have merit. One
        wonders how well Kohlberg's stages apply to the great Eastern
        philosophies. One also wonders if his stages do justice to moral
        development in many traditional village cultures. Researchers find that
        villagers stop at stage 3, but perhaps they continue to develop
        moralities in directions that Kohlberg's stages fail to capture.
Another criticism is that Kohlberg's
        theory is sex-biased, a view that has been thoughtfully expressed by one
        of Kohlberg's associates and co-authors, Carol Gilligan (1982). Gilligan
        observes that Kohlberg's stages were derived exclusively from interviews
        with males, and she charges that the stages reflect a decidedly male
        orientation. For males, advanced moral thought revolves around rules,
        rights, and abstract principles. The ideal is formal justice, in which
        all parties evaluate one another's claims in an impartial manner. This
        conception of morality, Gilligan argues, fails to capture the distinctly
        female voice on moral matters.
For women, Gilligan says, morality
        centers not on rights and rules but on interpersonal relationships and
        the ethics of compassion and care. The ideal is not impersonal justice
        but more affiliative ways of living. Women's morality, in addition, is
        more contextualized, it is tied to real, ongoing relationships rather
        than abstract solutions to hypothetical dilemmas.
Because of these sex differences,
        Gilligan says, men and women frequently score at different stages on
        Kohlberg's scale. Women typically score at stage 3, with its focus on
        interpersonal feelings, whereas men more commonly score at stages 4 and
        5, which reflect more abstract conceptions of social organization. Thus,
        women score lower than men. If, however, Kohlberg's scale were more
        sensitive to women's distinctly interpersonal orientations, it would
        show that women also continue to develop their thinking beyond stage 3.
Gilligan has made an initial effort to
        trace women's moral development. Since she believes that women's
        conceptions of care and affiliation are embedded in real-life
        situations, she has interviewed women facing a personal crisis--the
        decision to have an abortion. Through these interviews, Gilligan has
        tried to show that women move from a conventional to a postconventional
        mode of thinking. That is, they no longer consider their
        responsibilities in terms of what is conventionally expected, of them
        but in terms of their own insights into the ethics of care and
        responsibility.
Not everyone agrees with Gilligan's
        critique. Rest (1983), in particular, argues that Gilligan has
        exaggerated the extent of the sex differences found on Kohlberg's scale.
        An evaluation of this question, however, must await closer reviews of
        the literature.
In the meantime, Gilligan has raised an
        interesting theoretical possibility. Like Werner, she is suggesting that
        development may proceed along more than one line. One line of moral
        thought focuses on logic, justice, and social organization, the other on
        interpersonal relationships. If this is so, there is the further
        possibility that these two lines at some point become integrated within
        each sex. That is, each sex might become more responsive to the dominant
        orientation of the other. Perhaps, as Gilligan briefly suggests (1982,
        Ch. 6), this integration is a major task of the adult years. (For
        further thoughts in this vein, see Chapter 14 on Jung's theory of adult
        development.)
There are other criticisms of Kohlberg's
        work. Many of these have to do with empirical matters, such as the
        problem of invariant sequence, the prevalence of regression, and the
        relationships between thought and action. Since I have mentioned these
        earlier, I would like to conclude with a more general question. Kohlberg
        writes in a forceful manner and he promotes stage 6 as if it provides
        the decision-making tools we need for the toughest ethical dilemmas.
        However, there may be issues that the principles of justice frequently
        fail to resolve. One such issue is abortion. Stage 6 would ask us to
        consider the physical life of the fetus as well as all the parties'
        right to fulfilling lives, but does stage 6 routinely lead to decisions
        that we feel are right? Kohlberg's students, Reimer et al. (1983, pp.
        46-47, 88-89) discuss a stage 6 approach to a hypothetical abortion
        decision without reaching much of a conclusion. The decision, they say,
        will have to vary with the situation. Stage 6. of course, is not
        intended to provide a set of answers--it is a mode of decision-making.
        Still, Kohlberg sometimes seems to skim over the incredible difficulty
        that some ethical problems present--a difficulty that is more directly
        expressed in the writing of Kant (1788).
Nevertheless, whatever criticisms and
        questions we might have, there is no doubt that Kohlberg's
        accomplishment is great. He has not just expanded on Piaget's stages of
        moral judgment but has done so in an inspiring way. He has studied the
        development of moral reasoning as it might work its way toward the
        thinking of the great moral philosophers. So, although few people may
        ever begin to think about moral issues like Socrates, Kant, or Martin
        Luther King, Kohlberg has nonetheless provided us with a challenging
        vision of what development might be.
