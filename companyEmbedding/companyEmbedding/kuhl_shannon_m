Outlaws & Renegades
What makes KÜHL designs so unique?  KÜHL does things the old-fashioned way, and that makes all the difference. Every good card player knows to keep their hand close, and that’s how KÜHL approaches building product. Pattern, design, and sample sewing teams remain in-house, where the creative process is nurtured and protected. When you buy KÜHL, you know you’re getting the real deal, an original design you won’t find anywhere else.




Built for a Purpose, Not a Price
KÜHL’s rebuilt 1972 UNIMOG accompanies the team to events around the town, helping them meet more customers face to face. The company chose to rebuild and customize the KÜHLMOG because of its “Built for a purpose, not a price” approach, a principle that influences all actions at KÜHL. The truck demonstrates that design isn’t just about clothes—it’s about everything KÜHL touches.




Giving Back
KÜHL is passionate about protecting the areas where we all work and play, and helping others do the same. The company takes an active role to support the health of its community and the beautiful open spaces that bring everyone joy. KÜHL products and behind-the-scenes financial donations help promote awareness and fuel the organizations making a difference in its home on the Wasatch Front in Utah.




The Airspeed
Hot sun, high humidity, and no breeze are the perfect conditions for KÜHL’s Airspeed collection of sun shirts. The technical woven nylon/poly blend blocks UV rays, wicks moisture, and dries fast. Ventilating, strategically placed high-tech knit mesh panels and KÜHL’s exclusive articulated 5-panel sleeves (patent pending) deliver ultimate range of motion for outdoor pursuits.



About KÜHLWhile KÜHL is known today for great fitting pants and wool sweaters, the origins of the KÜHL story can be traced back to the snowy Wasatch Mountains of 1983 with a Peruvian-inspired polar fleece cap known as the “Alf Hat.”  The hat was the brainchild of John “Alf” Engwall, who partnered with a young Conrad Anker and brothers Jay and Kevin Boyle to market the “Alf” to serious skiers and mountaineers. Driven to build a business around the mountain lifestyle they loved, as well as to fund the obsession with climbing and skiing that they all shared, they founded a company called Alfwear. The Alf Hat became the go-to choice of avid powder skiers in the ‘80s and the fledgling company enjoyed a relative amount of success. Then tragedy struck when a car accident took the life of John Engwall. The three remaining partners continued to run the business for several more years, until in 1989, following the loss of several key accounts, the original Alfwear partnership was dissolved. Conrad Anker went on to pursue his legendary career as a professional mountaineer and Jay Boyle began to attend graduate school. What remained of the company (several boxes of the original Alf Hat) was left to Kevin Boyle who went to work transforming the brand. Drawing on his passion for skiing, art, and mountain life, Kevin envisioned a new line of clothing, and in 1990 he turned Alfwear into the company we know today as KÜHL. The first product KÜHL introduced was the Jacquard Jacket; a fleece top featuring thumb-loop cuffs (a first in outdoor clothing) and underarm gussets for freedom of movement. The jacket rapidly became popular in the outdoor community and even won the Polartec Apex Award for Design Excellence. As the company began to build on the success of the Jacquard Jacket, careful attention was paid to ensure that the skiing and climbing lifestyle lived by the founders would continue to inspire and guide the brand—an initiative that is maintained to this day. Design work continued and the line expanded to include pants, shirts, shorts, and hats for both men and women. Today, the KÜHL line of clothing features unique weaves, carefully selected fabrics, vintage washes, and renowned attention to fit—especially with their pants. You’d be hard pressed to find a genuine disciple of mountain culture who doesn’t have a pair of KÜHL pants in their weekly rotation, evidence of the like-minded designers who bring each KÜHL garment into existence. For great fit, freedom of movement, and a sense of style that is truly “born in the mountains,” look no further than KÜHL.

Women's Pants




KÜHL Women’s Pants Weave Performance and Style Together
From mountain to market, KÜHL technical hiking pants and travel pants deliver unparalleled performance in flattering, feminine fashion.
Choose from a variety of fabrics, styles and features for the women’s performance pants that are right for you:
Fabrics for Every Climate – Our number one travel choice, the KONTRA™ PANT features quick drying ÜBERKÜHL™ for comfort and breathability in hot, humid conditions. Stay cool and dry in the KENDRA™ PANT with two-layer KÜHLDRY™; the outer layer pulls moisture away from your skin while the inner layer breathes and dries quickly.
A perennial favorite, the MØVA Series with KONTOUR™ fabric blends performance and design. A soft and durable stretch nylon made to look like woven fabric for texture and appeal, KONTOUR™ fabric holds its shape for a flattering, feminine fit. Available in a range of fits and styles, the MØVA PANT effortlessly transitions from trail to town.  
Convertible Hiking Pants – For overnight backpacking trips, long day hikes, or travel, nothing beats the versatility of Convertible Pants. Try the ANIKA CONVERTIBLE when you need flexible options on the trail.
Roll-up Pants – Perfect for beach coming and paddle boarding, the SPLASH and ANIKA ROLL-UP PANT easily transition from full-length trekking pants to capris.
Softshell Technology and Groundbreaking Design – For peak performance when alpine climbing, skiing, and mountaineering, the DESTROYR™ PANT combines a form-fitting, flexible softshell with 3D ergonomic design. The DURANGO™ PANT features KINETIK™ fabric, an extremely abrasion resistant stretch nylon softshell with DWR finish and UPF 50.
When selecting the perfect pant for work or play, look for signature touches like KÜHLKURVE fit: the contoured waistband is slightly higher in the back and lower in the front for a perfect fit. The internal draw cord on many styles provides a custom fit, and details like 5-pocket jean styling and 3-needle stitching add sophisticated style. Available in SKINNY, STRAIGHT and RELAXED fit, KÜHL has the perfect pants to take you from trail to town, daytime to date night.

Hi, we’re Co-op Cycles

We’re bikes born from a love of adventure, cooperatively designed with REI members and built for riders who seek the fun and freedom that comes from exploring the world on two wheels.



























Mountain

When fat tires and dirt trails combine, it’s magic, plain and simple. These low-maintenance fun machines have proven technologies and upgradability that’ll let you dial in a ride all your own.




Explore mountain bikes





























All-road

Road bikes for the adventurous, who know the ride shouldn’t end just because the pavement does. These are built strong and light, providing true versatility from pavement to gravel and beyond.




Explore all-road bikes





























Adventure

Made for loaded tours in ever-changing terrain, these are the bikes from which great stories come. Each model is purpose-built, fully rackable and ready to roll wherever you want to take it.




Explore adventure bikes





























City

Ditch the car and start living, people. Commuting, errands, beer runs and nights out are all made better when done on two wheels. Being part of the solution has never been so much fun.




Explore city bikes





























Kids

When you're a kid, your bike is your freedom. Start 'em out right with sturdy and reliable bikes that will take them from training wheels to singletrack in no time.




Explore kids' bikes














BIKES WORTH RIDING

Adventure ready

Our bikes are adventure ready and built for versatility. Our members told us that their adventures don’t always fit into exact categories, so we made it easy to accessorize and upgrade.

























Built with great parts

We consciously choose high-quality components over just the latest-and-greatest tech. Meaning, spec-for-spec, our bikes are some of the best values around, and they’ll keep you riding happy for years.

























Cooperatively designed

We start our design process by talking with our riders. They tell us what matters most to them, and we use their feedback to build nothing but great bikes worth riding.

These pants are soooo comfortable! They look good too very flattering. I bought them to wear on the weekends but I am going to dress these up for work. I want to live in these pants!

I purchased another pair of these pants for my mom because I loved my 3 pair and thought she would enjoy the comfort, stylishness, and flexibility to do just about anything in these pants (lazy around the house, working out, or just athletic leisure wear). Well she definitely enjoyed them since this was the 2nd pair I got for her and she wants more when I find her size. She is 71 years old and wanted her to realize style and comfort are possible. Packs easily for trips without wrinkles! We are both 5'2" so love the option of short inseam --plus I wear a size 0 and she wears a size 12 but they look amazing on both of us (flattering to all shapes and sizes)!

I love these pants so much EXCEPT that every single piece of lint or hair sticks to them. Not cool. Aside from that flaw, they are comfortable, look and feel good on, too heavy for warm fall days in the south but great for cooler nights. But the lint. Oh my goodness.
I'd also recommend:  Lucy, Prana

These pants are so comfortable! Somewhat lightweight, soft material. Very flattering & a step up in style from standard loungewear. A little pricey, but I will probably be buying a 2nd pair in another color simply because I love them!

Outlaws & Renegades
What makes KÜHL designs so unique?  KÜHL does things the old-fashioned way, and that makes all the difference. Every good card player knows to keep their hand close, and that’s how KÜHL approaches building product. Pattern, design, and sample sewing teams remain in-house, where the creative process is nurtured and protected. When you buy KÜHL, you know you’re getting the real deal, an original design you won’t find anywhere else.




Built for a Purpose, Not a Price
KÜHL’s rebuilt 1972 UNIMOG accompanies the team to events around the town, helping them meet more customers face to face. The company chose to rebuild and customize the KÜHLMOG because of its “Built for a purpose, not a price” approach, a principle that influences all actions at KÜHL. The truck demonstrates that design isn’t just about clothes—it’s about everything KÜHL touches.




Giving Back
KÜHL is passionate about protecting the areas where we all work and play, and helping others do the same. The company takes an active role to support the health of its community and the beautiful open spaces that bring everyone joy. KÜHL products and behind-the-scenes financial donations help promote awareness and fuel the organizations making a difference in its home on the Wasatch Front in Utah.




The Airspeed
Hot sun, high humidity, and no breeze are the perfect conditions for KÜHL’s Airspeed collection of sun shirts. The technical woven nylon/poly blend blocks UV rays, wicks moisture, and dries fast. Ventilating, strategically placed high-tech knit mesh panels and KÜHL’s exclusive articulated 5-panel sleeves (patent pending) deliver ultimate range of motion for outdoor pursuits.



About KÜHLWhile KÜHL is known today for great fitting pants and wool sweaters, the origins of the KÜHL story can be traced back to the snowy Wasatch Mountains of 1983 with a Peruvian-inspired polar fleece cap known as the “Alf Hat.”  The hat was the brainchild of John “Alf” Engwall, who partnered with a young Conrad Anker and brothers Jay and Kevin Boyle to market the “Alf” to serious skiers and mountaineers. Driven to build a business around the mountain lifestyle they loved, as well as to fund the obsession with climbing and skiing that they all shared, they founded a company called Alfwear. The Alf Hat became the go-to choice of avid powder skiers in the ‘80s and the fledgling company enjoyed a relative amount of success. Then tragedy struck when a car accident took the life of John Engwall. The three remaining partners continued to run the business for several more years, until in 1989, following the loss of several key accounts, the original Alfwear partnership was dissolved. Conrad Anker went on to pursue his legendary career as a professional mountaineer and Jay Boyle began to attend graduate school. What remained of the company (several boxes of the original Alf Hat) was left to Kevin Boyle who went to work transforming the brand. Drawing on his passion for skiing, art, and mountain life, Kevin envisioned a new line of clothing, and in 1990 he turned Alfwear into the company we know today as KÜHL. The first product KÜHL introduced was the Jacquard Jacket; a fleece top featuring thumb-loop cuffs (a first in outdoor clothing) and underarm gussets for freedom of movement. The jacket rapidly became popular in the outdoor community and even won the Polartec Apex Award for Design Excellence. As the company began to build on the success of the Jacquard Jacket, careful attention was paid to ensure that the skiing and climbing lifestyle lived by the founders would continue to inspire and guide the brand—an initiative that is maintained to this day. Design work continued and the line expanded to include pants, shirts, shorts, and hats for both men and women. Today, the KÜHL line of clothing features unique weaves, carefully selected fabrics, vintage washes, and renowned attention to fit—especially with their pants. You’d be hard pressed to find a genuine disciple of mountain culture who doesn’t have a pair of KÜHL pants in their weekly rotation, evidence of the like-minded designers who bring each KÜHL garment into existence. For great fit, freedom of movement, and a sense of style that is truly “born in the mountains,” look no further than KÜHL.

Women's Pants




KÜHL Women’s Pants Weave Performance and Style Together
From mountain to market, KÜHL technical hiking pants and travel pants deliver unparalleled performance in flattering, feminine fashion.
Choose from a variety of fabrics, styles and features for the women’s performance pants that are right for you:
Fabrics for Every Climate – Our number one travel choice, the KONTRA™ PANT features quick drying ÜBERKÜHL™ for comfort and breathability in hot, humid conditions. Stay cool and dry in the KENDRA™ PANT with two-layer KÜHLDRY™; the outer layer pulls moisture away from your skin while the inner layer breathes and dries quickly.
A perennial favorite, the MØVA Series with KONTOUR™ fabric blends performance and design. A soft and durable stretch nylon made to look like woven fabric for texture and appeal, KONTOUR™ fabric holds its shape for a flattering, feminine fit. Available in a range of fits and styles, the MØVA PANT effortlessly transitions from trail to town.  
Convertible Hiking Pants – For overnight backpacking trips, long day hikes, or travel, nothing beats the versatility of Convertible Pants. Try the ANIKA CONVERTIBLE when you need flexible options on the trail.
Roll-up Pants – Perfect for beach coming and paddle boarding, the SPLASH and ANIKA ROLL-UP PANT easily transition from full-length trekking pants to capris.
Softshell Technology and Groundbreaking Design – For peak performance when alpine climbing, skiing, and mountaineering, the DESTROYR™ PANT combines a form-fitting, flexible softshell with 3D ergonomic design. The DURANGO™ PANT features KINETIK™ fabric, an extremely abrasion resistant stretch nylon softshell with DWR finish and UPF 50.
When selecting the perfect pant for work or play, look for signature touches like KÜHLKURVE fit: the contoured waistband is slightly higher in the back and lower in the front for a perfect fit. The internal draw cord on many styles provides a custom fit, and details like 5-pocket jean styling and 3-needle stitching add sophisticated style. Available in SKINNY, STRAIGHT and RELAXED fit, KÜHL has the perfect pants to take you from trail to town, daytime to date night.

We’re bikes born from a love of adventure, cooperatively designed with REI members and built for riders who seek the fun and freedom that comes from exploring the world on two wheels.



























Mountain

When fat tires and dirt trails combine, it’s magic, plain and simple. These low-maintenance fun machines have proven technologies and upgradability that’ll let you dial in a ride all your own.




Explore mountain bikes





























All-road

Road bikes for the adventurous, who know the ride shouldn’t end just because the pavement does. These are built strong and light, providing true versatility from pavement to gravel and beyond.




Explore all-road bikes





























Adventure

Made for loaded tours in ever-changing terrain, these are the bikes from which great stories come. Each model is purpose-built, fully rackable and ready to roll wherever you want to take it.




Explore adventure bikes





























City

Ditch the car and start living, people. Commuting, errands, beer runs and nights out are all made better when done on two wheels. Being part of the solution has never been so much fun.




Explore city bikes





























Kids

When you're a kid, your bike is your freedom. Start 'em out right with sturdy and reliable bikes that will take them from training wheels to singletrack in no time.

Adventure ready

Our bikes are adventure ready and built for versatility. Our members told us that their adventures don’t always fit into exact categories, so we made it easy to accessorize and upgrade.

























Built with great parts

We consciously choose high-quality components over just the latest-and-greatest tech. Meaning, spec-for-spec, our bikes are some of the best values around, and they’ll keep you riding happy for years.

























Cooperatively designed

We start our design process by talking with our riders. They tell us what matters most to them, and we use their feedback to build nothing but great bikes worth riding.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
