eIQ Energy Names Dimitry Goder VP of Engineering, Paul Heidesch 
      Director of Western Sales Area




Staff Expansions Strengthen Technology Development and Distribution 
      Activities






June 30, 2010 04:00 PM Eastern Daylight Time



SAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--In moves that will bolster its technology development and distribution 
      capabilities, Parallel Solar developer eIQ Energy Inc. has named Dimitry 
      Goder vice president of engineering, and Paul Heidesch director, Western 
      sales area. Both positions are newly created in response to increasing 
      levels of business for the company’s Parallel Solar technology, which 
      enables wiring of solar arrays in parallel rather than series.
    


      Mr. Goder has 25 years of engineering and marketing experience in power 
      management, most recently as senior director of power management 
      products for semiconductor developer Integrated Device Technology (IDT). 
      Like virtually all of eIQ Energy’s senior management, he has 
      entrepreneurial experience, having started a power management product 
      line at IDT and also co-founded Switch Power Inc. and served as its vice 
      president of design engineering until its 1999 acquisition by Bourns 
      Corp.
    

      In his new role, Mr. Goder will oversee the expansion and strategic 
      direction of eIQ Energy’s development team as it enhances and extends 
      the Parallel Solar product line. Power management technology is at the 
      heart of eIQ Energy’s products, which allow the connection of an 
      unprecedented number of solar panels on a single cable run, greatly 
      reducing up-front solar array costs and providing much more design 
      flexibility, while also boosting lifetime energy harvest with 
      distributed MPPT.
    

      “I’m excited to join a leader in green energy solutions, and to have the 
      opportunity to help make solar technology more widely available and 
      increasingly cost effective,” said Mr. Goder.
    

      Mr. Heidesch, who comes to eIQ Energy from Enerworks Solar where he 
      served as director of business development for the Southwest U.S., will 
      be based in Southern California and have responsibility for cultivating 
      new business channels in the Western U.S. He performed similar duties 
      for solar thermal developer Enerworks, and also worked in business 
      development at Advanced Solar Integration Technologies and IHS Energy.
    

      “I hope to quickly establish new distribution channels, and help cement 
      eIQ Energy’s position as the leader in innovative array architecture 
      technology,” commented Mr. Heidesch.
    

      Oliver Janssen, CEO of eIQ Energy, noted that since the company’s launch 
      last fall, it has seen steadily increasing market interest and demand. 
      “We’re getting very positive signals, and we’re glad to have the benefit 
      of Dimity and Paul’s knowledge and skills as we move into our next stage 
      of growth,” he said.

      energy more effective and affordable. The company’s Parallel Solar

      designers, installers and operators. eIQ Energy was founded in 2007 with 
      the principal goal of improving the performance and the return on 
      investment for clean energy sources such as photovoltaic systems.
