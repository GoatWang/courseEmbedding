Tampa Electric Co. v. Nashville Coal Co., 365 U.S. 320 (1961), the Tampa Electric case, was a 1961 decision of the Supreme Court that, together with United States v. Philadelphia Nat'l Bank, clarified the legal test for determining whether requirements contracts "may substantially lessen competition" or "tend to create a monopoly" for purposes of section 3 of the Clayton Act.[1]

Background[edit]
Tampa Electric, an electricity generating utility in Florida, decided to switch from burning oil to burning coal as boiler fuel at one of its new generating stations. It entered into a 20-year total requirements contract with Nashville Coal for the supply of coal at the station.[2] Shortly before the first coal was actually to be delivered, Tampa Electric, in order to equip its first units for the use of coal, spent some $3 million more than the cost of constructing oil-burning units. At that point Nashville Coal advised Tampa Electric that the contract was illegal under the antitrust laws, would therefore not be performed, and no coal would be delivered.[3] Tampa Electric was therefore obliged to procure its coal elsewhere.[4]
According to the Court, there were some 700 coal suppliers in the producing area where Nashville Coal operated, and Tampa Electric's anticipated maximum requirements at the new station "would approximate 1% of the total coal of the same type produced and marketed" in that area.[5]
Tampa sued Nashville to enforce the contract. The district court granted summary judgment in Nashville's favor, and the court of appeals affirmed. Both courts compared the estimated coal tonnage as to which the contract preempted competition for 20 years, namely, 1 million tons a year by 1961, with the previous annual consumption of peninsular Florida, 700,000 tons. Emphasizing that fact, as well as the contract value of the coal covered by the 20-year term—$128 million—they held that such volume was not "insignificant or insubstantial," and that the effect of the contract would "be to substantially lessen competition," in violation of the § 3 of the Clayton Act.[6] Tampa then sough further review in the Supreme Court.
Ruling of Supreme Court[edit]




Justice Tom Clark


The Court, in a 7-2 opinion written by Justice Tom C. Clark, reversed. It turned to the Standard Stations case for guidance:

[Standard Stations] held that such contracts are proscribed by § 3 if their practical effect is to prevent lessees or purchasers from using or dealing in the goods, etc., of a competitor or competitors of the lessor or seller, and thereby "competition has been foreclosed in a substantial share of the line of commerce affected." In practical application, even though a contract is found to be an exclusive dealing arrangement, it does not violate the section unless the court believes it probable that performance of the contract will foreclose competition in a substantial share of the line of commerce affected.[7]

The Court then directly quoted Standard Stations:

"[A] purely quantitative measure of this effect is inadequate, because the narrower the area of competition, the greater the comparative effect on the area's competitors. Since it is the preservation of competition which is at stake, the significant proportion of coverage is that within the area of effective competition."[8]

That meant, the Court said, that it was necessary to evaluate this contract in terms of its magnitude in the relevant market:

[T]he competition foreclosed by the contract must be found to constitute a substantial share of the relevant market. That is to say, the opportunities for other traders to enter into or remain in that market must be significantly limited, as was pointed out in [Standard Stations]. There, the impact of the requirements contracts was studied in the setting of the large number of gasoline stations—5,937, or 16% of the retail outlets in the relevant market—and the large number of contracts, over 8,000, together with the great volume of products involved. This combination dictated a finding that "Standard's use of the contracts [created] just such a potential clog on competition as it was the purpose of § 3 to remove" where, as there, the affected proportion of retail sales was substantial.[9]

In the Court's view, the two lower courts had focused on an artificially narrow relevant market (Florida rather than much of the Eastern US[10]) that was not the area of effective competition:

In applying these considerations to the facts of the case before us, it appears clear that both the Court of Appeals and the District Court have not given the required effect to a controlling factor in the case—the relevant competitive market area. . . .[I]t clearly appears that the proportionate volume of the total relevant coal product as to which the challenged contract preempted competition, less than 1%, is, conservatively speaking, quite insubstantial. A more accurate figure, even assuming preemption to the extent of the maximum anticipated total requirements, 2,250,000 tons a year, would be .77%. . . . While $128,000,000 is a considerable sum of money, even in these days, the dollar volume, by itself, is not the test, as we have already pointed out. [T]he relevant coal market . . . sees an annual trade in excess of 250,000,000 tons of coal and over a billion dollars—multiplied by 20 years, it runs into astronomical figures. There is here neither a seller with a dominant position in the market, . . . nor myriad outlets with substantial sales volume, coupled with an industry-wide practice of relying upon exclusive contracts, as in [Standard Stations]. On the contrary, we seem to have only that type of contract which "may well be of economic advantage to buyers, as well as to sellers." [Citing Standard Stations][11]

The Court rejected the view that Standard Stations held that 6.7 percent of the market was enough to make a contract illegal, and it concluded:

In weighing the various factors, we have decided that, in the competitive bituminous coal marketing area involved here, the contract sued upon does not tend to foreclose a substantial volume of competition.[12]

Justices Black and Douglas dissented without opinion.
Subsequent developments[edit]
Later court decisions have relied on Tampa Electric as providing guidance on how to determine the relevant market in which competitive impact should be measured. For example, in White & White, Inc. v. American Hosp. Supply Corp., 723 F. 2d 495, 503 (6th Cir. 1983), the Sixth Circuit instructed:

Accordingly, the proper criteria for defining a geographic market is that "area in which the seller operates, and to which the purchaser can practicably turn for supply." (Citing Tampa Elec., 365 U.S. at 327.) While that area is not ordinarily susceptible to a "metes and bounds definition," it is the area in which "producers effectively compete." Id.

In Apani Southwest, Inc. v. Coca-Cola Enterprises, 300 F.3d 620, 625 (5th Cir. 2002). the Fifth Circuit explained the Supreme Court's analysis in Tampa:

When assessing whether an exclusive-dealing arrangement has the probable effect of substantially lessening competition, the Supreme Court has identified a three-part inquiry. Tampa Elec. First, the relevant product market must be identified by considering interchangeability and cross-elasticity of demand. Second, the relevant geographic market must be identified, "by careful selection of the market area in which the seller operates and to which the purchaser can practicably turn for supplies." Id. Finally, a plaintiff must show that the "competition foreclosed by the arrangement constitutes a 'substantial share of the relevant market.'" Id. That is, "the opportunities for other traders to enter into or remain in that market must be significantly limited." Id.

Tampa Electric Co. v. Nashville Coal Co., 365 U.S. 320 (1961), the Tampa Electric case, was a 1961 decision of the Supreme Court that, together with United States v. Philadelphia Nat'l Bank, clarified the legal test for determining whether requirements contracts "may substantially lessen competition" or "tend to create a monopoly" for purposes of section 3 of the Clayton Act.[1]

Background[edit]
Tampa Electric, an electricity generating utility in Florida, decided to switch from burning oil to burning coal as boiler fuel at one of its new generating stations. It entered into a 20-year total requirements contract with Nashville Coal for the supply of coal at the station.[2] Shortly before the first coal was actually to be delivered, Tampa Electric, in order to equip its first units for the use of coal, spent some $3 million more than the cost of constructing oil-burning units. At that point Nashville Coal advised Tampa Electric that the contract was illegal under the antitrust laws, would therefore not be performed, and no coal would be delivered.[3] Tampa Electric was therefore obliged to procure its coal elsewhere.[4]
According to the Court, there were some 700 coal suppliers in the producing area where Nashville Coal operated, and Tampa Electric's anticipated maximum requirements at the new station "would approximate 1% of the total coal of the same type produced and marketed" in that area.[5]
Tampa sued Nashville to enforce the contract. The district court granted summary judgment in Nashville's favor, and the court of appeals affirmed. Both courts compared the estimated coal tonnage as to which the contract preempted competition for 20 years, namely, 1 million tons a year by 1961, with the previous annual consumption of peninsular Florida, 700,000 tons. Emphasizing that fact, as well as the contract value of the coal covered by the 20-year term—$128 million—they held that such volume was not "insignificant or insubstantial," and that the effect of the contract would "be to substantially lessen competition," in violation of the § 3 of the Clayton Act.[6] Tampa then sough further review in the Supreme Court.
Ruling of Supreme Court[edit]




Justice Tom Clark


The Court, in a 7-2 opinion written by Justice Tom C. Clark, reversed. It turned to the Standard Stations case for guidance:

[Standard Stations] held that such contracts are proscribed by § 3 if their practical effect is to prevent lessees or purchasers from using or dealing in the goods, etc., of a competitor or competitors of the lessor or seller, and thereby "competition has been foreclosed in a substantial share of the line of commerce affected." In practical application, even though a contract is found to be an exclusive dealing arrangement, it does not violate the section unless the court believes it probable that performance of the contract will foreclose competition in a substantial share of the line of commerce affected.[7]

The Court then directly quoted Standard Stations:

"[A] purely quantitative measure of this effect is inadequate, because the narrower the area of competition, the greater the comparative effect on the area's competitors. Since it is the preservation of competition which is at stake, the significant proportion of coverage is that within the area of effective competition."[8]

That meant, the Court said, that it was necessary to evaluate this contract in terms of its magnitude in the relevant market:

[T]he competition foreclosed by the contract must be found to constitute a substantial share of the relevant market. That is to say, the opportunities for other traders to enter into or remain in that market must be significantly limited, as was pointed out in [Standard Stations]. There, the impact of the requirements contracts was studied in the setting of the large number of gasoline stations—5,937, or 16% of the retail outlets in the relevant market—and the large number of contracts, over 8,000, together with the great volume of products involved. This combination dictated a finding that "Standard's use of the contracts [created] just such a potential clog on competition as it was the purpose of § 3 to remove" where, as there, the affected proportion of retail sales was substantial.[9]

In the Court's view, the two lower courts had focused on an artificially narrow relevant market (Florida rather than much of the Eastern US[10]) that was not the area of effective competition:

In applying these considerations to the facts of the case before us, it appears clear that both the Court of Appeals and the District Court have not given the required effect to a controlling factor in the case—the relevant competitive market area. . . .[I]t clearly appears that the proportionate volume of the total relevant coal product as to which the challenged contract preempted competition, less than 1%, is, conservatively speaking, quite insubstantial. A more accurate figure, even assuming preemption to the extent of the maximum anticipated total requirements, 2,250,000 tons a year, would be .77%. . . . While $128,000,000 is a considerable sum of money, even in these days, the dollar volume, by itself, is not the test, as we have already pointed out. [T]he relevant coal market . . . sees an annual trade in excess of 250,000,000 tons of coal and over a billion dollars—multiplied by 20 years, it runs into astronomical figures. There is here neither a seller with a dominant position in the market, . . . nor myriad outlets with substantial sales volume, coupled with an industry-wide practice of relying upon exclusive contracts, as in [Standard Stations]. On the contrary, we seem to have only that type of contract which "may well be of economic advantage to buyers, as well as to sellers." [Citing Standard Stations][11]

The Court rejected the view that Standard Stations held that 6.7 percent of the market was enough to make a contract illegal, and it concluded:

In weighing the various factors, we have decided that, in the competitive bituminous coal marketing area involved here, the contract sued upon does not tend to foreclose a substantial volume of competition.[12]

Justices Black and Douglas dissented without opinion.
Subsequent developments[edit]
Later court decisions have relied on Tampa Electric as providing guidance on how to determine the relevant market in which competitive impact should be measured. For example, in White & White, Inc. v. American Hosp. Supply Corp., 723 F. 2d 495, 503 (6th Cir. 1983), the Sixth Circuit instructed:

Accordingly, the proper criteria for defining a geographic market is that "area in which the seller operates, and to which the purchaser can practicably turn for supply." (Citing Tampa Elec., 365 U.S. at 327.) While that area is not ordinarily susceptible to a "metes and bounds definition," it is the area in which "producers effectively compete." Id.

In Apani Southwest, Inc. v. Coca-Cola Enterprises, 300 F.3d 620, 625 (5th Cir. 2002). the Fifth Circuit explained the Supreme Court's analysis in Tampa:

When assessing whether an exclusive-dealing arrangement has the probable effect of substantially lessening competition, the Supreme Court has identified a three-part inquiry. Tampa Elec. First, the relevant product market must be identified by considering interchangeability and cross-elasticity of demand. Second, the relevant geographic market must be identified, "by careful selection of the market area in which the seller operates and to which the purchaser can practicably turn for supplies." Id. Finally, a plaintiff must show that the "competition foreclosed by the arrangement constitutes a 'substantial share of the relevant market.'" Id. That is, "the opportunities for other traders to enter into or remain in that market must be significantly limited." Id.

Products and Services
Innovation: helping customers meet their sustainability goals
A sustainable future requires a focus on products and services beneficial to customers.
Direct use of natural gasPeoples Gas is uniquely positioned when natural gas is used as a premium fuel for customers. Natural Gas has an extremely positive environmental profile, especially when used directly in appliances at customer homes. A typical home's carbon footprint can be reduced by as much as 4,000 pounds per year by adding a natural gas range, tankless water heater, furnace and clothes dryer to replace lower efficiency electric appliances. Peoples Gas is working with green-minded residential and business customers across Florida on ways to increase the retail use of natural gas as a way to reduce carbon emissions.
Alternative Fuel Vehicles



The companies of TECO Energy are leading advocates in the development and deployment of alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) - electric and natural gas. Our Tampa Electric and Peoples Gas websites, tampaelectric.com/ev and peoplesgas.com/ngv, help educate and provide resources to customers interested in electric and natural gas vehicles. The sites offer information about vehicles on the market, industry developments and our own Green Fleet of AFVs. The sites also cover issues of interest to AFV customers, including frequently asked questions and even a history of electric vehicles dating back to 1835. The enhanced websites add to a growing list of moves TECO Energy is making to support sustainable transportation.
Tampa Electric is committed to developing electric vehicle charging infrastructure. In 2014, the company launched free workplace charging for its team members and signed the Department of Energy's Workplace Charging Pledge - adding TECO Energy to a growing list of workplace partners providing accessible, affordable charging to their employees. Tampa Electric is also partnered with the Department of Energy Clean Cities Coalition and the Electric Drive Transportation Association. We find it exciting that electricity could be the new fuel for vehicles. With electric vehicles entering the market, we want to do our part to ensure a good experience for our customers.

Peoples Gas' involvement in Clean Cities and NGVAmerica is part of our commitment to expanding the use of natural gas vehicles and providing fueling infrastructure. Many businesses are looking to find ways to save on gasoline costs - after all, we've heard the recent predictions on what we should expect to pay at the pump. Commercial fleets are exceptionally good candidates to convert from diesel or gasoline to natural gas.
Renewable energy

Alongside LEGOLAND® Florida's Divisional Director Adrian Jones, Tampa Electric President Gordon Gillette places the final LEGO piece into the theme park's solar-powered globe, which was funded through Tampa Electric's Renewable Energy Program.
Traditional methods of electricity generation rely on fossil fuels, such as coal, oil and natural gas. Renewable energy is electricity produced from sources such as the sun, wind, biomass (plant material) and water.

Tampa Electric was the first investor-owned utility in Florida to offer a renewable energy program to its customers. In late 2000, Tampa Electric began its Renewable Energy program, which allows residential and business customers to choose to purchase renewable energy to offset their electric consumption by signing up for $5 blocks of renewable energy. For each block purchased, Tampa Electric will provide 200 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of renewable energy. Additionally, customers and organizations may purchase renewable energy to power events at a convention center, hotel, stadium or other location.




Conservation and Energy Efficiency
Tampa Electric has been a pioneer in energy conservation programs for customers. The company created  conservation programs in the late 1970s, before any federal or state energy conservation requirements. It also was the first investor-owned utility in Florida to offer a renewable energy program to its customers.
				
Since 1981, Tampa Electric has spent nearly $643 million to deliver cost-effective conservation programs to the marketplace. The Florida Public Service Commission allows the company to recover this investment through the conservation charge on customers' bills. These programs have reduced summer peak demand by 331 megawatts and winter peak demand by 723 megawatts, resulting in annual savings of more than 815 gigawatt-hours.
