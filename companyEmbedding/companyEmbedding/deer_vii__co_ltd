What are analysts saying about Verastem stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Verastem stock: 
1. Cann analysts commented, "Verastem announced today that scientific findings from two studies evaluating focal adhesion kinase (FAK) inhibition in preclinical models of pancreatic and breast cancer with the publication of two papers in the peer-reviewed journals PLoS One and Oncotarget. The company reported that these two published articles continue to validate its underlying thesis for ongoing clinical collaborations evaluating lead FAK inhibitor defactinib in combination with chemotherapeutic and leading immunotherapeutic agents in several difficult-to-treat cancers." (7/25/2017)
2. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Verastem, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing novel drugs that selectively target cancer stem cells. The company discovers, researches, and develops new medicines for the treatment of major cancers such as breast cancer. Verastem, Inc. is based in Cambridge, Massachusetts.   " (7/18/2017)
3. Cantor Fitzgerald analysts commented, "DYNAMO Follow-Up Data Coming Soon. VSTM will present follow-up data with duvelisib in double-refractory indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (iNHL) at the International Conference on Malignant Melanoma (ICML), commonly referred to as the Lugano Meeting" on June 15th. We think these data could provide support for duvelisib, should the long-term data prove to be durable. Rethinking Duvelisib. Duvelisib’s past history as a development candidate is potentially masking its true market opportunity, as the drug could be used in Imbruvica failures. We don’t view the outcome of the DUO trial as slam dunk", but we do think that the drug’s potential has been overshadowed by its previous history. The drug is being compared to Novartis’ (Not Covered) Arzerra (ofatumumab), and tested in a setting of relapsed/refractory CLL. Optionality with Defactinib. While duvelisib will be the key driver for the value expansion near term, in our view, VSTM is also continuing development of defactinib. Given the prior history of defactinib (COMMAND) it also appears to us that the clinical profile may not be recognized until additional data are in hand, particularly as some of the work is being conducted via investigator- sponsored trials (ISTs)." (5/11/2017)
4. HC Wainwright analysts commented, "According to management, the topline results from the Phase 3 DUO study of duvelisib (a PI3K-??/PI3K-?? inhibitor) for the treatment of relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) are expected around mid-year 2017. Recall, DUO is a 300-patient, randomized, controlled study comparing the use of duvelisib monotherapy to ofatumumab, an anti-CD20 antibody marketed as Arzerra by Novartis (NVS; not rated), for the treatment of CLL, with the primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS) and secondary endpoints that include overall response rate (ORR) and overall survival (OS). Based on results from earlier stage studies in CLL as well as the previously completed DYNAMO study in indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (iNHL), we believe that DUO is highly likely to meet its primary PFS endpoint. Furthermore, while many investors have doubts regarding duvelisib's commercial outlook in the competitive CLL indication, we believe that, even with less-than-stellar results from DUO, the drug has the potential to capture a material portion of the highly lucrative market for 2nd/3rd-line CLL treatments. Therefore, we expect positive results from the DUO study to be a significant catalyst for the company. Based on our analysis of duvelisib's commercial potential, we are increasing our price target to $6.50 per diluted share, up from $5.00." (3/24/2017)

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer

25

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).
