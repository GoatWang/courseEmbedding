Comment::We bought this bike for our daughter for her 8th birthday. She is about to turn 14. It has been through 2 of our girls. We just gave it to some friends of ours for their eight year old daughter. It is still in great shape. Other than regular annual maintenance and adjustments, we've had to do nothing to the bike. It has held up really well. I would recommend it to anyone!
