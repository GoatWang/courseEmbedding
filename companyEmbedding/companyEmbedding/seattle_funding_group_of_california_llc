BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.
                    





Out of Business









                        BBB reports on a company that is out of business for three years from the date the company closes its doors or ceases to do business.
                    





Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.
                    





Mail Returned









                        BBB reports when mail sent to the business was returned by the Postal Service.

                        The Customer Review Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive,
                        neutral, and negative reviews posted.

                        IncFile.com, LLC has received 4.7 out of 5 stars based on 14 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

“Best service and speed of funding we've had in a long time. Thanks and we hope to have another transaction for you soon.”Jeff MeierhoferThe Madison Group“My experience as a commercial real estate broker has demonstrated that finding a willing buyer and seller is only half the challenge, obtaining the financing that glues the deal together is the other half. Seattle Funding Group provided the service and flexibility that kept all the parties at the table.”Dan StutzCB Richard Ellis“As a broker, I called Seattle Funding Group first because I heard they are the quickest lender around that can get almost anything done fast, and they definitely did that for us. The same day I called, they came out to my client's properties and approved them both the same day. None of the other lenders came close in respect to time or customer service as SFG.”Jared EkdahlGuaranty Mortgage“When our clients need results, the team at Seattle Funding Group is simply the best in the business, bar none.”Peter NisbetMarcus & Millichap“I have referred many customers to Seattle Funding Group over the last 10 years.

And because they have no prepay penalty, I don't have to hide from my borrowers when they ask me for a refinance.”Anthony R. OwensPortia Financial Services“Not surprisingly, my customer wanted no prepayment penalty on his $450,000 equity loan. After another broker had worked on it for two months with no success, we took it to Seattle Funding Group. They closed the deal, with no prepayment penalty, inside of a week.”Michael HoveyMortgage Master“The underwriters at Seattle Funding Group are real deal makers. They delivered exactly as promised, on time, and without hassles. I'd use them again and again and again.”Mike ReedWashington Home Mortgage“It is always great doing business with someone that is available as Seattle Funding Group Vice President Kent Rowe has been.

We appreciate all you did and look forward to working together in the future.”Philip JemmettJemm Investments, LLC“Because of you... 6 JayMarc employees have stopped collecting unemployment. 14 families will move into a new home this year. 26 contractors and vendors are growing their businesses. 100+ tradesmen are now diligently building JayMarc houses instead of home waiting by the phone. 1 idea, with your support, is changing lives. Thank you for financing JayMarc Homes, you are making a difference.”The JayMarc FamilyJayMarc Homes“I would like to thank you and your team for the professionalism shown when working with our client and the expediency at which your firm approved and closed the loan.

    Construction Loans  

When it comes to construction financing, a quick closing can mean the difference between a profitable project built on time and under budget or another lost opportunity. Given the risk that comes with rapidly changing market conditions, Seattle Funding Group’s deal certainty can be a game changer for the experienced builder. While banks are still in loan committee, SFG’s construction borrowers are out of the ground and on their first or second draw. SFG’s construction loan program is the fastest, simplest financing of its kind in the market today.
SFG’s Construction Department is managed by Jim McBride, a construction professional who has been with SFG since 2001. Prior to the close of a construction loan, Jim works closely with the applicant/owner/builder to analyze the essential elements of the project, including the budget, plans, specs, permit status, site conditions, GC and the construction team. After close, Jim continues to work closely with the builder throughout the construction process, up to the point of completion. Jim’s experience, dedication and focus are a tremendous value add for SFG and builders alike. Our many long-term construction relationships and repeat opportunities stem from Jim’s commitment to a quality experience and result for all involved.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
