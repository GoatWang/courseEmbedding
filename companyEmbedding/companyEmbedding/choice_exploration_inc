Company Overview: Choice Exploration 




You Are Here: O&G Directory >> Choice Exploration



 
	 





		
		Choice Exploration Inc. is active in all phases of upstream production. Our ability to generate a prospect from over 2,700 square miles of 3-D Seismic data and targeting a specific core area improves our ability to create an enhanced rate of return from Oil and Natural Gas exploration. 
Choice Exploration was formed in 1997 as a Texas Corporation. Currently, Choice is utilizing the latest 3-D seismic imaging technology to prospect its core area in Texas and Louisiana. 
This science aids in targeting oil and gas reserves and limiting waste of time and capital expenditures as well as identifying new trends and generating potentially larger prospects.
Our capability to generate a prospect, acquire the minerals and land, engineer and operate the well and disperse revenue, maximizes our ability to produce an enhanced return on investment to our partners.
Our expansion plan is to develop domestic reserves through a mixture of acquisition and drilling in development and core areas. Our commitment is to fuel your success with knowledge and integrity.
