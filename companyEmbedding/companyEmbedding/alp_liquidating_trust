ARTICLE I.
 
                                
THE TRUST
 
     1.1     TRUST NAME.
  The trust created
hereby shall be known as the ALP
Liquidating Trust, in which name the
Administrator may conduct the business
of the Trust, make and execute contracts,
and sue and be sued.
 
     1.2     DELAWARE STATUTORY
TRUST STATUS.   It is
the intention of the
parties hereto that the Trust created
hereby constitute a statutory trust
under Chapter 38 of Title 12 of the
Delaware Code, 12 DEL. C. Section
3801, ET SEQ., as amended from time to time
(as so amended, the "Trust
Act"), and that this document constitute
the governing instrument of the
Trust.   The Resident Trustee is hereby
authorized and directed to execute
and file a certificate of trust with the
Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware in substantially the form attached
hereto as EXHIBIT A.
 
     1.3     GRANTOR TRUST STATUS.
  The Trust is intended
to be a
liquidating trust within the meaning of
United States Treasury Department
Regulation Section 301.7701-4(d) that is
treated as a   grantor
trust, of
which the Beneficiaries are the owners,
within the meaning of Section 671
ET SEQ. of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended, and shall be
construed accordingly.
 
     1.4     TRANSFER TO TRUST.
  On the effective date
hereof, the
Partnership shall transfer and deposit into
the Trust all assets then owned
by the Partnership, including all of its
cash and cash equivalent
investments for the purposes set forth
herein. Such deposit, together with
any income thereon and any other assets of
the Trust, shall constitute the
"Trust Property."
 
     1.5     PAYMENT OF
LIABILITIES.
 
      (a)
   The Partnership
hereby assigns to the Trust and the Trust
hereby assumes all remaining liabilities
and claims against (including
contingent, conditional or unmatured
liabilities and expenses) or
obligations of the Partnership.
  Should any liability
be asserted against
the Trust as a result of the assumption of
any liability pursuant to this
Section 1.5, the Administrator may use such
part of the Trust Property as
may be necessary in contesting any such
liability or in payment thereof.
 
      (b)
   Pursuant to
Section 17-804(b) of the Act, all claims against
and obligations of the Partnership shall be
paid in full and any such
provision for payment shall be made in full
if there is sufficient Trust
Property in the Trust.   If there is insufficient Trust
Property in the
Trust, such claims against or obligations
of the Partnership shall be paid
or provided for according to their priority
and, among claims against or
obligations of the Partnership of equal
priority, ratably to the extent of
Trust Property legally available
therefor.
 
 
                            
    ARTICLE
II.
 
                              
BENEFICIARIES
 
     2.1     FORMER PARTNERS AS
BENEFICIARIES.   The
General Partner, the
Associate Limited Partners (as defined
below) and the registered owners of
the other limited partner interests in the
Partnership, whether limited
partners or assignees (the "Public Limited
Partners"), set forth in the
books and records of the Partnership as of
10:00 a.m. Eastern Standard Time
on the date of this Trust Agreement (the
"Effective Time") shall
automatically, and without any action being
required of such persons or
entities, be the initial beneficial owners
(each, a "Beneficiary" and
collectively, the "Beneficiaries") of the
Trust.   Each of the
Public
Limited Partners shall receive the same
number of Beneficial Interest Units

<PAGE>
 
 
as limited partner interests, or assignee
interests therein, that such
Beneficiary owned in the Partnership as of
the Effective Time; and the
General Partner shall receive 4,488
Beneficial Interest Units and
Arvida/JMB Limited Partnership and
Arvida/JMB Associates (collectively, the
"Associate Limited Partners") shall receive
4,533 Beneficial Interest Units
and 35,858 Beneficial Interest Units,
respectively (the Beneficial Interest
Units issued to the General Partner and the
Associate Limited Partners, as
a percentage of the total Beneficial
Interest Units outstanding on the date
of initial issuance, being equal to the
aggregate percentage interest (10%)
held by such parties in the Partnership).
  All such Beneficiaries
shall be
bound by the terms and provisions of this
Trust Agreement.   For
purposes of
this Trust Agreement, "Beneficial Interest
Units" shall mean equal units of
the undivided beneficial interest (as
provided in this Trust Agreement) of
the Beneficiaries in the Trust Property.
  The rights of
Beneficiaries in,
to and under the Trust Property and the
Trust shall not be represented by
any form of certificate or other
instrument, and no Beneficiary shall be
entitled to such a certificate.
 
     2.2     RECORD OF
BENEFICIARIES.   The
Administrator shall keep or cause
to be kept books and records and maintain a
register in which the
Administrator shall record the names of
each Beneficiary, the number of
Beneficial Interest Units owned by such
Beneficiary, and transfers of
Beneficial Interest Units as provided
herein.
 
     2.3     TRANSFER OF BENEFICIAL
INTEREST UNITS.  
Beneficial Interest
Units may not be transferred in any manner
whatsoever (including, without
limitation, by sale, exchange, gift, pledge
or creation of a security
interest) except (a) by bequest or
inheritance in the case of an individual
Beneficiary; or (b) by operation of law;
provided, however, that the
executor or administrator of the estate of
a Beneficiary may mortgage,
pledge, grant a security interest in,
hypothecate or otherwise encumber,
the Beneficial Interest Units held by the
estate of such Beneficiary if
necessary in order to borrow money to pay
estate, succession or inheritance
taxes or the expenses of administering the
estate of the Beneficiary, upon
written notice to and upon written consent
of the Administrator; or (c)
with the prior written consent of the
Administrator, to an Affiliate of the
Beneficiary holding the Beneficial Interest
Units.   Except as may
be
otherwise required by law, the Beneficial
Interest Units of the
Beneficiaries hereunder shall not be
subject to attachment, execution,
sequestration or any order of a court, nor
shall such interests be subject
to the contracts, debts, obligations,
engagements or liabilities of any
Beneficiary, but the interest of a
Beneficiary shall be paid by the
Administrator to the Beneficiary free and
clear of all assignments,
attachments, anticipations, levies,
executions, decrees and sequestrations
and shall become the property of the
Beneficiary only when actually
received by the Beneficiary.   For purposes of this Agreement,
with respect
to the specified person, "Affiliate" shall
mean (i) any person or entity
that directly or indirectly through one or
more intermediaries controls or
is controlled by or is under common control
with the specified person or
entity, (ii) any person or entity that is
an officer or director of,
partner in or trustee of, or serves in a
similar capacity with respect to,
the specified person or entity or of which
the specified person or entity
is an officer,   partner or trustee, or with
respect to which the specified
person or entity served in a similar
capacity, (iii) any person or entity
that, directly or indirectly, is the
beneficial owner of 10% or more of any
class of voting securities of, or otherwise
has a substantial beneficial
interest in, the specified person or entity
or of which the specified
person or entity is directly or indirectly
the owner of 10% or more of any
class of voting securities or in which the
specified person or entity has a
substantial beneficial interest and (iv)
any relative or spouse of the
specified person.   An Affiliate of a specified person
or entity does not
include a person or entity that is a
partner in a partnership or joint
venture with the specified person or entity
or with any other Affiliate of
the specified person or entity if such
person or entity is not otherwise an
Affiliate of the specified person or
entity.

Interest Units.   Each
Beneficiary
shall take and hold the same subject to all
the terms and provisions of
this Agreement.   The interest of each Beneficiary
hereunder is declared,
and shall be in all respects, personal
property and upon the death of an
individual Beneficiary, the Beneficiary's
Beneficial Interest Units shall
pass as personal property to the
Beneficiary's legal representative and
such death shall in no way terminate or
affect the validity of this
Agreement.   A Beneficiary shall have no title
to, right to, possession of,
management of, or control of, the Trust
Property except as expressly
provided herein.   No widower, widow, heir or devisee
of any person who may
be a Beneficiary shall have any right of
dower, homestead, or inheritance,
or of partition, or of any other right,
statutory or otherwise, in any
property forming a part of the Trust
Property but the whole title to all
the Trust Property shall be vested in the
Administrator and the sole
interest of the Beneficiaries shall be the
rights and benefits given to
such persons under this Agreement.
 
 
                              
ARTICLE III.
 
            
PURPOSE, LIMITATIONS; DISTRIBUTIONS AND DURATION
 
     3.1     PURPOSE OF TRUST.
  This Trust is
established for the sole
purpose of holding the Trust Property on
behalf of the Beneficiaries,
enforcing the rights of the Beneficiaries
thereto, collecting the income
thereon, determining, defending against and
satisfying any claims against
and liabilities of the Partnership
(including identification and
satisfaction of claims against or
obligations of the Partnership in
accordance with the Act), asserting any
rights or claims of the Partnership
that may pertain to the Trust Property or
the Partnership's former business
activities, selling or otherwise disposing
of the remaining Trust property,
distributing the remaining Trust Property
to the Beneficiaries, and taking
such other action as is necessary to
conserve and protect the Trust
Property and to provide for the orderly
investment, conservation, sale,
liquidation and distribution of any and all
of the Trust Property after the
payment of expenses and liabilities, and
the making of reasonable provision
for claims and contingent, conditional or
unmatured liabilities.  
Under no
circumstances shall the Trust or the
Administrator on behalf of the Trust
have any power to cause the Trust to
continue or engage in any trade or
other business, and this limitation shall
apply irrespective of whether the
conduct of any business activities is
deemed by the Administrator to be
convenient, desirable, necessary or proper
for the conservation and
protection of the Trust Property.
 
     3.2     OPERATION OF TRUST.
  The Administrator, on
behalf of the Trust,
shall receive and hold all the Trust
Property and shall make payments from
the Trust to claimants in accordance with
Section 1.5 of this Trust
Agreement.   Other than as set forth in Section
3.4 below, no payments shall
be made to the Beneficiaries until all
claims against or obligations of the
Partnership and the Trust have been paid or
otherwise provided for to the
extent required by law.   Once all such claims and
obligations have been
paid, or otherwise provided for, the
balance of the Trust Property shall
then be distributed to the Beneficiaries in
accordance with Section 3.4
hereof as promptly as reasonably possible
by the Administrator with a view
to not unduly prolonging the duration of
the Trust; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
no distribution shall be made to the
Beneficiaries without first reasonably
satisfying or adequately providing a
reserve for the reasonable expenses
incurred or to be incurred by, or on behalf
of, the Trust.   In
addition,
the Administrator may, subject to the
proviso in the preceding sentence,
distribute any of the Trust Property to the
Beneficiaries in-kind.  
The
Administrator shall take such action as it
deems appropriate to enforce the
rights of the Trust to the Trust Property
so that the Beneficiaries may
receive the full benefit thereof.

<PAGE>
 
 
     3.3     NO PAYMENT TO THE
PARTNERSHIP.   In no
event shall the
Administrator or the Trust distribute to
the dissolved Partnership any
Trust Property.
 
     3.4     DISTRIBUTIONS.
  At such times as may
be determined by it, the
Administrator shall distribute, or cause to
be distributed, to the
Beneficiaries, in proportion to the
respective interests of the
Beneficiaries in the Trust Property such
amounts as it determines
appropriate consistent with this Agreement;
provided, however, that the
Trust shall be permitted to retain
reasonable amounts of cash and property
to meet all claims against or obligations
of the Partnership and the Trust.
 
The Administrator shall make disposition of
all liquidating distributions
and other payments due any Beneficiaries
who have not been located, subject
to applicable state laws regarding escheat
and abandoned property.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, under no
circumstances shall the Trust, or the
Administrator on behalf of the Trust,
be required to make a distribution if such
distribution would violate
Section 17-804 of the Act or other
applicable law.   All
distributions to
the Beneficiaries hereunder shall be made
pro rata according to their
number of Beneficial Interest Units.
 
     3.5     FINAL DISTRIBUTION.
  If the Administrator
determines that all
claims, debts, liabilities and obligations
of the Trust and Partnership
have been paid or discharged, and all of
the assets of the Trust have been
reduced to cash, the Administrator shall,
as expeditiously as is consistent
with the conservation and protection of the
Trust Property, distribute the
remaining Trust Property to the
Beneficiaries of record on the close of
business on such record date as the
Administrator may determine, in
proportion to their interests therein.
  However, the Trust may
retain
installment obligations that are described
in Section 3.6 in order to
collect and distribute payments made with
respect to the installment
obligations.
 
     3.6     DURATION.   The existence of the Trust shall
terminate promptly
when all claims, debts, liabilities and
obligations of the Trust and
Partnership have been paid or discharged,
unless an earlier termination is
required by the applicable laws of the
State of Delaware, or unless earlier
terminated by the distribution of all of
the Trust Property as provided in
Section 3.5, or by failure to appoint a
successor Administrator as provided
in Section 7.2.   However, notwithstanding the
foregoing, if the Trust
receives installment obligations which
arose from the sale of property by
the Partnership prior to its liquidation,
the trust term may be extended,
solely with respect to those obligations,
for a period that is reasonably
necessary to collect and distribute
payments made with respect to the
obligations.

Definition
Accounts Receivable is money owed to a business by customers and shown on its Balance Sheet as an asset.

Explanation
1. Accounts Receivable are created when a customer has received a product but has not yet paid for that product. Days sales outstanding measures of the average number of days that a company takes to collect revenue after a sale has been made. It is a financial ratio that illustrates how well a company's accounts receivables are being managed.
ALP Liquidating Trust's Days Sales Outstanding for the quarter that ended in Mar. 2016 is calculated as:



Days Sales Outstanding


=Account Receivable/Revenue*Days in Period

=0/0*91


=



2. In Ben Grahams calculation of liquidation value, ALP Liquidating Trust's accounts receivable are only considered to be worth 75% of book value:
ALP Liquidating Trust's liquidation value for the quarter that ended in Mar. 2016 is calculated as:



Liquidation value


=Cash and Cash Equivalents-Total Liabilities+(0.75 * Account Receivable)+(0.5 * Inventory)


=12.881-1.461+0.75 * 0+0.5 * 0


=11.42



* All numbers are in millions except for per share data and ratio. All numbers are in their local exchange's currency.

Be Aware
Net receivables tells us a great deal about the different competitors in the same industry. In competitive industries, some attempt to gain advantage by offering better credit terms, causing increase in sales and receivables.
If company consistently shows lower % Net receivables to gross sales than competitors, then it usually has some kind of competitive advantage which requires further digging.
Average Days Sales Outstanding is a good indicator for measuring a companys sales channel and customers. A company may book great revenue and earnings growth but never receive payment from their customers. This may force a write-off in the future and depress future earnings.
