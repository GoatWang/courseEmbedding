DP&L Will Pay You to Recycle Your Refrigerator- You Continue Saving and Help Protect the Environment


Email
Tweet
Facebook
LinkedIn





	Dayton, Ohio – June 29, 2015 - Dayton Power and Light (DP&L), a subsidiary of The AES Corporation (NYSE: AES), is announcing it has recycled 18,000 refrigerators and freezers since beginning its appliance recycling program in 2009, saving customers $11.7 million in energy costs.

	The program pays customers $50 to have their old inefficient working refrigerator or freezer picked up for free. Almost 100% of the materials are recycled, helping to protect the environment and avoiding filling up landfills. Replacing an inefficient refrigerator that uses three times the amount of energy as a newer model can have the impact of taking up to two cars off the road for a year.

	In addition, customers can save up to $150 in energy costs annually by using a more energy efficient appliance that meets current energy standards. A 20-year-old refrigerator can use 1,200 kilowatt hours annually while a new high energy efficient model uses 400-500 kilowatt hours annually.

	The appliance recycling program is part of DP&L’s ongoing Energy Efficiency efforts to help customers save money through rebates for reducing energy costs by installing higher energy efficiency heating and air conditioning equipment, and for discounts for purchasing high efficiency lighting products at participating retailers. 

	For more information about recycling your appliance or to schedule a pick-up, visit our website.

Google Trusted Store Customer RatingsHave brought many items for LG Medical since 2012 and never had an issue. Service is always great and the products are excellent quality for a great price. If you have a question and call they are knowledgeable about their products plus the LG web site has many videos and tip. I will continue to buy from LG Medical as I feel the are one of the best in their field. DMD- Written on June 17, 2016 READ MORE REVIEWSA family member ordered from LGMedSupply in the past and had great service, and that is why I felt safe ordering from them. And they didn't let me down. I got exactly what I ordered and it got to me when it was supposed to so that is why I gave them the top rating.- Written on July 19, 2016 READ MORE REVIEWSGreat product, Great Shipping, Great Customer service. AAA+++- Written on July 17, 2016 READ MORE REVIEWS I was very happy with the service that I got from the staff at LG Med Supply. I looked all over the net for over a year to see who was the main Co. that had not only what I needed but who was the Co. that seemed to be the main Manufacturer of the Tens Unit. Then I started checking who had all of the Conductive Designed Pads That my Dr. wanted me to have and here again LG Med Supply had all of the items and were offering the best prices on all of the items that I needed. LG Med Supply was hands down the best in all of the categories as far as who had all of the items that I needed from the Back Belt Strap/Neck electrode/Shoulder and Knee Conductive Designed Pads that my Dr. wanted me to start therapy with. LG Med Supply is the only web site that had a vast selection of different shaped Electrodes which deliver a totally different stimulation that really gives you a completely different feeling then a straight square pad electrode. Thank You LG Med Supply for being there in my time of need. Carter- Written on January 22, 2016 READ MORE REVIEWSI ORDERED MY TENS / EMS UNIT PREVIOUSLY FROM LG MED SUPPLY, MAKING ME A RETURN CUSTOMER. THE SALES PERSON WAS POLITE AND VERY HELPFUL.
