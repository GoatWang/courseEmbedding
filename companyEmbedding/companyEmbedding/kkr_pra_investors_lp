Combined Organization Strengthens Capabilities and Geographical

      Presence

 RALEIGH, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--

      PRA International ("PRA"), a leading clinical research organization,

      today announced the completion of its merger with ReSearch

      Pharmaceutical Services ("RPS") and the closing of the acquisition by

      Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co L.P. (together with its affiliates, "KKR").

      The combination of PRA and RPS creates the fourth largest contract

      research organization ("CRO"), offering an enhanced array of services

      and capabilities to support its clients.

    


      Going forward, RPS will operate as PRA's Strategic Solutions Division

      and the combined enterprise will be led by PRA's CEO Colin Shannon.

      Former RPS CEO Harris Koffer and President Samir Shah have been named

      President and COO of the Strategic Solutions Division, respectively.

    

Colin Shannon, President and CEO of PRA said, "As we join forces with

      the team at RPS, this begins a new chapter for both organizations. We

      have a supportive long-term partner in KKR and the combination with RPS

      makes PRA a stronger organization, offering our customers a more

      comprehensive range of services through our expanded capabilities and

      therapeutic expertise. As a division of PRA, the RPS Strategic Solutions

      Division will continue to operate as RPS has previously, which should

      enable a seamless integration with absolutely no disruption for our

      clients."

    

Harris Koffer added: "We are excited about joining the PRA family and

      leveraging the enhanced capabilities of the combined company to deliver

      greater value and innovation for our clients and employees."

    


      Since 2000, PRA has performed approximately 2,000 clinical trials in

      over 80 countries on behalf of over 300 clients. RPS is known throughout

      the industry as the pioneer of the Embedded clinical development model,

      with an established presence in North America and EMEA and specialized

      capabilities in Latin America and Asia. RPS has more than 4,000

      employees located in over 64 countries. As a result of the merger, PRA

      will have nearly 10,000 employees with operations and resources in 80

      countries across North and South America, Europe, Africa, and Asia

      Pacific, offering a full suite of services — both Embedded and

      programmatic — for its clients.

    

About PRA



      PRA is transforming clinical trials through our people, innovation and

      transparency. PRA provides personalized service customized to the unique

      requirements of each study. We support our global reach and innovative

      approach through flexible and reliable service, delivered by skilled

      employees dedicated to ensuring that sponsors achieve their long-term

      goals.

    


      We serve our clients across all phases of biopharmaceutical drug

      development by combining therapeutic and operational expertise with

      local knowledge. Offering services in 80+ countries and serving sponsors

      for 35+ years, we have amassed a level of expertise that enables us to

      work on a variety of compounds, ranging from niche treatments and

      therapies to blockbuster drugs. But at PRA, we are looking to the

      future, not the past. Our increasingly forward-thinking approach to

      transforming the clinical trial landscape continues to make a difference

      to healthcare patients around the world.
