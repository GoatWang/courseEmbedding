WisBusiness.com: Forward Development Group: Construction of Kettle Park West Commercial Center to begin




































Forward Development Group: Construction of Kettle Park West Commercial Center to begin
    
      8/31/2015

CONSTRUCTION OF KETTLE PARK WEST COMMERCIAL CENTER TO BEGIN


VERONA, Wis.  August 28, 2015  Verona-based Forward Development Group today announced the successful completion of the real estate transactions necessary to launch the Kettle Park West Commercial Center, a long-planned development in the City of Stoughton.    

The Kettle Park West Commercial Center is the cornerstone of the planned mixed-use neighborhood located on the citys west side at the intersection of US Highway 51 and State Highway 138.  

With todays real estate closing, we have satisfied all of the conditions in the development agreement with the city, allowing the project to move forward, said Dennis Steinkraus, development manager at Forward Development Group. Construction of the streets and utilities for the new development will begin in September and is expected to be completed by the end of 2016. 

The project is anchored by a 152,000 square foot Walmart Supercenter. The first phase of the project also features a Kwik Trip gas station/convenience store and new offices for McFarland State Bank. A fourth lot has been sold to a retail developer with plans to construct a 10,000 square-foot multi-tenant building. More details are expected to be announced in the coming months. Upon completion, the first phase of development is anticipated to generate approximately $34 million of new tax base for the City of Stoughton. 
 
This new development will help fulfill our goal of providing jobs, goods and services for the citizens of Stoughton, said Donna Olson, mayor of the City of Stoughton. 
 
The City of Stoughton is providing approximately $4.5M of Tax Incremental Financing to cover the cost of the necessary public infrastructure. Financing for the private development is being provided by McFarland State Bank.

It is a pleasure to be involved in a project that benefits the City of Stoughton and all of its citizens, said David Locke, Chairman and CEO of McFarland State Bank.
 
Future phases of development for the surrounding 200+ acre neighborhood will include an office park, town center, a diverse mix of housing opportunities and more than 30 acres of restored wetland habitat.

Forward Development Group, a full-service real estate development company founded by several seasoned real estate professionals, started planning for Kettle Park West in 2009.

New Developer Assumes Lease for UW Plaza
November 15, 2013
A Casper-based development company has purchased a
University of Wyoming ground lease and aims to revitalize a retail development
on the east end of the UW campus, the UW Board of Trustees was told today
(Friday).
Forward Development LLC, whose principal owner is
Casper businessman Mick McMurry, purchased the lease for the UW Plaza from Beta
Properties, the entity created by the Bank of Colorado to hold the lease when
Grand Avenue Land Partners, the previous developer, defaulted on the lease.
“This is great for the community and great for UW,”
says Vice President and General Counsel Rick Miller. “We now have a developer
who will aggressively pursue improvements on the property’s vacant lots.”
UW is amending the ground lease as a condition of
the purchase to make the arrangement more suitable for development, Miller
says.
The UW Plaza, development of which began in 2005,
serves as a prominent entry to the UW campus. It’s intended to provide economic
and aesthetic benefits, boost essential community services, and enhance visitor
and tourist experiences.
The 9-acre development’s current tenants include
restaurants and retail businesses. There is potential for additional retail and
restaurant development, as well as business and professional offices.
The media contact for Forward Development LLC is
Dick Bratton, (307) 234-0583, dbratton@mcmurry.net.

FOR RELEASE Tuesday, May 12, 2015

	Place matters in economic success

http://www.thenewsenterprise.com/content/place-matters-economic-success

	When I moved to Elizabethtown in the 1970s, I immediately felt connected to this community. I saw right away that this was a place with so much to offer, all driven by people who truly cared.

	I still recall when my child's principal knew who I was and where I worked even though we had never met. I was blown away, but that's just the sort of thing that turns a city into a quality community.

	Our landscape has changed in the last 40 years, but that quality of place still holds true. In fact, it is part of the reason four of my five children chose to stay here to build careers and raise families.

	Another testament to the importance of our quality of place is one of Central Kentucky's newest companies, Atlas Development Group. This business grew not only from its founders' passion for their work - engineering in the firearms industry - but also from a love of their home.

	ADG CEO Brent Jarboe and others formed the company when their employer decided to leave Elizabethtown and consolidate operations elsewhere. They had the option of following their jobs to another state, but they couldn't imagine packing up and moving.

	"It was a good company," Jarboe said of his former employer, Remington Arms. "Unfortunately, it just left the place we call home."

	Jarboe and the other founders combined more than a century of experience when they formed ADG. Their goal is to become a Kentucky-based consultant and manufacturer of firearms and ammunition components for military and recreational use worldwide.

	While they have the know-how and experience to develop their products and services, they knew very little about launching a business.

	"We're engineers. We're pretty smart guys. But from a business perspective, dealing with a lending institution, for example, is not something we did on a daily basis," Jarboe said.

	ADG reached out to Rick Games, president and chief operating officer of the Elizabethtown-Hardin County Industrial Foundation. With extensive knowledge of business resources throughout the state, Games put the engineers in touch with professionals from the Cabinet for Economic Development and the Small Business Development Center in Elizabethtown.

	The SBDC helped the team with business planning. The Cabinet for Economic Development offered support through the Kentucky Small Business Credit Initiative, leading to a loan from First Citizens Bank of Elizabethtown, which helped ADG move forward. ADG also received a low-interest loan through the Lincoln Trail Area Development District based on the company creating jobs in the area.

	In addition, the industrial foundation provided office space for the company at its incubator.

	"We want to help ADG become successful," Games said. "Retaining that talent is the right thing for the industrial foundation, the other supporting organizations and our overall community."

	The company also is working with the Elizabethtown office of the Kentucky Innovation Network, which offers a number of other small business resources.

	ADG has ordered manufacturing equipment and plans to move into its own facility by the end of the year. It also plans to hire 18 additional employees.

	ADG's story absolutely showcases what we're doing right to attract entrepreneurship. At the local, regional and state level, I'm proud of the support offered to encourage innovation and investment.

	Still, it's more than business resources. I'm thrilled about ADG's founders' desire to stay in Kentucky. While mostly Kentucky natives, two ADG founders had followed Remington Arms from other states and they now call Elizabethtown home.

	Central Kentucky offers such a high quality of life - from the low cost of living to our wonderful schools and churches to our excellent regional healthcare system. And our strong sense of community only makes our roots here stronger.

	That sense of community came up at the recent ribbon cutting and expansion announcement at Hendrickson in Elizabethtown. Company leaders said they always have felt welcome here. And the high level of local involvement - from business resources to the crowd at the recent ribbon cutting - reinforces their decision to invest in our area.

	That's a result of the hard work of our economic development, business and education partners and our workforce. But I have no doubt that kind of praise also is a reflection of an entire community.

	Edna Berger is mayor of Elizabethtown and a member of the Lincoln Trail Workforce Investment Board.

FOR RELEASE Saturday, March 28, 2015

	New firearms firm gets state support

http://www.thenewsenterprise.com/content/new-firearms-firm-gets-state-support

	A firearms and ammunition product development company based in Elizabethtown will receive $315,000 in state incentives for creating up to 18 jobs. Including benefits, the jobs are expected to earn an average of $32 an hour, according to the state.

	The proposal from Atlas Development Group described its $2.9 million investment to produce ammunition cartridge cases.

	Atlas, which formed in January, is headed by Brent Jarboe and operates with much of the same leadership formerly directing the Remington Arms Research and Development Technical Center in Elizabethtown.

	The incentive package was one of 14 approved Thursday during a meeting of the Kentucky Economic Development Finance Authority's board.

	Former Remington employees launch new company

Planning began after relocation announcement
	By Anna Taylor

http://www.thenewsenterprise.com/content/former-remington-employees-launch-new-company

	A new firearms and ammunition product development company is preparing to launch in Elizabethtown under much of the same leadership as Remington Arms Company Research and Development Technical Center on Ring Road.

	Atlas Development Group LLC officially announced its launch of operations Monday.

	According to CEO Brent Jarboe, the company initially will focus on providing firearms and ammunition industry consulting, technology development and original equipment manufacturing.

	Atlas currently is comprised of five former Remington engineering professionals, representing more than 110 years of combined industry experience. These individuals were largely responsible for the engineering and product development success of Remington Defense products in recent years, according to a news release.

	The founding members voluntarily separated their employment Friday from Remington to launch Atlas.

	Jarboe said two more employees are expected to join in July and by the 18-month mark, they hope to grow the company to 20-30 more employees in manufacturing.

	Jarboe said when Remington announced in February 2014 it would be moving its operations to Huntsville, Alabama, he knew relocating was not in his future.

	"Being a native Kentuckian with pretty deep roots in the area, relocating wasn't an option for me," Jarboe said.

	Jarboe and his team members have been planning for Atlas with weekly meetings since February.

	"There were others in a similar situation and I approached them with an idea," he said.

	Jarboe has more than 20 years of industry experience with 19 years credited to Remington. He said if Remington never announced plans to relocate, he likely would have retired from the company.

	"I have a lot of passion for it and decided I wanted to continue working in (the industry)," he said.

	Although Remington never announced an official date for its final transition to Huntsville, Jarboe said he predicts it to be completely relocated by the end of the year.

	Atlas launched this month because Jarboe said the team wanted to be separate from Remington during a big industry trade show known as SHOT from Jan. 20-23.

	The company is planning to network with potential clients at the trade show in Las Vegas, Nevada.

	Atlas consulting services plans to offer a full range of product development expertise including design vetting, mechanical design and engineering, industrial design, materials and coating engineering, product testing and manufacturing implementation. OEM products are offered to select clients with a high degree of anonymity, the release states.

	With its more than 110 years of industry experienced combined across employees, the new company is made up of a strong team, Jarboe said.

	"Each one of us has a particular skill set," he said. "...We're people who have taken designs from paper to the selling point."

	The idea for Atlas is for everyone to continue what they have been doing at Remington, just on a smaller scale at first.

	In 18 months, Jarboe said the company would like to have its own branded products and in-house designs.

	"This will be our opportunity to put some of our designs and ideas into something," he said.

	The business currently is operating out of the Elizabethtown Industrial Foundation building and will move to Suite 150 of the new EIF building at 233 Ring Road in February.

	The company website, >www.atlasdg.com, will be fully operational prior to SHOT.

	Jarboe said everyone at Atlas has maintained a great relationship with Remington and they have been "refreshingly encouraging."

	"Unfortunately, geography is going to prevent us from continuing with them," he said. "... It's a bittersweet day. None of us wish them any ill will at all."

	Jarboe said they have offered Remington to be their first customer if they need something done.

	"We know where our roots are," he said. "It's unfortunate, but in the end, it's business."

	Anna Taylor can be reached at 270-505-1747 or ataylor@thenewsenterprise.com.

Inventors

Using our Creative Design Process, we work with our customers to take a project from a concept, through brainstorming, prototyping, engineering, and up to the point of handing it off for production.
 
We offer a 2-hour Inventors Consultation for $585. This one-on-one meeting is tailored to suit the needs of your project. We typically provide “devil’s advocate” evaluation of the idea in terms of feasibility and cost, and often use some of the time for sketching and brainstorming. We also try to answer your questions regarding patents, business models, licensing, the product development process, manufacturing, etc.

Using our Creative Design Process, we work with our customers to take a project from a concept, through brainstorming, prototyping, engineering, and up to the point of handing it off for production.
 
We offer a 2-hour Inventors Consultation for $585. This one-on-one meeting is tailored to suit the needs of your project. We typically provide “devil’s advocate” evaluation of the idea in terms of feasibility and cost, and often use some of the time for sketching and brainstorming. We also try to answer your questions regarding patents, business models, licensing, the product development process, manufacturing, etc.

More Videos












100% ONSHORE

30-50% Less Expensive
Thanks to our lean operations and onshore remote model you get senior software professionals at a significant discount over our competitors.

Why wait 60-90 days to find a senior software engineer when Surge can provide the best onshore talent in 1-2 weeks.









Top 2% Of Software Engineers
We have incredibly high standards. Our proprietary hiring process means that only 2% pass our rigorous evaluation and live coding process. Hiring great engineers is expensive and time consuming, let Surge do it for you. 











Full "agile-scrum"
Not just great developers but we also offer full scrum teams that include ui/ux designers, business analysts, qa/testers (manual and automated), devops, db admins, and certified scrum masters.









White Glove Treatment
