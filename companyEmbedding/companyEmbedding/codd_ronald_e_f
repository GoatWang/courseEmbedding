FireEye expands board with former PeopleSoft, Inc. CFO and SVP finance and administration

"I have been very impressed with FireEye's trajectory over the

  president and chief executive officer of McAfee, Inc., and William M.

  leadership on the board will be invaluable and we look forward to his
  acute advisement."Visit www.fireeye.com for more
