Risk Management


Each of us encounter risks throughout our lives, and most losses can be emotionally and financially devastating. If there is a possibility of loss, it is important to protect yourself with the proper risk management strategies.
Our risk management process begins with a thorough review of your potential risk exposures. After analyzing your needs, our advisors will recommend the proper amount of coverage and the product type to best fit your needs. Whether you are concerned with outliving your savings, an untimely disability or death, comprehensive healthcare or a catastrophic loss, we will work with you to find a suitable strategy.

Lifetime Income Annuities


If you are like most retirees, you may have concerns about outliving your money. Many retirees have fixed income sources such as pensions and entitlements. These sources of income may not cover all of your expenses. Many retires want to have their essential expenses covered by a steady stream of income. Various types of annuities are available to provide a dependable source of fixed income:

Immediate Annuities
Deferred Fixed/Indexed Annuities
Deferred Variable Annuities

Annuities are long-term investment vehicles designed for retirement purposes. Gains from tax-deferred investments are taxable as ordinary income upon withdrawal. Guarantees are based on the claims paying ability of the issuing company. Withdrawals made prior to age 59½ are subject to a 10% IRS penalty tax and surrender charges may apply.

 Immediate Annuities


Immediate Annuities allow you to invest a lump sum and receive an income for one or two lives. To protect your beneficiaries, the income can also be paid for a period certain. When investing in an immediate annuity, you lose control of your money, but you will receive the largest income stream of any annuity product available.

 Deferred Fixed Annuities


Deferred Fixed Annuities allow you to invest a lump sum and defer your investment and income. As you wait, your balance grows at a fixed rate of return. Over time, your potential lifetime income grows, and you can elect can elect single or spousal income options. Unlike immediate annuities, you own the account balance and have the ability to name your beneficiaries.

 Deferred Variable Annuities


Deferred Variable Annuities allow you to invest a lump sum and defer your investment and income. As you wait, your balance grows at a variable rate of return. Over time, your potential lifetime income grows and you can elect single or spousal income options. Unlike immediate annuities, you own the account balance and have the ability to name your beneficiaries.

 















Life, Disability & Long-Term Care












Life Insurance
In the event of your death, it is important to protect your loved ones. The tax-free proceeds from a life insurance policy can help your family:


Cover your final expenses
Provide care for children
Pay for education
Eliminate debts
Fund savings and generate income
Create estate liquidity

Types of Coverage
Life Insurance can be a complicated topic. Many people feel they are covered through their employer, but this is not always the case. Group life insurance isn’t designed to meet all of your needs, and you risk losing this benefit if you change employers. It is important to review your benefits with an advisor to better understand your group coverage and determine if supplemental coverage is needed.
 
Cornerstone Wealth offers life insurance products which provide coverage for your current and future needs. Depending on your needs, many individuals elect a combination of coverage. The two types of life insurance are:


Term Life Insurance


Term Life Insurance provides coverage for a specific period of time.

 Permanent Life Insurance


Permanent Life Insurance offers lifelong coverage when your needs exceed a specific period of time.

 







Disability Insurance
Your ability to earn income is essential, but very few people think to protect their ability to earn a living. If you cannot work due to an illness or injury, you must determine how to provide income for yourself and loved ones. Disability income protection ensures you’ll continue to receive income when you are unable to work.
		

Disability Insurance Solutions


Disability Insurance helps protect your current and retirement income needs. If the insured paid the premiums, the policy pays tax-free benefits. Most policies pay an annual benefit while you are disabled, while other forms of coverage offer a lump sum or even a retirement benefit.

 


Long-Term Care (LTC) Insurance
If you or a loved one face a chronic illness or disability, providing custodial and skilled care may be necessary. The type of care needed can range from assistance with simple activities, such as bathing and dressing, to skilled care provided by nurses, therapists and other professionals. Medicare covers limited expenses associated with long-term care, and the majority of your assets must be exhausted to utilize Medicaid. Long-term care expenses include care at home, an adult day care, an assisted living facility or nursing home. To many families, providing this type of care can be physically, emotionally and financially overwhelming. Having long-term care insurance can reduce the financial burden and ensure you can afford long-term care for yourself and your family.

Cornerstone Wealth offers innovative products to cover the cost of long-term care:


Traditional LTC Insurance


Traditional LTC insurance provides a tax-free benefit in exchange for an annual premium. Policies can be designed to cover one or more persons, including husband and wife, two partners, or two related adults. The premium is determined by the features and benefits included in the policy. Premium options include lifetime or limited pay, although premiums cease once the insured goes on claim.

 Hybrid Life/LTC Insurance


Hybrid Life/LTC Insurance allows the insured to pay one lump sum or limited premium payments for long-term care benefits and a cash value life insurance policy. This type of policy provides a tax-free benefit for long-term care expenses, but it also provides a tax-free death benefit if the policy isn’t used to pay for long-term care. The policy also includes a cash value, so the policy owner can terminate the policy and recover the cash value.

 Hybrid Annuity/LTC Insurance


Hybrid Annuity/LTC Insurance offers a tax-deferred annuity with long-term care benefits. The policy owner pays a lump sum premium, which is invested in a fixed or variable annuity. The policy offers tax-deferred growth for future income, but it also provides a benefit for long-term care expenses. Some policies only cover skilled cares, while others include home care and adult day care.

 



















Affordable Care Act (ACA) Health Insurance & Medicare


Paying for healthcare is an important consideration throughout our lives. Many of us have coverage through our employer, while others are self-insured or qualify for Medicare. Below is additional information about ACA Health Insurance and Medicare.

 ACA Health Insurance


ACA Health Insurance requires Americans to be covered by a healthcare policy. Depending on your income, you may be eligible for a stipend to offset the annual premium. If you are nearing retirement but not yet eligible for Medicare, premiums can become a financial burden. Often a proper portfolio distribution strategy can significantly lower your premium outlay. When faced with such situations, seeking professional guidance is imperative.

 Medicare


Medicare is our country’s health insurance program which is available to individuals age 65 or older, and recipients of social security disability benefits under age 65.
Once eligible, Medicare Part A and Part B cover the majority of your doctor and hospital expenses but offer no coverage for prescription drugs. Private insurance companies offer policies to cover the gaps in Part A and Part B including Medicare Supplement, Medicare Advantage and Part D prescription drug plans. Based on your personal circumstances, our team can assist you with navigating the options available to you.

 















Property & Casualty


Providing a secure future for yourself and your family typically involves investing in a variety of assets. As your portfolio grows, you build significant value in savings accounts, real estate and other investments. As your net worth grows, it becomes even more important to protect yourself against financial loss. We spend our lives building our net worth, and none of us can afford to start over. Unknowingly, many people expose themselves to significant risks. We can often alter your risk management strategy and provide additional protection against loss.

Financial Planning


We begin every client relationship by developing a personal financial plan. We follow a proven and detailed six-step process, which enables us to assist you with your financial goals and objectives.

 1. Discover and Define Goals


To begin the wealth management consulting process, your advisor will gather facts and understand your desires. Each client has a unique set of circumstances, so we get to know you on a personal level. We assist you with defining your goals and begin to devise a plan tailored for you.

 2. Analyze Assets, Liabilities, Insurance, Tax & Estate Documents


To build a solid plan for the future, we gain an understanding of your assets and liabilities to develop your current net worth statement. We review your bank, brokerage and retirement accounts to better understand your investments. We review your debt structure to uncover potential savings. Our firm provides a comprehensive review of all insurance policies, and we offer solutions which provide proper coverage at a reasonable price. We analyze your current tax strategy and make suggestions to help reduce and potentially avoid taxes, both today and in the future. Finally, we evaluate your estate documents to ensure your desires are carried out in the event of your incapacity or untimely death.

 3. Provide Wealth Management & Investment Plan


Our firm uses financial planning software, called eMoney, to understand your current situation and model future financial scenarios for your review. Proper planning allows your advisor to illustrate the financial impact of various events, such as selling a home or business, retirement or unexpected life events. Using conservative estimates for portfolio returns, inflation and taxes, we review potential outcomes to assist you in making important decisions. Throughout the planning process, you will become educated in many areas related to wealth management. With each meeting, we build upon your knowledge until you have the information needed to make informed decisions.

 4. Mutual Commitment & Execution of Strategies


Upon our mutual commitment, we begin to implement and execute financial strategies. Your advisor will organize your financial documents, consolidate your accounts and design your investment and risk management plan. Once we understand your risk tolerance and assess your need for growth and income, we invest, monitor and manage your portfolio with the appropriate allocation of equities, fixed income and alternatives. Finally, we address any risk management concerns by reviewing and possibly restructuring your insurance coverage.

 5. Monitor & Track Progress


As we consolidate your accounts and policies, your advisor will monitor and track our progress each step of the way. We will inventory all accounts and policies and finalize financial planning and investment strategies.

 6. Review & Refine Plan


Once your plan has been fully implemented, we will hold periodic meetings to review your accounts, including an assessment of your asset allocation and investment performance. As we meet, we will discuss major life events to better understand the impact to your financial plan. We will make recommendations and update your plan, if necessary. As advisors, we understand that you will be faced with challenges in life. Our goal is to serve as your personal financial coach to help guide you along the way.

 




















Retirement Planning


Whether you are in the accumulation or distribution phase of the retirement planning process, it is important to have a thorough understanding of savings, distribution and tax strategies. Our team of qualified retirement advisors will assist you with defining your retirement goals, and we will create a customized plan which is designed to help you live a successful retirement.




Below are some of the common services provided to pre-retirees and retirees:

 Traditional/Rollover IRA


To be eligible for a Traditional IRA, you must have earned income and be less than 70 ½ years of age. A Traditional IRA provides a way to save in a tax-deferred manner, but there are annual contribution limits and potential tax deductions. These limits and deductibility rules change, so it’s important to work with a qualified advisor to assist in the decision making process.
Often times, employees change companies or careers and leave employer-sponsored retirement plans behind. The process of consolidating these accounts into an IRA is called a rollover.

 Roth IRA


To be eligible for a Roth IRA, you must have earned income. Unlike a Traditional IRA, you can contribute to a Roth IRA if you are 70 ½ years of age or older. A Roth IRA provides a way to save in a tax-deferred manner, and you can make tax-free distributions of contributions and earnings after age 59 ½. There are annual contribution limits and tax-free distribution rules you must follow, so it’s important to work with a qualified advisor to assist in the decision making process.

 Portfolio Risk Assessment


A portfolio should be designed to meet an individual’s retirement income needs. Growing a client’s portfolio is important, but taking on unnecessary risk is not prudent. It’s important to perform a risk assessment before constructing the proper portfolio. During this process, factors such as age, time horizon, tax bracket and income needs are taken into consideration.

 Income for Life Strategies


With advances in healthcare, many retirees are concerned about outliving their money. Our advisors develop income for life strategies to address these fears. This process involves a thorough review of all expenses as compared to existing retirement income, such as Social Security and defined benefit pension plans. When developing an income plan, our objective is to provide income to cover any shortfall. As independent advisors, we have access to numerous fixed income securities and various types of annuities which are designed to provide income for life.

 Required Minimum Distributions


Retirees with employer-sponsored retirement plans and Traditional and/or Rollover IRAs are required to begin annual distributions after April 1st of the year following age 70½. The required minimum distribution, often called RMDs, must be taken by 12/31 of each year. If the correct amount isn’t taken, the IRS imposes a 50% penalty, based on the amount of the required distribution. If you are still employed at age 70 ½, you are not required to take a distribution from an employer-sponsored retirement plan unless you are a 5% (or greater) owner of the company.

 Social Security Benefits Planning


When planning to begin Social Security Benefits, retirees must take many factors into consideration. You can begin taking benefits as early as 62, but you can also defer your benefits until age 70. You must consider your life expectancy, income needs, employment and marital status when making this important decision. Today, retirees are living much longer lives, so it is important to maximize annual benefits while understanding the impact on each recipient’s lifetime benefits.

 Review of Employer Retirement Offers


When employers are forced to reduce their workforce, many of them offer retirement packages to long-standing employees. These offers typically involve severance pay and some additional benefits. Our advisors offer a complimentary evaluation of your retirement offer. We understand this decision can impact the rest of your life, so we offer candid feedback and sound advice.

 Evaluation of Employer Retirement Plans


Many employers offer retirement plans to attract and retain their employees. Most retirement plans allow you to contribute to a tax-advantaged account through payroll deduction, while some employers contribute on your behalf. To encourage employees to save, many employers offer a matching contribution. Having a retirement plan is important, but many plans are underutilized due to a lack of employee education. During the planning process, we offer a complimentary review of your employer plan to make sure you are taking full advantage of the benefits being offered.

 Pension Plan Analysis


Pension plans offer annuity income options, lump sum payments or a combination of these options. Pension plans can have a significant impact on a client’s retirement, so it is important to incorporate this benefit into the comprehensive wealth management plan. To make an informed decision, it’s important to work with a qualified advisor when reviewing these options.

 Tax Reduction Strategies


As you spend down your retirement accounts, it is important to utilize a tax-efficient distribution strategy. Many retirees have investment accounts which grow tax-deferred, taxable and tax-free. When consulting with retirees, we often distribute income from a combination of these accounts to reduce your income. Lowering your income will lessen your federal and state taxes, but it can also lessen the taxes on your Social Security benefits and lower your Medicare Part B premiums.

 







Many of your birthdays have a financial impact on your life. Our advisors educate you about the rules and requirements associated with the following ages:



































Executive Benefits Planning


To attract, retain and reward executives, many companies provide benefits which aren’t offered to all employees. As an executive it is important to have a complete understanding of the benefits offered by your employer, but it can be difficult to navigate the rules of each plan. Many of the plans have complicated guidelines and tax implications, so it’s imperative to work with a professional advisor to design and implement appropriate planning strategies.
Our advisors seek to understand each executive’s personal goals and objectives. After defining short and long-term goals, we design a customized wealth management plan to pursue each stated objective. Upon mutual commitment to work together, we implement each step of the plan. As time progresses, we are here to guide and assist in the execution of strategies to maximize your executive benefits.








We provide advice for the following executive benefits:

 Employee Stock Purchase Plans


A stock purchase plan enables employees to purchase their company’s common stock, often at a discount from the market price.

 Non-Qualified Stock Options (NSOs)


Non-Qualified Stock Options are stock option plans which do not meet certain IRS requirements, eliminating special tax treatment of the stock’s gain, called the bargain element.

 Incentive Stock Options (ISOs)


Incentive Stock Options are stock option plans which meet certain IRS requirements, which allow for special tax treatment of the stock’s gain, called the bargain element.

 Restricted Stock Units (RSUs)


An RSU is a grant valued in terms of company stock, but the actual stock is not issued at the time of the grant. After the recipient of a unit satisfies the vesting requirement, the company distributes cash equivalent to the number of shares used to value the unit. RSU’s are subject to ordinary income and payroll taxes, so this must be taken into consideration when planning for future expenditures.

 Restricted Stock Awards (RSAs)


An RSA is a grant of company stock in which the recipient’s rights in the stock are restricted until the shares vest. Once the vesting requirements are met, an employee owns the shares outright. RSAs are subject to ordinary income and payroll taxes, so this must be taken into consideration when planning for future expenditures.

 Restricted Stock


Restricted Stock is typically acquired by executives, as compensation for their professional services.  Restricted Stock can be sold, but the executive must meet certain conditions set forth in Rule 144.

 Stock Appreciation Rights (SARs)


SARs are awards which provide the holder with the ability to profit from the appreciation in value of a set number of shares of company stock over a set period of time. The valuation of a stock appreciation right derives value when the stock price increases above the price set in the award.  The employee is not required to pay an exercise price to acquire shares, but simply receives the net amount of the increase in the stock price in either cash or shares of company stock.

 Performance Awards Plans


A performance award is a grant of company shares or units in which the recipient’s rights in the shares or units are contingent on the achievement of pre-established performance goals.

 Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation


A plan which allows a highly-compensated employee the ability to defer a portion of their compensation, and attributable federal and state income taxes, into the future.

 



























Investment Management


We employ our six-step investment discipline for every client. Our philosophy is one of fully independent, non-conflicted, open architecture investment management. We offer no proprietary products of any kind, which allows us to focus on the best possible outcome for your financial goals.




			Below is the six step investment management process:
		

1. Define Goals of the Client


Our investment management process begins by listening to you, our client. Whether you engage Cornerstone Wealth for a full wealth management plan or retain our firm to manage a portion of your investment portfolio, our advisors will engage you in a series of comprehensive conversations. We strive to fully understand every client’s financial circumstances, financial goals, family considerations and risk preferences. Armed with this information, our investment management team begins the construction of a customized portfolio specific to each client.

 2. Evaluate Macro Environment through Micro Data


Our investment outlook begins with an exhaustive and ongoing analysis of multiple layers of global economic information. Our discipline includes the monitoring of hundreds of data sets to identify, throughout the world, where economic activity is accelerating, remaining stable or decelerating.

 3. Provide Wealth Management & Investment Plan


Selecting a suitable asset allocation for our clients is paramount in the investment management process. Our investment team monitors a large matrix of domestic, international and emerging market asset classes, including equities, fixed income and cash. We evaluate the relative attractiveness of each asset class, based upon our valuation analysis, overlaid with our economic assessment. From this process, our investment committee makes decisions to overweight and underweight specific asset classes.

 4. Customized Portfolio Construction


After determining the proper asset allocation, we construct a portfolio unique to each client.
The following are some examples of investment options:

Stocks
Large Capitalization Stocks • Small Capitalization Stocks • Preferred Stocks • Public REITs and MLPs • International Stocks


Bonds
Government Securities • Corporate Bonds • Municipal Bonds • International Bonds


Alternatives
Commodities • Private Equity • Hedge Funds • Managed Futures



5. Disciplined Portfolio Monitoring & Adjustments


Our investment process never ends, nor does the monitoring of your portfolio. Our team constantly evaluates the investment environment, making adjustments and changes when we believe necessary. Where appropriate, we always consider tax related implications of any change to your portfolio.

 6. Collaborative Review


Wealth Advisors meet regularly with the investment team and have a full understanding of the firm’s investment perspective. Following every review meeting, your advisor will meet with the investment team to discuss potential adjustments to your portfolio. As you move through the cycles of life, your portfolio is managed accordingly. At Cornerstone Wealth, we have a 365 day, 360 degree focus on you.

 















Risk Management


Each of us encounter risks throughout our lives, and most losses can be emotionally and financially devastating. If there is a possibility of loss, it is important to protect yourself with the proper risk management strategies.
Our risk management process begins with a thorough review of your potential risk exposures. After analyzing your needs, our advisors will recommend the proper amount of coverage and the product type to best fit your needs. Whether you are concerned with outliving your savings, an untimely disability or death, comprehensive healthcare or a catastrophic loss, we will work with you to find a suitable strategy.








Below are risk management strategies we offer:

Estate Planning


Estate planning is the process of organizing your financial and healthcare decisions to best serve your family and your heirs.  A properly designed estate plan allows you to maintain your current lifestyle, while providing for your loved ones in the event of your incapacitation or death. If you have charitable inclinations, your estate plan can direct contributions during your life or in the future.
To assist with the process, our advisors work with you and an estate planning attorney to educate you about legal terminology and important planning concepts.  If you have an existing estate plan, we will review each of the legal documents to make sure they concur with your wishes.  If you have not created your estate plan, we will recommend the appropriate estate attorney based on your needs.  After confirming your estate plan meets your objectives, we will fund your plan by registering your accounts and naming your beneficiaries properly.








Below are some of the essential and advanced estate planning services we offer:
