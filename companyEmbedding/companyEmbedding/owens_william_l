Early life, education, and military service[edit]
Born in Brooklyn to Lewis Owens and Alice Stanton Owens,[2] Owens was raised in Mineola, New York. After graduating from Chaminade High School, where he was a classmate of television host and conservative political commentator Bill O'Reilly, he enlisted in the U.S. Air Force and was stationed at Plattsburgh Air Force Base. He returned to the North Country and has lived there for over 30 years after serving as a United States Air Force captain.
Owens is a 1971 summa cum laude graduate of Manhattan College with a degree in business administration and a 1974 top-half graduate of Fordham University School of Law.
Law career[edit]
Before coming to Congress, Owens was a managing partner at Stafford, Owens, Piller, Murnane & Trombley, where he specialized in business law, international law, and estate and tax law.[3] He is also an adjunct professor in business law at State University of New York at Plattsburgh. In 2004, he was appointed by Governor George Pataki to the College Council at that university.[4] He served as the host for Business Affairs[5][6] on WCFE-TV, a PBS television station in Plattsburgh. According to financial disclosure forms filed when he ran for Congress, Owens made $751,000 in 2008, mostly from his law practice.[7]
When the Plattsburgh Air Force Base closed in 1995, Owens helped create and worked for the Plattsburgh Airbase Redevelopment Corporation (formerly the Plattsburgh Inter-municipal Development Council), which recruited private companies to reuse the space. The base is now home to companies such as Bombardier Inc., a passenger railway car maker. Plattsburgh Airbase Redevelopment Corporation attests that more than 2,000 jobs were created at the site since the military left.[8]
U.S. House of Representatives[edit]
Elections[edit]

2009

Main article: New York's 23rd congressional district special election, 2009
On August 10, 2009, the Democratic Party of New York's 23rd congressional district chose Owens to run in a special election to fill the House seat vacated by the incumbent Republican John McHugh, who had resigned to take a post as the Secretary of the Army.[9] Because he was a registered independent at the time, Owens had to obtain the signatures of all 11 Democratic county chairs in the district to allow him to run as a Democrat.[10]
Originally, Owens faced Republican Assemblywoman Dede Scozzafava and Doug Hoffman, an accountant from Lake Placid who was running as a third party candidate on the single ballot line of the Conservative Party of New York after failing to also get the Republican Party nomination. “The race,” wrote Valerie Bauman of the Associated Press, “received national attention, with some calling it a referendum on Obama and others saying it could help Republicans focus their message to attract more people to the party.” Bauman said that “Despite the fervor that surrounded Hoffman in the final week of the campaign, Owens managed to appeal to the voters with his talk of job creation and the need for more federal support for Fort Drum (an army base in the district) and farmers.”[11] Scozzafava was a social liberal, and high-profile conservatives such as Rush Limbaugh, Sarah Palin, and Michelle Malkin threw their support behind Hoffman, who enjoyed Tea Party support. Under pressure from conservative elements in her party, who saw “Doug Hoffman as the man who would save them,” according to the San Francisco Chronicle, Scozzafava dropped out of the race on October 31, the weekend before the election.[12] Hoffman became Owens's sole opponent when Scozzafava dropped out of the race on October 31. The Watertown Daily Times, which had originally endorsed Scozzafava, switched its endorsement to Owens on November 1.[13] Later on November 1, Scozzafava endorsed Owens. In the special election, Owens won 49 percent of the vote to 45 percent for Hoffman and 6 percent for Scozzafava. Owens was sworn in on November 6, 2009. He became the first Democrat to represent what is now the 23rd since 1873.

2010

See also: United States House of Representatives elections in New York, 2010 § District 23
Owens almost immediately announced that he would run for a full term in 2010. He campaigned largely on “creating jobs throughout his district, attracting foreign manufacturers, taking care of veterans, and ensuring that Fort Drum (an Army installation located in the district) is preserved.” Owens won his re-election bid with a second consecutive minority plurality of 47.5% of the vote against Republican and Independence nominee Matt Doheny and Conservative nominee Doug Hoffman, becoming the first Democrat to win a full term in the North Country district in 138 years.
The election was one of the ten closest Congressional races that year.[14]

2012

See also: United States House of Representatives elections in New York, 2012 § District 21
Owens ran for reelection in 2012 in the renumbered 21st District. He faced a rematch against Doheny and was elected to a second full term, albeit narrowly.[15]
Tenure[edit]
During his campaign, Owens said he would focus on creating jobs throughout his district, attracting foreign manufacturers, taking care of veterans, and ensuring that Fort Drum is preserved.[10][16] He has called for deeper federal budget cuts (including 3% cuts across the board for federal agencies), co-sponsored the Budget Process Improvement Act of 2011, and said that the Bush-era tax cuts need to be allowed to expire for people earning over $500,000. Owens is the second thriftiest member of Congress, with staff expenses of $713,969.[17]
Owens has consistently voted for legislation to build the controversial Keystone Pipeline to carry tar sand oil across the United States from Canada for export to foreign nations .[18]
As a congressman, Owens first authored piece of legislation was the [19] Rural Jobs Tax Credit Act, a bill that, if passed, would create a 15% tax incentive in 2010 for businesses that hire or expand their payroll in rural areas, and a 10% tax incentive for firms that do the same in 2011.
On December 14, 2011, Marc Heller reported that Sen. Claire McCaskill had accused Owens and other members of the House Armed Services Committee “of loading up an annual defense bill with pork-barrel projects despite a congressional ban on home-state 'earmarks.'” Owens's earmarks “included construction at Fort Drum and $500,000 intended for the Fort Drum Regional Health Planning Organization.”[20]

Gay Marriage

In August 2009, Owens stated that he supported civil unions and believed marriage should be legally recognized as one man one woman. Owens opposes any federal action on marriage, which he called a "states rights issue".[10] In July 2011, after the New York State legislature passed a bill recognizing same-sex marriage in New York, Owens became a co-sponsor of the Respect for Marriage Act, which would repeal the federal Defense of Marriage Act.[21]

Labor

He supports the Employee Free Choice Act.[22]

Health Care

Owens voted for the Affordable Health Care for America Act on November 7, 2009.[23] He voted against the Stupak Amendment which proposed to restrict abortion funding in the federal health insurance exchanges.[24] He voted for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act on March 21, 2010, and for the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 to incorporate certain agreed-upon changes with the Senate.[25][26]

Internet policy

In 2011, Rep. Owens became a co-sponsor of Bill H.R.3261 otherwise known as the Stop Online Piracy Act.[27]

GMO crops

Owens is a member of the House Committee on Agriculture[28] and voted for the Farmer Assurance Provision.[29] Owens says that he is "still doing the fact-finding" when it comes to Monsanto and GMO crops. "I have farmers who are telling me it's a great thing. I have people telling me that it's the worst thing in the world."[30]
The Monsanto Citizenship Fund from Monsanto donated $1,500 on June 24, 2013 to Owens' 2014 campaign.[31]

Early life, education, and military service[edit]
Born in Brooklyn to Lewis Owens and Alice Stanton Owens,[2] Owens was raised in Mineola, New York. After graduating from Chaminade High School, where he was a classmate of television host and conservative political commentator Bill O'Reilly, he enlisted in the U.S. Air Force and was stationed at Plattsburgh Air Force Base. He returned to the North Country and has lived there for over 30 years after serving as a United States Air Force captain.
Owens is a 1971 summa cum laude graduate of Manhattan College with a degree in business administration and a 1974 top-half graduate of Fordham University School of Law.
Law career[edit]
Before coming to Congress, Owens was a managing partner at Stafford, Owens, Piller, Murnane & Trombley, where he specialized in business law, international law, and estate and tax law.[3] He is also an adjunct professor in business law at State University of New York at Plattsburgh. In 2004, he was appointed by Governor George Pataki to the College Council at that university.[4] He served as the host for Business Affairs[5][6] on WCFE-TV, a PBS television station in Plattsburgh. According to financial disclosure forms filed when he ran for Congress, Owens made $751,000 in 2008, mostly from his law practice.[7]
When the Plattsburgh Air Force Base closed in 1995, Owens helped create and worked for the Plattsburgh Airbase Redevelopment Corporation (formerly the Plattsburgh Inter-municipal Development Council), which recruited private companies to reuse the space. The base is now home to companies such as Bombardier Inc., a passenger railway car maker. Plattsburgh Airbase Redevelopment Corporation attests that more than 2,000 jobs were created at the site since the military left.[8]
U.S. House of Representatives[edit]
Elections[edit]

2009

Main article: New York's 23rd congressional district special election, 2009
On August 10, 2009, the Democratic Party of New York's 23rd congressional district chose Owens to run in a special election to fill the House seat vacated by the incumbent Republican John McHugh, who had resigned to take a post as the Secretary of the Army.[9] Because he was a registered independent at the time, Owens had to obtain the signatures of all 11 Democratic county chairs in the district to allow him to run as a Democrat.[10]
Originally, Owens faced Republican Assemblywoman Dede Scozzafava and Doug Hoffman, an accountant from Lake Placid who was running as a third party candidate on the single ballot line of the Conservative Party of New York after failing to also get the Republican Party nomination. “The race,” wrote Valerie Bauman of the Associated Press, “received national attention, with some calling it a referendum on Obama and others saying it could help Republicans focus their message to attract more people to the party.” Bauman said that “Despite the fervor that surrounded Hoffman in the final week of the campaign, Owens managed to appeal to the voters with his talk of job creation and the need for more federal support for Fort Drum (an army base in the district) and farmers.”[11] Scozzafava was a social liberal, and high-profile conservatives such as Rush Limbaugh, Sarah Palin, and Michelle Malkin threw their support behind Hoffman, who enjoyed Tea Party support. Under pressure from conservative elements in her party, who saw “Doug Hoffman as the man who would save them,” according to the San Francisco Chronicle, Scozzafava dropped out of the race on October 31, the weekend before the election.[12] Hoffman became Owens's sole opponent when Scozzafava dropped out of the race on October 31. The Watertown Daily Times, which had originally endorsed Scozzafava, switched its endorsement to Owens on November 1.[13] Later on November 1, Scozzafava endorsed Owens. In the special election, Owens won 49 percent of the vote to 45 percent for Hoffman and 6 percent for Scozzafava. Owens was sworn in on November 6, 2009. He became the first Democrat to represent what is now the 23rd since 1873.

2010

See also: United States House of Representatives elections in New York, 2010 § District 23
Owens almost immediately announced that he would run for a full term in 2010. He campaigned largely on “creating jobs throughout his district, attracting foreign manufacturers, taking care of veterans, and ensuring that Fort Drum (an Army installation located in the district) is preserved.” Owens won his re-election bid with a second consecutive minority plurality of 47.5% of the vote against Republican and Independence nominee Matt Doheny and Conservative nominee Doug Hoffman, becoming the first Democrat to win a full term in the North Country district in 138 years.
The election was one of the ten closest Congressional races that year.[14]

2012

See also: United States House of Representatives elections in New York, 2012 § District 21
Owens ran for reelection in 2012 in the renumbered 21st District. He faced a rematch against Doheny and was elected to a second full term, albeit narrowly.[15]
Tenure[edit]
During his campaign, Owens said he would focus on creating jobs throughout his district, attracting foreign manufacturers, taking care of veterans, and ensuring that Fort Drum is preserved.[10][16] He has called for deeper federal budget cuts (including 3% cuts across the board for federal agencies), co-sponsored the Budget Process Improvement Act of 2011, and said that the Bush-era tax cuts need to be allowed to expire for people earning over $500,000. Owens is the second thriftiest member of Congress, with staff expenses of $713,969.[17]
Owens has consistently voted for legislation to build the controversial Keystone Pipeline to carry tar sand oil across the United States from Canada for export to foreign nations .[18]
As a congressman, Owens first authored piece of legislation was the [19] Rural Jobs Tax Credit Act, a bill that, if passed, would create a 15% tax incentive in 2010 for businesses that hire or expand their payroll in rural areas, and a 10% tax incentive for firms that do the same in 2011.
On December 14, 2011, Marc Heller reported that Sen. Claire McCaskill had accused Owens and other members of the House Armed Services Committee “of loading up an annual defense bill with pork-barrel projects despite a congressional ban on home-state 'earmarks.'” Owens's earmarks “included construction at Fort Drum and $500,000 intended for the Fort Drum Regional Health Planning Organization.”[20]

Gay Marriage

In August 2009, Owens stated that he supported civil unions and believed marriage should be legally recognized as one man one woman. Owens opposes any federal action on marriage, which he called a "states rights issue".[10] In July 2011, after the New York State legislature passed a bill recognizing same-sex marriage in New York, Owens became a co-sponsor of the Respect for Marriage Act, which would repeal the federal Defense of Marriage Act.[21]

Labor

He supports the Employee Free Choice Act.[22]

Health Care

Owens voted for the Affordable Health Care for America Act on November 7, 2009.[23] He voted against the Stupak Amendment which proposed to restrict abortion funding in the federal health insurance exchanges.[24] He voted for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act on March 21, 2010, and for the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 to incorporate certain agreed-upon changes with the Senate.[25][26]

Internet policy

In 2011, Rep. Owens became a co-sponsor of Bill H.R.3261 otherwise known as the Stop Online Piracy Act.[27]

GMO crops

Owens is a member of the House Committee on Agriculture[28] and voted for the Farmer Assurance Provision.[29] Owens says that he is "still doing the fact-finding" when it comes to Monsanto and GMO crops. "I have farmers who are telling me it's a great thing. I have people telling me that it's the worst thing in the world."[30]
The Monsanto Citizenship Fund from Monsanto donated $1,500 on June 24, 2013 to Owens' 2014 campaign.[31]

Early life, education, and military service[edit]
Born in Brooklyn to Lewis Owens and Alice Stanton Owens,[2] Owens was raised in Mineola, New York. After graduating from Chaminade High School, where he was a classmate of television host and conservative political commentator Bill O'Reilly, he enlisted in the U.S. Air Force and was stationed at Plattsburgh Air Force Base. He returned to the North Country and has lived there for over 30 years after serving as a United States Air Force captain.
Owens is a 1971 summa cum laude graduate of Manhattan College with a degree in business administration and a 1974 top-half graduate of Fordham University School of Law.
Law career[edit]
Before coming to Congress, Owens was a managing partner at Stafford, Owens, Piller, Murnane & Trombley, where he specialized in business law, international law, and estate and tax law.[3] He is also an adjunct professor in business law at State University of New York at Plattsburgh. In 2004, he was appointed by Governor George Pataki to the College Council at that university.[4] He served as the host for Business Affairs[5][6] on WCFE-TV, a PBS television station in Plattsburgh. According to financial disclosure forms filed when he ran for Congress, Owens made $751,000 in 2008, mostly from his law practice.[7]
When the Plattsburgh Air Force Base closed in 1995, Owens helped create and worked for the Plattsburgh Airbase Redevelopment Corporation (formerly the Plattsburgh Inter-municipal Development Council), which recruited private companies to reuse the space. The base is now home to companies such as Bombardier Inc., a passenger railway car maker. Plattsburgh Airbase Redevelopment Corporation attests that more than 2,000 jobs were created at the site since the military left.[8]
U.S. House of Representatives[edit]
Elections[edit]

2009

Main article: New York's 23rd congressional district special election, 2009
On August 10, 2009, the Democratic Party of New York's 23rd congressional district chose Owens to run in a special election to fill the House seat vacated by the incumbent Republican John McHugh, who had resigned to take a post as the Secretary of the Army.[9] Because he was a registered independent at the time, Owens had to obtain the signatures of all 11 Democratic county chairs in the district to allow him to run as a Democrat.[10]
Originally, Owens faced Republican Assemblywoman Dede Scozzafava and Doug Hoffman, an accountant from Lake Placid who was running as a third party candidate on the single ballot line of the Conservative Party of New York after failing to also get the Republican Party nomination. “The race,” wrote Valerie Bauman of the Associated Press, “received national attention, with some calling it a referendum on Obama and others saying it could help Republicans focus their message to attract more people to the party.” Bauman said that “Despite the fervor that surrounded Hoffman in the final week of the campaign, Owens managed to appeal to the voters with his talk of job creation and the need for more federal support for Fort Drum (an army base in the district) and farmers.”[11] Scozzafava was a social liberal, and high-profile conservatives such as Rush Limbaugh, Sarah Palin, and Michelle Malkin threw their support behind Hoffman, who enjoyed Tea Party support. Under pressure from conservative elements in her party, who saw “Doug Hoffman as the man who would save them,” according to the San Francisco Chronicle, Scozzafava dropped out of the race on October 31, the weekend before the election.[12] Hoffman became Owens's sole opponent when Scozzafava dropped out of the race on October 31. The Watertown Daily Times, which had originally endorsed Scozzafava, switched its endorsement to Owens on November 1.[13] Later on November 1, Scozzafava endorsed Owens. In the special election, Owens won 49 percent of the vote to 45 percent for Hoffman and 6 percent for Scozzafava. Owens was sworn in on November 6, 2009. He became the first Democrat to represent what is now the 23rd since 1873.

2010

See also: United States House of Representatives elections in New York, 2010 § District 23
Owens almost immediately announced that he would run for a full term in 2010. He campaigned largely on “creating jobs throughout his district, attracting foreign manufacturers, taking care of veterans, and ensuring that Fort Drum (an Army installation located in the district) is preserved.” Owens won his re-election bid with a second consecutive minority plurality of 47.5% of the vote against Republican and Independence nominee Matt Doheny and Conservative nominee Doug Hoffman, becoming the first Democrat to win a full term in the North Country district in 138 years.
The election was one of the ten closest Congressional races that year.[14]

2012

See also: United States House of Representatives elections in New York, 2012 § District 21
Owens ran for reelection in 2012 in the renumbered 21st District. He faced a rematch against Doheny and was elected to a second full term, albeit narrowly.[15]
Tenure[edit]
During his campaign, Owens said he would focus on creating jobs throughout his district, attracting foreign manufacturers, taking care of veterans, and ensuring that Fort Drum is preserved.[10][16] He has called for deeper federal budget cuts (including 3% cuts across the board for federal agencies), co-sponsored the Budget Process Improvement Act of 2011, and said that the Bush-era tax cuts need to be allowed to expire for people earning over $500,000. Owens is the second thriftiest member of Congress, with staff expenses of $713,969.[17]
Owens has consistently voted for legislation to build the controversial Keystone Pipeline to carry tar sand oil across the United States from Canada for export to foreign nations .[18]
As a congressman, Owens first authored piece of legislation was the [19] Rural Jobs Tax Credit Act, a bill that, if passed, would create a 15% tax incentive in 2010 for businesses that hire or expand their payroll in rural areas, and a 10% tax incentive for firms that do the same in 2011.
On December 14, 2011, Marc Heller reported that Sen. Claire McCaskill had accused Owens and other members of the House Armed Services Committee “of loading up an annual defense bill with pork-barrel projects despite a congressional ban on home-state 'earmarks.'” Owens's earmarks “included construction at Fort Drum and $500,000 intended for the Fort Drum Regional Health Planning Organization.”[20]

Gay Marriage

In August 2009, Owens stated that he supported civil unions and believed marriage should be legally recognized as one man one woman. Owens opposes any federal action on marriage, which he called a "states rights issue".[10] In July 2011, after the New York State legislature passed a bill recognizing same-sex marriage in New York, Owens became a co-sponsor of the Respect for Marriage Act, which would repeal the federal Defense of Marriage Act.[21]

Labor

He supports the Employee Free Choice Act.[22]

Health Care

Owens voted for the Affordable Health Care for America Act on November 7, 2009.[23] He voted against the Stupak Amendment which proposed to restrict abortion funding in the federal health insurance exchanges.[24] He voted for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act on March 21, 2010, and for the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 to incorporate certain agreed-upon changes with the Senate.[25][26]

Internet policy

In 2011, Rep. Owens became a co-sponsor of Bill H.R.3261 otherwise known as the Stop Online Piracy Act.[27]

GMO crops

Owens is a member of the House Committee on Agriculture[28] and voted for the Farmer Assurance Provision.[29] Owens says that he is "still doing the fact-finding" when it comes to Monsanto and GMO crops. "I have farmers who are telling me it's a great thing. I have people telling me that it's the worst thing in the world."[30]
The Monsanto Citizenship Fund from Monsanto donated $1,500 on June 24, 2013 to Owens' 2014 campaign.[31]

During his campaign, Owens said he would focus on creating jobs throughout his district, attracting foreign manufacturers, taking care of veterans, and ensuring that Fort Drum is preserved.[10][16] He has called for deeper federal budget cuts (including 3% cuts across the board for federal agencies), co-sponsored the Budget Process Improvement Act of 2011, and said that the Bush-era tax cuts need to be allowed to expire for people earning over $500,000. Owens is the second thriftiest member of Congress, with staff expenses of $713,969.[17]
Owens has consistently voted for legislation to build the controversial Keystone Pipeline to carry tar sand oil across the United States from Canada for export to foreign nations .[18]
As a congressman, Owens first authored piece of legislation was the [19] Rural Jobs Tax Credit Act, a bill that, if passed, would create a 15% tax incentive in 2010 for businesses that hire or expand their payroll in rural areas, and a 10% tax incentive for firms that do the same in 2011.
On December 14, 2011, Marc Heller reported that Sen. Claire McCaskill had accused Owens and other members of the House Armed Services Committee “of loading up an annual defense bill with pork-barrel projects despite a congressional ban on home-state 'earmarks.'” Owens's earmarks “included construction at Fort Drum and $500,000 intended for the Fort Drum Regional Health Planning Organization.”[20]

Gay Marriage

In August 2009, Owens stated that he supported civil unions and believed marriage should be legally recognized as one man one woman. Owens opposes any federal action on marriage, which he called a "states rights issue".[10] In July 2011, after the New York State legislature passed a bill recognizing same-sex marriage in New York, Owens became a co-sponsor of the Respect for Marriage Act, which would repeal the federal Defense of Marriage Act.[21]

Labor

He supports the Employee Free Choice Act.[22]

Health Care

Owens voted for the Affordable Health Care for America Act on November 7, 2009.[23] He voted against the Stupak Amendment which proposed to restrict abortion funding in the federal health insurance exchanges.[24] He voted for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act on March 21, 2010, and for the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 to incorporate certain agreed-upon changes with the Senate.[25][26]

Internet policy

In 2011, Rep. Owens became a co-sponsor of Bill H.R.3261 otherwise known as the Stop Online Piracy Act.[27]

GMO crops

Owens is a member of the House Committee on Agriculture[28] and voted for the Farmer Assurance Provision.[29] Owens says that he is "still doing the fact-finding" when it comes to Monsanto and GMO crops. "I have farmers who are telling me it's a great thing. I have people telling me that it's the worst thing in the world."[30]
The Monsanto Citizenship Fund from Monsanto donated $1,500 on June 24, 2013 to Owens' 2014 campaign.[31]

MTV Acts Responsibly?
The MTV summer series “16 and Pregnant” explored the very
real-world consequences of the hook-up culture that MTV usually
promotes.
By: L. Brent Bozell
August 01, 2009 06:45 ET

*** begin quote ***

The standout episode focused on Catelynn and Tyler, who firmly chose to
put their baby up for adoption. Only about one percent of all women
make that hard choice. It is doubly courageous and unselfish: avoiding
the quick and dirty abortion and accepting the stigma of teenage
pregnancy, only then to face the pain of giving up the child to someone
else.

*** end quote ***

Amazing that two out of six did the “right thing”. Wish
that more would. We can only pray that their hearts are softened.

PrayersRequested: Jasper’s son going in harm’s way
I know a young man, son of a Jasper, who is going to serve his country.
Even now, he’s in Kuwait waiting to go up to Iraq. He’s
courageous (does he know the danger?); his Mom does. I’d ask my
fellow Jaspers to pray for his safe and uneventful return. And, the
return of all the boys and girls regardless of where their parent did
or didn’t go to school.

Dems pick Plattsburgh attorney
23RD CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT: Owens, a registered independent, helped redevelop Air Force base site
By JUDE SEYMOUR
TIMES STAFF WRITER
TUESDAY, AUGUST 11, 2009

*** begin quote ***

Plattsburgh attorney William L. Owens will represent the Democratic
Party in the expected race for the 23rd Congressional District seat.

Mr. Owens, 60, secured the nomination after impressing the district’s 11 Democratic county chairpersons …

{Extraneous Deleted}

It was unknown as of late Monday whether Mr. Owens received unanimous
support from all the leaders and whether multiple rounds of balloting
were needed to pick a candidate.

{Extraneous Deleted}

Mr. Owens is a managing partner at Stafford, Owens, Piller, Murnane
& Trombley, where he specializes in business, estate and tax law.
The firm is an offshoot of one founded by Ronald B. Stafford, a
prominent Republican state senator.

Mr. Owens is not a Republican, but he’s not a Democrat, either. The attorney is a registered independent.

A Brooklyn native, Mr. Owens stayed in Plattsburgh following his
service in the U.S. Air Force. When the military abandoned the base in
1995, the leaders said, Mr. Owens helped create the Plattsburgh Airbase
Redevelopment Corp., which recruited private companies to reuse the
space.

The base is now home to companies such as Bombardier, a Canadian
passenger railway car maker. The chairpersons said more than 500 jobs
were created at the site since the military left.

“We did it by taking advantage of our regional assets – a
well motivated workforce, good infrastructure, good schools and
colleges, and access to outside investment and markets,” Mr.
Owens said in a statement. “We can do the same thing throughout
the 23rd District if we work together with total dedication.
That’s what I will do in Congress.”

Mr. Owens is a 1971 graduate of Manhattan College. He received his law degree from Fordham University in 1974.

Wednesday, August 12, 2009
“NY 23rd District Open Seat…” Dan Francis   Upstate, in Watertown, New York

*** begin quote ***

On top of all that, Mr. Owens publicly stated he does not support the
Obama health care reform proposal.President Obama, as president of the
United States, is the head of the nation’s Democrat Party. Mr.
Owens even by his statement thus, does not hold the principles of the
head of the party or for a major principle for the party that supports
a common need for national health care. (If Mr. Owens feels no need for
such a program, then he should have run as an Independent or Republican
– as both are opposed to the Obama plan). That is not change!

Also, Mr. Owens on the issue of same-sex marriage is even to the right
of his Republican opponent Dede Scozzafava and of the Conservative
nominee, Mr. Hoffman. Owens does not support full marriage for gays and
he opposes any federal action on the “states rights issue”
– saying to one reporter, “I fully support equal rights for
everybody, and certainly civil unions are in that mix. For religious
reasons, I have difficulty with the use of the word marriage in that
process.” That is not change!

REFERENCE: JNews: Owens, William L. [MC1971] will run for Congress

[JR: Any politician, that doesn't see the enraged electorate over
healthcare, is going to walk into a buzzsaw. It would seem that an
incumbent congresscritter might be an endangered species in the
mid-term 2010 elections. As an L. I don't care for either party. And,
maybe parties should be eliminated. Better idea, maybe gooferment
should be eliminated. It is after all the meme that kills.]

ENDNOTE: Gooferment “healthcare” is a call to action
http://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&pageId=105909

Time to go, Grandpa
Posted: August 04, 2009
Pat Buchanan

*** begin quote ***

To traditional Christians, God is the author of life, and innocent
life, be it of the unborn or terminally ill, may not be taken. Heroic
means to keep the dying alive are not necessary, but to advance a
natural death by assisting a suicide or euthanasia is a violation of
God’s commandment, Thou shalt not kill.

*** and ***

In Weimar, Germany, two professors published “The Permission to
Destroy Life Unworthy of Life,” which advocated assisted suicide
for the terminally ill and “empty shells of human beings.”
Hitler’s Third Reich, marrying Social Darwinism to Aryan racial
supremacy, carried the concepts to their logical if horrible conclusion.

*** end quote ***

[JR: It's hard to imagine government run "healthcare" with abortion and
euthanasia. But, it will have it. And, we will be paying for it with
our taxes. Personally, will the Church -- it's leadership and laity --
have the "stones" to on the day it is passed to do TWO things: (1)
close ALL Catholic hospitals (i.e., shut them down and don't sell the
facilities to the government; just leave them idle); AND (2) call on
all Catholics and like minded souls to engage in civil disobedience.
THe civil rights movement demonstrated how to do it. Do Catholics have
the moral courage and intestinal fortitude to stand up for their
beliefs?]
