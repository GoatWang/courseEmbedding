Publisher's Description▼▲
Discover the power in making the connection "Making the Connection" offers an impactful, yet practical, easy to understand resource to those wanting a well-grounded connection to God as the power source for abundant living.Just like a lamp needs to be connected to a sufficient power source to give light, so must we be connected to a sufficient power source to live a full and abundant life. The only sufficient power connection is to God through Jesus Christ Once the divine connection is made we then have access to the power we need to connect effectively in all human relationships."Making the Connection" is written to first help you make, maintain or make stronger this divine connection. It then shows how the power of that connection can be activated in the first of all God-ordained human relationship - marriage. So, if you are a seeker or believer, male or female, married or single, this is written for you. Discover the Power - Make the Connection Rev. Arthur L. Smith is a graduate of International Seminary in Plymouth, FL and has twenty-five years pastoral experience. He is currently the pastor of the Macedonia Missionary Baptist Church, Safety Harbor, FL and serves in leadership in the South Florida Progressive Baptist Association.

                           Churchill tillod tyske tropper, som skulle have overgivet sig til russerne, at rykke ind i den engelske besættelseszone. Englænderne
                              opretholdt anselige tyske militære enheder længe efter krigen og Churchill var, siger Smith, villig til at anvende tidligere

                           There are several important studies in Allied efforts to re-educate German civilians after the fall of Nazism. The simultaneous
                              major program of the U.S., Britain, and Soviet Union to influence the future of German politics and society through the re-education
                              of prisoners of war has not previously been studied. Based on extensive archival research, including hitherto unknown material
                              from the Soviet archives, as well as interviews with participants, this book draws a fascinating picture of the war for the
                              postwar German mind. It also explores the question of the impact of the returnees upon the two German states that emerged
                              after 1945. The unique value of this study lies in its genuinely comparative approach which also examines the program that
                              the Soviets introduced in their POW camps

                           Seit 1945 ist das Schicksal von etwa einer Million deutscher Soldaten ungeklärt. Der Annahme, der größte Teil dieser Wehrmachtsangehörigen
                              sei an der Ostfront gefallen oder in sowjetischen Lagern zugrunde gegangen, hat der kanadische Journalist James Bacque die
                              Behauptung entgegengesetzt, die "vermisste Million" sei im Westen umgekommen, und zwar in der Gefangenschaft als Ergebnis
                              zielbewusster Politik und Vernachlässigung vor allem seitens der Amerikaner. Arthur L. Smith kann diese Behauptung eindeutig
                              widerlegen. Zwar zeigt er, dass die Behandlung der deutschen Kriegsgefangenen ein schändliches Kapitel in der Geschichte
                              der amerikanischen Streitkräfte ist – einige Zehntausende gingen vor allem in den berüchtigten "Rheinwiesenlagern" zugrunde.
                              Ebenso deutlich geht aus der Studie jedoch hervor, dass die Antwort auf die Frage nach dem Geschick der "vermissten Million"
                              nicht im Westen, sondern im Osten zu finden ist, Die überwältigende Mehrheit der Vermissten war zuletzt an der Ostfront

                              This book explores and explains communication among different racial groups within the scope of existing communication theory.
                                 Following a brief introduction, chapters cover "Directions in Transracial Communication" (definitions, process, structurization,
                                 and purpose); "Culture and Transracial Communication" (a viewpoint on culture, time, family, black language styles, functions
                                 of black language, and an approach to intervention); "Structure of Transracial Communication" (form and content, qualities
                                 affecting structure); "a Model of Transracial Communication" (universal context, ethnic perspective, and initiator); "Elements
                                 of Transracial Noise" (control beliefs, stereotypes, lack of basic skills, and inadequate perception); "Symbols in Transracial
                                 Communication" (symbols, symbols and racism); and "Determinants of Normalization" (Speech acts in transracial contexts, metacommunication,
                                 sex and transracial communication, social stratification and transracial communication, conversations in the routine, and
                                 consensus--the plague of normalization). A 157-item bibliography concludes the volume. (Hod)

                              Main description: Seit 1945 ist das Schicksal von etwa einer Million deutscher Soldaten ungeklärt. Der Annahme, der größte
                                 Teil dieser Wehrmachtsangehörigen sei an der Ostfront gefallen oder in sowjetischen Lagern zugrunde gegangen, hat der kanadische
                                 Journalist James Bacque die Behauptung entgegengesetzt, die vermisste Million sei im Westen umgekommen, und zwar in der Gefangenschaft
                                 als Ergebnis zielbewusster Politik und Vernachlässigung vor allem seitens der Amerikaner. Arthur L. Smith kann diese Behauptung
                                 eindeutig widerlegen. Zwar zeigt er, dass die Behandlung der deutschen Kriegsgefangenen ein schändliches Kapitel in der Geschichte
                                 der amerikanischen Streitkräfte ist. Einige Zehntausende gingen vor allem in den berüchtigten Rheinwiesenlagern zugrunde.
                                 Ebenso deutlich geht aus der Studie jedoch hervor, dass die Antwort auf die Frage nach dem Geschick der vermissten Million
                                 nicht im Westen, sondern im Osten zu finden ist, die überwältigende Mehrheit der Vermissten war zuletzt an der Ostfront

                              Main description: Annäherung un Abgrenzung prägten in den Jahren zwischen 1956 und 1969 das innerdeutsche Verhältnis. Schritt
                                 für Schritt entfernte sich die DDR von ihrer ursprünglichen gesamtdeutschen Strategie zugunsten einer klaren Abgrenzungspolitik.
                                 Parallel dazu löste in der Bundesrepublik der Wunsch nach einem "geregelten Nebeneinander" die Hoffnungen auf eine baldige
                                 Wiedervereinigung ab. Der Band behandelt zwei wichtige Aspekte dieser Entwicklung: die jahrelangen Bemühungen um einen Dialog
                                 zwischen FDP und LDPD und die "Westarbeit" der SED. Die Darstellung beruht nicht nur auf den seit der deutschen Einigung zugänglich
                                 gewordenen Quellen, auch Akteuere und Zeugen der damaligen Vorgänge wurden systematisch befragt
