Michael Brown is a Jewish believer in Jesus (he came to faith in 1971 as a heroin-shooting, LSD-using, hippie rock drummer) and he holds a Ph.D. in Near Eastern Languages and Literatures from New York University. He’s written more than 25 books, including wake-up calls to the Church of America, scholarly monographs and commentaries on biblical subjects, a series of volumes on answering Jewish objections to Jesus, and much-discussed books on today’s hottest cultural issues. He has spoken throughout America and in more than 25 countries, and he hosts the nationally syndicated, daily talk radio show The Line of Fire. He is the founder and president of FIRE School of Ministry in Concord, NC and serves as a visiting or adjunct professor at a number of seminaries. He and his wife Nancy have been married since 1976 and have two wonderful daughters and four incredible grandchildren. His heart beats to see a gospel-based moral and cultural revolution in this generation.

Overview
In this collection, Messianic Jewish apologist Michael L. Brown, author, speaker, and radio host, brings a message of reformation, repentance, revival, and revolution. Recognizing the need for a spiritual revolution within the church, he explores what it means to be Christ’s disciples in a secular world. Brown addresses contemporary issues facing the church and illustrates how a radical change within the Body of Christ can positively impact the current generation—locally and globally.
All Scripture passages link to your favorite Bible translation in your library. With Logos’ advanced search features, you can perform powerful searches by topic or Scripture reference—finding, for example, every mention of “Great Commission” or “Micah 6:8.”

Revolution: Jesus’ Call to Change the World
Revolution in the Church: Challenging the Religious System with a Call for Radical Change







Revolution: Jesus’ Call to Change the World

Author: Michael L. Brown
Publisher: Kirkdale Press
Publication Date: 2013
Pages: 339

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




This volume is not a call for the violent overthrow of the government, nor is it a call to take up arms, nor is it a call to political activism in and of itself. It is a call to something far more extreme: a call to live out the Gospel, a call for people of God to impact this generation with the prophetic message of repentance, a call to spark the most sweeping counterculture movement in our nation’s history, a call to take back the moral ground that has been stolen from under our feet, a call to follow Jesus by life or by death. In that sense, it is a call to start a revolution—now!
Join Michael Brown as he highlights the men and women, past and present, who have laid aside lukewarm spirituality and embraced the Great Commission. Revolution: Jesus’ Call to Change the World will challenge you to follow in these figures’ footsteps on the journey to holiness.


If every young person in this nation would read this book and take it to heart, I believe it would be the catalyst for igniting a new Jesus Movement.
—Ché Ahn, senior pastor, Harvest Rock Church, Pasadena, CA
Michael Brown’s teachings have had a profound impact on the men of Sonicflood. I pray that the Holy Spirit will work through Revolution to stir up the lost passion and power of God’s people.
—Jason Halbert, keyboardist, Sonicflood
Revolution has the answers to change the world.
—Jim Burns, president, YouthBuilders
A clarion call from a man who knows the one who calls the signals and shapes our ultimate destiny.
—Winkie Pratney, author of Fire on the Horizon
Michael Brown’s Revolution is the prophetic road map for what will be the greatest youth awakening the West has ever seen.
—Bob Weiner, founder, Weiner Ministries International







Revolution in the Church: Challenging the Religious System with a Call for Radical Change

Author: Michael L. Brown
Publisher: Kirkdale Press
Publication Date: 2013
Pages: 234

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




Revolution in the Church looks at the need for a spiritual revolution, not only in the church, but ultimately in the world.
In a dynamic and lively writing style, Michael Brown exposes erroneous practices and beliefs popular today, challenging you to make some radical transformations. He explores the biblical pattern of leadership, the meaning of true discipleship, the Jewish roots of our faith, and other issues facing the church today.
With its timely and revealing message, Revolution in the Church will be a welcome corroboration of the revolution already taking place in your church—or a penetrating wake-up call to action.


Revolution is not ‘rebelution.’ It is birthed in the spirit and through a right heart. It is the same radical call to live as Jesus did. . . . This book is not for contented pew-sitters or self-satisfied leaders, but for humble, hungry hearts who want more of Jesus.
—Ché Ahn, senior pastor, Harvest Rock Church, Pasadena, CA
