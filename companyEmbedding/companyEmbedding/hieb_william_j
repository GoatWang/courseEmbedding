DNB Financial Corporation Names William J. Hieb Interim Chief Executive Officer






GlobeNewswire



Jan 13, 2016 5:52 PM EST













 




























































 DOWNINGTOWN, Pa., Jan. 13, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- DNB Financial Corporation (NASDAQ:DNBF), today announced that William J. Hieb, 59, the company's president, has been appointed interim chief executive officer, following the death of William S. Latoff on Monday. The company also announced that James H. Thornton has been appointed interim chairperson of the Board of Directors, and that Mary D. Latoff has been elected as a director. With more than 37 years of commercial banking experience, including lending, credit administration and wealth management, Mr. Hieb has served as president of the company since 2005, and as chief risk and credit officer since 2011. He has also been a director of the company since 2005. Mr. Thornton has served as a director of the company since 1995. He is president of Thornton Consulting, a hospital and healthcare consulting firm, and was previously chief executive officer of Brandywine Health System. Ms. Latoff is a former financial officer for Chester County's Department of Human Services and has held various positions with the Chester County Youth Center. Mr. Thornton said, "We are very fortunate to be able to call upon Bill Hieb, who has worked closely with Bill Latoff for more than a decade, to lead DNB on an interim basis. With his tremendous knowledge and experience, Bill will provide strategic direction and continuity, and allow the Board to conduct a comprehensive and thoughtful review to identify the most qualified candidate to serve as CEO on a long-term basis. We expect the review process to be completed within six months." "We are also pleased to welcome Mary Latoff to the Board, and grateful that she will continue to represent her family's interest in DNB, while playing a critical role in shaping the future of our institution," said Mr. Thornton. "Among her accomplishments is financial experience with government and non-profit agencies in our region. Along with her husband Bill, Mary has supported a number of philanthropic organizations."

See what people like you are saying about BeenVerified







Natasha, Oklahoma
Nursing Student
"My daughter recently went out for soccer. I decided it would be a good idea to run another player’s father through BeenVerified. Turns out this guy had been charged with indecent exposure and was on parole."


Maryann, New Jersey
Analyst
"I used BeenVerified to check into a guy that I had met online. It turns out he had lied to me about where he lived and his family. Needless to say, thanks to BV I severed contact with him and have not heard from him since. Thank you BV!"


Bob M, New Jersey
Retired Detective
"I am retired and have a ministry helping the dying and sick. I found a son and the mother was dying of cancer. She held on waiting for her son who had not been in touch for years."


Rhonda, Missouri
Caring Mom
"I'm a single mother dating online and I use BeenVerified to help protect my family!"

Gizmodo.com
"It found my photos on Flickr, my Amazon wishlist, my public Foursquare records, Vimeo, Picassa, and Stumbleupon accounts. It grabbed approximately twelve bajillion photos of me (with many, many false positives) and even more web links."


From the Press
U.S. News & World Report
"BeenVerified easily and inexpensively provides access to public records information through its website and several mobile phone applications. No longer are large corporations the only ones who can afford background checks."
