This SECOND AGREEMENT OF

WHEREAS , the parties hereto have entered into the

thereof, the Receivables Purchase Agreement pursuant to
Section 7.01(b) thereof, the Indenture pursuant to

accordance with the terms and conditions set forth below;
and

NOW, THEREFORE
, in consideration of the mutual
agreements herein contained and other good and valuable
consideration, receipt of which is acknowledged, the parties hereto
agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

RECITALS AND
DEFINITIONS

Section 1.1
Recitals . The foregoing Recitals are hereby
incorporated in and made a part of this Agreement.

Section 1.2
Definitions . Capitalized terms used and not defined
herein have the respective meanings assigned such terms in the
Annex of Definitions attached to the Amended and Restated Transfer
and Servicing Agreement, dated as of October 15, 2003 (as
amended, modified, supplemented, amended or restated or otherwise
modified from time to time, the “ Transfer and Servicing
Agreement ”), by and among Nissan Wholesale Receivables
Corporation II (“ NWRC II ”), as transferor (the
“ Transferor ”), Nissan Master Owner Trust
Receivables, as issuer (the “ Issuer ”), and
Nissan Motor Acceptance Corporation (“ NMAC ”),
as servicer (the “ Servicer ”).

ARTICLE II

MODIFICATIONS

Section 2.1 Agreements
With Respect to the Transfer and Servicing Agreement . As
of the Effective Date:

(a) Section 2.03(c) of the
Transfer and Servicing Agreement shall be modified in its entirety
to read as follows:

“Reassignment upon Breach. If
any breach of any of the representations and warranties set forth
in Section 2.03(a), Section 2.06(f) and
Section 2.08(d) has a material adverse



effect on the Noteholders’
Collateral in Receivables transferred to the Issuer by the
Transferor, then any of the Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee or
the Holders of Notes evidencing at least a majority of the
Outstanding Principal Amount of all Notes of all outstanding
Series, by notice then given in writing to the Transferor (and to
the Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee, the Servicer and any
Series Enhancer if given by the Noteholders), may direct the
Transferor to accept reassignment of all the Receivables (or, at
the Transferor’s option, redesignation of the Accounts
related to such Receivables and reassignment of all Receivables
under such Accounts) transferred by it to the Issuer within 30 days
of such notice, and the Transferor is obligated to accept such
reassignment on the Determination Date immediately succeeding the
expiration of such 30-day period on the terms and conditions set
forth below; provided, however, that no such reassignment is
required to be made if, by the end of such 30-day period, the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 2.03(a)
are satisfied in all material respects, and any material adverse
effect on the Noteholders’ Collateral in Receivables caused
by the breach has been cured.

In connection with any reassignment
pursuant to this Section, the Transferor will deposit into the
Collection Account in immediately available funds on the Business
Day preceding the Payment Date on which such reassignment
obligation arises, in payment for such reassignment, an amount
equal to the sum of the Reassignment Amounts with respect to each
outstanding Series in the related Indenture Supplement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, such
deposited amount will be distributed to the Noteholders on such
Payment Date in accordance with the Indenture and each Indenture
Supplement in payment of their Notes. The Owner Trustee will
execute such documents and instruments of transfer or assignment
and take such other actions as are reasonably requested by the
Transferor to effect the conveyance of such Receivables (or, at the
Transferor’s option, the redesignation of the Accounts
related to such Receivables and conveyance of all Receivables under
such Accounts) pursuant to this Section. If the Owner Trustee, the
Indenture Trustee or the Noteholders give notice directing the
Transferor to accept reassignment of all the Receivables (or, at
the Transferor’s option, redesignation of the Accounts
related to such Receivables and reassignment of all Receivables
under such Accounts) transferred by the Transferor as provided
above, the obligation of the Transferor to accept such reassignment
and make the required deposit into the Collection Account pursuant
to this Section constitutes the sole remedy with respect to an
event of the type specified in the first sentence of this
Section 2.03(c) available to the Noteholders (or the Owner
Trustee, any Series Enhancer or the Indenture Trustee on behalf of
the Noteholders).”

(b) Section 2.04(c) of the
Transfer and Servicing Agreement shall be modified in its entirety
to read as follows:

“Reassignment upon Breach. If
any representation or warranty under Section 2.04(a) is not
true and correct as of the date specified therein and such breach
has a material adverse effect on a Receivable, then, within 30 days
of the earlier to occur of the discovery of any such breach by the
Transferor, or receipt by the Transferor of written notice of any
such breach given by the Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee, the
Servicer or any Series Enhancers, the Transferor will accept
reassignment of such Receivable (or,
 
2



at the Transferor’s option,
redesignation of the Account related to such Receivable and
reassignment of all Receivables under such Account) on the
Determination Date immediately succeeding the expiration of such
30-day period on the terms and conditions set forth in the next
succeeding paragraph; provided, however, that no such reassignment
will be required to be made if, by the end of such 30-day period,
the representations and warranties set forth in
Section 2.04(a) are then true and correct in all material
respects and any material adverse effect caused by the breach has
been cured.

In connection with any reassignment
of a Receivable pursuant to this Section, the Transferor will
direct the Servicer to deduct, subject to the next sentence, the
principal amount of such Receivable from the Pool Balance on or
before the end of the Collection Period in which such reassignment
obligation arises. If such deduction would cause the Adjusted Pool
Balance to fall below the Required Participation Amount, then
(i) pursuant to Section 2.06, the Transferor shall
designate additional Eligible Accounts as Additional Accounts, such
that the Adjusted Pool Balance exceeds the Required Participation
Amount, or (ii) the Transferor shall deposit into the Excess
Funding Account in immediately available funds the Transferor
Deposit Amount; provided, however, that if the Transferor fails to
transfer such Receivable (or, at the Transferor’s option,
redesignate the Account related to such Receivable and transfer all
Receivables under such Account) and Related Security arising in
connection with such Additional Accounts, or if the related
Transferor Deposit Amount is not deposited as required by this
sentence, then the principal amount of such Receivable will not be
deducted from the Pool Balance for purposes of determining whether
the Adjusted Pool Balance has fallen below the Required
Participation Amount and collections in respect of such Receivable
will continue to be included in Interest Collections and Principal
Collections. Upon reassignment of any such Receivable (or, at the
Transferor’s option, redesignation of the Account related to
such Receivable and reassignment of all Receivables under such
Account), but only after the transfer by the Transferor of
Receivables or redesignation of Accounts and transfer of all
Receivables under such Accounts, as applicable, and Related
Security with respect to Additional Accounts or payment by the
Transferor of the Transferor Deposit Amount, if any, the Issuer
will automatically and without further action be deemed to
transfer, assign, set over and otherwise convey to the Transferor,
without recourse, representation or warranty, all the right, title
and interest of the Issuer in and to such Receivable, all Related
Security and all moneys due or to become due with respect thereto
and all proceeds thereof. The Owner Trustee will execute such
documents and instruments of transfer or assignment and take such
other actions as are reasonably requested by the Transferor to
effect the conveyance of such Receivable (or, at the
Transferor’s option, the redesignation of the Account related
to such Receivable and the conveyance of all Receivables under such
Account) pursuant to this Section. The obligation of the Transferor
to accept reassignment of any such Receivable and to pay any
related Transferor Deposit Amount constitutes the sole remedy with
respect to the event of the type specified in the first sentence of
this Section 2.04(c) available to the Noteholders (or the
Owner Trustee, any Series Enhancer or the Indenture Trustee on
behalf of the Noteholders).”

(c) Section 2.08(a) of the
Transfer and Servicing Agreement shall be modified in its entirety
to read as follows:
 
3



“On any date, the Transferor
has the right to redesignate any Eligible Accounts as Redesignated
Accounts and thereby either (x) repurchase from the Issuer the
outstanding related Receivables (or, at the Transferor’s
option, redesignate the Accounts related to such Receivables and
repurchase all Receivables under such Accounts) and all Related
Security in connection with such Redesignated Accounts, including
all amounts then held by the Issuer or thereafter received by the
Issuer in respect of such Receivables or (y) cease the
transfer to the Issuer of Receivables and Related Security arising
in such Redesignated Accounts after the Redesignation
Date.”

(d) Section 2.08(c)(i) of the
Transfer and Servicing Agreement shall be modified in its entirety
to read as follows:

“the Transferor (or the
Servicer on its behalf) will deliver to the Owner Trustee, the
Indenture Trustee and any Series Enhancers a Redesignation Notice,
substantially in the form attached as Exhibit B, specifying such
Redesignation Date on which the redesignation of Receivables (or,
at the Transferor’s option, the Accounts related to such
Receivables and all Receivables under such Accounts) in one or more
Eligible Accounts occurred; and”

(e) Section 2.08(d) of the
Transfer and Servicing Agreement shall be modified in its entirety
to read as follows:

“Representations and
Warranties. The Transferor hereby represents and warrants on each
applicable Redesignation Date as to the matters set forth in clause
(iii) of Section 2.08(b). These representations and
warranties will survive the removal of the respective Receivables
(or, at the Transferor’s option, the redesignation of the
Accounts related to such Receivables and the removal of all
Receivables under such Accounts) and the Related Security from the
Issuer. Upon discovery by the Transferor, the Servicer, the Owner
Trustee, the Indenture Trustee or any Series Enhancers of a
material breach of any of these representations and warranties, the
party discovering such breach will give prompt written notice to
the other parties and to any Series Enhancers. If any such breach
has a material adverse effect on the related Receivable, the
provisions of Section 2.03(c) will apply.”

(f) Section 2.08 of the
Transfer and Servicing Agreement shall be modified to add the
following Section (e) to such Section 2.08:

“(e) Notwithstanding the
foregoing, NMAC hereby agrees that, in the event it elects to
exercise its option to redesignate or remove one or more Accounts
related to Receivables that are required to be repurchased under
the Transaction Documents, it will not as a result purchase
additional Receivables it would not otherwise be required to
repurchase in an amount in excess of 10% of the Outstanding
Principal Balance of all Receivables as of the first day of the
prior calendar quarter.”

(g) Section 3.03(c) of the
Transfer and Servicing Agreement shall be modified in its entirety
to read as follows:
 
4



“(c) Purchase upon Breach. If
any representation or warranty or covenant set forth in clauses
(ix) through (xiii) of Section 3.03(a) is not true
and correct in any material respect as of the date made with
respect to any Receivable and such breach has a material adverse
effect on a Receivable included in the Noteholders’
Collateral, then, within 30 days of the earlier to occur of the
discovery of any such breach by the Servicer, or receipt by the
Servicer of written notice of any such breach given by the Owner
Trustee, the Indenture Trustee, the Transferor or any Series
Enhancers, the Servicer will purchase such Receivable (or, at the
Servicer’s option, redesignate the Account related to such
Receivable and purchase all Receivables under such Account) at the
end of such 30-day period on the terms and conditions set forth in
the next succeeding paragraph; provided, however, that no such
purchase will be required to be made if, by the end of such 30-day
period the representations and warranties are then true and correct
in all material respects and any material adverse effect caused by
the breach has been cured.

The Servicer will effect such
purchase by depositing into the Collection Account in immediately
available funds an amount equal to the Purchase Price of such
Receivable. Upon purchase of any such Receivable (or, at the
Servicer’s option, redesignation of the Account related to
such Receivable and purchase of all Receivables under such
Account), but only after the deposit by the Servicer of the
Purchase Price of such Receivable, the Issuer will automatically
and without further action be deemed to transfer, assign, set over
and otherwise convey to the Servicer, without recourse,
representation or warranty, all the right, title and interest of
the Issuer in and to such Receivable, all Related Security and all
moneys due or to become due with respect thereto and all proceeds
thereof. The Owner Trustee will execute such documents and
instruments of transfer or assignment and take such other actions
as are reasonably requested by the Servicer to effect the
conveyance of such Receivables (or, at the Servicer’s option,
the redesignation of the Accounts related to such Receivables and
the conveyance of all Receivables under such Accounts) pursuant to
this Section. The obligation of the Servicer to purchase any such
Receivable and to deposit the Purchase Price of such Receivable
into the Collection Account, constitutes the sole remedy with
respect to the event of the type specified in the first sentence of
this Section 3.03(c) available to the Noteholders (or the
Owner Trustee or the Indenture Trustee on behalf of the
Noteholders).”

(h) The lead in paragraph of
Section 5.04(a) of the Transfer and Servicing Agreement shall
be modified in its entirety to read as follows:

“The Servicer will indemnify
and hold harmless each of the Issuer, the Owner Trustee, the
Indenture Trustee and any trustees predecessor thereto and their
respective directors, officers, employees and agents from and
against any and all loss, liability, claim, expense, damage or
injury suffered or sustained thereby by reason of (1) any acts
or omissions of the Servicer in connection with this Agreement or
(2) the acceptance or performance of the trusts and duties
contained herein in the case of the Owner Trustee and the Indenture
Trustee; provided, however, that that the Servicer will not
indemnify the Issuer, the Owner Trustee or the Indenture Trustee
for:”

(i) Clause (a) of the
definition of “Authorized Officer” in the Annex of
Definitions shall be modified in its entirety to read as
follows:

Owner Trustee in matters relating to the Issuer and who is
identified on the list of Authorized Officers, containing the

Trustee to the Indenture Trustee on the Series Issuance (as such
list may be modified or supplemented from time to time thereafter)
and any officer of the Administrator who is authorized to act for
the Administrator in matters relating to the Issuer and to be acted
upon by the Administrator pursuant to the Administration Agreement
and who is identified on the list of Authorized Officers
(containing the specimen signatures of such officers) delivered by
the Administrator to the Indenture Trustee on the Series Issuance
(as such list may be modified or supplemented from time to time
thereafter);”

(j) Clause (7) of the

Definitions shall be modified in its entirety to read as
follows:

which eligibility is initially determined or at the end of the
prior month under the Floorplan Financing Agreement or under any
other lender floorplan program; and”

For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

History of Nissan North America
Nissan began selling vehicles in the United States in 1958. In the decades since—from the 1969 debut of the game-changing Z to the 2010 unveiling of LEAF, the world’s first mass-produced 100% electric vehicle—our unwavering commitment to quality and constant pursuit of innovation have made Nissan one of the most prominent automakers in the country today.
