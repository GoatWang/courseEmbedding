Deutsche Multi-Market Income Trust (Omission of Shareholder Proposal), June 24, 2016


















Home | Previous Page





























 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 — Rule 14a-8
Deutsche Multi-Market Income Trust
June 24, 2016
John S. Martin
Vedder Price 
222 North LaSalle Street
Chicago, IL 60601
Re: Deutsche Multi-Market Income Trust — Omission of Shareholder Proposal Submitted by Western Investment, LLC Pursuant to Rule 14a-8
Dear Mr. Martin:
In a letter dated May 27, 2016, on behalf of Deutsche Multi-Market Income Trust, (the “Fund”) you requested confirmation from the staff of the Division of Investment Management that it would not recommend enforcement action to the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) if a shareholder proposal and supporting statement (the “Proposal”) submitted by Western Investment, LLC (the “Proponent”) is omitted from the proxy materials for the Fund’s 2016 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.[1] The Proposal provides:
RESOLVED, that the shareholders of Deutsche Multi-Market Income Trust (“KMM”) hereby request that the Board of Directors of KMM (the “Board”) take the necessary steps to declassify the Board so that all directors are elected on an annual basis. Such declassification shall be completed in a manner that does not affect the unexpired terms of the previously elected directors.
You argue that the Proposal may be excluded pursuant to Rule 14a-8(i)(3) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, because the Proposal contains materially false and misleading statements.
We are unable to concur in your view that the Fund may exclude the Proposal under Rule 14a-8(i)(3). We are unable to conclude that you have demonstrated objectively that the portions of the supporting statement you reference are materially false or misleading in violation of Rule 14a-9. Accordingly, we cannot assure the Fund that we would not recommend enforcement action if the Fund omits the Proposal or portions of the supporting statement from its proxy materials in reliance on Rule 14a-8(i)(3).
Attached is a description of the informal procedures the Division follows in responding to shareholder proposals. If you have any questions or comments concerning this matter, please call me at (202) 551-6966.

Sincerely,
/s/ Marianne Dobelbower
Marianne Dobelbower
Attorney
Division of Investment Management

Investment return and principal value fluctuate with changing market conditions so when sold shares may be worth more or less than the original cost. Performance includes reinvestment of all distributions. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. Please call (800) 349-4281 and speak to a representative to obtain the fund’s most recent performance.   Total return based on market price reflects changes in market value. Total return based on net asset value reflects changes in the fund’s net asset value during each period. Each figure assumes that dividends and capital gains, if any, were reinvested. These figures will differ depending on the level of any discount from or premium to NAV at which the fund’s shares traded during the period. Closed-end funds, unlike open-end funds, are not continuously offered. There is a one time public offering and once issued, shares of closed-end funds are sold in the open market through a stock exchange. Shares of closed-end funds frequently trade at a discount to net asset value. The price of the fund’s shares is determined by a number of factors, several of which are beyond the control of the fund. Therefore, the fund cannot predict whether its shares will trade at, below or above net asset value.Returns during part or all of the periods shown reflect a fee and/or expense waiver. Without this waiver, returns would have been lower and any rankings/ratings might have been less favorable. Expenses of the fund include investment advisory and administration fees and other fund expenses. Total returns shown take into account these fees and expenses.Growth of a $10,000 Investment from 06/30/07 to 06/30/17 06/0706/0906/1106/1306/1506/17Growth Chart$10000$10003$14904$17647$19715$21986SourceSource: Deutsche Asset Management.

    R-002926.8 (4/17)Important Objectives and Risk InformationScheduled Liquidation date: No later than 12/31/18. The fund seeks to provide high income consistent with prudent total return. The fund invests in a range of income-producing securities such as US corporate fixed-income securities and debt obligations of foreign governments, their agencies and instrumentalities which may be denominated in foreign currencies and may not be rated. Closed-end funds, unlike open-end funds, are not continuously offered. There is a one time public offering and once issued, shares of closed-end funds are sold in the open market through a stock exchange. Shares of closed-end funds frequently trade at a discount to net asset value. The price of the fund’s shares is determined by a number of factors, several of which are beyond the control of the fund. Therefore, the fund cannot predict whether its shares will trade at, below or above net asset value.brBond investments are subject to interest-rate, credit, liquidity and market risks to varying degrees. When interest rates rise, bond prices generally fall. Credit risk refers to the ability of an issuer to make timely payments of principal and interest. Investments in lower-quality ("junk bonds") and non-rated securities present greater risk of loss than investments in higher-quality securities. Investing in derivatives entails special risks relating to liquidity, leverage and credit that may reduce returns and/or increase volatility. Leverage results in additional risks and can magnify the effect of any gains or losses. Emerging markets tend to be more volatile and less liquid than the markets of more mature economies, and generally have less diverse and less mature economic structures and less stable political systems than those of developed countries. Investing in foreign securities presents certain risks, such as currency fluctuations, political and economic changes, and market risks.Important Information and Definitions©2017 Morningstar, Inc. All rights reserved. Morningstar, Inc., shall not be responsible for investment decisions, damages or other losses resulting from use of this rating. For each fund with at least a 3-year history, Morningstar calculates a Rating based on a risk-adjusted return measure that accounts for variation in a fund’s monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in a category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.) Effective maturity is the weighted average of the bonds held by the fund taking into consideration any maturity shortening features. Effective duration is an approximate measure of the Fund’s sensitivity to interest rate changes taking into consideration any maturity shortening features.
