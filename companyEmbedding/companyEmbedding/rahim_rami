Shaygan Kheradpir to Step Down as Chief Executive Officer and From Board of Directors, Effective Immediately
SUNNYVALE, CA -- (Marketwired) -- 11/10/14 --
 Juniper Networks (NYSE: JNPR), the industry leader in network innovation, today announced that Rami Rahim has been named chief executive officer, effective immediately. Rahim has also been appointed to the board of directors.


Rahim, a 17-year Juniper Networks veteran, previously served as executive vice president and general manager, Juniper Development and Innovation. In this role, he has been responsible for driving innovation across the Company through the oversight of all research and development programs, strategy, development, and business growth across the portfolio of routing, switching, and security. He has also overseen the ongoing evolution of silicon technology and the Junos® operating system. Rahim started at Juniper as employee #32 and worked as an engineer on Juniper's first product, the M40 core router. Rahim was also one of the original architects of the MX, Juniper's flagship routing platform, and oversaw its exceptional growth.


The board of directors and the executive leadership team remain fully committed to the strategy and financial targets Juniper articulated at its October 30, 2014 Investor Day including the near- and long-term outlook the Company has recently disclosed.


"Rami is the right chief executive officer to lead Juniper," said Scott Kriens, chairman of the board, Juniper Networks. "He is a talented leader who brings deep instincts about the networking industry, and enormous support from our employees and our customers. Rami has succeeded at every challenge he's ever taken on at Juniper, and we couldn't be more excited about his ability to lead this company."


"I am honored to be asked to lead Juniper -- a company I have dedicated 17 years of my career to -- at such an important time in our history," said Rahim. "Juniper employees have truly risen to the challenge this year and that has enabled us to make incredible progress in 2014, including sharpening our focus on the highest-growth segments of the market, optimizing our organizational structure and improving cost management. And we've accomplished this while readying our next wave of great products. I want to thank my talented colleagues around the world for their hard work and dedication. The management team and I remain committed to our strategy and are excited about the opportunities that lie ahead for Juniper."


Shaygan Kheradpir has resigned as chief executive officer and director of the Company. His resignation follows a review by the board of directors of his leadership and his conduct in connection with a particular negotiation with a customer. The board and Kheradpir have different perspectives regarding these matters. The board's review will not result in any adjustments to the Company's financial statements.
