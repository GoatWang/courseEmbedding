I recently learned of this tragic loss of Jerry. You will always have fond memories in our hearts.
If any of the Grundhofer family remembers me, please reach out to Facebook and look for me. I live in Washington State now.

Jerry was the most energetic, fun loving and yet very down to earth fellow.  He always made us laugh and had time to talk and share his stories.  When I read Mick's note on Caring Bridge, I told Bud about the accident.  His first comment was... they must have needed a good carpenter "up there."  Remember your comment Lois.... only the good die young. 
Love to you all, Bud and Bernice Lentz

We are keeping all of you in our thoughts and prayers.  Jerry is going to be missed by all.  Always ready to help out with the trails, grooming and whatever else came his way.  I remember he would come back from grooming and Dick would go over and discuss what needed to be done or what was done.  In deepest sympathy.

After coming back to the Osceola Snowmobile club, I had only know Jerry for about a year. The impressions he had on anyone you talk to about Jerry were great. He was so passionate about family, friends, the tasks he took on, and life itself. He will truly missed.

Michelle, I just want to say how bad I feel for you and your family.  It is one thing to lose a parent from an illness like I did with my dad but to lose your dad from such a tragic accident it is harder to grasp.  Please know that you and your family are in my thoughts and prayers at this difficult and sad time in your lives.  Hugs to you.  I will see you Tuesday.

      ■ Jerry A. Grundhofer worked his way up through the banking world
      to become the president, CEO, and chairman of U.S. Bancorp (USB), the
      nation's eighth-largest bank-holding company. Over his career
      Grundhofer turned around several faltering banks by adhering to his basic
      business principles: maintaining a sales-oriented culture, offering
      high-quality customer service, and instituting major cost-cutting
      measures. Through acquisitions and mergers he turned Star Banc Corporation
      of Cincinnati first into Firstar Corporation of Milwaukee and then into
      U.S. Bancorp of Minneapolis. Firstar made big news when in February 2001
      the company bought USB—run by Grundhofer's brother John,
      well known as "Jack"—for $21 billion and took its
      name. Although family control of large American banks had become very
      rare, the relationship

      between and complementary skills of the Grundhofer brothers smoothed the
      complex integration of these two large corporations.
    

      FOLLOWED HIS BROTHER INTO BANKING
    

      Jerry Grundhofer, his older brother Jack, and a sister were raised in a
      modest home in the Los Angeles suburb of Glendale. Grundhofer's
      father, a bartender, and mother, who worked as a caterer and maid,
      struggled to put their sons through Jesuit schools. Jerry's first
      job was parking cars at church. Jack coached Jerry in baseball. Jerry
      eventually followed his brother through Loyola High School and Loyola
      Marymount University and into the world of banking. As a
       management trainee at Union Bank in Los Angeles, Jack found Jerry a
      summer job in the mailroom.
    

      Following his graduation from college Jerry Grundhofer continued to work
      at Union Bank; in 1981 he became president of the struggling Alliance
      Bank. Two years later Jack Grundhofer convinced his employer, Wells Fargo
      Bank, to hire his brother. As the Grundhofer brothers rose through the
      ranks at Wells Fargo, they adopted the "Wells
      way"—the cost-management principles of the company's
      CEO Carl Reichardt. However, whereas Jack Grundhofer cut costs through
      layoffs and other draconian measures—earning him the nickname
      "Jack the Ripper"—Jerry emphasized the cutting of
      costs through aggressive salesmanship and employee incentives.
    

      In 1987 Robert Smith, the chairman and CEO of Security Pacific Corporation
      in Los Angeles, recruited Jerry Grundhofer to head the company's
      retail-banking business. Over the next three years Grundhofer increased
      the business's net income from $125 million to $425 million, and in
      1990 he was promoted to president and chief operating officer. As Security
      Pacific ran into serious problems, Smith credited Grundhofer with keeping
      earnings up and saving the company from complete disaster. In an article
      in 
      
        Institutional Investor
      
       Jack Milligan quoted Smith as saying, "It's hard not to
      follow Jerry because he believes so much in what he's doing"
      (November 2000). In April 1992 BankAmerica Corporation announced that it
      would acquire Security Pacific. Grundhofer stayed on until May of 1993,
      when he was named president, CEO, and board chairman of Star Banc
      Corporation of Cincinnati.
    

      TURNED STAR BANC INTO FIRSTAR
    

      Grundhofer's reputation grew as he turned Star Banc around with his
      charismatic optimism. Richard Davis told John Engen of 
      
        USBanker
      
       that when Grundhofer called to recruit him to Star Banc, "He said,
      'You know how we always talked about building something from
      scratch and doing things right? This is it—a once-in-a-lifetime
      chance to put all those best practices in place.'…
      There's no better salesperson than Jerry" (February 2004).
      His first address to the senior managers was both a pep talk and a sharing
      of his vision for the troubled company.
    

      Grundhofer walked through the building in his shirt-sleeves, quizzing
      employees about their latest sales coups and their sales
      "pipelines." He became famous for his unorthodox selling
      strategies, telling employees to hand out their business cards in
      grocery-store lines and sponsoring sales contests between groups of
      workers—the winners earned Las Vegas vacations. Grundhofer
      transformed Star Banc into one of the nation's most profitable and
      efficient banks; he topped the record per-share operating earnings for 28
      successive quarters, and Star Banc's stock valuation soared.
    

      Grundhofer's success enabled him to acquire the struggling Firstar
      Corporation of Milwaukee in late 1998. With assets of $15 billion Star
      Banc paid $7.5 billion in stock for Firstar and its $23 billion in assets.
      Grundhofer took the Firstar name and moved his company's
      headquarters to Milwaukee. Known for his effective communication with Wall
      Street, Grundhofer convinced analysts that the move was an inspired one.
    

      TURNED FIRSTAR AROUND
    

      Under Grundhofer the "Wells way" became the "Firstar
      way." He continued to follow his philosophy of efficiency and cost
      cutting while making strategic investments and providing employee
      incentives. He told Milligan, "Being a low-cost provider gives one
      a tremendous strategic advantage. It allows you to deal with challenges,
      be competitive on the asset and liability sides of the balance sheet, and
      take care of customers" (November 2000).
    

      Whereas many banks were notorious for their high worker-turnover rates and
      low-quality service, at Firstar Grundhofer created an employee-motivating
      meritocracy. Bonuses and stock options were based on revenues and customer
      service. Grundhofer gave branch managers more authority; they became
      responsible for their own profit-and-loss statements and were instructed
      to reward performance by augmenting base salaries by up to 40 to 50
      percent. Underperforming managers were fired.
    

      Analysts were stunned when in early 1999, just months after the Star
      Banc–Firstar merger, Firstar paid $10 billion for Mercantile
      Bancorp of St. Louis, a regional holding company with $33 billion in
      assets. Grundhofer admitted that he would have liked to have moved more
      slowly but, as with his later acquisitions, believed that he
      couldn't afford to wait.
    

      Firstar's earnings continued to rise. Over Grundhofer's
      three years of leadership Firstar increased in size eightfold. He
      emphasized low-cost retail products and taught his employees how to sell.
      At his monthly meetings with the heads of the 23 major business lines
      Grundhofer stressed the principle of "operating
      leverage"—the constant pushing of costs below 50 percent of
      revenue. Each Firstar business unit was committed to a "Five-Star
      Service Guarantee." Retail customers would receive $5 each for an
      inaccurate statement, a teller-line wait of more than five minutes,
      failure to receive a same-day answer to a query, lack of access to a
      telephone representative, or a closed or malfunctioning ATM.
    

      Grundhofer summed up his approach to management for the 
      
        Business Journal–Milwaukee
      
      : "Our philosophy is to give customers what they want, when they
      want it, and on their own terms. Also, we put the highest priority on
      increasing the value of our shareholders' investment in Firstar
      Corporation. It is the reason that we come to work each day" (May
      5, 2000).
    

      ACQUIRED U.S. BANCORP
    

      In 2001 Grundhofer made his boldest move yet in acquiring U.S.
      Bancorp—run by Jack Grundhofer—for $86 billion. Investors
      worried that Grundhofer was moving too fast, particularly in light of
      other recent—and sometimes disastrous—large bank mergers,
      but USB was attractive and affordable. Jack believed that USB had not been
      growing fast enough and needed a larger base; Jerry believed that Firstar
      had to move immediately so as not to lose USB to a competitor.
    

      After the acquisition Firstar took the USB name and moved its headquarters
      to Minneapolis. Jerry Grundhofer became president and CEO of the
      country's eighth-largest commercial bank, while Jack was chairman
      of the combined board of directors. The brothers saw the two companies as
      a perfect match, with Firstar providing high-quality, low-cost retail
      banking and customer loyalty and USB providing investmentbanking services,
      primarily through its Piper Jaffray subsidiary. In addition USB had access
      to western consumer markets that were growing at an average of 7.5 percent
      a year—twice the rate of midwestern metropolitan markets. USB also
      had transaction-processing and commercial-payments businesses, offering
      ATM services and corporate credit cards, that were growing by 20 percent
      annually. Milligan quoted Grundhofer as commenting, "We know how to
      compete if we have a distribution system, and U.S. Bancorp gives us that.
      We'll combine the values of the heartland with the growth markets
      of the West. This is a story made for fairy tales and history
      books" (November 2000).
    

      The reunion of the Grundhofer brothers made headlines. Milligan quoted
      Jerry Grundhofer as having once said, "Jack and I are pretty
      similar. We think about things the same way. We run our companies pretty
      much the same way" (November 2000). However, although both brothers
      believed in drastic cost cutting, Jack acknowledged that Jerry not only
      had more experience with large retail-branch operations but worked within
      a different model; Jack decided that Jerry's model would be the
      ideal one for USB. The brothers had offices down the hall from each other
      and made decisions together on a daily basis.
    

      EXPANDED USB
    

      Milligan quoted Jerry Grundhofer as saying, "We have the mental
      toughness to win. There's no acceptance around here for not making
      it" (November 2000). Analysts and employees seemed to agree that
      not only was Grundhofer tough but his infectious enthusiasm enabled him to
      sell his vision effectively while maintaining a long-term perspective.
    

      Grundhofer chose to integrate the two companies over a relatively long
      period of time, so as to minimize disruptions to employees and customers.
      In an address to an 
      
        American Banker
      
       conference Grundhofer stressed the importance of retail-branch banking:
      "Brick and mortar is not dead, and it's not going away. The
      branch office remains the center of the customer relationship"
      (February 26, 2002).
    

      While cutting costs and eliminating USB's many-layered bureaucracy,
      Grundhofer expanded retail services, especially in California, where, just
      as analysts had predicted, USB began buying up retail banks. The company
      opened student-loan, auto-leasing and home-mortgage units; it introduced
      investment and insurance products. By the summer of 2003 USB had 220
      branches in California alone and had become the nation's largest
      real-estate lender. That summer U.S. Bank, a USB subsidiary, undertook a
      major push into corporate banking in downtown Los Angeles. Grundhofer made
      other acquisitions, including Leading Mortgage Company of Defiance, Ohio,
      and Nova Corporation of Atlanta, the country's third-largest
      payment processor. Grundhofer also spun off Piper Jaffray.
    

      MANAGEMENT STYLE
    

      Following Jack's retirement at the end of 2002 Jerry Grundhofer
      became USB's chairman as well as its president and CEO. As of 2004
      U.S. Bancorp had assets of more than $189 billion, operating nearly 2,300
      bank offices and 4,500 ATMs in 24 states. The company continued to offer
      Firstar's "Five-Star Service Guarantee." In May 2004
      Grundhofer announced that he had no plans to make further major
      acquisitions.
    

      In addition to bringing Firstar's branch strategies to USB,
      Grundhofer brought its meritocracy. Annual bonuses for senior managers
      were tied to performance; analysts credited Grundhofer with developing one
      of the best bank-management teams in the country. In February 2002
      Grundhofer announced that all employees would be eligible for stock
      options, including part-timers.
    

      USB's former chief financial officer Andy Cecere told Engen of 
      
        USBanker
      
      , "Jerry runs this very large company like a small company, with a
      lot of focus and engagement, and he works hard to keep things
      simple"; the acting CFO David Moffett noted, "There are a
      lot of CEOs who love being CEO more than they love the business.
      That's not the case with Jerry. He loves to sell, and he
      cares" (February 2004).

Jerry Grundhofer (born 1945) is the former CEO and Chairman of U.S. Bancorp. He graduated from Seattle University in 1965. In 1993, he became the president of Star Banc Corporation and held that position until 1998, when it merged with Firstar Corporation. He had been the CEO of U.S. Bancorp since February 2001, and had been Chairman of the Board since 2002. Jerry Grundhofer stepped down as CEO on December 12, 2006 and was replaced by his longtime lieutenant Richard K. Davis who assumed the position of CEO in addition to his current role as President. Jerry Grundhofer was to remain as Chairman of the Board of Directors until the end of 2007 when he was scheduled to retire. Jerry was a former Vice-President of Security Pacific Bank and Bank of America when that institution bought out Security Pacific Bank in the early 1990s. He left Bank of America to join Star Banc Corporation in 1993.
Jerry Grundhofer received $17.98 million in total compensation in 2005 which included stock options and other forms of compensation. In 2006, he received $32.28 million in total compensation an increase of over 79.5% per year over the previous year while US Bancorp's stock price and return on equity increased 20% and 23% respectively during the same period.
He also served as vice chairman of Bank of America (BAC) and was on the board of Lehman Brothers.[1]
In March 2009, Citigroup announced the appointment of Grundhofer to its board of directors in order to take advantage from his broad banking experience in a time when Citi was facing serious financial trouble. In July, 2009, he was appointed Chairman of a newly independent board of the group's subsidiary Citibank. He also led the board's risk management and finance committee and was a member of its nomination and governance committee. In June, 2011, Grundhofer resigned suddenly from the board to "spend time on other interests," according to board chair Richard Parsons. "Jerry's ... a critical part of the last couple of years with various regulatory bodies.... [His] experience and track record was very, very helpful there," another board member and former CEO of Bank of Hawaii, Michael O'Neill, was quoted saying at the time.[2]

Contentious material about living persons that is unsourced or poorly sourced must be removed immediately, especially if potentially libelous or harmful. (August 2013) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


Jerry Grundhofer (born 1945) is the former CEO and Chairman of U.S. Bancorp. He graduated from Seattle University in 1965. In 1993, he became the president of Star Banc Corporation and held that position until 1998, when it merged with Firstar Corporation. He had been the CEO of U.S. Bancorp since February 2001, and had been Chairman of the Board since 2002. Jerry Grundhofer stepped down as CEO on December 12, 2006 and was replaced by his longtime lieutenant Richard K. Davis who assumed the position of CEO in addition to his current role as President. Jerry Grundhofer was to remain as Chairman of the Board of Directors until the end of 2007 when he was scheduled to retire. Jerry was a former Vice-President of Security Pacific Bank and Bank of America when that institution bought out Security Pacific Bank in the early 1990s. He left Bank of America to join Star Banc Corporation in 1993.
Jerry Grundhofer received $17.98 million in total compensation in 2005 which included stock options and other forms of compensation. In 2006, he received $32.28 million in total compensation an increase of over 79.5% per year over the previous year while US Bancorp's stock price and return on equity increased 20% and 23% respectively during the same period.
He also served as vice chairman of Bank of America (BAC) and was on the board of Lehman Brothers.[1]
In March 2009, Citigroup announced the appointment of Grundhofer to its board of directors in order to take advantage from his broad banking experience in a time when Citi was facing serious financial trouble. In July, 2009, he was appointed Chairman of a newly independent board of the group's subsidiary Citibank. He also led the board's risk management and finance committee and was a member of its nomination and governance committee. In June, 2011, Grundhofer resigned suddenly from the board to "spend time on other interests," according to board chair Richard Parsons. "Jerry's ... a critical part of the last couple of years with various regulatory bodies.... [His] experience and track record was very, very helpful there," another board member and former CEO of Bank of Hawaii, Michael O'Neill, was quoted saying at the time.[2]

Jerry Grundhofer (born 1945) is the former CEO and Chairman of U.S. Bancorp. He graduated from Seattle University in 1965. In 1993, he became the president of Star Banc Corporation and held that position until 1998, when it merged with Firstar Corporation. He had been the CEO of U.S. Bancorp since February 2001, and had been Chairman of the Board since 2002. Jerry Grundhofer stepped down as CEO on December 12, 2006 and was replaced by his longtime lieutenant Richard K. Davis who assumed the position of CEO in addition to his current role as President. Jerry Grundhofer was to remain as Chairman of the Board of Directors until the end of 2007 when he was scheduled to retire. Jerry was a former Vice-President of Security Pacific Bank and Bank of America when that institution bought out Security Pacific Bank in the early 1990s. He left Bank of America to join Star Banc Corporation in 1993.
Jerry Grundhofer received $17.98 million in total compensation in 2005 which included stock options and other forms of compensation. In 2006, he received $32.28 million in total compensation an increase of over 79.5% per year over the previous year while US Bancorp's stock price and return on equity increased 20% and 23% respectively during the same period.
He also served as vice chairman of Bank of America (BAC) and was on the board of Lehman Brothers.[1]
In March 2009, Citigroup announced the appointment of Grundhofer to its board of directors in order to take advantage from his broad banking experience in a time when Citi was facing serious financial trouble. In July, 2009, he was appointed Chairman of a newly independent board of the group's subsidiary Citibank. He also led the board's risk management and finance committee and was a member of its nomination and governance committee. In June, 2011, Grundhofer resigned suddenly from the board to "spend time on other interests," according to board chair Richard Parsons. "Jerry's ... a critical part of the last couple of years with various regulatory bodies.... [His] experience and track record was very, very helpful there," another board member and former CEO of Bank of Hawaii, Michael O'Neill, was quoted saying at the time.[2]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
