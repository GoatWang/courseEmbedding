Nicholas T. Pinchuk


          	Snap-On CEO Leads By Example


                          By Roy Asfar                          
Mar 25, 2010















Snap-on CEO Nicholas T. Pinchuk is a proud Vietnam Veteran seasoned in the boardroom, lab, and factory floor, who brings a spirit of innovation and high-tech savvy to our nation’s pre-eminent tool supplier for professionals.


A product of the ROTC program with a graduate degree in electrical engineering from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and an MBA from Harvard, Pinchuk values teamwork and camaraderie. They make for superior employees, franchise operators and business partners.
“In Vietnam, you learned the lesson of being confident and collected under pressure. And what you saw more graphically than in any other situation is that in such a pressure environment, your team can get rattled, but they look to you, as their leader, for stability,” he tells Veterans Advantage in an exclusive interview. “They will take their cues from you.  They will be confident or concerned, depending on how you react to the situation.”
“This is true, whether you are in a war zone, a factory or a board room,” he adds.

Pinchuk served in the Army Signal Corps in 1970 and 1971, which included a formative year in Vietnam, where he grew to value composure under pressure, while enjoying the camaraderie of his fellow soldiers. He eventually left the Army as a Captain and pursued his civilian career. The Troy, New York native received a “classical” education, participated in intercollegiate sports, and enjoyed a rich graduate school experience, which included research in the development of the Viking Probe which reached Mars in 1976. 
As a son of a Veteran who saw action on the beaches of the Pacific, Pinchuk has a keen appreciation of past wars. He travelled to the site of the famous Battle of Saipan, and called his excited and emotional dad on a cell phone to share the experience.
“Those guys had tremendous courage. You look at the terrain, and say ‘they stormed this?’ It really gave you an extraordinary feeling of sacrifice that soldiers made in World War II,” Pinchuk recalls.

The experiences of Pinchuk's military service translate to his company today. Snap-on serves a number of customer segments where composure is important. The company prides itself as the premium priced leader in its field, because it has to be: Its complex array of 65,000 product SKUs is for the serious professional who performs the most essential tasks. Its signature Snap-on Flank Drive wrenching system is not for the weekend warrior, but it is necessary for professionals performing work where reliability and repeatability are paramount; Snap-on manufactures tools and other solutions for a broad spectrum of critical industries where the mission is absolutely critical.  And this, of course, includes the military where Snap-on solutions range from repair systems for Army tanks, humvees and artillery maintenance sets, to maintenance sets for the Black Hawk helicopter and Navy Osprey. Adds, Pinchuk, “When lives are on the line, you can depend on Snap-on.”
The company makes a concerted effort to hire military veterans, or retain them as franchisees through its franchise discount program for veterans.
“I think Corporate America has a responsibility to help people coming out of it [the military] . . .try to get them jobs . . . look to employ them,” he says. “It’s in a corporation’s interest to recognize the special skills and personal characteristics developed in the military.”
Managers “value those who are effective in a team environment.  Veterans have that character in abundance,” he adds.
Snap-on has a rich tradition in serving its markets, and is called on at times by the U.S. government to customize tools to meet certain objectives. The Corporation prides itself on cutting-edge technology, and offers innovative products ranging from laser-based tire balancers to ratchet sets, made especially for smaller hybrid vehicles.
“We make work easier for serious professionals doing critical tasks . . .like keeping cars moving, planes flying and factories running,” Pinchuk said. “We like it when technology changes; it gives us new opportunities to serve professionals.”
PROFESSIONAL BACKGROUND
Pinchuk was elected Snap-on Chairman in April, 2009, and has served as President and Chief Executive Officer since December 2007. Previously, he was the Corporation’s Chief Operating Officer and Senior Vice President and President - Worldwide Commercial and Industrial Group. In prior positions, he was president, global refrigeration operations for Carrier Corporation, a subsidiary of United Technologies Corporation. Pinchuk also served in a number of executive, operational, planning and financial capacities within Carrier and United Technologies, including: president, Asia-Pacific air conditioning operations; vice president, strategic planning; and chief financial officer, Carrier International Corporation. Before joining United Technologies, he was with the Ford Motor Company, where he held various financial and engineering positions. Pinchuk serves as a member of the Board of Directors of Columbus McKinnon Corporation and of the National Association of Manufacturers.

Good day and welcome to the Snap-on Incorporated 2015 Third Quarter Results Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded.
At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Leslie Kratcoski. Please go ahead, ma'am.
Leslie H. Kratcoski - Vice President-Investor Relations
Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today to review Snap-on's third quarter results, which are detailed in our press release issued earlier this morning.

Additional information and the factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are contained in our SEC filings.
With that said, I'll now turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick?
Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Leslie. Morning, everybody. As usual, I'll start with the third quarter highlights, provide an update on the environment and speak a bit about our trends. Aldo will then provide a detailed review of the financials.
In the third quarter, we again showed progress along our runways for growth and for improvement, and we saw those gains across our operating segments. Organic sales were up 7.3% from last year. Opco operating margin, it reached 17.5%, up 130 basis points. When you add the $43.5 million in operating earnings from Financial Services, up from $37.7 million in 2014, the consolidated operating margin was 21.2%, an increase of 160 basis points. And EPS, EPS was $1.98, up $0.22 or 12.5% from the $1.76 of last year.
Our reported sales increase was 1.9% including the impact of unfavorable foreign currency. And in this quarter, that total was $42.6 million, about the same as the second quarter. Adding the incremental $2.1 million sales from our third quarter acquisition of Ecotechnics, the total reported sales for the period were $821.5 million.
For automotive repair businesses, the environment continues to be favorable. Actually, it's been that way for a while. And our Tools Group and Repair Systems & Information, our RS&I Group, are both well positioned to take full advantage. You can see it in the performance, another quarter of solid gains for both groups, advancing along our runways for growth. Clearly, the Tools Group demonstrated enhancements to the franchise network, gains in all its markets, continuing to take advantage of the opportunities that are so abundant in a changing vehicle fleet, not only in the United States, but in places like the UK and Australia. And RS&I, with strong sales across North America and parts of Europe, double-digit growth in the U.S. and modest gains in Western Europe, offsetting the continuing softness in Eastern Europe and particularly in Russia. RS&I progress achieved with independent repair shop owners and managers, and with OEM dealerships, advanced by our latest diagnostics and undercar product offerings.

For the Commercial & Industrial, our C&I Group, we overcame some increased headwinds with the overall organic sales rise offsetting mixed environments across industries and across geographies. That said, in the third quarter, our European based hand tool businesses and our Asia Pacific operations recorded high-single-digit gains overcoming the turbulence within their particular markets.
Now our Industrial division did have some headwinds in the period, impacted by weak U.S. military volume and slowdowns in our oil and gas activity. We've consistently mentioned the uncertainty associated with the military. In the third quarter, that caution materialized and our results included a double-digit decrease. Measured spending and budget constraints making the present tight and the future even more difficult to predict.
Within our Natural Resources segment, volume in oil and gas was down substantially. You see it in oil prices, and you read about it in the newspapers. And despite our small share and opportunities for penetration, we were impacted. But that said, saying that, there will always be headwinds. They've been a factor in other quarters and they were present in the third quarter and we overcame, because we're well positioned to confront the challenges and proceed down all our runways for growth, enhancing the franchise network, expanding the repair shop owners and managers, extending the critical industries and building in emerging markets. These do represent the avenues for advancement and there has been consistent progress along each of those paths.
At the same time, those growth drivers are joined and supported by the benefits of Snap-On value creation, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement, or RCI, these are the processes, the tools we use each and every day to drive improvements, but this quarter we especially benefited from customer connection and innovation.
Customer connection: Snap-on's continuing pursuit of understanding of work derived from the hours and the days we spend with professionals. Innovation: taking that practical insight and matching it with the possibilities of modern technologies. And in the quarter, those processes resulted in more prestigious product awards for the corporation. We were again honored with two MOTOR Magazine Top 20 Tool Awards. The winners this time are 3/8-inch Drive Steering Rack Sockets and our SOLUS Edge diagnostic handheld.
Let's talk about the steering rack socket. The S6229 was developed from a customer connection derived from direct observation of work and from conversations with multiple technicians. This innovative tool allows the tech to replace power steering O-rings without removing the whole steering assembly, saving up to an hour of labor, clearly making work easier and professional repair more productive.
In addition, also created out of deep insight in the repair process, the innovative SOLUS Edge coverage for hundreds of vehicle systems, including hybrid, TPMS, steering and clean diesel, and it all comes loaded with our Fast-Track Troubleshooter database with its vehicle specific tips, tests and time savers. The SOLUS Edge is enhanced coverage for over 40 car makes without the cost or complexity of factory scan tools. And for all its power, for all its strength, it's easy to use. The large 8-inch touch-screen display is an aid to visibility and the software provides accurate results in as little as 30 seconds, quick.
I mention these awards because they're just the most recent recognitions of a growing list of very popular products that provide unique advantages, created by the observations of our franchisees and direct salespeople who are committed to translating that insight into productivity innovations, and that broad value creation is reflected in the positive results registered across all our operating groups again this quarter.

Now let's focus on those individual groups. Starting with Commercial & Industrial, organic sales were up 3.4%, operating margins reached 14.3%, up 60 basis points from last year's 13.7%, growth along with the benefits of Snap-on value creation. Now I said, as we said, there are headwinds, but our Industrial direct salesmen have been expanding their reach nevertheless into sectors like railroads, up double-digits, growing our presence, offering a wider variety of tools and tool control solutions.
We've spoken in the past about building our understanding of work in critical industries, expanding our customer connections. Well, one way that's happening is by using our experience in RCI, participating in customer Lean events, participating in the customer sponsored Lean events, our team was able to assist in improving railroad operations, while at the same time gaining a better understanding of their work processes, their product requirements, their business needs and their overall industry direction, all key customer connections gained through Lean event participation.
One of the tools conceived from those insights was our special extendable line of tube wrenches, great for heavy-duty work on railroad cars and tracks. Made in our Elizabethton, Tennessee plant, these tube wrenches replace the traditional slugging wrenches in railroad applications, allowing the operator better access, eliminating the need for costly two-person slugging procedures and making work easier, safer and more productive.
Let's speak about SNA Europe. Now, eight quarters in a row of year-over-year growth, navigating through some of the most difficult geographies and tepid economies. SNA Europe activities continues to be encouraged – activity continues to be encouraging, but its profits are even more positive, now up significantly for 10 straight quarters. And we believe there's much more room for further gains.
And related to our Asia Pacific operations, the environments are mixed, but we had overall gains with upward movement in places like Thailand and Indonesia and Vietnam. Actually it's nice to see progress in Vietnam, that emerging Southeast Asia nation. So that provides a bit of color on C&I.
Now, on to the Tools Group. Organic sales up 11%, 11%, significant growth in the U.S. and internationally. Operating income $56.3 million compared to $49.5 million in 2014. Operating income margins of 14.8% rose 90 basis points from last year's 13.9%. The additional volume as well as operating improvements from RCI translated into significant margin improvement, and that 90 basis point gain overcame 120 basis points of negative currency.
When you consider the Tools Group's success, you see the power of Snap-on value creation, and the benefits of our award-winning innovative new products. Besides the MOTOR Top 20 award, the Tools Group also received recognition from the readers of Professional Tool & Equipment News, gaining five People's Choice selections for new tool innovation products, once again born at the intersection between customer connection insight and advanced technology wielded by our innovation teams, products like the KRL, 72-inch Roll Cab with its Power Tool Organizer System, the powerful and light CT8850, 18-volt cordless impact wrench, our new brake caliper press, our new advanced battery system tester with its print capability, and our new EET2 full view welding helmet, all selected by the readers of PTEN Magazine and by our technician customers as great new products, products that make work easier and products that provide further evidence of Snap-on innovation.
You might remember that the third quarter is also when we hold the annual Snap-on Franchisees Conference, our SFC. This year it was in Washington, D.C., with more than 8,000 attendees, franchise and family members from over 3,000 routes, three days of showcasing the opportunities to enhance the franchise channel, to amplify the power of our van space and of our franchisees' time. And based on the optimism and the confidence of our franchisees, it was a strong success. And by the way, orders were up once again, beating the record level achieved in 2014.

When we speak of the van channel, we also have to consider the very strategic contributions of Snap-on Credit. Our Financial Services arm helps create opportunities across our organization, but especially within the Tools Group and Credit had a strong presence at the SFC. Supporting franchisees with unique programs, enabling sales of those big ticket items, which are so essential to franchisee success. And in the third quarter, Financial Services OI was up $5.8 million or 15.4%, another period of powerful contribution to the organization.
Let's move to RS&I. Organic sales were up 8.2%. The operating margin of 24.6%, it increased 130 basis points from 23.3% just last year. RS&I was charged with expanding our presence to repair shop owners and managers and in the quarter, it did just that. We once again had growth in our businesses providing repair, information and diagnostics to independents. In fact, we appear to be gaining traction across many dimensions in automotive, in medium and in heavy duty garages, serving both OEM dealerships as well as those independent shops, all fueled by our expanding product offering. And one of those great RS&I product came from our diagnostics division, demonstrating its continuing innovation.
Our diagnostics team launched its new VERUS Edge handheld, an enhanced top-of-the-line offering. Thinner, lighter, including important features like five-second ready-to-use capability, five-hour battery life, a solid state hard drive for increased durability and, of course, access to our unique integrated SureTrack real-world fixes based on masses of actual repair data, all features guided by effective customer connection input.
In the VERUS Edge, we believe we have in it a winner, advancing the state-of-the-art and addressing the most serious of repair challenges, and initial sales of breaking the records and exceeding our expectations.
Also in the third quarter and with the focus on heavy duty shops, RS&I introduced the latest generation of its proprietary vehicle interface, the Nexiq USB-Link 2, now with Wi-Fi connectivity. It extends our leading position by adding wireless capabilities to the already successful family of Nexiq heavy duty diagnostics product. The USB-Link 2 is compatible with heavy duty diagnostic applications for engines, transmission, ABS and instrument clusters and much more. It supports virtually every standardized vehicle network protocol and nearly every software application in vehicle sectors like construction, agriculture, and of course heavy duty truck.
Five times the speed of its predecessors with 16 times the memory, the USB-Link 2 is perfect for dealership, fleets, and truck shops. It speeds the repair times of these particularly mission critical vehicles and it improves technician productivity. It's a great upgrade to an already successful product of our RS&I group.
Also in the third quarter, our equipment division registered high single-digit growth with strong volume in North America, helping to offset the Russian market, which is our primary headwind in Eastern Europe. Overall, undercar gains in the U.S. were quite solid with especially impressive increase – sales increases at our Challenger Lifts division. Challenger has been a great addition to our Snap-on team and it improved again this quarter and we believe there is much more to come, helping RS&I to expand with repair shop owners and managers. RS&I, great new product, with demonstrated growth in diagnostics, heavy duty and undercar equipment, and all of that played out in the third quarter results.
Well, that's the highlights of our quarter. Organic sales up 7.3%, gains across all groups, clear progress along our runways for growth. Snap-on Value Creation at the forefront of our activities, customer connection leading to innovation, creating powerful new products, RCI driving improvement and it all shows in the results, OI margin to 17.5%, up 130 basis points. It was an encouraging quarter.

Now, I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo?
Aldo J. Pagliari - Senior Vice President-Finance and Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Nick. Our third quarter consolidated operating results are summarized on slide six. Net sales of $821.5 million in the quarter were up 7.3% organically.
On a reported basis, net sales including $42.6 million of unfavorable foreign currency, increased to 1.9%. As you know, Snap-on has significant international operations and is subject to foreign currency fluctuations. Largely due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, foreign currency movements adversely impacted our Q3 sales comparisons by 570 basis points.
Net sales in the third quarter also included $2.1 million of sales from our July 2015 acquisition of Ecotechnics, a designer and manufacturer of automatic vehicle air conditioning maintenance equipment for OEM dealerships and independent repair shops.
Consolidated gross profit of $406.9 million increased $13 million from 2014 levels, primarily due to the higher sales and savings from RCI initiatives, partially offset by 30 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. The gross margin of 49.5% in the quarter improved 60 basis points from 48.9% a year ago.
Operating expenses were $263.3 million in both the third quarters of 2015 and 2014. The operating expense margin of 32% improved 70 basis points from 2014 levels, primarily due to benefits from sales volume leverage, partially offset by higher pension expense.
No restructuring costs were included in operating earnings in the third quarter of 2015. Last year, we incurred $2 million of such costs.
As a result of these factors, operating earnings before Financial Services of $143.6 million in the quarter, including $11.9 million or 50 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased 10% and, as a percentage of sales, improved 130 basis points to 17.5%. Financial Services revenue of $61.1 million in the quarter increased 14% from 2014 levels and operating earnings of $43.5 million increased 15.4%. These increases primarily reflect the continued growth of the Financial Services portfolio.
Consolidated operating earnings of $187.1 million in the quarter, including $12.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects increased 11.2%, and the operating margin of 21.2% improved 160 basis points from 19.6% a year ago.
Our third quarter effective income tax rate of 31.6% compared with 31.8% last year. Finally, net earnings of $116.8 million or $1.98 per diluted share, increased to $13.1 million or $0.22 per share, representing a 12.5% increase in diluted earnings per share.
Now let's turn to our segment results. Starting with the Commercial & Industrial, or C&I Group on slide 7, sales of $288.5 million in the quarter were up 3.4% organically, driven primarily by high single-digit gains in both the segment's European-based hand tools business, and Asia-Pacific operations, and a double-digit increase in the segment's power tools operations. These sales increases were partially offset by a mid single-digit decline in sales to customers in critical industries, primarily reflecting lower sales to the military and to customers in the oil and gas sector.
Gross profit in the C&I Group of $109.5 million in the quarter decreased $2.3 million from 2014 levels, while the gross margin of 37.9% improved 50 basis points, principally due to savings from RCI initiatives and lower restructuring costs.
Operating expenses of $68.2 million in the quarter decreased $2.8 million from 2014 levels, and the operating expense margin of 23.6% improved 10 basis points from 23.7% last year. As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the C&I segment of $41.3 million, including $2.9 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased $0.5 million from 2014 levels, and the operating margin of 14.3% improved 60 basis points.

Turning now to slide 8. Third quarter sales on the Snap-on Tools Group of $380.6 million increased 11% organically, reflecting continued double-digit gains in both the company's U.S. and international franchise operations. Gross profit of $166.5 million in the quarter increased $11.7 million from 2014 levels and the gross margin of 43.8% improved 20 basis points.
Benefits from the higher sales and savings from RCI initiatives were largely offset by 110 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses of $110.2 million in the quarter increased $4.9 million from 2014 levels, and the operating expense margin of 29% improved 70 basis points, principally due to sales volume leverage.
As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $56.3 million increased $6.8 million, and the operating margin of 14.8% improved 90 basis points including $6.8 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects.
Turning to the Repair Systems & Information, or RS&I Group shown on slide 9. Sales of $282.9 million in the quarter increased 8.2% organically. The organic sales increase primarily reflects a double-digit gain in sales to OEM dealerships, a high single-digit increase in sales of undercar equipment, and a mid single-digit gain in sales of diagnostics and repair information products through independent repair shop owners and managers.
Gross profit of $130.9 million increased $3.6 million over 2014 levels. Gross margin of 46.3% in the quarter decreased 60 basis points from 46.9% last year, primarily due to a shift in sales that included higher volumes of lower gross margin products, including increased essential tool and micellization sales to OEM dealerships, partially offset by lower restructuring cost.
Operating expenses of $61.2 million in the quarter decreased $2.8 million from 2014 levels. The operating expense margin of 21.7% improved 190 basis points, mostly due to sales volume leverage including benefits from the sales shift noted above.
Third quarter operating earnings for the RS&I Group of $69.7 million, including $2.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased $6.4 million from prior year levels, and the operating margin of 24.6% improved 130 basis points.
Now turning to slide 10. In the third quarter, operating earnings from Financial Services of $43.5 million on revenue of $61.1 million compared with operating earnings of $37.7 million on revenue of $53.6 million last year. The average yield on finance receivables of 17.9% in the quarter compared with 17.6% last year, and the average yield on contract receivables was 9.5% in both years. Originations of $257.6 million increased 16.2% from 2014 levels.
Moving to slide 11, as of quarter end, our balance sheet includes $1.53 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.33 billion from our U.S. Snap-on credit operation. Approximately 80% of our U.S. financing portfolio relates to extended credit loans to technicians. During the quarter, our worldwide finance portfolio grew approximately $62 million. As for finance portfolio losses and delinquency trends, these continue to be in line with our expectations.
Now, turning to slide 12. Cash provided by operations of $113.7 million in the quarter increased $25.7 million from comparable 2014 levels, primarily reflecting higher net earnings in 2015 and net changes in operating assets and liabilities. Net cash used by investing activities of $86.9 million included $55.9 million to fund a net increase in finance receivables. Third quarter capital expenditures of $18.5 million in 2015 compared to $22.3 million last year. Cash used in investing activities in the quarter also included $13.1 million for the acquisition of Ecotechnics.
Turning to slide 13, days sales outstanding for trade receivables was 61 days at both quarter end and 2014 year end. Inventories increased $52.2 million from 2014 year end levels, primarily to support continued higher customer demand and new product introductions as well as inventories related to the Ecotechnics acquisition. On a trailing 12 month basis, inventory turns of $3.4 million compared with 3.6 turns a year ago. Our quarter end cash position of $119.2 million decreased $13.7 million from 2014 year end levels.

The net decrease includes the impact of funding, $629.2 million of new finance receivables, the repurchase of 670,000 shares for $101.6 million, dividend payments of $92.5 million, and capital expenditures of $64.3 million. These cash decreases were largely offset by $476.6 million of cash from collections of finance receivables, $352.1 million of cash from operations, net of $30 million of discretionary cash contribution to the company's domestic pension plans, and $39.7 million of cash proceeds from stock purchase and option plan exercises. Our net debt to capital ratio of 25.7% compared with 26.3% at 2014 year end.
In addition to our $119.2 million of cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million in available credit facilities, and our current short-term credit ratings allow us access to the commercial paper markets. At quarter end, we had $45.2 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding.
This concludes my remarks on our third quarter performance. I'll now briefly review a few outlook items for the balance of 2015. We anticipate that capital expenditures in 2015 will be in the range of $80 million to $85 million, of which $64.3 million was incurred through the end of the third quarter. We continue to expect our 2015 full year effective income tax rate will be at or below our 2014 full year rate of 32.1%.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?
Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Aldo. Snap-on third quarter, sales up organically 7.3% against some significant headwinds. Of course as we say often, there will always be headwinds, always be challenges. But in the midst of that, we believe our runways for growth are wide with abundant opportunities and you can see it in the operating groups. C&I in the center of the turbulence, sales up 3.4%, profits up 60 basis points. RS&I, wielding software and hardware with repair shop owner and managers activity rising 8.2% and OI margin of 24.6%, up 130 basis points.
Tools, an established and storied business, reaching higher, capturing more customers. Sales up 11% and a greater than 6% increase in 21 of the last 22 quarters. OI margin up 90 basis points despite 120 basis points of unfavorable currency. And beside that growth, we see the effects of Snap-on value creation paving our runways for improving, helping to drive our opco margin to 17.5%, up 130 basis points including 50 basis points of currency headwinds. And rolling all together with financial services, our EPS was $1.98, up 12.5%.
We believe that the third quarter results extending our positive trends continuing confirmation of the Snap-on possibilities for both growth and for improvement. And we believe as demonstrated this past quarter, we can continue on those positive runways as we proceed forward.
Now before I turn the call over to the operator for questions, I think it's appropriate to speak to our franchisees and associates. I know many of you are listening in again. The encouraging results of the third quarter and our positive trends are a direct reflection of your capability and your effort. For the gains you've achieved, you have my congratulations. And for your commitment and your extraordinary contribution to our team, you have my thanks.
Now, I'll turn the call over to the operator. Operator?

Thank you. We'll take our first question from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC
Hi. Good morning, guys.
Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Good morning.
Aldo J. Pagliari - Senior Vice President-Finance and Chief Financial Officer
Good morning.
Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC
A question on RS&I, you mentioned specific strength in undercar and service chain reported this morning, it had an 11% comp in alignment. Is there something structurally going on in that space driving growth or is yours tied to new product introduction? This row (00:32:51) deterioration is a secular shift or...?

Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
I think structurally – not something happened and I don't think this particular quarter. But I think structurally the whole automotive repair business is – got a nice tailwind in terms of changes in vehicles. And in fact as you have more vehicles that want to do more things automatically, self-driving and so on. The precision of calibration becomes more and more important and therefore the more accuracy and speed – more accuracy – things like alignment become more important and therefore the speed of that alignment becomes important, therefore the need for new products. And so, I think it's nice times for automotive repair in general and in particular for undercar equipment. And I think...
Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC
And I guess...
Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
...ours being pushed by both at tailwind and some nice new product, that's in place as well.
Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC
Okay. And I guess, on that speed of change in technology – is sort of the next question, the software upgrade cycle as you were looking in the handheld units and replacing software, is that accelerating at all, or is the new code basically at the same cadence?
Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
I think it's expanding. I think we're finding – I don't know, if we're introducing any faster necessarily upgrades, but I think the upgrades are more attractive. You hear me talk about SureTrack and if I had a little more time to talk about VERUS Edge, I would talk about the fact that it has technical service bulletins involved. And so, those products are more attractive and they're more liberating and they're more productivity advancing to customers and so that's driving part of that.
You can see it. You can see – and I'm sure, you've looked at the trends, and you can see that, I think the numbers are something like somewhere under 50% of cars – we today require in all garages require diagnostics repairs and all garages require diagnostics units, but something like 7 of 10 repairs in new cars require diagnostics units. So you see a demand for that. And our software is the best available.
One of the things you see in our – one of the things we're really excited about in our business when we did independent surveys of technician preferences, 63% said they preferred Snap-on diagnostics. Number two was 7%.
Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC
Okay.
Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Does it help?
Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC
Thanks. And one question I guess specifically to C&I on the U.S. military, you talked about it being particularly weak. When they are weak, are they buying less premium product or not buying at all? I mean, are they going to Harbor Freight for what they would have purchased for you or did they just step out?
Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
No. No. I don't think they are buying that stuff. I'm not sure, but I'm pretty sure that they are not buying the stuff, because you know when the .50 caliber bullets are flying over head I think this is the ultimate critical application and I don't think anybody wants anybody being disadvantaged under those circumstances. So what really has happened by and large is the fact that there's uncertainty in where to deploy budget around. We've seen it before. Actually C&I, if you go back and look at the late – in late 2013, the critical industries, the critical industries again was bedeviled by a reduction associated with the military and that was directly associated with the word as sequestration. And so, you're starting to see those kinds of things now. In Washington people are talking about government shutdowns and so on and it's making the military nervous and they are spending less. We feel we're pretty well positioned though to take full advantage when they are ready to spend.

Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC
Okay. Great. So it's not trading down. It's just not spending.
Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
No. No. Not any significant way.
Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC
Okay. Great. Thank you.
Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer

Our next question comes from Liam Burke with Wunderlich. Your line is now open.
Liam D. Burke - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.
Thank you. Good morning, Nick. Good morning, Aldo.
Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Good morning, Liam. How are you?
Liam D. Burke - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.
Good. Thank you. Nick, you talked about railroad as being an interesting growth segment in C&I. Are there any other areas that saw particular strength during the quarter in the C&I?
Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Look, we were – amazingly, we're up pretty well in mining. Like I said, we're still starting to penetrate these things. So you can't – we're finding that we're effective sometimes by – somewhat by the environment, but not – we can overcome it at times and mining was one of those. Heavy truck was up fairly well in the quarter. So that was a good entry. General, if you just look at general production, the kinds of stuff, the things that are associated with grinders and so on, we had that kind of thing. So I mean we had some fairly reasonable positive points, the U.S. aviation, the aviation in U.S. was okay, that kind of thing.
Liam D. Burke - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.
Okay.
Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
So we had some positives. And we had oil and gas, international aviation and the military which were negative.
Liam D. Burke - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.
Okay. And with your van channel being supported now with Rock N' Roll vans, are you seeing any step up in average ticket item per franchisee during the quarter?
Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
No. Big ticket was still reasonably strong, but I think we're not seeing any particular, if the question is associated with the rise in the size of the – let's say the purchases, the size of the purchases, I would say no in the quarter necessarily, not anything particularly big in the quarter. Nothing that would change the trend. We're still seeing a robust demand though for things like tool storage and of course our diagnostic units and other things that we would roll into big ticket.
Liam D. Burke - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.
Great. Thank you, Nick.

Our next question comes from Gary Prestopino with Barrington. Your line is now open.
Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.
Hi. Good morning, everyone.
Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Good morning, Gary.
Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.
Couple of the questions have been answered, particularly on industrial. But let me just ask in terms of seeing pretty good growth year-over-year in the credit portfolio, is that still indicative of that there is a healthy appetite for the tool boxes, bigger ticket items?
Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, there's a healthy – I think there's a healthy attitude, generally it directly reflects the motion of the Tools Group. In general, if you look back at originations and look at Tools Group growth over the last three quarters, they're sort of the same, so that's pretty much what's driving it. I think it's not just tool boxes though, you get – you will get things like – you get things like big diagnostics like the VERUS Edge. I mean, the new VERUS Edge is a product that will run in several thousands of dollars and that can be financed on that kind of things. So, you will see a number of things like that. So, it's not just tool boxes, but it is – the big ticket items were, I think this quarter just slightly below, somewhat below the Tools Group in general, but over three quarters, four quarters has been better than the Tools Group.

Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.
Okay. And then in terms of the Rock N' Roll vans and the techno vans, are you at capacity where you want to be right now in the U.S.?
Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
I don't know. I think Rock N' Roll cab, I think we added like maybe like five in the last quarter in the techno vans and we didn't add any Rock N' Roll cabs. Rock N' Roll cabs have been solid for some time. Having said – been the same number for some time, but, you know, I wouldn't necessarily sign up to the idea that I wouldn't add more going forward. Rock N' Roll cabs were introduced somewhere in 2011. And I have to tell you, Gary, we've been learning about how to use them better and how effective they are and where they're most effective and how to do that each quarter. But for now, they're pretty much where they're going to be. The techno is something else. So we've added quite a few. I think actually year-over-year for techno, we've added 21 techno vans, and I think we'll be probably trying to see how that 21 plays out for a little while, and then we'll make a decision whether we need more or not going forward. But it's a mistake to think that tool storage sales is directly proportional to the number of Rock N' Roll cabs, that's not true. What we found is they've gotten more and more and more productive, more and more liberating every time, every quarter, and same thing for techno vans.
Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.
All right. Well, it basically expands your store for selling space, right?
Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Correct, it does. But then we find out how to – then actually what we find out is how to amplify the Rock N' Roll space. I mean, it's kind of a multilayered thing. It does help that though. I mean in one sense it expands on a time-sharing basis the space, but the effect of that space, I would say over the four years we've had it, the ones that we installed first are helping a lot more than they did when they first occurred.
Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.
And last question. Is this just the U.S. phenomenon or is this in other countries where mechanics own the tools that you have these kind of vans?
Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
It's in other countries. I mean I think, I guess we have seven international Rock N' Roll cabs, and so we've used them in different places, things like the UK, in Canada, and some in Australia. And we've just started to do that for the techno vans. So it's a phenomenon that can work in other places.
Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.

Our next question comes from David Leiker with Baird. Your line is now open.
David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Good morning, everyone.
Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Good morning, David.
Aldo J. Pagliari - Senior Vice President-Finance and Chief Financial Officer
Good morning.
David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
So a couple of things, back on C&I. That's a business; you've got three or four different buckets of businesses within there.
Aldo J. Pagliari - Senior Vice President-Finance and Chief Financial Officer
We do.
David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Tends to be a little bit lumpy quarter-to-quarter. It's kind of a strange question, but is there any way or anything that we from the outside should look at to try and get a better handle on what the quarter-to-quarter trends are going to be there?
Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
I don't really have – the thing is that – the truth is, sure. What we know is the industry problems, the economic environments create an overhang. And then in places like, for us and you see it in oil and gas this time, you can see it in mining, although mining was a contributory for us. So it's very difficult to look at any macro and say it's going to affect us. All you can say is look, the general macro is going to create an overhang. How well we do in offsetting it is another question, but we do have the ability to offset it from time to time. Like in this quarter, we felt, we feel when we look at Industrial, when we look at critical industries, we feel we can see the trajectory of upward trends even though it was a tepid quarter, it was a drag on us this time, because we can see the gains in railroad, in places like mining and heavy duty. So we can see the proof-of-concept working through. It's hard for us to give you any guidance on that. In Asia Pacific, for example, the turbulence around Asia Pacific did really create an overhang for us, but we succeeded in some markets and had some difficulty in others. Our operations and our sales in both those markets ended up being a growth situation. In Europe, it seems like, and I think what's worked for us in Europe is we came from such a low position. We kept investing. We create new product that we're growing even as the market is tepid. So it's kind of a cocktail of things that I can't quite give you any particular macro on which to trend.

David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Yeah, I figured that...
Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
All I can tell you is I think we feel progress in each of those places.
David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Yeah, I just figured that was the answer. On Asia Pacific...
Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, yeah.
David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
...that business over the years, you've continued to see strong growth on the automotive equipment side of that business. What's the makeup of that revenue today between equipment versus the critical industries versus other pieces?
Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
I don't really have the percentages for you. I will say that you're right in saying that equipment is probably the biggest piece of that, and then you've got cutting tools, which are another piece of it, which are primarily Industrial based. Industrial based tools are another piece, and then what's after that, it would be, I'd say, the critical – we call them – in that world (00:46:10) we call them premium tools, like the Snap-on tools sold into the super-premium applications like Thai Airways and things like that.
We actually had a pretty good quarter with those in places like Singapore and Hong Kong. And the equipment actually was one of the things that drove us into Vietnam. We're actually pretty pleased about Vietnam. I've been waiting for Vietnam to give us some daylight for some time, and this is the quarter which it kind of worked. So it was an encouraging event.
David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Great. And then one last item here on margins. You guys did a great job of continuing to drive value and drive margins with the RCI activity and the focus on execution. Are you doing anything beyond what you normally do, cost cutting or pulling back on discretionary spending or anything along those lines, belt tightening with some of the uncertainties going on around the world?
Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
No. We're not doing anything like that. I mean I suppose it's kind of dumb thing for a guy like me to say that, but the fact our – we – okay, people here are shaking their heads, yes, that is dumb. But, okay.
David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
So am I.
Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
It's true, we believe in our runways for growth, and we continue to invest in them. The profit improvements you are seeing, the 130 basis points, have nothing to do with restriction, nothing.
David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Okay.
Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Because we don't see it that way. Of course, there are headwinds and they might impact us, and I never said we would keep going, marching upward every quarter. It's almost impossible for anybody to do that, although we have. And so we just believe in the future of extending the critical industries, enhancing the van channel, expanding with repair shop owners, and in emerging markets, so we keep investing in it.
David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Okay. Perfect, great. Thank you very much.

Our next question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. Your line is now open.
David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC
Yeah. Good morning, everyone. And Nick, congratulations on a great quarter.
Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Thanks.
David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC
Let me start off with just continuing on the point we were just discussing, and you talked about the fact that there wasn't a lot of belt tightening in this, but then you cite RCI progress in each of the individual segments. So let me reconcile this. It seems as though there has been some cost cutting. I'm looking specifically at the C&I segment, where you had a negative 5% incremental margin. In other words, revenues were down, but EBIT was up. And I know you've said repeatedly in the past that your RCI would allow you to grow margins in a flat revenue environment. Help me understand the answer you just gave to the last question versus these points.

Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Sure. First of all, first of all, we view -- you may not like this either -- but we view as-reported sales as arithmetic. Organic sales are up for us, so the bits and the bytes and the metal and the mechanisms, we sell more of that we're happy. We're encouraged by that. So even in C&I, which was down, that 3.4% organic is what we follow because that looks to us to be customer gain. That's one.
Two is, is that what you see in this situation is when I'm talking about RCI, I'm talking about things like being able to make the product less expensively. We reduce the set-up times in the factory, which is a big deal for us. We find ways through customer connection and our innovation process to wield new technologies that allow us to develop new product cheaper. Remember, in C&I, for example, last year in aviation, we brought – last year, in oil and gas, I think we – for heavy truck, let's say, we brought out 859 new products, and aviation was 996. And one of the things that allows us to make to do that better is new technology like 3D printing and finite element analysis and so on. And that cuts cost in the design cycle and allows us to bring out those new products with lower cost than before. Those are the kinds of things we do.
David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC
Okay.
Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
And even if we have – so, even if we have lower as reported revenues, our cost gets driven down because of some of that. And it doesn't happen every quarter, if it happens – if I reduce the cost of one particular product, well, maybe that product sells well this quarter and I get some good benefit out of it. That may not sell so well next quarter and I don't quite get the quote at the same benefit.
David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC
Okay. I appreciate that clarification.
Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Okay.
David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC
Yeah, I appreciate the clarification. Thanks. On the originations, it's up 16%. Once again it's kind of an up 9% number last quarter. Is that really just timing?
Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, it's pretty much. Yeah, there's a lot of timing flowing through. Remember that originations have to do with the franchisees selling the products.
David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC
Right.
Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Right. And you also got an SFC that flows through this. So, in originations are things like loans that go through for the franchisees themselves, like van loans and things like that that occur. And so there's that noise in van originations in the month. So when we have a particularly great SFC, that can distort that as well. But when you step back and you look at the trend of everything, it really is – there is a lot of noise from quarter-to-quarter. You've kind of got to look back. And if you look at three quarters, you'll see it's pretty close to the same, between Tools Group growth and originations, pretty close to the same and if you say that Tools Group will pick a group faster, it makes sense.
David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC
Okay. Military and oil and gas, is there any way you can size that up for us as a percentage of critical industries...
Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Okay. (00:51:55). I'll try this – how about this one. We mentioned like five segments, six segments in critical industries, and the military is a big one, it's the biggest because we entered there first, because it made sense. Just as I said before, when the bullets are flying overhead -- I can assure you this from personal experience, when the bullets are flying overhead, people kind of want to make sure things work. And so we figured it was the most critical of industries. We invested in it and it (00:52:16) warrants bigger. So if you take our revenues which is somewhere north of $450 million or something like that let's say, and you divide them by six and you take one of the bigger ones, that would be the military. And oil and gas would be more in the middle some place. So that helps. I think that should give you some ballpark view of this. You got one big guy who is down strong double digits, can put a little over hang on you.

David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC
Okay. Let me just ask one last question, just relating to the call here and just kind of a big picture high level question, but if you could just walk us through with some quick comments on each of the four segments. You just discussed recessionary environment, how much downside would you expect in revenues? And also, I guess, with all the progress in RCI initiatives and the new product introductions in the much richer portfolio, how much better, if at all, would margins be in the trough than what we saw last time around?
Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Last time around we started at 12% and went to 10%. The 12.3%, if I remember 2008, the OI percentage was like 12.3% and it went to 9.9%.
David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC
Yeah.
Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
And that was – the 9.9% was, I would say, artificially depressed by the fact that we had the credit company in transition, somewhat, not huge, but that's a factor there a little bit. And so, you can say, all right, it impacted some, but maybe not much, but okay, we had that transition going on in Tools Group and so on, maybe arithmetically it didn't affect. But down there, we had some turbulence. And so then the big difference there now is we're starting at 17.5%, all right. So I mean, I wouldn't expect it to be worse than that duration.
The other factor I'd offer is this, is I believe – two factors. One is, I believe we are stronger in our market positions, therefore even more resistant, number one. Number two – number three, and this is harder to predict. Last time, our customer base, which was principally the – 70% of the customer base, the automotive repair technician, I spent a lot of time talking about the fact that they were cash rich and confidence poor, they were getting up every day and reading bad news for breakfast. It was the worst recession of our lifetime. People were talking about putting dollars in mattresses. Well, I'm not sure – and so therefore they didn't buy big ticket items even though they had a lot of cash.
That would happen again, but I'm not sure it'd be the same extent. I don't know. That's a judgment call of course. And one more experience at RCI than we were. And the other thing is, we're just better at RCI, and so we probably step that up. If you can't, you only have 24 hours in a day, so if you can't – if you think the prospects for growth are less, you turn more toward improvement.
David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC
That's really helpful. Thanks a lot.
Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Sure.

Our next question comes from Tom Hayes with Northcoast Research. Your line is now open.

Aldo J. Pagliari - Senior Vice President-Finance and Chief Financial Officer
Good morning.
Tom L. Hayes - Northcoast Research Partners LLC
Just as it relates to the Tools Group, certainly positive results from both the domestic and international businesses. Nick, I was wondering if you could maybe give a little additional color in regards to the contribution for the international franchise business in the Tools Group?
Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
The international franchise business is about, is also up double-digits. The U.S. is up strong double-digits, the U.S. is up, the international is up just about the same. I would say that in order the strength, Australia and UK were actually up more than the U.S., Canada was up somewhat less, so you put those together in a cocktail and I think it all came to about the same as the U.S.
Tom L. Hayes - Northcoast Research Partners LLC

Okay. And then I guess looking a little bit of bigger picture, I think you've kind of tested on some components so far today. Clearly an opportunity for you is to get a larger percentage of the shop related spending. Just what are your thoughts on where you are on the penetration rates when you look at complete shop spending and some of your initiatives to expand that?
Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Well, let's look at it this way. I think I would say that we are less than half of where we are in terms of our position with tools. And so, if you think of it that way, yes, people respect our brand, shop owners respect our brand as much as technicians. So I would view that as kind of an – view of the opportunity. We think we have runway in the tools itself for the technicians and we're well behind that in terms of shop penetration. So, I think we've got quite a bit of runway there. I would say if you want to use baseball terms, we're in the third or fourth inning.

History[edit]
Snap-on was founded as the Snap-on Wrench Company in Milwaukee, Wisconsin in 1920 by Joseph Johnson and William Seidemann.[3] As a new socket wrench manufacturing company, the business manufactured and marketed ten sockets that would "snap on" to five interchangeable handles. Their slogan was "5 do the work of 50"




Snap-on walk-in dealer van, Westland, Michigan


After World War II, Palmer advertised for a military officer to organize and develop a larger sales force for the expected post-war sales boom. Newton Tarble was hired, and came up with the idea of developing routes for company dealers to see mechanics on a weekly basis. Eventually these salesmen became independent businessmen and authorized dealers using larger walk-in vans to carry a growing product line. Thus, Snap-on tools are sold only by dealers and none are sold in retail stores. Their quality is highly regarded but their prices are also among the very highest. Snap-on currently operates plants in various states and cities such as Milwaukee, Wisconsin and Elizabethton, Tennessee, which manufacture hand tools. Pneumatic tools are currently manufactured in Murphy, North Carolina.
In 1975, Snap-on opened a manufacturing plant in Johnson City, Tennessee and closed the plant 32 years later in 2007. The Murphy, North Carolina plant was named as one of the top 10 plants in North America by Industry Week.[4] In 1999, Snap-on acquired Bahco, a Swedish hand tool brand. Bahco hand tools are designed and manufactured by SNA Europe, the European manufacturing subsidiary of Snap-on Incorporated.
Products[edit]
Snap-on produces hand, air, and electric tools designed for professional use in all facets of the transportation industry. Automotive, heavy-duty, equipment, marine, aviation, and railroad industries all are customers of Snap-on. Snap-on also distributes hand tools and power tools under the brand name Blue-Point, as an entry-level or price-conscious offering. Snap-on also manufactures tool storage cabinets in its Algona, Iowa plant. Snap-on produces hand-held electronic diagnostic tools for the on-board computer systems used in most modern cars and heavy-duty vehicles, as well as automotive emissions control diagnostics equipment (DGA/PGA-500/CSM-5000) in its San Jose, CA diagnostic facility. Snap-on diagnostic products are being sold in Europe and Brazil under the name Sun.[5]
In October, 2016 Snap-on announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Sweden-based Car-O-Liner Holding AB (“Car-O-Liner”) for approximately $155 million in cash.[6]
Stores[edit]
Snap-on has always maintained the philosophy that the customer's time was too valuable to spend going shopping for tools. Snap-on Franchisees visit their customers in their place of work once weekly, in a van loaded with items for purchase. Purchase options range from Collect on Delivery, to a revolving account in which a customer pays a set portion of his balance weekly, to an extended credit program sponsored by Snap-on Credit for large purchases.
Recently, Snap-on has made other advances in their product showcasing. Newest among these are the Snap-on TechKnow Express, showcasing everything Snap-on has to offer in the realm of Diagnostic equipment, and the Rock 'n Roll Cab Express, a truck with various types of tool storage showing customization options, including units larger than what would fit on a standard Franchisee van. These trucks are typically assigned to a particular region and work within that region with individual Franchisees.
Racing sponsorships[edit]
Since the early 1980s, Snap-on has been sponsoring Penske Racing teams in the NASCAR Sprint and Nationwide Series as well as Championship Auto Race Teams (CART) and the Indy Racing League (IRL). The first driver Snap-on became associated with was Rick Mears in 1979. Rick went on to be a 4 time Indy 500 Winner. Nearly 20 years ago, Snap-on began an association with two time NHRA world champion Cruz Pedregon. In 2004, Snap-on began an association with Cruz’s brother Tony Pedregon, a two time champion himself.

Thus, Snap-on tools are sold only by dealers and none are sold in retail stores. Their quality is highly regarded but their prices are also among the very highest. Snap-on currently operates plants in various states and cities such as Milwaukee, Wisconsin and Elizabethton, Tennessee, which manufacture hand tools. Pneumatic tools are currently manufactured in Murphy, North Carolina.
In 1975, Snap-on opened a manufacturing plant in Johnson City, Tennessee and closed the plant 32 years later in 2007. The Murphy, North Carolina plant was named as one of the top 10 plants in North America by Industry Week.[4] In 1999, Snap-on acquired Bahco, a Swedish hand tool brand. Bahco hand tools are designed and manufactured by SNA Europe, the European manufacturing subsidiary of Snap-on Incorporated.
Products[edit]
Snap-on produces hand, air, and electric tools designed for professional use in all facets of the transportation industry. Automotive, heavy-duty, equipment, marine, aviation, and railroad industries all are customers of Snap-on. Snap-on also distributes hand tools and power tools under the brand name Blue-Point, as an entry-level or price-conscious offering. Snap-on also manufactures tool storage cabinets in its Algona, Iowa plant. Snap-on produces hand-held electronic diagnostic tools for the on-board computer systems used in most modern cars and heavy-duty vehicles, as well as automotive emissions control diagnostics equipment (DGA/PGA-500/CSM-5000) in its San Jose, CA diagnostic facility. Snap-on diagnostic products are being sold in Europe and Brazil under the name Sun.[5]
In October, 2016 Snap-on announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Sweden-based Car-O-Liner Holding AB (“Car-O-Liner”) for approximately $155 million in cash.[6]
Stores[edit]
Snap-on has always maintained the philosophy that the customer's time was too valuable to spend going shopping for tools. Snap-on Franchisees visit their customers in their place of work once weekly, in a van loaded with items for purchase. Purchase options range from Collect on Delivery, to a revolving account in which a customer pays a set portion of his balance weekly, to an extended credit program sponsored by Snap-on Credit for large purchases.
Recently, Snap-on has made other advances in their product showcasing. Newest among these are the Snap-on TechKnow Express, showcasing everything Snap-on has to offer in the realm of Diagnostic equipment, and the Rock 'n Roll Cab Express, a truck with various types of tool storage showing customization options, including units larger than what would fit on a standard Franchisee van. These trucks are typically assigned to a particular region and work within that region with individual Franchisees.
Racing sponsorships[edit]
Since the early 1980s, Snap-on has been sponsoring Penske Racing teams in the NASCAR Sprint and Nationwide Series as well as Championship Auto Race Teams (CART) and the Indy Racing League (IRL). The first driver Snap-on became associated with was Rick Mears in 1979. Rick went on to be a 4 time Indy 500 Winner. Nearly 20 years ago, Snap-on began an association with two time NHRA world champion Cruz Pedregon. In 2004, Snap-on began an association with Cruz’s brother Tony Pedregon, a two time champion himself.

History[edit]
Snap-on was founded as the Snap-on Wrench Company in Milwaukee, Wisconsin in 1920 by Joseph Johnson and William Seidemann.[3] As a new socket wrench manufacturing company, the business manufactured and marketed ten sockets that would "snap on" to five interchangeable handles. Their slogan was "5 do the work of 50"

Products[edit]
Snap-on produces hand, air, and electric tools designed for professional use in all facets of the transportation industry. Automotive, heavy-duty, equipment, marine, aviation, and railroad industries all are customers of Snap-on. Snap-on also distributes hand tools and power tools under the brand name Blue-Point, as an entry-level or price-conscious offering. Snap-on also manufactures tool storage cabinets in its Algona, Iowa plant. Snap-on produces hand-held electronic diagnostic tools for the on-board computer systems used in most modern cars and heavy-duty vehicles, as well as automotive emissions control diagnostics equipment (DGA/PGA-500/CSM-5000) in its San Jose, CA diagnostic facility. Snap-on diagnostic products are being sold in Europe and Brazil under the name Sun.[5]
In October, 2016 Snap-on announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Sweden-based Car-O-Liner Holding AB (“Car-O-Liner”) for approximately $155 million in cash.[6]
Stores[edit]
Snap-on has always maintained the philosophy that the customer's time was too valuable to spend going shopping for tools. Snap-on Franchisees visit their customers in their place of work once weekly, in a van loaded with items for purchase. Purchase options range from Collect on Delivery, to a revolving account in which a customer pays a set portion of his balance weekly, to an extended credit program sponsored by Snap-on Credit for large purchases.
Recently, Snap-on has made other advances in their product showcasing. Newest among these are the Snap-on TechKnow Express, showcasing everything Snap-on has to offer in the realm of Diagnostic equipment, and the Rock 'n Roll Cab Express, a truck with various types of tool storage showing customization options, including units larger than what would fit on a standard Franchisee van. These trucks are typically assigned to a particular region and work within that region with individual Franchisees.
Racing sponsorships[edit]
Since the early 1980s, Snap-on has been sponsoring Penske Racing teams in the NASCAR Sprint and Nationwide Series as well as Championship Auto Race Teams (CART) and the Indy Racing League (IRL). The first driver Snap-on became associated with was Rick Mears in 1979. Rick went on to be a 4 time Indy 500 Winner. Nearly 20 years ago, Snap-on began an association with two time NHRA world champion Cruz Pedregon. In 2004, Snap-on began an association with Cruz’s brother Tony Pedregon, a two time champion himself.

History[edit]
Snap-on was founded as the Snap-on Wrench Company in Milwaukee, Wisconsin in 1920 by Joseph Johnson and William Seidemann.[3] As a new socket wrench manufacturing company, the business manufactured and marketed ten sockets that would "snap on" to five interchangeable handles. Their slogan was "5 do the work of 50"




Snap-on walk-in dealer van, Westland, Michigan


After World War II, Palmer advertised for a military officer to organize and develop a larger sales force for the expected post-war sales boom. Newton Tarble was hired, and came up with the idea of developing routes for company dealers to see mechanics on a weekly basis. Eventually these salesmen became independent businessmen and authorized dealers using larger walk-in vans to carry a growing product line. Thus, Snap-on tools are sold only by dealers and none are sold in retail stores. Their quality is highly regarded but their prices are also among the very highest. Snap-on currently operates plants in various states and cities such as Milwaukee, Wisconsin and Elizabethton, Tennessee, which manufacture hand tools. Pneumatic tools are currently manufactured in Murphy, North Carolina.
In 1975, Snap-on opened a manufacturing plant in Johnson City, Tennessee and closed the plant 32 years later in 2007. The Murphy, North Carolina plant was named as one of the top 10 plants in North America by Industry Week.[4] In 1999, Snap-on acquired Bahco, a Swedish hand tool brand. Bahco hand tools are designed and manufactured by SNA Europe, the European manufacturing subsidiary of Snap-on Incorporated.

Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Leslie. Good morning, everybody. I'll start with the highlights of our fourth quarter and our year. As usual, I'll give you my perspective on the results, on the environment and on our progress. And after that, Aldo will move into a more detailed review of the financials
The Snap-on fourth quarter; organic sales up and profits well above last year. The period continued our positive trajectory of performance. Again this quarter, we had opportunities and we had headwinds. We took advantage of those opportunities and we overcame the headwinds. Organic sales grew 3.1%. If we include the impact of $33.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, overall sales in the quarter were $851.7 million, a small decrease from last year.
Our EPS was $2.22, up 12.7% from $1.97 in 2014. And that rise reflects an OpCo operating margin of 19.1%, an increase of 220 basis points. Financial service earnings of $45 million in the quarter were also up, leading to a consolidated operating margin, including both financial services and OpCo, of 22.7%, an improvement of 230 basis points. The results were encouraging.
Our markets, the automotive repair-related segments, they continue to be favorable. Changing technologies and aging vehicles are requiring new tools and more repairs. Our Tools Group and our Repair Systems & Information, or the RS&I Group, took advantage of those opportunities and grew across our franchise network and with repair shop owners and managers.

Now, for our Commercial & Industrial Group, or our C&I Group, markets were mixed, headwinds a bit more pronounced in the quarter, impacted by few down sectors and macro economically challenged geographies, leading to organic volume just under 2014. A couple of those difficult environments were natural resources and the U.S. military, both substantially lower in the fourth quarter.
Oil and gas, a market we've identified as a long-term strategic growth opportunity for us and we continue to see it that way. But in the quarter, we experienced similar issues to those businesses with more prominent exposure in that arena and we saw a deep decline. The military sales: ongoing troop drawdown's and budget restraints led to a substantial year-over-year drop. But we continue to maintain our presence in that segment and we're poised to increase our position when the variability subsides.
C&I's also the most international of businesses and was also challenged in the quarter by economic turbulence across the globe and some of the European markets and in parts of Asia Pacific. That said, C&I progressed through the quarterly headwinds, taking advantage of the opportunities in critical industries like aviation, and in national markets like Japan and Germany and Mexico, and in emerging markets like India and Indonesia.
So, overall, our businesses I would characterize – overall across our businesses, I would characterize our markets as mixed. We have tailwinds in automotive repair and we have pockets of turbulence in some afflicted critical industries and in challenged geographies. Having said that, we believe that our businesses are well-positioned to capitalize on the possibilities, opportunities that do exist along our runways for growth, enhancing the van network, expanding with Snap-on's presence with repair shop owners and managers, extending into critical industries, and building in emerging markets. These are the strategic initiatives we see as decisive for our future. And we'll continue to strengthen our position along those runways as we go forward.
And also, looking ahead, we also see clear runways for improvement. Snap-on Value Creation processes; safety, quality, customer connection, innovation, rapid continuous improvement or RCI, driving significant progress, and our fourth quarter and our full year results confirm those ongoing improvement possibilities.
Let's speak about the full year. Snap-on's EPS in 2015 was $8.10, an increase of 13.4%. Driving those earnings was an OpCo earnings margin of 17.7%, up 140 basis points for the full year. And when we include the income from financial services of $170.2 million, which rose $21.1 million, the consolidated operating margin for the corporation in the year was 21.3%, up 170 basis points.
That performance came on sales for the year of $3.4 billion reflecting a 7.1% organic increase, broad growth. Tools Group up 10.9%; RS&I increasing 4.9%; C&I rising 5.8%, all performances in the year reflecting significant advances down our runways for growth and for improvement.
Now, let's move to the groups and their fourth quarter results. C&I: sales were down in the period 5.5% from 2014, impacted by 490 basis points of unfavorable currency. Organic sales were slightly lower than last year with varied results across the group, gains by SNA Europe, our European hand tools business and the power tools operation and decreases at the Industrial division.
From an earnings perspective, C&I operating income was $41.9 million. That represents an operating margin of 14.9%, a rise of 130 basis points. Encouragingly, SNA Europe posted a sales increase again in the midst of significant European headwinds, continuing its progress now, nine quarters in a row of year-over-year growth, and the profits rising even higher, now up 11 straight quarters, reflecting RCI and Snap-on Value Creation, new products and new processes; positive trends in some difficult geographies.

Also in C&I, our power tools division advanced in the period, bolstered by an array of new products. Innovations like our CDR8815 18V Lithium Cordless Drill launched in the quarter. It's our latest in the successful line of cordless tools; an oversized variable speed trigger, less finger stress and more accurate torque control; a heavy-duty gearbox reducing operating wobble and run-out, important for power tools. A precision single sleeve keyless chuck with carbide jaw, increasing grip and torque and enabling one-handed bit changes; a nice time saver for professionals. And all those features contained in a powerful but compact design. With the CDR8815, we believe we have a winner and the early results confirm it.
Now, the Industrial division had weaker sales in the quarter, as we mentioned, and there were difficulties in military and oil and gas. That said, we've maintained our growth strategies of extending in critical industries even during this turbulence. We remain committed to ongoing advancements made possible by Snap-on Value Creation especially in customer connection and innovation, authoring new products specifically aimed at customers facing critical challenges.
One of those new products, designed for the natural resource sector, is the Snap-on gas meter wrench, custom engineered for a safer and more efficient service of gas meters, rugged and lightweight with an aviation-grade aluminum body, five interchangeable heads for maximum versatility, and a 19-inch handle to more easily generate the full range of force required. Over 500,000 gas meters are replaced annually in New York City area alone and 20% to 30% of all injuries in the utility sector are attributed to the gas meter service.
This innovative new Snap-on wrench was guided by customer connection, direct observation of the work and it includes an improved ergonomic design for better grip and less hand stress. And, of course, it incorporates our Snap-on Flank Drive wrenching system, eliminating slippage and requiring less force to complete the job. It's more versatile. It ends the need for a technician to carry a heavy bag of assorted pipe wrenches, and it's safer and more effective. We believe the Snap-on gas meter wrench will be a big seller; a must-have for service technicians throughout the power generation industry. It's just another example, another example of customer connection and innovation, strengthening the C&I position in critical industries.
Now, on to the Tools Group; an 8.7% rise in organic sales; an encouraging increase again this quarter. The operating earnings of $71.9 million represented a margin rate of 17.5%, up 100 basis points from last year. And that gain included a 70-basis point impact from negative currency.
We speak quite a bit about the runways for coherent growth. Strategic avenues of sales advancement and clearly large among those opportunities is enhancing the franchise network. The Tools Group once again demonstrated significant progress along that runway. You can see it vividly in the financial numbers for the quarter and for the full year and it's evident in the health metrics we monitor each period whether it's franchise profitability, turnover or delinquencies.
The measures of franchise health are all trending upward. And that speaks to the growing strength and to the widening advantage, the widening advantage of our band network in the robust vehicle repair arena. But beyond the numbers, there's qualitative but clearly observable evidence of forward momentum. I can tell you that the franchisees at our fourth quarter National Franchise Advisory Council and more recently at the 2016 kickoff events held earlier this month demonstrated the enthusiasm and confirmed the optimism that has marked the Tools Group from route to route for some time now.

And there's more evidence. We continue to be recognized as a franchise of choice. Again, this year, Snap-on ranked among the top 25 in Entrepreneurs Magazine's List of Top 500 Franchises. And the Franchise Business Review, which collects franchisee satisfaction feedback, listed Snap-on as a Top 50 Franchise in its latest ranking, marking the ninth consecutive year we received that award. It also goes without saying that the Tools Group's performance would not have been possible without the benefits of Snap-on Value Creation, particularly innovation and customer connection creating an assortment of exciting new products, born from our unique customer interactions. And for the sixth straight year, the Tools Group increased this number of hit products, million dollar sellers developed from that direct customer observation, from our onsite experience in the workplace.
Let's consider our new SPBS series of striking prybars; an upgrade in performance, in durability, and most importantly, in safety. These next-generation tools include a precision ground blade with angle design for maximum lift. It also features a new grip material which performs in extremely low temperatures, in important place like Chicago today, and has greater resistance to common shop chemicals. And it features a new ergonomic handle that not only offers a more comfortable grip, but the flared design provides technician hands greatly improved protection from off-center hits. Not a small feature. It's an exceptional design made possible from customer connection, and it represents progress even in a long, established product line.
Finally, I'd be missing a huge contributor to our van channel and a major strategic advantage if I didn't mention Snap-on Credit, financing the network's big ticket items. And as you would expect, the Credit operation was well represented at our kickoff meetings – at our recent kickoff meetings held in the first part of the year. And they were working to increase the power of Credit and making our finance operations an even greater strategic contributor. Snap-on is wielding its tools network more effectively every day. And the support of our Credit company is a major element in that progress.
Moving to RS&I. Sales in the fourth quarter were $280.6 million with organic gains of 2.2%, reflecting a rise in diagnostics and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers, a low single digit increase to OEM dealerships, and essentially flat sales of undercar equipment. Operating earnings of $72.1 million rose $6.9 million. And the OI margin, it was 25.7%, up 260 basis points from last year's 23.1% with RCI paving the way.
RC&I advanced in the quarter, expanding with repair shop owners and managers, but particularly with the independents. Mitchell 1 offers independent shops leading shop management software, innovative marketing services to gain more repair customers, and the most comprehensive and capable repair information anywhere. And based on customer connection, it has thousands of customer contexts every year.
Mitchell 1 keeps improving its advantage, adding repair information for new vehicles, improving the ease of navigating its ProDemand system, building on the millions of actual repair events it already catalogs, making its unique SureTrack big data repair base even more powerful and customers, shop owners and managers have taken notice. The quarter saw more fleet placements, more attention to industry shows like APEC and more penetration of shops across the country.
From our diagnostics division, also selling to independents; another solid quarter, including positive results from our newest handheld unit, the VERUS Edge. I mentioned it last quarter; it was in the midst of its introduction, while the enthusiasm continued from our customers and from our franchisees.

It's our most successful launch. Customer satisfaction is high and we regularly receive testimonials when I go out and visit with franchisees and customers and technicians. We receive testimonials like the VERUS Edge, it helps my shop fix cars faster and be more profitable.
VERUS Edge is quite a product; faster, easier, smarter. Technical service bulletins at hand, comprehensive diagnostics, and the power of SureTrack big repair data. Simply the best handheld in vehicle repair and is another winner with independent shops, it's clear.
And speaking of diagnostics, this time in the heavy truck area, we continue to expand our coverage. More engines, more power train combinations. The PRO-LINK Ultra, already the go-to diagnostics in truck shops across the nation, got stronger again.
Finally, in the period, RSI Equipment Division recorded essentially flat activity, impacted particularly by Eastern Europe. That said, we keep driving to expand our position in equipment with repair shops. With innovative new products like the B1200P wheel balancer system, designed for more sophisticated independent shops with specialty or a dealer-like operation.
A series of customer connection with those locations help us highlight the need for features like fast run-out measurement, automatic data entry via scanners and Smart Sonar, a pin-point laser light for positioning the adhesive weights on the wheel, and a highly intuitive and rapid touch screen interface. The B1200; faster and more accurate. It's now available in European markets and the North American introduction is scheduled for later this year. So, that's RS&I; using Snap-on Value Creation, authoring innovative new products, capturing opportunities and securing an expanded presence with shop owners and managers.
And that's our fourth quarter; organic sales rising 3.1%; EPS, $2.22 in the quarter, up 12.7% against the $0.11 of unfavorable currency; progress along our runways for coherent growth; and clear advancements down our runways for improvement; safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement, driving a 19.1% operating margin, 220 basis points higher than last year. It was an encouraging quarter.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Aldo.
Aldo J. Pagliari - Senior Vice President-Finance and Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Nick. Our fourth quarter consolidated operating results are summarized on slide six. Net sales of $851.7 million in the quarter were up 3.1% organically, reflecting increases in our businesses serving automotive repair, notably, the Snap-on Tools Group, as well as our diagnostics and repair information business, partially offset by some headwinds in our C&I segment.
On a reported basis, net sales, which included $33.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation decreased $5.7 million or 0.7% from 2014 levels. As you know, Snap-on has significant international operations and is subject to foreign currency fluctuations. Largely due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, foreign currency movements adversely impacted our Q4 sales comparisons by 400 basis points.
Consolidated gross margin of 48.4% in the quarter improved 40 basis points primarily due to higher organic sales and savings from RCI initiatives, partially offset by 20 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses of $250 million yielded an operating expense margin of 29.3% in the quarter, an improvement of 180 basis points from last year, primarily due to organic sales volume leverage and savings from RCI initiatives, as well as lower performance-based and stock-based compensation expenses.
No restructuring costs were incurred in the quarter. We incurred $1.1 million of such costs in the fourth quarter of last year. As a result of these factors, operating earnings before financial services of $162.3 million in the quarter, including $9.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased 11.8% as compared to the prior year and as a percentage of sales, improved 220 basis points to 19.1%.

Financial services revenues of $63.1 million in the quarter increased 6.2% from 2014 levels and operating earnings of $45 million increased 6.6%. These increases primarily reflect the continued growth of the financial services portfolio. Consolidated operating earnings of $207.3 million in the quarter, including $9.9 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased 10.6%. And the operating margin of 22.7% improved 230 basis points from 20.4% a year ago. Our fourth quarter effective income tax rate of 31.1% compared to 32.1% last year. Finally, net earnings in the quarter of $131.4 million or $2.22 per diluted share increased $15.2 million or $0.25 per share from 2014 levels representing a 12.7% increase in diluted earnings per share.
Now, let's turn to our segment results. Starting with the Commercial & Industrial, or C&I Group, on slide seven, sales of $281.8 million in the quarter decreased 0.6% organically, primarily due to a high single digit decline in sales to customers in critical industries, largely reflecting deep declines in sales to the military and to customers in the oil and gas sector. These organic sales declines were partially offset by a low single digit gain in the segment's European-based hand tools business and a double digit increase in the segment's power tool operation.
Gross profit in the C&I Group was $107.6 million in the quarter. The gross margin of 38.2% increased 20 basis points as savings from RCI initiatives and lower restructuring costs were partially offset by a shift in sales that included lower volumes of higher gross margin sales to customers in critical industries, and an increase in lower gross margin sales from the power tool operations.
Operating expenses of $65.7 million in the quarter compared to $72.9 million last year. The operating expense margin of 23.3% improved 110 basis points primarily due to a 70-basis point gain from the sale of a former manufacturing facility, as well as benefits from the sales shift already mentioned. As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the C&I segment of $41.9 million, including $1.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased 3.5% from 2014 levels, and the operating margin of 14.9% improved 130 basis points.
Turning now to slide eight, fourth quarter sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $411.2 million increased 8.7% organically, reflecting continued strength in sales both in the U.S. and internationally. Gross profit of $173.7 million in the quarter increased $7.3 million from 2014 levels. The gross margin of 42.2% decreased 70 basis points primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses of $101.8 million in the quarter decreased slightly, and the operating expense margin of 24.7% improved 170 basis points principally due to sales volume leverage. As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $71.9 million, including $4.8 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased 12.5%, and the operating margin of 17.5% improved 100 basis points from 16.5% last year.
Turning to the Repair Systems & Information, or RS&I Group, shown on slide nine, fourth quarter sales of $280.6 million increased 2.2% organically. The organic sales increase primarily reflects a mid-single digit gain in sales of diagnostic and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers and a low single digit increase in sales to OEM dealerships. Sales of undercar equipment were essentially flat year-over-year with continued weakness in East European markets, including Russia. Gross margin of 46.7% improved 20 basis points from 46.5% last year.
Operating expenses totaled $58.9 million in the quarter, and the operating expense margin of 21% improved 240 basis points, primarily due to organic sales volume leverage and savings from RCI initiatives. Fourth quarter operating earnings for the RS&I Group of $72.1 million, including $2.9 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased 10.6% from prior year levels, and the operating margin of 25.7% improved 260 basis points from 23.1% last year.

Now, turning to slide 10, in the fourth quarter, operating earnings from financial services of $45 million on revenue of $63.1 million, compared with operating earnings of $42.2 million on revenue of $59.4 million last year. The average yield on finance receivables of 17.8% compared with 17.6% last year, and the average yield on contract receivables was 9.5% in both periods. Originations of $252 million in the quarter increased 8.5% from 2014 levels.
Moving to slide 11, our year-end balance sheet includes approximately $1.6 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.4 billion from our U.S. operation. Approximately 80% of our U.S. financing portfolio relates to extended credit loans to technicians. In 2015, our worldwide financial services portfolio grew $206 million. As for finance portfolio losses and delinquency trends, these continue to be in line with our expectations.
Now, turning to slide 12, cash provided by operations of $144.4 million in the quarter increased $47.2 million from comparable 2014 levels, due in part to higher 2015 net earnings and lower growth in working investment as compared to the prior year.
Net cash used by investing activities of $74.6 million included $66.8 million to fund the net increase in finance receivables. Capital expenditures of $16.1 million in the quarter compared with $17.3 million last year. For the full year, capital expenditures totaled $80.4 million.
Turning to slide 13, days sales outstanding for trade receivables of 60 days compared with 61 days at 2014 year-end. Inventories increased $22.3 million from 2014 year-end levels, primarily to support continued higher customer demand in the auto repair sector and new product introductions, as well as the addition of inventories related to the acquisition of Ecotechnics.
On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 3.5 turns compared with 3.7 turns at 2014 year-end. Our year-end cash position of $92.8 million decreased $40.1 million from 2014 year-end levels. The net decrease include the impacts of funding $844.2 million of new finance receivables, dividend payments of $127.9 million, the repurchase of 723,000 shares for $110.4 million, $80.4 million for capital expenditures, and $11.8 million for the acquisition of Ecotechnics.
These cash decreases were largely offset by $624.8 million of cash from collections of finance receivables and $496.5 million of cash from operations. Our net debt to capital ratio of 24.6% compared with 26.3% at 2014 year-end.
In addition to our $92.8 million of cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million in available credit facilities, and our current short-term credit ratings allow us to access the commercial paper markets. At 2015 year-end, we had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding.
This concludes my remarks on our fourth quarter performance. Now, briefly review a few outlook items for 2016. We anticipate that capital expenditures in 2016 will be in the range of $80 million to $90 million. We also expect that our full year 2016 effective income tax rate will be comparable to our 2015 full year rate of 31.7%.
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick?
Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Aldo. Snap-on's fourth quarter, an encouraging period; taking advantage of tailwinds, overcoming headwinds, growing organically, improving performance significantly, again. There is turbulence, deep decreases in the military and oil and gas and difficulties across the geographies. But there are tailwinds. The aging and changing of vehicles continue, so vehicle repair remains robust.
In this environment, we keep driving down our strategic runways for growth, launching innovative new products and advancing our position. And despite the difficulties, we continue moving down our runways for improvement. Snap-on Value Creation, safety and quality.

Customer connection and innovation working better and better. We had more new hit products in 2015 than ever before, not just for the Tools Group but for the corporation overall. Runways, growth and improvement, authored 3.1% organic growth in the quarter against the wind.
EPS of $2.22, up 12.7% over last year's fourth quarter, against $0.11 of unfavorable currency. And a 19.1% OpCo operating margin, a rise of 220 basis points, all extending our ongoing upward trend that has continued for some time. And we believe that the strength of our business model, the power of our brand and the capabilities of our team position us well to continue that positive trend as we go forward.
Before I turn the call over to the operator, I'll say a word to our franchisees and associates. I know many of you are hearing this call. The encouraging results of our fourth quarter and the year and our potential for continuing the encouraging trends reflect your capability and your dedication. For the success you've achieved, for your contribution to our future and for your commitment to our team, you have my congratulations, you have my admiration and you have my thanks.
Now, I'll turn the call over to the operator for questions. Operator?
Question-and-Answer Session

Thank you. We'll go first to Tom Hayes of Northcoast Research.
Thomas Hayes - Northcoast Research Partners LLC
Hey. Good morning, gentlemen.
Aldo J. Pagliari - Senior Vice President-Finance and Chief Financial Officer
Good morning.
Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Good morning.
Thomas Hayes - Northcoast Research Partners LLC
Yes. Nick, I was just wondering maybe you could talk a little bit more or provide a little bit more detail on the critical industries side. Certainly, military and oil and gas has been kind of a challenge in the year. Maybe talk about the cadence as it went through that quarter and then the outlook for 2016?
Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Well, I mean, I think, we're seeing deep declines in both of those places. We're talking multiple double digit declines in the military again and oil and gas in particular. If you're talking about the outlook we've set for some time that military – those two businesses are driving C&I in general. If you look at C&I beyond those businesses, it grew by about just over 5%. So, you see how much they influence the situation.
So, you say to yourself, well, what's going to happen with those businesses? And we've said for the military for a long time that it's uncertain. And so you say to yourself, well, that uncertainty is dependent on the government situation and so we're poised to take advantage and it could come back in a short-term or it could continue for a while.
In terms of oil and gas, I think we're seeing a historic downturn, 70% decline in the business. I mean, in the oil price just in the last – in a recent time. And we haven't – we saw that at the big recession in 2009. We saw at the Iran-Iraq War. So, it's kind of an unusual situation. When that comes back, I expect oil and gas to come back.
Thomas Hayes - Northcoast Research Partners LLC
Okay. And maybe just a little bit...
Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
On the other hand, as we said in our release and our comments, aviation was pretty good for us in the quarter. So, you see some goes-ins and goes-outs, but the dominant factor in those businesses are the oil and gas and the military.
Thomas Hayes - Northcoast Research Partners LLC
Okay. And then maybe just a question on the expense line, the operating expense was down meaningfully. How much of the decline was tied to – you called out less stock-based comp, how much of that was contributed to the decline?
Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer

I don't know.
Aldo J. Pagliari - Senior Vice President-Finance and Chief Financial Officer
Let's say about 20 basis points.
Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yes, 20 basis points. The big thing, if you're looking at operating expenses, there's quite a few goes-ins and goes-outs, but a lot of that is RCI. But also, if you step back last year in the fourth quarter, we talked about the – there was a 53rd week. But 53rd week, in general, if I looked at it from the trajectory of the corporation, it was kind of not significant. It wasn't significant. It shouldn't change your view of where we're going.
But if you start to look at it on account by account, it, of course, becomes an issue associated with the operating expenses, because you have that extra week of operating expenses. You start to look at accounts, you had an extra week of sales, 1.7% extra sales, but last year, so that wouldn't be an issue.
But if you step back and look at it, we don't think the 53rd week was significant, in general, or would change your view of the corporation. But if you look at it on account, like operating expense, it really is a factor. And you have currency in operating expense as well. So, you have those things rolling through, RCI, currency and things like the special events of last year.

Up next, from Longbow Research, we go to David MacGregor.
David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC
Yes. Good morning, Nick. Good morning, everyone. Nick, can you just talk about demand patterns in January and any deterioration that may be visible beyond critical industries?
Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
We almost traditionally never talk about the current quarter. We never give guidance. But I will say, look, I will say, that I was just on a van out here in Addison Itaska (37:03), and I have to say that when I talked to the people in the field, both our franchisees and the customers – you get out of a van and you go from – you know this, you go from shop to shops. They all seemed very positive and that might stop with the positiveness and the optimism that I saw at the kickoff meetings. We have a lot of these around the country. And I was at one of them and the rest of our staff was at others and they come back, and certainly, we're seeing a qualitative view of optimism. And so, I can offer that.
David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC
Okay. Is there – just within that SG&A pullback, notwithstanding it was 70 basis points in the C&I business, I guess, I get that. But how much of that was just attributable to the weaker military and oil and gas business versus what may have been in that number in terms of structural cost takeouts? And I guess, also, can you say to what extent there may have been some cost items that were pushed forward into 1Q or pulled back into last quarter's...
Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
I don't think we did that. I think – look, I think if you look at – if you're talking about – are you talking about the 130 basis points of margin improvement in C&I?
David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC
I was talking about the $16 million of SG&A drop, which was great. But I'm just trying to get a sense of what the nature of that was.
Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
That's overall, though. The $16 million is overall.
David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC
Right.
Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Right? That's not just for C&I.
David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC
Correct.
Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
And that didn't have much push or pull. What's in there is, like I said, you had currency, a big number of currency, with the currency year-over-year affects that SG&A and shrinks it. You have RCI. You've got – as somebody mentioned before, you have some goes-ins and goes-outs in terms of pension going the other way, compensation going one way. And you also have the 53rd week last year which was an extra week of operating expenses. Like I said – and so, therefore, the comparison issue isn't favorable, you get paid back at the sales line for that because the sales ends up being a little bit smaller. But if you look at it – I don't want to – I want to focus that, if you look at that one account, you start to see the effect of the 53rd week. If you look at it in total, it wasn't much of an effect for us.

David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC
Okay. Last question, just if you could talk about the trends you're seeing in tool storage and whether you're seeing a deceleration in demand patterns.
Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
No. No. Our big ticket items in total, we never talk particularly about tool storage, but our big ticket items in total were up a little bit more than the tools did (39:27) in the quarter. And I don't see that, really. I really don't see it. We haven't identified any particular cooling of that activity. Now, from quarter-to-quarter, these things always change. But I don't see as a downturn. Like I said, our big ticket items continued.
David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC

Liam D. Burke - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.
Thank you. Good morning, Nick. Good morning, Aldo.
Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Hey, Liam.
Aldo J. Pagliari - Senior Vice President-Finance and Chief Financial Officer
Good morning.
Liam D. Burke - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.
Nick, can you give us a sense – you had a good year in new product introductions and hit products. What can we look forward? I mean, are you continuing to see growth in that area with more new introductions to create more hit products?
Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yes, I am. But, look, I hate to pin myself to the rack of continual increases in million-dollar hit products. I'm trying not to do that. But that's our drive. I can tell you this. We're getting better and better at customer connection and innovation. And if you think about it, a complex product line (40:37) 65,000-plus SKUs is asymmetrically (40:40) enabled by new technology like 3D printing and finite element analysis and some of the other things like X-ray diffractometers, which is new to us, and electron microscopes and so on.
So, from a design point of view, we're getting better, so we don't have to put as much upfront into every product. And from a calling-the-airstrikes point of view, in other words, reacting to customer connection, we're getting better. And that has authored the continual improvement of our hit products. This year, it was up again. I would be aiming to bring it up next year, but we're not – it's not something we always report about. But I think every year, our new products become more impactful and more effective. I mean, just look at the VERUS Edge. The VERUS Edge is simply the best product available in diagnostics. And diagnostics is a rising category. It's faster, smarter, easier to use, and it gives you handheld access to our unique millions of records in – database of millions of records that allows technicians to shortcut the repair process. This is revolutionary, and that's just one thing.
We pointed out the prybar today in our – now, we use the prybar for a reason. The prybar is just – it's a prybar, yet customer connection and innovation showed us how to make that long-standing category so much better. That's what's happening in Snap-on. That's what's driving the business for us. And it works in the Tools Group. And we're confident it's going to work for critical industries, although there's turbulence as you can see in critical industries with oil and gas. I mean, oil and gas, I think, we – oil and gas, and military, we never – we always said that our penetration was low and we wouldn't see an impact, but we didn't contemplate going from $115 oil to $30 oil, which is cataclysmic.
Liam D. Burke - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.
Okay. And with the end markets in the automotive repair continuing to grow, are you seeing any change in the competitive front?

Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
I don't think so. I listen to the same publicity that you would listen to. And so people are – I think it's a robust market, so there's room for everybody to have some kind of good news in this market. But, when I go out – and I checked this the other day with our people, when I go out to the franchisees around the vans, they don't talk about the competitors. They talk about our business and how we can make it better. So I don't think we're seeing any kind of change at present.
I rode on a van where the guy talks about the numbers of competitors that left his route, in other words, gave up the business and went out. He keeps track of it, but that's all. I mean, he doesn't worry about the competition. He worries about himself. He worries about, well, okay our – things like, questions like, our power tool is actually a lot better than our old power tool, the one I replaced. Or maybe it isn't as good. We need to make it a little bit better. Those are the kinds of things we talk about. Or how much our productivity advancements like providing – for the vans, providing a mobile tablet for van drivers, a couple of mobile tablets for a van. 570 of our van drivers have assistance and the mobile tablet allows them to spread both the principal and the assistant out into different areas, greatly increasing their reach. They talk about that and the efficacy of that. They don't talk about the competitors.

From Barrington Research, we'll go to Gary Prestopino.
Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.
Hey. Good morning, everyone.
Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Hi, Gary.
Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.
Couple of questions here. I know somebody asked this about million-dollar products, but, Nick, could you maybe quantify what was the growth in million-plus products that you put out this year versus last year?
Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
I'm not going to actually quantify. I've tried to avoid quantifying that, and I'm not going to change that in this call. But I would say it was up this year by a reasonable margin. In fact, you might even call it a substantial margin in terms of what was launched. So we had a pretty good year in terms of new products. And remember, what I have said is that the number is now five times or six times what it was in 2006. That's a pretty...
Aldo J. Pagliari - Senior Vice President-Finance and Chief Financial Officer
...good number.
Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Pretty good increase.
Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.
That's helpful. And you would anticipate that, obviously, you're going to continue to try and strive to put out more new products, especially --
Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Sure. The whole point is yes. I'm probably not going to slit my wrists if it doesn't increase as much next year, you know what I mean? But certainly, we do target that and that's part of our plan. We would expect that to happen. We put the capabilities and the elements in place to make that happen. And we're getting – it's simply, Gary, we're getting better at it. We're getting better at it. You can see it in the Tools Group numbers.
Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.
Right.
Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
You know, okay, 8.7% against 1% or 2% GDPs.
Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.
Right. Can you maybe – we've – at least we think that you've had a recovery here for -- we're going into year seven, especially in the U.S. and the automotive market. Is there anything different that you're experiencing in this recovery versus maybe prior recoveries in your experience with Snap-on?

Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Actually, no. I don't think so. Actually, the recovery has been going on since 2009 and so I don't think so. I do think automotive repair, which is 70% of our business – 70%-plus of our business -- is relatively robust determined by the aging of the vehicles and the changing of the vehicles which isn't interrupted so much by economics. And so, I think automotive repair is in a good place and makes us resistant to these – not immune to these kinds of changes, but resistant. I don't see any change there. Look, I think, if you look at other geographies and industries, they go up and down like you see in oil and gas and in military, like in anybody else, but I don't see anything different about those that I haven't seen in a number of different ups and downs except that maybe the oil and gas (47:37).

No. That was fine. I think we were talking about just maybe differences in the recovery, what you're seeing.
Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yes. I don't think that much. I mean this is just – I mean certainly oil and gas is a bigger downturn than anybody's seen in a while. It's unusual, right? But other than that, I don't think so. This isn't our first rodeo. So, we've seen it. And automotive repair seems to be chunking along, I think.
Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.
Okay. And then one last...
Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Doing pretty well. Sure.
Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.
That's good to hear. One last question for Aldo; in terms of your international sales, they run, what, about 25% of your business, right, somewhere around there?
Aldo J. Pagliari - Senior Vice President-Finance and Chief Financial Officer
Yes. That's a – I think you have Europe is about 18% of the mix and emerging markets add another 10%.
Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.
That's what I'm getting at. In terms of currencies, the currencies that really impact you would probably be the pound, the euro and then what else?
Aldo J. Pagliari - Senior Vice President-Finance and Chief Financial Officer
You have it pretty much right. If you're looking at the sales line, Gary, the most important currency that creates a headwind is the euro. In addition to the euro, you have the Canadian dollar. Lot of people forget about that, but the Canadian dollar, the British pound would be the next most significant ones.
When it comes to the bottom line, we have more natural hedges throughout the continent of Europe. So, the euro actually has less of an impact on the bottom line. The biggest impact to our profitability is actually the Canadian dollar, the British pound.
Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.
Okay. So, the Canadian dollar and the pound are on (50:37)
Aldo J. Pagliari - Senior Vice President-Finance and Chief Financial Officer
Gee, that's why you see most of the impact manifesting itself in the Tools Group. If you think about the Tools Group is largely a sales footprint. So, they don't have a lot of cost that enjoy the benefit of the haircut in the weaker currencies in the United Kingdom and in Canada or Australia for that matter. So they don't enjoy the protection that you get where you have a euro-based organization. There's a lot more cost that decrease in U.S. dollar terms.

Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yes. The Tools Group was up 17.5% – was up 100 basis points. But that was against 70 basis points of negative currency. So, you can see where that affects, okay?
Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.
Okay. Thanks a lot, guys.

We'll go next to David Leiker, Robert W. Baird.
Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Hi. Good morning. This is Joe Vruwink in for David.
Unknown Speaker
Hi, Joe.
Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
The one slice of C&I that I don't believe you commented on yet was Asia. Any updates on growth rates or trends from the Asia Pacific region?
Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
It was mixed in the quarter. China was weaker than we've seen in a while. And so, we had China being weak and we had some – whereas Indonesia had been weak before. Indonesia was up, India was up, so we kind of had a balance there in terms of our mix in Asia Pacific, China being more difficult in this quarter. We see a lot of variation from quarter-to-quarter in Asia Pacific.
Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
And in China, is it possible to determine – this will sound strange, but if a slowdown in new vehicle demand, which may actually cause the fleet to age a bit ultimately ends up being more beneficial to Snap-on?
Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
I don't know. I don't think so. I mean, I kind of think the cars that are there in the park, they're going to age anyway. I don't think that the cars or the new cars that are being purchased are making the old cars go away. That's what I think. I don't think they're shipping those overseas to any big extent. Now, I could be wrong about that, but that's our general impression about China, it's a lot of different markets and a lot of different areas. I think the slowdown would probably help some, but I don't think it would be as big a factor as you might think. It's usually the size of the park.
Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
And then one last one on C&I. Is there any correlation in the military business for Snap-on to the wheeled vehicle programs getting rolled out? So if JLTV production starts ramping at Oshkosh, does Snap-on typically see a benefit in their defense business?
Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Well, I don't know if we've tied to particularly Oshkosh or something like that, but certainly, wheeling out of new programs help us a lot. For example, the F-35 is a help to us, the fighter vehicle, the fighter, because we have a lot of the business associated with supporting that for both production and for repair. So that kind of program is an underlying program.
But across the programs in the defense department, particularly around the projects, around with those new products, that business is very weak – was very weak this quarter. If they launch new products, like you say, a wheeled vehicle product at Oshkosh, that provides an opportunity and we're well-positioned to take advantage of that. So those kinds of programs, new vehicles do help us. But I don't know...
Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
And so...
Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
I don't know if you can just trace it to an Oshkosh program.
Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
No, no. I was thinking more broadly on the programs that you commented on. And so, is it, maybe, fair to say the duration of this pullback in military spending might be shorter than what's Snap-on dealt with in 2012, 2013, around the sequester?
Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer

Yes. Gee. I don't know. I think the government business is kind of uncertain. We've said, the military business was up in the quarter – up in the first two quarters. And we said we knew it was going to be uncertain. And now when it's down, I still say the same thing. Certainly, the things you're talking about. New programs are going to help and would shorten the cycle. That's true. Stabilization of the budget would help. It may be not as chronic as the controller of the prior cycle, but I can't really say for sure.
Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Okay. I will leave it there. Thank you.

From Jefferies, we'll hear from Bret Jordan.
David L. Kelley - Jefferies LLC
Good morning. This is actually David Kelley in for Bret this morning. Thanks for taking my questions. A couple of quick follow-ups on RS&I here. And I guess first regarding the flat undercar sales you mentioned. I know U.S. service chain reported a fourth quarter comp decline and largely due to some mild winter weather conditions along the East Coast. Just wondering if you saw some weather-related headwinds in the quarter and I guess how was domestic undercar performance? And how do we think about that segment going forward given the robust auto repair market we're talking about and really some of the significant miles driven gains we've seen over the last three months...
Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yes. Look, there's a lot of goes-ins and goes-outs in the undercar equipment business. First and foremost, that flatness is impacted by Eastern Europe. Among all our businesses, the undercar equipment business had the strongest position in Eastern Europe and Russia. So, the dips in those places impacted that business as just squeezed down to a smaller place the most. That's number one.
In terms of the other businesses, of course, weather can be a factor in undercar, and that might have been – say, it might be entitled to some of that in the fourth quarter and some of that bad weather. And then the other thing is, it was up quite – our undercar business is a longer wave business. It isn't just a quarter business. When we have a good quarter like we had in the third quarter, sometimes you'll have resources devoted to installation of those new products, flowing into the next quarter which will put a weight on the next quarter.
So, you see those three things rolling through it. I would expect – to your question about the longer-term, I expect that undercar repair will follow along with the generally robust vehicle repair market in the U.S. and in Europe as the cars get older. And by the way, as the cars get lighter and need more fuel economy, the precision of balancing and alignment needs to be stronger. So, we're very positive about the long-term future of that business, and we have a major share of it.
David L. Kelley - Jefferies LLC
All right, great. I appreciate the color. And then, just quickly, if you can provide some, maybe, color around the 260 basis points margin expansion for RS&I; just wondering how much of that is basic blocking and tackling around these RCI initiatives that continue to provide you, guys, tailwinds here?
Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Well, RCI is a big dollop of it. And then, of the 260 basis points, I would say, you've got a little bit of negative currency, and you got about 70 basis points or so, what I would call favorable mix. As you follow us over time, you will see that RS&I has quite a variation from business to business in terms of operating margin. It could be thousands of basis points.
And so, what happened in this quarter is we had another strong quarter of diagnostics and Mitchell, the business to independents which are high margin business, and a reduction of the hardware business which is equipment. So, that generated that 70 basis points, or so, of help from business mix. So, that's what you're seeing. RCI and business mix.

David L. Kelley - Jefferies LLC
All right, great. Thank you. And then, just a final one from me and this is more kind of a big picture thought question here. You're mentioning sales to OEM dealerships were up again single digits. And I guess as we think about maybe being on the back end of a cyclical recovery in new vehicle sales, do you think there might be a shift in dealership ordering patterns of equipment, either they're focusing more on parts than service retention or maybe they're spending less due to a flat retail sales market? How do you think about the dealership channel over the next...
Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
I'm not sure. Having worked in the auto industry for 11 years myself, I would say that's a hard call. I mean, I don't think you can make a lot out of this. I guess, we were saying mid-single digits or low single digits in the OEM dealership business this quarter. But I don't think you can make a conclusion on one quarter. Some of that got driven by programs out of OEM manufacturers, the essential diagnostics and so on. I do think you make a point that as new car sales attenuate, dealerships tend to focus a little bit more on parts and service. I think that is true to the extent that the time constants on which that rolls into our business, I'm not sure.
David L. Kelley - Jefferies LLC
All right, great. Thanks for taking my question.
Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer

David MacGregor of Longbow Research has a follow-up question. Please go ahead.
David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC
Yes. Just a follow-up, Nick; somewhere within your portfolio, there's got to be a line of business or a product or some franchise that serves as a pretty reliable leading indicator for you. And I'm just wondering if you could talk a little bit about where you're seeing leading indicators in your business and basically what they're telling you. There's obviously some concerns here about your ability to sustain growth in 2016. I just wanted to give you an opportunity to talk a little bit about why you're feeling confident to – certainly in the first half of 2016?
Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Well, our leading indicators are pretty much what we hear from our franchisees and what we see about the programs in terms of the changing of the vehicles and what we hear from our franchisees about their outlooks for the demand in their businesses. You can go out and talk to them, and the leading indicators are, gee, are we providing the kinds of tools that would solve the new problems that are coming on the horizons in the independent garages?
Now, this isn't a quantitative leading indicator, but it's been pretty reliable for us. And so what we see is the optimism coming out from them saying, boy, I think things are good and the fact that we our new product portfolios, our innovative new products are solving more problems than ever. Those are the kinds of things and that hasn't abated. So, I feel pretty good about that business. And in terms of the other businesses, I just think we also feel good about our growing strength in the critical industries. It's just that you see some very big headwinds in some of those critical industries. And I can't predict where those are going to go.
David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC
Can you just remind us again what...
Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
On the other hand, I will just offer that, we've seen up and down before and we've been able to grow profitability against the winds; not every quarter necessarily but in terms of a trend. We view our situation as a trend. If you go back and you look at our numbers from 2006 onwards, sales and profits, the trend continued and even through the recession, and the dip in the recession, that trend continued.

David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC
So, you continue to see growth in your future-dated orders?
Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
We don't have future-dated orders, really. We're not a future-dated order business. So, we don't have much of an order backlog.
David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC
Yes.
Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
We don't have that kind of thing. We have to rely on the kinds of things I've talked about.
David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC
All right. Okay. And just last question. Can you just remind us what critical industries represents as a percentage of total C&I?
Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
It represents about I'd say 40%. David, you can say given for government worth, it's $450 million business roughly, right?
David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC

Richard Hilgert - Morningstar Research
Congratulations on a great quarter, guys.
Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Richard.
Richard Hilgert - Morningstar Research
Just wanted to get your feel for what you're seeing in terms of puts and takes with some of the issues that we're facing right now on the new car side of the business. We're seeing diesel being a big issue right now. We're seeing hybrids being a big issue. We're seeing active safety coming into play over the next couple of years. I would imagine that with more and more electronic control, there's going to be more opportunities for diagnostics, maybe, but also I'm wondering on the Tools side, if there's any opportunities there. What's some of the puts and takes that you're seeing with all these changes coming down the pike?
Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Actually, Richard, all of those things are positive for our business. When the vehicles change, that requires new tool loads, new electronics, new undercar equipment to deal with the changes. If you just take one and if you think about self-driving vehicles and things like that, I mean, the more people rely on internal mechanisms inside the car, the more precise calibration has to be, and therefore, the more careful and more detailed the mechanical job is, the mechanics have to be.
And so if it gets more electronic, there's opportunities for diagnostics. If it gets more attended to onboard computers to control the car, more equipment and more diagnostics. And, ironically, during the time in which the cars have electrified, it's gone from – in the 1990s, it went from 50, 60 engine codes for a car to now thousands of engine codes. In that time, demand for hand tools has only increased because the reparability of the car is so far down in terms of the design considerations that the cars have become more and more difficult to physically repair, let alone diagnose associated with electronics.
So, all of those things are good for us. We see a very positive future and trend, and we're confident. That continues the trend that you see in our numbers. If you look at our numbers and you see over periods of time, sales and OI margin, continual trends in good times and challenged times.
Richard Hilgert - Morningstar Research
Great. Thank you very much.
Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Okay.
