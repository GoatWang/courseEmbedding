Transamerica Partners Government Money Market Schedule of Daily Information











                                                    Transamerica Partners Money Market changed its name to Transamerica Partners Government Money Market, 
                                                    and Transamerica Partners Institutional Money Market changed its name to Transamerica 
                                                    Partners Institutional Government Money Market, and each fund now operates as a “government” 
                                                    money market fund under new federal regulations, which became effective on October 14, 2016. 
                                                    A “government” money market fund invests at least 99.5% of its total assets in U.S. government 
                                                    securities, cash, and/or repurchase agreements that are fully collateralized by U.S. government 
                                                    securities or cash.  You could lose money by investing in the Fund. Although the Fund seeks 
                                                    to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. 
                                                    The Fund may impose a fee upon sale of your shares or may temporarily suspend your ability to sell 
                                                    shares if  the Fund's liquidity falls below required minimums because of market conditions or other 
                                                    factors. An investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance 
                                                    Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund's sponsor has no legal obligation to provide 
                                                    financial support to the Fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support 
                                                    to the Fund at any time.

                                                        Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. The investment return 
                                                        and principal value will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares, when redeemed, may
                                                        be worth more or less than the original cost. Prices and returns fluctuate daily.

                                                        and capital gains, but do not reflect any sales charges. Fund shares are sold without a sales charge. 
                                                        


                                                        Performance figures may reflect fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements by the Investment Adviser. 
                                                        Without such waivers and/or reimbursements, the performance would be lower. 
                                                        Future waivers and/or reimbursements are at the discretion of the Investment Adviser.
                                                        



                                                    Mutual funds are subject to market risk, including the loss of principal. Past Performance is not indicative

SUB-ADVISER        


With roots to 1928, Wellington Management is one of the largest independent investment management firms in the world. Wellington Management serves as a private firm whose sole business is investment management and to serve as investment adviser for institutional clients in over 40 countries. The firm's most distinctive strength is commitment to proprietary, independent research—the foundation upon which their investment approaches are built. Wellington Management's commitment to investment excellence is evidenced by their significant presence and long-term track records in nearly all sectors of the liquid, global securities markets.













30-DAY SEC YIELD

The 30-Day SEC Yield is computed in accordance with a standardized method prescribed by rules of the SEC. The 30-day SEC Yield is computed by dividing the fund's investment income per share earned during a particular 30-day base period by the maximum offering price per share on the last day of the base period, and then annualizing the result. The 30-day SEC Yield is calculated at each month end and updated within the first ten business days of the following month. These yields reflect the reimbursements or waivers of certain expense. Had fees not been waived and/or expenses reimbursed, the yields would have been lower.            

12-MONTH DISTRIBUTION YIELD

The 12-Month distribution yield is calculated by taking the sum of all distributions occurring over the previous twelve calendar months and dividing the result by the Fund's Net Asset Value (NAV) as of the date of the previous month-end. The distribution yield represents a 12-month historical distribution and does not represent the total return of the Fund and is not necessarily an indication of future distributions or yield. For Funds that have been in operation for less than one year, an annualized distribution yield is calculated by annualizing the Fund's historical distributions to date and dividing the result by the Fund's Net Asset Value (NAV) as of the date of the previous month-end. The annualized distribution yield represents an estimated 12-month distribution from the Fund based on the limited distribution history of the Fund to date and does not represent the total return of the Fund and is not necessarily an indication of future distributions or yield. Past performance does not guarantee future results.
