“Don't miss this show!”


Reviewed January 25, 2017



via mobile




An absolutely brilliant show. These five British lads harmonize wonderfully. You'll be clapping your hands and dancing in your seats. They have great stage presence and their adaptations of some of the greatest rock hits are fantastic. Particularly enjoyed Bohemian Rhapsody (Queen) and Music of the Night (Phantom of the Opera). If you only see one show in Vegas - make it this one!!

“High energy, new classic rock show”


Reviewed January 25, 2017



via mobile




We received comp tickets to see the Tenors of Rock show at Harrah's. We really did not know what to expect. This is a new show in Las Vegas, only about two weeks old. I think that they have done a great job of working out the kinks. The performers are five men from the U.K. Each in there own right are very talented soloists. Combined, they are great. They have great voices and blend together nicely. My wife and I are products of the sixties and are not classic rock fans. The concert had enough variety for everyone. We thought that it was a nice touch that the singers and dancers came out into the audience and performed from there. The music is loud and sometimes somewhat overbearing. I think that there is something for everyone.

“Loved IT”


Reviewed January 25, 2017




I was at the third show ever they did during their residency at Harah's Las Vegas. I was told when I booked that they were loud and very energentic and the sound was great. Well I was not disappointed. These guys could sing opera to rock and they were sooooo good. I was rocking and loving the entire show. Their Talents of each one was out of this world. The show was on the big stage and on side stages. They were in the audience and interacting. I may be in my 60's but believe me, I knew every song and I can't say really explain how much I enjoyed this show. Keep it up guys I will be back!!!!!

“Loved it! These guys ROCK!!”


Reviewed January 23, 2017




Was looking for an inexpensive music show to see during our first night at Harrah's, and WOW, did we make the right choice! My partner and I LOVE rock music, and we had a great time at the show. These guys are very talented, and entertaining. The band was great, too. Loved the performance of Bohemian Rhapsody, which, apparently, was a new addition to the show!The dancing ladies were good, but a little goes a long way. I think some of the bits with the dancers could be removed from the act. I'm sure they'll figure out what 'works' as time goes on. Harrah's Showroom is a small venue, and it's cool that the guys and dancers wander out into the audience, but closer to the stage is definitely better. However, if you're in the first couple of rows, you might feel like the big boxes (speakers?) on the stage block your view a bit. The side seats were good. The lighting and stage sets were great. If you love rock, go see these guys!!

“Best rock show in Vegas”


Reviewed February 14, 2017



via mobile




I found their renditions of rock's classics both fresh and professional. Their harmony and personality's were engaging as they gave the audience everything they had. All the while being appreciative to the audience for their support and encouragement. A pleasant break from the artist who thinks the world revolves around them with no appreciation for their customer.

“Tenors or Rock .... "You Rock"”


Reviewed February 14, 2017




I knew I would like this show because I like rock music however, my husband is a country music fan so our tastes tend to differ. We both enjoyed this show immensely. The show was energetic and entertaining. The guys were entertaining and interactive making sure everyone had a great time. I saw several comments about the dancers. I thought the girls were beautiful and talented and did a great job. There is nothing I would change. This is a show I would recommend to others and will most likely return to see again. Highly recommend!

“When the tenors first came onstage, I was scared ...”


Reviewed February 13, 2017




thinking it might be an Iron Maiden or Alice Cooper tribute but so very happy I was wrong. Classic Rock at its absolutely finest! The guys are Big Big Big in the United Kingdom and now Las Vegas audiences can enjoy their huge talent. They adapted songs like Stairway to Heaven to their own beat, their voices meld together in a soup of perfection, and when they did their own version of Bohemian Rhapsody, I almost fainted with joy. Can't recommend this show highly enough! Intimate seating area, courteous staff, theater was completely full of patrons as it deserves to be. BRAVO!

“Great show”


Reviewed February 11, 2017




If you love rock, AC/DC, guns and roses, Rolling Stones, Beatles, then this show is for you. They do it in their own wonderful way without destroying the original piece. The dancers were energetic and pretty. I'll go back and watch it again, since I can get free tickets

Tenors of Rock are the newest most exciting vocal group around. Formed with five of the best male rock voices in the UK. The concept was to reinvent the standard male vocal group and create a seriously high profile rock experience. The vocal range and harmonic complexity really pushes new boundaries and sets ToR apart from all other vocal groups.
The music and current set list of Tenors of Rock is truly diverse.

This show also caters to all of the rock and roll groupies out there and if you consider yourself to be a skilled karaoke singer, you will have the chance to sing your face clean off to all of your favorite rock and roll classics.
There are various blasts from the past, as the Tenors of Rock offer performance of several classic songs, such as “Sweet Child O’ Mine,” “Whole Lotta Love” and “Living on a Prayer”.
