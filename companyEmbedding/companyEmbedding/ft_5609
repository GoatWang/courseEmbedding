Description





While most mobile devices use the 3.5mm headphone jack some are using a smaller 2.5mm version. Meanwhile most home audio systems with an amplifier or receiver use RCA jacks for audio inputs. This cable is ideal for connecting the 2.5mm output of your mp3 player or phone to the RCA jacks on your home audio system. The cable is made of heavy-duty coaxial cable for each conductor. The conductors are 22 AWG and each conductor is shield to prevent EMI or RFI interference from entering your audio system. The cable is 12mm x 6mm thick while the connector housings are about 41mm long x 15mm diameter.



Features


Because of their size and weight these cables are best suited for more permanent connections, such as from your PC to your sound system
If you want something more suitable for portable applications, please try one of our standard 3.5mm to RCA audio cables
