You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.

Value for Money







Pros:  I liked the following most about this software: It was easy to use on most things. Those parts I did not know how to use the staff helped me. They were kind, patient and timely. With this software we were able to reach 72% of our fundraising goal. The previous year (we did not have access to this software) we met 0% of that goal. 
Cons:  This software was linked to another system, so we did not get full credit for our fundraising efforts on this platform. We are excited that this feature will be added this year!
Overall:  Able to fundraise even though I have limited experience and resources to reach our intended audience.

Overall:  being able to sign up for Give For Good Louisville

Pros:  The software was easy to navigate for a first time user and produced an excellent fundraising page for our non-profit. Very good instructions on how to set up the page which help do it quickly. 
Cons:  I am not very good with graphic design, and it took me a while to figure out how to crop the pictures to the right size. 
Overall:  First time using this software, it was through Forefront and the ILGive promotion day for Non-Profits in the state of Illinois.  This was the first major on-line fundraiser that we had done and we were very pleased with the outcome.

Pros:  What I liked most was that the Give Gab website is very much user friendly. Setting up our pages was a fairly smooth process for me as I'm not an IT individual so it is truly user friendly. Also when I did need some help the customer service chat on line feature was very efficient! 
Cons:  I have nothing negative to report. Seedlings of Change is signed up with both Missoula Gives and Montana Gives and so it would be helpful to have a way to reflect the totals collected in both combined rather than completely separate. This feature would be helpful. 














Overall, my experience is good. Sometimes, I would like a little more information about a topic.

Pros:  The ease of signing up and logging hours.  Also, saving time sending out notices to members and the reports that can be generated.
Cons:  Sometimes moving from one facet of the software to another gets confusing.  The button on the Volunteer Northwest Mississippi website should have better wording.  You don't see GiveGab until later in the process.
Overall:  Easier method to inform my membership about times, places and changes in opportunities they learn about in our meetings.  Tabulating hours and printing report.

Pros:  Customer Service is world class and very quick. You can also do a TON with this product including signing up individual fundraisers which I love.

Pros:  The peer-to-peer fundraising feature is the best there is -- seriously. It's easy, attractive, and as the administrator, I appreciate that changes I make on the organizational page carry through to peer pages.
Cons:  I have only 2 complaints. 
First, the email we (and our fundraisers) get at the end of a campaign that says "Girls Inc. of Holyoke has ended." It has??
Second, I have the worst time trying to get the header photos for a campaign to fit the page. I've tried everything, and no matter what I do, it gets re-cropped, stretched, or otherwise looks weird.

Cons:  Customer response is misleading. There is an instant message that pops up but its just a bot. A little frustrating.


Vendor Response
by GiveGab
                on June 21, 2017
Scott, thank you so much for your positive comments regarding how easy GiveGab is to use - we truly appreciate it! 

Regarding your comment about our chat feature being a bot, the support tool we use has real live people responding.  Sometimes our support tool tries to answer questions with prompt feedback through artificial intelligence so we can improve, which may have been what you encountered as a bot. 

The Customer Success team aims to respond within 2 hours to a chat - but sometimes the "bot" answers questions before we do in a small percentage of conversations (this is usually before 9 AM or after 5 PM EST). We still follow up after the fact to ensure your question was answered!

I'm sorry you were misled in who you were chatting with. Rest assured, there is always a human on the other end and we are more than happy to help you with anything you might need :) 














Very easy to use and the customer service is great. They are always there to help and happy to do so

Pros:  How easy it is to use! You can use it for any type of fundraiser and make each page look unique! Also the customer service. They are always on hand to let help you and teach you how to fix the program in the future!
Cons:  The "would you like to cover the fees" button isn't easy for all donors to see so it often gets overlooked, in my opinion
Overall:  Easy fundraising that has allowed us to raise money for a variety of events

Pros:  Very easy to set up our campaigns. Then donors get instant gratification seeing their donations and comments posted immediately on the site.  It looks so professional and sleek. I can't wait to use it for our upcoming Memorial Walk event!
Cons:  Working as a volunteer for my not for profit organization, I fear for every penny we endeavor to collect! I feel that the paid platforms are a little pricey, but understand that the developers need to make money, too. 
Overall:  Professional looking donation platform that is user friendly as well as making the set up easy.  I love the analytics when compiling data after a campaign!

Cons:  There were not many negatives to the software. I suppose it would have benefited our non-profit to have more than 24 hours for the giving day.

Pros:  ease of use
Cons:  We have a complicated event registration with fundraising goals and registration fees.  We needed the registration fees to not be counted towards the registrant's goal.  It was hard to sort it all out but finally we did to some fashion.
Overall:  We have used GiveGab for multiple online campaigns . They offer a superb product with extraordinarily helpful, friendly and educated support staff.
Creating a campaign is easy with their software.  They have fresh, contemporary, and uncluttered design options with a few different color schemes so your campaigns don't always look alike.  It is easy to present a cohesive campaign/event with their easy-to-fill text boxes and variety of drop down menus you can use for event registration. if needed. The reports are generated with a click of a button and are emailed right to you at work.  I actually liked getting in the "back end" of the system to work.  What lay person ever says that!
Previously we had been working with a competitor to GiveGab.  I was always stressed about their software not functioning well and their people being hours away and essentially strangers to our non-profit.  When we left the competitor, it took them more than one year to reach out to us to ask why.  I simply told them that the GiveGab product was superior, the technical support staff a dream, and the fact that they GiveGab is a national company with a hard-working, local vibe sealed the deal.
You will not be disappointed if you choose GiveGab.
Recommendations to other buyers: Like in anything, there are glitches in life and art.  You just have to be creative to work through them.

Over the past 18 months, GiveGab's customer base of nonprofits who have fundraised on its agile giving platform has grown from less than 100 to more than 2,500 currently, with a significant pipeline for 2017. Additionally, the company has also seen rapid growth in Giving Days, quickly advancing from two annual giving days to more than 50, and growing.Charlie Mulligan, Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder of GiveGab, commented, "We developed our unique giving platform by listening to our customers, and created an easy-to-use solution for the challenges they face. It is simple yet effective, facilitating their fundraising efforts and helping them build long-term engaged relationships with their supporters. Throughout their fundraising initiatives, we aim to provide superior customer service, further differentiating GiveGab. Some of the many Giving Days who have utilized our platform include ILGive (Illinois), NYGivesDay (New York), OregoniansGive, CUNY Tuesday, The Big Give (San Antonio), Idaho Gives, Kentucky Gives, and Cornell Giving Day. To support our increasing customer base and programs, we expect to invest further in our staffing and systems as we seek to become the national giving platform of choice."Allen F. ("Pete") Grum, President and Chief Executive Officer of Rand Capital, added, "GiveGab's growth is a testament to the effectiveness of their platform and customer service. GiveGab enables nonprofits to carry out their mission more efficiently, supporting the rapidly growing "giving back" movement. As an example, the recent New York Gives Day 2016 initiative involved approximately 900 nonprofits working together to raise over $11 million in donations and gifts, from more than 29,000 donors. Rand not only has great confidence in GiveGab's technology and business model, we also feel very good about helping to fund a business that is having a major positive impact on giving to nonprofit organizations and those in need."Rand made an initial investment in GiveGab in 2013 and a follow-on in 2015. Rand currently has a 7.4% equity position in GiveGab, amounting to approximately 1.5% of Rand's portfolio.ABOUT GiveGabFounded in 2011, GiveGab, the user-friendly nonprofit giving platform, connects donors and volunteers with organizations that support their interests.
