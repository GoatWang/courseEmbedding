                Bates, Randy — Pens by Randy
            
Stanford, KY



Products

turned pens





Randy E. Bates takes joy in hand-turning pens, lamps, and other works on his lathe, “bringing out the hidden beauty in wood. He explains, “It’s exciting to see how each pen turns out (pun intended) since very piece of wood is unique.”
 
In making his pens, Randy hand turns, finishes and assembles the turned elements with purchased hardware himself. He turns unique woods and colorful acrylics and combines them with high quality hardware. The result is a pen that will withstand many years of use. 
 
His oil lamps are hand turned on the lathe from specially selected pieces of wood, and carefully finished.
 
Randy lives in Stanford, KY with his wife, two dogs, five cats and a bird. He is a juried member of the Kentucky Guild of Artists and Craftsmen.
 
Works by Randy Bates can be found at the Kentucky Artisan Center at Berea, Berea, KY.
