The fund may invest up to 20% of its managed assets in municipal securities rated below investment quality or judged by the manager  to be of comparable quality, of which up to 10% of its managed assets may be rated below B-/B3 or of comparable quality.  The fund uses leverage.

RISKSInvestment, Market, and Price Risk: Closed-end fund shares are subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of the entire principal amount that you invest.  Common shares frequently trade at a discount to their NAV.  At any point in time, your common shares may be worth less than you paid, even after considering the reinvestment of fund distributions.Interest Rate Risk: Fixed-income securities such as bonds, preferred, convertible and other debt securities will decline in value if market interest rates rise.Credit Risk: Debt or preferred securities held by the fund may fail to make dividend or interest payments when due.  Investments in securities below investment grade credit quality are predominantly speculative and subject to greater volatility and risk of default.  Unrated securities are evaluated by fund managers using industry data and their own analysis processes that may be similar to that of a nationally recognized rating agency; however, such internal ratings are not equivalent to a national agency credit rating. Counterparty credit risk may arise if counterparties fail to meet their obligations, should the fund hold any derivative instruments for either investment exposure or hedging purposes.Leverage Risk: The fund’s use of leverage may cause higher volatility for the fund’s per share NAV, market price, and distributions.  Leverage typically magnifies the total return of the fund’s portfolio, whether that return is positive or negative. Leverage is intended to increase common share net income, but there is no assurance that the fund’s leveraging strategy will be successful.  Different forms of leverage, including swaps, may introduce additional credit or interest rate risk. Leverage may also increase a fund’s liquidity risk, as the fund may need to sell securities at inopportune times to stay within fund or regulatory limits.Single State Concentration Risk: Because the fund primarily purchases municipal bonds from a single state or U.S. territories, such as Puerto Rico, the fund is more susceptible to adverse local economic, political, or regulatory changes affecting municipal bond issuers in those locations. Certain municipal bond issuers in Puerto Rico have recently experienced financial difficulties and rating agency downgrades.Inverse Floater Risk: The fund invests in inverse floaters. Due to their leveraged nature, these derivative investments can greatly increase a fund’s exposure to interest rate risk and credit risk, including counter-party credit risk. In addition, investments in inverse floaters involve the risk that the fund could lose more than its original principal investment.Tax Risk: The tax treatment of fund distributions may be affected by future changes in tax laws and regulations or their interpretation by the Internal Revenue Service or state tax authorities.Call Risk or Prepayment Risk: Issuers may exercise their option to prepay principal earlier than scheduled, forcing the fund to reinvest in lower-yielding securities.Hedging Risk: The fund may use derivative instruments for hedging purposes, but there is no assurance that the fund’s hedging strategy will be successful.  Derivatives may involve a high degree of financial risk, including the risk that the loss on a derivative may be greater than the principal amount invested.Municipal Bond Market Liquidity Risk: Inventories of municipal bonds held by brokers and dealers have decreased in recent years, either due to broker-dealer choices or to federal banking regulations, reducing their ability to make a market in these securities. This may decrease the fund’s ability to buy or sell bonds, and may increase bond price volatility and trading costs, particularly during periods of economic or market stress. As a result, the fund may be forced to sell a security at a lower price than desired, to sell other securities to raise cash, or to give up an investment opportunity, any of which could have a negative effect on performance. Large block sales could further reduce bond prices and hurt fund performance.
NOTES


					** The premium/discount is calculated as (most recent price/most recent NAV) -1.






				Income may be subject to state and local income taxes and the alternative minimum tax. Capital gains, if any, will be subject to capital gains tax.

†† INCOME ONLY DISTRIBUTIONS

				Distributions are sourced entirely from net investment income, unless noted otherwise.
				
						
							Distribution rates represent the latest declared regular distribution, annualized, relative to the most recent market price and NAV. Special distributions, including special capital gains distributions, are not included in the calculation.
						
					
			
1 Taxable Equivalent Yield

				Taxable equivalent yield is the yield or distribution rate needed from a taxable investment to be economically equal to receiving the stated tax-free yield from a municipal bond investment. Please note that the income levels shown in the calculator do not reflect (i) any federal or state limitations on the amounts of allowable itemized deductions, phaseouts of personal or dependent exemption credits or other allowable credits, (ii) any local taxes imposed, or (iii) any alternative minimum taxes or any taxes other than personal income taxes. The user is responsible for selecting the applicable federal and, as applicable, state tax rates. The stated federal tax rates for joint incomes over $250,000 include the 3.8% medicare tax imposed on the net investment income of certain taxpayers with higher incomes. This calculator is for illustrative purposes only and is not intended to represent actual performance, or to predict future performance, of any Nuveen Investments product. Certain taxpayers may find their effective marginal tax rates to be greater than those shown in the calculator. In that case, the taxable equivalent yield may be even higher.
			

				Income may be subject to state and local taxes, as well as the federal alternative minimum tax. There is no assurance that tax rates will remain unchanged; the rates used are believed to be correct for tax year 2016.

Nuveen Pennsylvania Dividend Advantage Municipal Fund
[K&L Gates LLP Letterhead]    BY EDGAR    January 25, 2010    Division of Investment Management  Securities and Exchange Commission  100 F Street,
N.E.  Washington, D.C. 20549  Attn:
John Grzeskiewicz, Esq.   


 
Re:
Nuveen Dividend Advantage Municipal Fund (File Nos. 333-164409; 811-09297)  Nuveen Dividend Advantage Municipal Fund 3 (File Nos. 333-164404; 811-10345)  Nuveen New Jersey Dividend Advantage Municipal Fund 2 (File Nos. 333-164478; 811-10551)  Nuveen Pennsylvania Dividend Advantage Municipal Fund (File Nos. 333-164479; 811-09457)  Registration Statements on Form N-2 Relating to MuniFund Term Preferred Shares  Dear Mr. Grzeskiewicz:  During the week of January 18, 2010, each of the above referenced funds (collectively, the January Funds) filed a Registration Statement on Form N-2 (each, a Registration Statement
and collectively the January Registration Statements) for the purpose of registering its MuniFund Term Preferred Shares of beneficial interest, Series 2015, liquidation preference $10 per share (MTP
Shares). The purpose of this letter is to request selective review of each of the Registration Statements, in accordance with the Commissions release on selective review, Revised Procedures For Processing Registration
Statements, Post-Effective Amendments and Preliminary Proxy Materials Filed by Registered Investment Companies, Investment Company Act Release No. 13768 (February 15, 1984).  In connection with the previous offering of MTP Shares by Nuveen Insured Dividend Municipal Advantage Fund (Insured
Dividend), the SEC staff reviewed and commented on Insured Dividends registration statement (File Nos. 333-160630; 811-09475) relating to MTP Shares (the Insured Dividend Registration Statement).
Subsequently, Nuveen has filed MTP Shares registration statements (the Previously Filed Registration Statements) for each of 24 additional funds (the Previous Funds) and requested selective review
for portions of each of those registration statements that were identical to (or substantially identical to) the Insured Dividend Registration Statement.  As we have discussed, the rights and preferences of the MTP Shares issued by Insured Dividend are identical to the MTP Shares to be issued by each of the January Funds. Furthermore, Insured Dividend and
each of the January Funds share the same board of trustees,




officers, investment adviser, legal counsel (both special counsel and special Massachusetts counsel), independent registered public accounting firm, transfer agent, custodian and redemption and
paying agent. As a result, the prospectus disclosure items set forth below are identical (or substantially identical) among the Insured Dividend Registration Statement and each of the January Registration Statements (page numbers correspond to the
Nuveen Dividend Advantage Municipal Fund Registration Statement). In addition, as a general matter, only those fund-specific disclosures (e.g., investment objectives and policies, investment restrictions, portfolio composition, portfolio
manager) in the prospectus and statement of additional information comprising each of the January Registration Statements are not substantially identical to those in the Insured Dividend Registration Statement, given the different investment focus
of these funds. The tax disclosures in the two state-specific January Registration Statements differ from the disclosures made in the Previously Filed Registration Statements, to the extent that the disclosure addresses state tax consequences of
investing in MTP Shares. In addition, the two state-specific January Funds have retained special legal counsel to advise on state-specific risk disclosure and tax disclosure.  Identical or Substantially Identical Disclosure Items

 Available Information (pgs. 65)  We believe this letter demonstrates the suitability of selective review of the January Registration Statements, based on the SEC staffs previous review and comment on the Insured Dividend
Registration Statement and its review of each of the Previously Filed Registration Statements. We note that, since the filing of the Insured Dividend Registration Statement, the Insured Dividend MTP Share offering, including one exercise of the
underwriters over-allotment option, and nine Previous Funds MTP Share offerings, including five exercises of the underwriters over-allotment options, have closed. We believe this demonstrates an increasing market acceptance of the
MTP Shares product, and highlights the market window currently open to these offerings. Please call me, Stacy H. Winick (202-778-9252) or Eric S. Purple (202-778-9220) if you have any questions about the enclosed, or if you require anything further.
 Very truly yours,  /s/ David P. Glatz  David P. Glatz
