The Philips Airfryer allows you to prepare healthier versions of your family’s favorite foods by frying them with a tablespoon or less of oil and draining excess fat while cooking. The unique Rapid Air technology circulates air around the entire unit, heating up to 390 degrees to ensure everything is cooked evenly and quickly. Food turns out crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.

* Compared to fresh fries prepared in a conventional Philips fryer




























Gordon Ramsay and the Philips Airfryer


Two innovative originals team up to cook healthy meals










" Cooking healthy shouldn't mean sacrificing taste.  My family and I love using the Philips Airfryer because its unique TurboStar technology makes dishes taste great with amazing texture.  Air is the new oil, and this time-saving tool stays in our kitchen.  It's just like having my own little sous chef that doesn't talk back"
 
Gordon Ramsay
 
 





























































The healthier way to cook


 
Our unique Rapid Air system fries to perfection with little or no added fat. Optimal temperature and precision air circulation produce a cleaner, safer, economical alternative to oil frying. Your Airfryer is fast and effective for baking, roasting and grilling, too. 























With the Airfryer you can fry, grill, roast and even bake

Roasting













































It’s not an Airfryer without the starfish 


 Only Philip’s starfish shaped pan provides the airflow needed to cook food faster and more evenly

















  
The Philips Airfryer makes it possible to enjoy food that’s crunchy on the outside and tender on the inside with up to 75% less fat.
 
How does it work?
The unique Rapid Air technology from Philips allows you to prepare food using only air. Thanks to its unique combination of fast and precise circulating hot air, an optimal temperature balance and a grill element it allows you to fry, roast, bake or grill all kinds of delicious food. Because you are only using air for frying, it is much safer and it saves you and your home from the smell of fried oil compared to a regular fryer. Thanks to the dishwasher-safe parts the Airfryer is also easy to clean!




















Why does the starfish shape matter to me?
















The Original Philips Airfryer with Starfish technology

































                The unique Starfish technology and design in the bottom of the pan, circulates air 360° giving you the most evenly cooked food.
                




















Competitive Airfryers without Starfish technology

































                Having no shape in the bottom decreases airflow and sometimes creates burnt food on the outside and undercooked food on the inside.
                





















All of our Airfryer models are tested at the Philips development center in Austria and held to the highest standards with regards to overall performance expectations.

      strategies that will further position the company ahead of industry 
      competition.
    

      Philip has joined UNIPOWER with over 20 years of operations and 
      executive management experience in high mix/mid-volume electronics 
      manufacturing with such companies as Yazaki, Valeo, Stoneridge and

* Compared to fresh fries prepared in a conventional Philips fryer




























Gordon Ramsay and the Philips Airfryer


Two innovative originals team up to cook healthy meals










" Cooking healthy shouldn't mean sacrificing taste.  My family and I love using the Philips Airfryer because its unique TurboStar technology makes dishes taste great with amazing texture.  Air is the new oil, and this time-saving tool stays in our kitchen.  It's just like having my own little sous chef that doesn't talk back"
 
Gordon Ramsay
 
 





























































The healthier way to cook


 
Our unique Rapid Air system fries to perfection with little or no added fat. Optimal temperature and precision air circulation produce a cleaner, safer, economical alternative to oil frying. Your Airfryer is fast and effective for baking, roasting and grilling, too. 























With the Airfryer you can fry, grill, roast and even bake

It’s not an Airfryer without the starfish 


 Only Philip’s starfish shaped pan provides the airflow needed to cook food faster and more evenly

















  
The Philips Airfryer makes it possible to enjoy food that’s crunchy on the outside and tender on the inside with up to 75% less fat.
 
How does it work?
The unique Rapid Air technology from Philips allows you to prepare food using only air. Thanks to its unique combination of fast and precise circulating hot air, an optimal temperature balance and a grill element it allows you to fry, roast, bake or grill all kinds of delicious food. Because you are only using air for frying, it is much safer and it saves you and your home from the smell of fried oil compared to a regular fryer. Thanks to the dishwasher-safe parts the Airfryer is also easy to clean!




















Why does the starfish shape matter to me?
















The Original Philips Airfryer with Starfish technology

































                The unique Starfish technology and design in the bottom of the pan, circulates air 360° giving you the most evenly cooked food.
                




















Competitive Airfryers without Starfish technology

































                Having no shape in the bottom decreases airflow and sometimes creates burnt food on the outside and undercooked food on the inside.
                





















All of our Airfryer models are tested at the Philips development center in Austria and held to the highest standards with regards to overall performance expectations.

Improving imaging outcomes through a better patient experience


                 
                









The experience and comfort of patients in the imaging suite can have a real and tangible impact on multiple areas of the department. Patient movement, for example, can have a domino effect: non-diagnostic-quality images lead to re-scanning; re-scans delay patient diagnosis and hamper department throughput; and both staff and patient incur stress in the process.
 
By focusing on the people behind the images, we aim to improve the quality of imaging outcomes. Specially designed equipment that makes procedures more comfortable and pleasant for the patient, analytics that properly manage radiation exposure, and advanced technologies that help deliver the right image the first time: All help give patients a more positive feeling about their care and treatment and empower staff to put patients first.

Improving imaging outcomes through a better patient experience


                 
                









The experience and comfort of patients in the imaging suite can have a real and tangible impact on multiple areas of the department. Patient movement, for example, can have a domino effect: non-diagnostic-quality images lead to re-scanning; re-scans delay patient diagnosis and hamper department throughput; and both staff and patient incur stress in the process.
 
By focusing on the people behind the images, we aim to improve the quality of imaging outcomes. Specially designed equipment that makes procedures more comfortable and pleasant for the patient, analytics that properly manage radiation exposure, and advanced technologies that help deliver the right image the first time: All help give patients a more positive feeling about their care and treatment and empower staff to put patients first.

Business/July 28, 2017/26 views /NYSE:PMPhilip Morris International Inc.Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) Focus On Smoke-Free Product Facilityshare on:FacebookTwitterPhilip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) is planning to invest around €490 million to transform its cigarette manufacturing factory in Otopeni, near Bucharest, into a high-tech facility to produce HEETS, the tobacco segments used with the IQOS. The transformation of the factory into a HEETS manufacturing facility has already started and is anticipated to be fully operational and completed by 2020. This investment will create around 300 additional professions for highly-skilled personnel at the Romanian facility, which presently employs around 600 people.
The details
Romania will become a part of growing list of nations where Philip Morris produces heated tobacco segments for IQOS. The company also reported plans to execute two new high-tech manufacturing lines in Neuchâtel, to manufacture HEETS.
In June, Philip Morris reported that it would expand capacity at the firm’s heated tobacco unit production facility in Bologna, and also reported plans to establish a new center for HEETS in Dresden. In addition, the company will also convert its cigarette facilities in Russia and Greece by the close of 2018. It intends to have a total yearly installed capacity of around 100 billion heated tobacco segments.
HEETS and IQOS have been accessible in 16 towns throughout Romania from the start of this year. IQOS is presently accessible in major cities in over 27 markets across the world and is anticipated to be accessible in 30-35 markets, either major cities or countrywide by the close of 2017, as capacity allows.
Commenting on this update, André Calantzopoulos, the CEO of Philip Morris, reported that their investment in Romania further exhibits their commitment to an imminent period in which smoke-free offerings ultimately replace cigarettes. They are thrilled the 2.9 million smokers across the globe who have already left smoking and moved to IQOS. The company anticipate this momentum to continue and the transformation of the Romanian facility will assist them to meet the increasing demand from adult smokers for better options to cigarettes.
