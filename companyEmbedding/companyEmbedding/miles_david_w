Product DescriptionEver wonder why they called him the Good Samaritan? Find out why in this level 2 I Can Read, written in the tradition of the popular Adventure Bible. Jewish people and the Samaritans were enemies they would never have considered helping one another. So what happens when a Jew is robbed, and left on the side of the road to die? Who stops to help? Read as Jesus tells a remarkable story about a man who serves his neighbor as God would want. Perfect for beginning readers ages 4-8, learning Bible stories on their own."More Product InformationPublisher: Zonderkidz

other and enhance this tribute for future generations.
