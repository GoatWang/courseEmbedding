Wealth and Risk Management for Families & Institutions
 
 

 
 





We don't see a pair of worn out shoes.


We see years of hard work worth protecting.

 

 
 
 
 
 




Roble Belko & Company
Roble Belko & Company is an investment advisory firm located in Pittsburgh, PA offering wealth and risk management services for high net worth individuals, families, and small institutions. We believe in the fundamental principle that investment diversification leads to capital preservation over the long run. Our investment strategies cater best to clients who want to preserve and enhance their assets through a holistic approach and seek to cultivate deep relationships with their advisors.
Whether for a family or institution, our disciplined process is centered on an asset-liability management framework to provide long run solutions toward their objectives. This approach relies on a proprietary risk management system developed as a result of several decades of capital markets experience. For families we further overlay a coordinated service offering to drive a transparent and integrated wealth management platform across various important aspects of their lives.

 
 


Our Holistic Service Offering


 
 
 
 





People

Our Principals have almost sixty years of combined experience in the investment industry. Our Team is homegrown and also comes predominantly from prior careers in the institutional markets. They have worked their way toward advanced degrees and certifications such that they are best prepared to add value for our clients. This is important, since we believe very much in a team oriented approach to our client service delivery model.


 


Process

We have developed an investment process well suited for institutional clientele, however we utilize the same disciplined process for our family clients. Given our fiduciary obligation to our clients, we’ve incorporated many different risk management tools into our process. Investment decisions are driven via a healthy combination of quantitative and qualitative analysis, some of which can be attributed to our years of experience in the investment industry.


 


Technology

We have custom built the key systems we use for our investment process, including our proprietary risk management system and our investment model. In our desire to be as transparent as possible, we have customized a financial dashboard with daily feeds of various investment metrics we utilize as advisors and portfolio managers. This technology has further enhanced the client experience, while creating greater efficiencies in the delivery of information and service.


 
 
 




Our Clients


 
 
 



Families

Family. Assets. Lifestyle. Legacy.
Roble Belko & Company serves as a financial advisor to a select group of entrepreneurs, business owners and executives who, with limited exceptions, have a minimum of $2 million in investable assets. Our clients are typically, but not always, first generation wealth creators who desire a diversified and disciplined investment approach seeking superior results over the long run. By working with a controlled number of clients, we are able to provide a holistic service offering which emphasizes an integrated wealth management approach for the whole family.


 
 


Institutions

Roble, Belko & Company also works with small institutions that otherwise cannot get the attention of the larger service providers. These mandates span from traditional asset allocation strategies to more sophisticated asset/liability management and cash matching strategies. Again, by working with a select number of mandates, we can provide these clients a level of service they deserve.

What is Preservation?
To us, preservation means ultimate protection – safeguarding a lifetime of investments, decisions, propositions and dreams. We often find that the concentration of risk is what creates the wealth, while the diversification preserves it. By providing our clients with a disciplined wealth management style, we never stray from the ultimate goal of wealth preservation.


 
 


Risk Management
Often times our clients have successfully passed the riskier stages of their business ventures, and have had the good fortune of a liquidity event.  As their financial advisor, we provide our clients an appropriate game plan and tools to navigate investment risk and a plan that seeks to satisfy their retirement and philanthropic objectives.

Roble, Belko & Company also works with small institutions that otherwise cannot get the attention of the larger service providers. These mandates span from traditional asset allocation strategies to more sophisticated asset/liability management and cash matching strategies. Again, by working with a select number of mandates, we can provide these clients a level of service they deserve.
