BEIJING, May 14, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Autohome Inc. (NYSE:   ATHM) ("Autohome" or the "Company"), the leading online destination for automobile consumers in China, today announced its intention to establish a strategic joint venture (JV) with HappiGO Home Shopping Co (HappiGO), a leading TV shopping business in China, to build a full-service auto sales platform.  HappiGO is controlled by Hunan Broadcasting Systems, one of the largest media groups in China.
This JV will combine the marketing efforts of HappiGO's dedicated automotive TV series that offers feature programs with Autohome's dedicated webpage to distribute the related content with a focus on the sale of automobiles through a multi-dimensional and integrated approach.  Marketing content will be built to be accessible through mobile devices, PCs and on TV while transaction services will be executed on multiple platforms including the internet, TV, through call centers, and on a full-service physical automotive sales mall in Hunan Province.  Services offered will include vehicle display, test driving, sale of autos and auto accessories, auto delivery, and license plate registration.  
The initial paid-in capital for the JV will be RMB100 million.  Autohome will inject RMB49 million into the JV accounting for a 49% shareholding while HappiGO will inject RMB51 million for a 51% shareholding.  
"This joint venture with Autohome will be a milestone in our effort to diversify into automobile sales in an innovative way," said Mr. Liang Tang, General Manager of HappiGo.  "Autohome is a leading auto vertical online platform with extensive networks and deep relations with the automakers and dealers all over China.  It also has very strong online coverage with the deepest user engagement in the industry and more than 18 million daily active users on the mobile and PC fronts.  We believe that the strengths of Autohome will provide great potential for our auto sales partnership, which will also then create value for our shareholders."
James Qin, CEO of Autohome stated, "Autohome is focused on providing superior products and services for automakers and dealers to help them drive more efficiencies.  Partnering with HappiGo can effectively provide auto consumers in Hunan Province with an advanced auto shopping experience.  The JV will also serve as an additional channel for automakers and dealers in the region to better showcase and promote their products."
Mr. Qin added, "There were several factors that prompted the formation of this JV.  HappiGo has desirable TV shopping capabilities with a premier sales channel in China.  With HappiGo's significant media influence across China, Autohome will be able to enjoy substantial marketing exposure from HappiGO/Hunan Broadcasting Systems.  We are looking forward to building a long-term partnership with HappiGo."  
The JV will focus on the sale of new automobiles in the near-term.  It will potentially expand the offering to value-added services such as car maintenance and insurance services as well as used cars sales in the future.

Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding.

Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

 Net Revenues Increased 23.3% Year-over-Year to RMB1.3 Billion Net Income Attributable to Autohome Inc. Increased 33.8% Year-over-Year to RMB327.4 Million BEIJING, May  10, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Autohome Inc. (NYSE:ATHM) (“Autohome” or the “Company”), the leading online destination for automobile consumers in China, today announced its unaudited financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017. First Quarter 2017 Financial Highlights1 Net Revenues increased 23.3% year-over-year to RMB1,348.4 million ($195.9 million). Net Income attributable to Autohome Inc. increased 33.8% year-over-year to RMB327.4 million ($47.6 million). Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities was RMB495.2 million ($71.9 million), an increase of 205.4% year-over-year. First Quarter 2017 Operational Highlights Continued Focus on Mobile Traffic: During the first quarter of 2017, the number of average daily unique visitors who accessed the Company’s mobile websites and mobile applications reached 10.1 million and 8.2 million, respectively. Combined, this represents a 23% increase in the total number of average daily unique visitors on mobile platforms compared with first quarter of 2016. Average time spent on the Company’s primary mobile application was 18 minutes per day during the first quarter of 2017. Successful Launch of Augmented Reality Showroom during March Auto Festival: The Company launched an Augmented Reality Automobile Showroom during its March Auto Festival which spanned from March 17 to 22, 2017 to enhance user engagement and interaction. Leveraging this successful launch, Autohome plans to further expand the use of augmented reality technology during its June Auto Festival by inviting more automakers to promote their products. Asset-Light Vehicle E-commerce Platform Business Model: The Company’s strategic change to become an asset-light vehicle e-commerce platform remains on track. Autohome sold 3,658 vehicles from its direct sales inventory during the first quarter of 2017. Mr. Yan Kang, President of Autohome, stated, “We started off the year strongly with better-than-expected financial and operational results. Revenue growth from our core media and leads generation services increased 27.8% year-over-year, primarily driven by solid growth in mobile traffic and our continued gain in market share for online advertising spending, which demonstrates Autohome’s leading market position and brand recognition among consumers as well as our unrivaled advantage in leads generation. While our progress so far is very encouraging, we still have a lot of work ahead of us, particularly when it comes to growing our community, efficiently connecting consumers throughout the automobile ownership cycle,  facilitating transactions, strengthening our core competitive position, and expanding the scale of our automotive ecosystem using big data analysis and technology.” Mr. Julian Wang, Chief Financial Officer, added, “We delivered an excellent quarter as we continued to gain top-line growth momentum which surpassed our original guidance. We also saw a solid improvement in our profitability despite the effects of seasonality. This reflects the success of our strategy to remain at the forefront of the industry in terms of user engagement, technology advancement, brand recognition, and commitment to our partners. Looking towards the rest of 2017, we are committed to further driving the growth and profitability of our core media platform and leads generation business, as well as further developing our value-enabling transactions and services. We will continue to enhance our value propositions to consumers, automakers and dealer clients in order to further strengthen the foundation of our business.” Overview of Key Financial Results for First Quarter 2017  Key Financial Results (In RMB Millions except for per share data)1Q20161Q2017% Change    Net Revenues1,093.51,348.423.3%     Net Income attributable to Autohome Inc.244.7327.433.8%     Adjusted Net Income attributable to Autohome Inc.2294.4367.224.7%     Diluted Earnings Per Share32.112.8032.7%     Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities162.2495.2205.4% Unaudited First Quarter 2017 Financial Results Net Revenues Net revenues increased 23.3% to RMB1,348.4 million ($195.9 million) from RMB1,093.5 million in the corresponding period of 2016. The increase was mainly due to a 27.8% increase in revenues from media and leads generation services.                                                    Media services revenues increased 17.2% to RMB518.1 million ($75.3 million) from RMB442.1 million in the corresponding period of 2016. The increase was mainly due to an increase in average revenue per automaker advertiser as automakers continue to allocate a greater portion of their advertising budgets to the Company’s online advertising and marketing channels. Leads generation services revenues increased 40.1% to RMB538.0 million ($78.2 million) from RMB384.1 million in the corresponding period of 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to a 26.0% year-over-year increase in average revenue per paying dealer as dealers continue to allocate a greater portion of their budgets to the Company's services. .  Online marketplace revenues were RMB292.3 million ($42.5 million) compared to RMB267.3 million in the corresponding period of 2016. In the first quarter of 2017, the Company sold 3,658 vehicles and generated RMB275.1 million ($40.0 million) in direct vehicle sales revenues, which accounted for 94.1% of online marketplace revenues. This is in line with the Company’s strategy to de-emphasize direct vehicle sales and focus more on transaction facilitation.         Cost of Revenues Cost of revenues increased 16.0% to RMB444.6 million ($64.6 million) from RMB383.4 million in the corresponding period of 2016, primarily due to an increase in cost of goods sold related to direct vehicle sales and an increase in valued-added tax and surcharges along with the increase in revenue. In addition, cost of revenues included share-based compensation expenses of RMB4.1 million ($0.6 million) during the first quarter of 2017, compared to RMB2.0 million for the corresponding period of 2016. Operating Expenses Operating expenses increased 7.7% to RMB556.4 million ($80.8 million) from RMB516.6 million in the corresponding period of 2016. This increase was mainly due to increases in product development expenses as the Company continues to reinvest in future growth opportunities. Sales and marketing expenses decreased 6.9% to RMB306.3 million ($44.5 million) from RMB329.1 million in the corresponding period of 2016. This decrease was primarily due to decreased investment in certain online marketing channels and decreased offline execution and promotional expenses related to the new vehicle transaction business. Sales and marketing expenses for the first quarter of 2017 included share-based compensation expenses of RMB10.7 million ($1.6 million), compared with RMB11.1 million in the corresponding period of 2016. General and administrative expenses decreased 16.2% to RMB60.4 million ($8.8 million) from RMB72.0 million in the corresponding period of 2016. The decrease was primarily attributable to decreases in general expenses for corporate functions. General and administrative expenses for the first quarter of 2017 included share-based compensation expenses of RMB9.3 million ($1.4 million), compared with RMB24.8 million in the corresponding period of 2016.  Product development expenses increased 64.3% to RMB189.7 million ($27.6 million) from RMB115.5 million in the corresponding period of 2016. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in salaries and benefits associated with growth in product development headcount, which is in line with the Company's strategy of strengthening its technology and big data analysis capabilities. Product development expenses for the first quarter of 2017 included share-based compensation expenses of RMB14.5 million ($2.1 million), compared with RMB10.8 million in the corresponding period of 2016. Operating Profit Operating profit increased 79.6% to RMB347.3 million ($50.5 million) from RMB193.4 million in the corresponding period of 2016. Income tax (expense)/benefit There was an income tax expense of RMB68.8 million ($10.0 million) in the first quarter of 2017, compared to income tax benefit of RMB33.1 million in the corresponding period of 2016. The income tax benefit in the first quarter of 2016 was derived from change in the enacted tax rate of one of Autohome’s subsidiaries which resulted in tax benefit of RMB69.4 million being recorded in the first quarter of 2016. Net Income attributable to Autohome Inc. and EPS  Net income attributable to Autohome Inc. increased 33.8% to RMB327.4 million ($47.6 million) from RMB244.7 million in the corresponding period of 2016. Basic and diluted earnings per share and per ADS (“EPS”) were RMB2.83 ($0.41) and RMB2.80 ($0.41), respectively, compared with basic and diluted EPS in the corresponding period of 2016 of RMB2.16 and RMB2.11, respectively. Adjusted Net Income attributable to Autohome Inc. and Non-GAAP EPS Adjusted net income attributable to Autohome Inc., defined as net income attributable to Autohome Inc. excluding share-based compensation expenses and amortization expenses of intangible assets related to acquisitions, increased 24.7% to RMB367.2 million ($53.3 million) from RMB294.4 million in the corresponding period of 2016. Non-GAAP basic and diluted EPS were RMB3.18 ($0.46) and RMB3.13 ($0.45), respectively, compared with non-GAAP basic and diluted EPS in the corresponding period of 2016 of RMB2.60 and RMB2.54, respectively. Balance Sheet and Cash Flow As of March 31, 2017, the Company had cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of RMB6,189.9 million ($899.3 million) . Net cash provided by operating activities in the first quarter of 2017 was RMB495.2 million ($71.9 million), a substantial increase compared with RMB162.2 million in the corresponding period of 2016, primarily attributable to the positive cash flow from direct vehicle sales model associated with inventory clearance and part of the Company’s shift in focus towards an asset-light automobile e-commerce platform. Employees  The Company had 3,745 employees as of March 31, 2017. Business Outlook  Autohome currently expects to generate net revenues in the range of RMB1,405 million ($204.1 million) to RMB1,437 million ($208.8 million) in the second quarter of fiscal year 2017, representing a 1.9% to 4.3% year-over-year increase.  This quarter also marks the end of our buyout clean-up effort.              This forecast reflects the Company's current and preliminary view on the market and operating conditions, which are subject to change.

We define Adjusted Net Income attributable to Autohome Inc. as net income attributable to Autohome Inc. excluding share-based compensation expenses and amortization expenses of intangible assets related to acquisitions. We define Non-GAAP basic and diluted EPS as Adjusted Net Income attributable to Autohome Inc. divided by the basic and diluted weighted average number of ordinary shares. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income attributable to Autohome Inc. before income tax expense/(benefit), depreciation expenses of property and equipment and amortization expenses of intangible assets and share-based compensation expenses. We present these non-GAAP financial measures because they are used by our management to evaluate our operating performance, in addition to net income prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are important to help investors understand our operating and financial performance, compare business trends among different reporting periods on a consistent basis and assess our core operating results, as they exclude certain expenses that are not expected to result in cash payments. The use of the above non-GAAP financial measures has certain limitations. Share-based compensation expenses have been and will continue to be incurred in the future and are not reflected in the presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures, but should be considered in the overall evaluation of our results. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.
