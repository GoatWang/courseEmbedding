Company history[edit]
1855–1950[edit]
Henri Merle et Compagnie was founded in 1855, in France. It originally produced caustic soda from coal, salt, pyrites and limestone, but also began producing aluminium metal in 1860.[8] The Northern Aluminium Company, Ltd, was founded in Canada in 1902, as a Canadian subsidiary of the Pittsburgh Reduction Company, later called Alcoa. In 1925 it was renamed Aluminium Company of Canada in 1925, and separated from Alcoa in 1928, becoming Aluminium of Canada Ltd, or Alcan.[9]
1950–2003[edit]
Henri Merle et Compagnie was renamed Pechiney in 1950, growing to become one of the world's leading aluminium manufacturers. In 2000, Pechiney announced that it had agreed to join in a merger with Canada's Alcan and Switzerland's Algroup to form a new globally operating aluminium producer, which, with sales worth nearly $30 billion, became a player in the industry, ahead of American company Alcoa.[10]
However, the merger bumped up against European Commission demands that Alcan sell its interests in a German aluminium producer, Alunorf. Alcan refused to sell, and Pechiney was forced to withdraw from the merger. Alcan and Algroup merged that year, becoming Alcan Inc.[11][12]
2003–2007[edit]
Pechiney became the wholly owned subsidiary of Alcan in 2003, after it was purchased in a deal worth $4.52 billion.[13] Alcan spun off the majority of pre-Pechiney rolling activities to create an independent company—Novelis Inc.[14]
2007–2011[edit]
The original Rio Tinto company was established in Spain in 1873, and became a worldwide copper producer by the end of the 1880s.[15] Today, the Rio Tinto Group is a British-Australian, multinational mining and resources group.
2013[edit]
Since May 2013, Constellium is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and NYSE Euronext market.[16]
2014[edit]
On October, Constellium announced the acquisition of Wise Metals, a private aluminium sheet producer located in Muscle Shoals, Alabama (U.S.A.).[17] The transaction diversified Constellium’s global footprint and offerings by increasing the company’s exposure to the North American market. Wise’s growing can sheet business in the U.S. will supplement Constellium’s leading position in Europe and provide stability through long-term contracts with global beverage can customers.[18]
Activities[edit]
Aerospace and Transportation[edit]
Constellium's Aerospace and Transportation business unit has around 3,800 employees working at 7 sites in Europe and America. The company deliver aircraft parts and components for the commercial aircraft, military and space sectors. It offers a low density alloy for lighter aircraft named AIRWARE®. This solution is a technology inspiring heightened interest among aerospace companies in using new aluminium solutions rather than composites for high-tech structures in the next generation of aircraft.[19]
Packaging and Automotive Rolled Products[edit]
Constellium designs and produces aluminium products including packaging, automotive, industrial coil and sheet. The unit has four plants and employs over 4,200 people.
Automotive Structures and Industry[edit]
Constellium provides structures for European and North American car manufacturers, and emerging markets in the global automotive sector, from six sites in Germany, the U.S. and China. In parallel, Constellium also supplies diverse customized extrusions, including soft and hard alloys and large profiles, through ten sites in Europe. The unit employs over 2,200 people.
Constellium and recycling[edit]
Recycling has become very important in the aluminium industry, and 75% of all aluminium produced since 1888 is still in use today. As part of its recycling programme, Constellium is a partner in the EU PAMELA project, where it helped recycle the aluminium parts of a 35-year-old twin-aisle Airbus A300 airplane. 77% of the weight of the plane was aluminium, which is fully recyclable and does not lose its properties when recycled.[20][21]
Constellium is a founding member of Aluminium Stewardship Initiatives (ASI) to promote responsible practices across the aluminium value chain.[22] It also joined in 2013 the UN Global Compact.[23]
Constellium worldwide[edit]
Constellium operates 25 production facilities throughout Europe, China and North and Central America.[24] It employs approximately 11,000 people.[25]
Constellium has six main sites that supply its Aerospace and Transportation, Packaging and Automotive Rolled Products, and Automotive Structures and Industry divisions.
In Germany, Constellium's Singen site has cold mills, an integrated hot/cold rolling line and one of the largest extrusion presses in the world.
In France, Constellium has eight sites among which Neuf-Brisach and Issoire. Neuf-Brisach houses a rolling mill, an automotive finishing line and a recycling center. Issoire has one of the world's two leading aerospace plate mills and large-volume recycling, and inaugurated its Airware® casthouse on March 26, 2013.[26]
The Sierre site in Switzerland has a dedicated precision plate shop for general engineering products. In the USA (Ravenswood), Constellium has an aerospace plate shop with stretcher and wide-coil capabilities.[27]

Constellium is a global producer of aluminium semi-products with headquarters in Amsterdam, Netherlands. It was created when Rio Tinto sold off Alcan Engineered Products to Apollo Management (51%) and FSI (10%) in 2011.[3][4] Alcan Engineered Products was the result of various mergers and acquisitions between Pechiney, Alcan and Alusuisse. Constellium is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and Euronext Paris since May 2013.[5]
It has a board of ten directors and maintain a one-tier board of directors consisting of both executive directors and non-executive directors (each a “director”). Under Dutch law, the board of directors is responsible for the policy and day-to-day management. The non-executive directors supervise and provide guidance to the executive directors.[6]
Constellium manufactures aluminium rolled products and extruded products based on a large variety of advanced alloys. It has customers in different industries, including mainly aerospace, automotive and packaging sectors.
Constellium reported €4.7 billion in revenues in 2016.[7]

Company history[edit]
1855–1950[edit]
Henri Merle et Compagnie was founded in 1855, in France. It originally produced caustic soda from coal, salt, pyrites and limestone, but also began producing aluminium metal in 1860.[8] The Northern Aluminium Company, Ltd, was founded in Canada in 1902, as a Canadian subsidiary of the Pittsburgh Reduction Company, later called Alcoa. In 1925 it was renamed Aluminium Company of Canada in 1925, and separated from Alcoa in 1928, becoming Aluminium of Canada Ltd, or Alcan.[9]
1950–2003[edit]
Henri Merle et Compagnie was renamed Pechiney in 1950, growing to become one of the world's leading aluminium manufacturers. In 2000, Pechiney announced that it had agreed to join in a merger with Canada's Alcan and Switzerland's Algroup to form a new globally operating aluminium producer, which, with sales worth nearly $30 billion, became a player in the industry, ahead of American company Alcoa.[10]
However, the merger bumped up against European Commission demands that Alcan sell its interests in a German aluminium producer, Alunorf. Alcan refused to sell, and Pechiney was forced to withdraw from the merger. Alcan and Algroup merged that year, becoming Alcan Inc.[11][12]
2003–2007[edit]
Pechiney became the wholly owned subsidiary of Alcan in 2003, after it was purchased in a deal worth $4.52 billion.[13] Alcan spun off the majority of pre-Pechiney rolling activities to create an independent company—Novelis Inc.[14]
2007–2011[edit]
The original Rio Tinto company was established in Spain in 1873, and became a worldwide copper producer by the end of the 1880s.[15] Today, the Rio Tinto Group is a British-Australian, multinational mining and resources group.
2013[edit]
Since May 2013, Constellium is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and NYSE Euronext market.[16]
2014[edit]
On October, Constellium announced the acquisition of Wise Metals, a private aluminium sheet producer located in Muscle Shoals, Alabama (U.S.A.).[17] The transaction diversified Constellium’s global footprint and offerings by increasing the company’s exposure to the North American market. Wise’s growing can sheet business in the U.S. will supplement Constellium’s leading position in Europe and provide stability through long-term contracts with global beverage can customers.[18]
Activities[edit]
Aerospace and Transportation[edit]
Constellium's Aerospace and Transportation business unit has around 3,800 employees working at 7 sites in Europe and America. The company deliver aircraft parts and components for the commercial aircraft, military and space sectors. It offers a low density alloy for lighter aircraft named AIRWARE®. This solution is a technology inspiring heightened interest among aerospace companies in using new aluminium solutions rather than composites for high-tech structures in the next generation of aircraft.[19]
Packaging and Automotive Rolled Products[edit]
Constellium designs and produces aluminium products including packaging, automotive, industrial coil and sheet. The unit has four plants and employs over 4,200 people.
Automotive Structures and Industry[edit]
Constellium provides structures for European and North American car manufacturers, and emerging markets in the global automotive sector, from six sites in Germany, the U.S. and China. In parallel, Constellium also supplies diverse customized extrusions, including soft and hard alloys and large profiles, through ten sites in Europe. The unit employs over 2,200 people.
Constellium and recycling[edit]
Recycling has become very important in the aluminium industry, and 75% of all aluminium produced since 1888 is still in use today. As part of its recycling programme, Constellium is a partner in the EU PAMELA project, where it helped recycle the aluminium parts of a 35-year-old twin-aisle Airbus A300 airplane. 77% of the weight of the plane was aluminium, which is fully recyclable and does not lose its properties when recycled.[20][21]
Constellium is a founding member of Aluminium Stewardship Initiatives (ASI) to promote responsible practices across the aluminium value chain.[22] It also joined in 2013 the UN Global Compact.[23]
Constellium worldwide[edit]
Constellium operates 25 production facilities throughout Europe, China and North and Central America.[24] It employs approximately 11,000 people.[25]
Constellium has six main sites that supply its Aerospace and Transportation, Packaging and Automotive Rolled Products, and Automotive Structures and Industry divisions.
In Germany, Constellium's Singen site has cold mills, an integrated hot/cold rolling line and one of the largest extrusion presses in the world.
In France, Constellium has eight sites among which Neuf-Brisach and Issoire. Neuf-Brisach houses a rolling mill, an automotive finishing line and a recycling center. Issoire has one of the world's two leading aerospace plate mills and large-volume recycling, and inaugurated its Airware® casthouse on March 26, 2013.[26]
The Sierre site in Switzerland has a dedicated precision plate shop for general engineering products. In the USA (Ravenswood), Constellium has an aerospace plate shop with stretcher and wide-coil capabilities.[27]

Company history[edit]
1855–1950[edit]
Henri Merle et Compagnie was founded in 1855, in France. It originally produced caustic soda from coal, salt, pyrites and limestone, but also began producing aluminium metal in 1860.[8] The Northern Aluminium Company, Ltd, was founded in Canada in 1902, as a Canadian subsidiary of the Pittsburgh Reduction Company, later called Alcoa. In 1925 it was renamed Aluminium Company of Canada in 1925, and separated from Alcoa in 1928, becoming Aluminium of Canada Ltd, or Alcan.[9]
1950–2003[edit]
Henri Merle et Compagnie was renamed Pechiney in 1950, growing to become one of the world's leading aluminium manufacturers. In 2000, Pechiney announced that it had agreed to join in a merger with Canada's Alcan and Switzerland's Algroup to form a new globally operating aluminium producer, which, with sales worth nearly $30 billion, became a player in the industry, ahead of American company Alcoa.[10]
However, the merger bumped up against European Commission demands that Alcan sell its interests in a German aluminium producer, Alunorf. Alcan refused to sell, and Pechiney was forced to withdraw from the merger. Alcan and Algroup merged that year, becoming Alcan Inc.[11][12]
2003–2007[edit]
Pechiney became the wholly owned subsidiary of Alcan in 2003, after it was purchased in a deal worth $4.52 billion.[13] Alcan spun off the majority of pre-Pechiney rolling activities to create an independent company—Novelis Inc.[14]
2007–2011[edit]
The original Rio Tinto company was established in Spain in 1873, and became a worldwide copper producer by the end of the 1880s.[15] Today, the Rio Tinto Group is a British-Australian, multinational mining and resources group.
2013[edit]
Since May 2013, Constellium is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and NYSE Euronext market.[16]
2014[edit]
On October, Constellium announced the acquisition of Wise Metals, a private aluminium sheet producer located in Muscle Shoals, Alabama (U.S.A.).[17] The transaction diversified Constellium’s global footprint and offerings by increasing the company’s exposure to the North American market. Wise’s growing can sheet business in the U.S. will supplement Constellium’s leading position in Europe and provide stability through long-term contracts with global beverage can customers.[18]
Activities[edit]
Aerospace and Transportation[edit]
Constellium's Aerospace and Transportation business unit has around 3,800 employees working at 7 sites in Europe and America. The company deliver aircraft parts and components for the commercial aircraft, military and space sectors. It offers a low density alloy for lighter aircraft named AIRWARE®. This solution is a technology inspiring heightened interest among aerospace companies in using new aluminium solutions rather than composites for high-tech structures in the next generation of aircraft.[19]
Packaging and Automotive Rolled Products[edit]
Constellium designs and produces aluminium products including packaging, automotive, industrial coil and sheet. The unit has four plants and employs over 4,200 people.
Automotive Structures and Industry[edit]
Constellium provides structures for European and North American car manufacturers, and emerging markets in the global automotive sector, from six sites in Germany, the U.S. and China. In parallel, Constellium also supplies diverse customized extrusions, including soft and hard alloys and large profiles, through ten sites in Europe. The unit employs over 2,200 people.
Constellium and recycling[edit]
Recycling has become very important in the aluminium industry, and 75% of all aluminium produced since 1888 is still in use today. As part of its recycling programme, Constellium is a partner in the EU PAMELA project, where it helped recycle the aluminium parts of a 35-year-old twin-aisle Airbus A300 airplane. 77% of the weight of the plane was aluminium, which is fully recyclable and does not lose its properties when recycled.[20][21]
Constellium is a founding member of Aluminium Stewardship Initiatives (ASI) to promote responsible practices across the aluminium value chain.[22] It also joined in 2013 the UN Global Compact.[23]
Constellium worldwide[edit]
Constellium operates 25 production facilities throughout Europe, China and North and Central America.[24] It employs approximately 11,000 people.[25]
Constellium has six main sites that supply its Aerospace and Transportation, Packaging and Automotive Rolled Products, and Automotive Structures and Industry divisions.
In Germany, Constellium's Singen site has cold mills, an integrated hot/cold rolling line and one of the largest extrusion presses in the world.
In France, Constellium has eight sites among which Neuf-Brisach and Issoire. Neuf-Brisach houses a rolling mill, an automotive finishing line and a recycling center. Issoire has one of the world's two leading aerospace plate mills and large-volume recycling, and inaugurated its Airware® casthouse on March 26, 2013.[26]
The Sierre site in Switzerland has a dedicated precision plate shop for general engineering products. In the USA (Ravenswood), Constellium has an aerospace plate shop with stretcher and wide-coil capabilities.[27]

As part of its recycling programme, Constellium is a partner in the EU PAMELA project, where it helped recycle the aluminium parts of a 35-year-old twin-aisle Airbus A300 airplane. 77% of the weight of the plane was aluminium, which is fully recyclable and does not lose its properties when recycled.[20][21]
Constellium is a founding member of Aluminium Stewardship Initiatives (ASI) to promote responsible practices across the aluminium value chain.[22] It also joined in 2013 the UN Global Compact.[23]
Constellium worldwide[edit]
Constellium operates 25 production facilities throughout Europe, China and North and Central America.[24] It employs approximately 11,000 people.[25]
Constellium has six main sites that supply its Aerospace and Transportation, Packaging and Automotive Rolled Products, and Automotive Structures and Industry divisions.
In Germany, Constellium's Singen site has cold mills, an integrated hot/cold rolling line and one of the largest extrusion presses in the world.
In France, Constellium has eight sites among which Neuf-Brisach and Issoire. Neuf-Brisach houses a rolling mill, an automotive finishing line and a recycling center. Issoire has one of the world's two leading aerospace plate mills and large-volume recycling, and inaugurated its Airware® casthouse on March 26, 2013.[26]
The Sierre site in Switzerland has a dedicated precision plate shop for general engineering products. In the USA (Ravenswood), Constellium has an aerospace plate shop with stretcher and wide-coil capabilities.[27]

It has a board of ten directors and maintain a one-tier board of directors consisting of both executive directors and non-executive directors (each a “director”). Under Dutch law, the board of directors is responsible for the policy and day-to-day management. The non-executive directors supervise and provide guidance to the executive directors.[6]

Company history[edit]
1855–1950[edit]
Henri Merle et Compagnie was founded in 1855, in France. It originally produced caustic soda from coal, salt, pyrites and limestone, but also began producing aluminium metal in 1860.[8] The Northern Aluminium Company, Ltd, was founded in Canada in 1902, as a Canadian subsidiary of the Pittsburgh Reduction Company, later called Alcoa. In 1925 it was renamed Aluminium Company of Canada in 1925, and separated from Alcoa in 1928, becoming Aluminium of Canada Ltd, or Alcan.[9]
1950–2003[edit]
Henri Merle et Compagnie was renamed Pechiney in 1950, growing to become one of the world's leading aluminium manufacturers. In 2000, Pechiney announced that it had agreed to join in a merger with Canada's Alcan and Switzerland's Algroup to form a new globally operating aluminium producer, which, with sales worth nearly $30 billion, became a player in the industry, ahead of American company Alcoa.[10]
However, the merger bumped up against European Commission demands that Alcan sell its interests in a German aluminium producer, Alunorf. Alcan refused to sell, and Pechiney was forced to withdraw from the merger. Alcan and Algroup merged that year, becoming Alcan Inc.[11][12]
2003–2007[edit]
Pechiney became the wholly owned subsidiary of Alcan in 2003, after it was purchased in a deal worth $4.52 billion.[13] Alcan spun off the majority of pre-Pechiney rolling activities to create an independent company—Novelis Inc.[14]
2007–2011[edit]
The original Rio Tinto company was established in Spain in 1873, and became a worldwide copper producer by the end of the 1880s.[15] Today, the Rio Tinto Group is a British-Australian, multinational mining and resources group.
2013[edit]
Since May 2013, Constellium is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and NYSE Euronext market.[16]
2014[edit]
On October, Constellium announced the acquisition of Wise Metals, a private aluminium sheet producer located in Muscle Shoals, Alabama (U.S.A.).[17] The transaction diversified Constellium’s global footprint and offerings by increasing the company’s exposure to the North American market. Wise’s growing can sheet business in the U.S. will supplement Constellium’s leading position in Europe and provide stability through long-term contracts with global beverage can customers.[18]
Activities[edit]
Aerospace and Transportation[edit]
Constellium's Aerospace and Transportation business unit has around 3,800 employees working at 7 sites in Europe and America. The company deliver aircraft parts and components for the commercial aircraft, military and space sectors. It offers a low density alloy for lighter aircraft named AIRWARE®. This solution is a technology inspiring heightened interest among aerospace companies in using new aluminium solutions rather than composites for high-tech structures in the next generation of aircraft.[19]
Packaging and Automotive Rolled Products[edit]
Constellium designs and produces aluminium products including packaging, automotive, industrial coil and sheet. The unit has four plants and employs over 4,200 people.
Automotive Structures and Industry[edit]
Constellium provides structures for European and North American car manufacturers, and emerging markets in the global automotive sector, from six sites in Germany, the U.S. and China. In parallel, Constellium also supplies diverse customized extrusions, including soft and hard alloys and large profiles, through ten sites in Europe. The unit employs over 2,200 people.
Constellium and recycling[edit]
Recycling has become very important in the aluminium industry, and 75% of all aluminium produced since 1888 is still in use today. As part of its recycling programme, Constellium is a partner in the EU PAMELA project, where it helped recycle the aluminium parts of a 35-year-old twin-aisle Airbus A300 airplane. 77% of the weight of the plane was aluminium, which is fully recyclable and does not lose its properties when recycled.[20][21]
Constellium is a founding member of Aluminium Stewardship Initiatives (ASI) to promote responsible practices across the aluminium value chain.[22] It also joined in 2013 the UN Global Compact.[23]
Constellium worldwide[edit]
Constellium operates 25 production facilities throughout Europe, China and North and Central America.[24] It employs approximately 11,000 people.[25]
Constellium has six main sites that supply its Aerospace and Transportation, Packaging and Automotive Rolled Products, and Automotive Structures and Industry divisions.
In Germany, Constellium's Singen site has cold mills, an integrated hot/cold rolling line and one of the largest extrusion presses in the world.
In France, Constellium has eight sites among which Neuf-Brisach and Issoire. Neuf-Brisach houses a rolling mill, an automotive finishing line and a recycling center. Issoire has one of the world's two leading aerospace plate mills and large-volume recycling, and inaugurated its Airware® casthouse on March 26, 2013.[26]
The Sierre site in Switzerland has a dedicated precision plate shop for general engineering products. In the USA (Ravenswood), Constellium has an aerospace plate shop with stretcher and wide-coil capabilities.[27]

FlashRatings - All research for my stocks!

The most comprehensive equity research coverage available online.


          Never miss a single piece of research, upgrade, downgrade or target price change by any analyst firm on any stock!
          
          Equity research by professional analysts - especially their rationales more than their forecasts - contains far more interesting and important information about the actual fundamentals of the traded companies than can be gathered from conventional news reports.
          
          Our mission is to unlock access to valuable research on stocks for all retail investors.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Constellium N.V. Supplies 10 Millionth Part to Ford Motor Company
Jul 13 17
Constellium N.V. announced that it has delivered its 10 millionth part to Ford Motor Company. A provider of aluminum structural components for the Ford F-150 and Super Duty trucks, Constellium will also supply the all-new Ford Expedition starting in Fall 2017. Constellium provides several aluminum parts for the Ford F-150 and Super Duty, including the windshield header, a complex component that reduces weight as well as the number of parts required in comparison with the steel version it replaced. In Fall 2017, Constellium will begin supplying the all-new aluminum-intensive Ford Expedition from its Van Buren plant as well. The facility was expanded in 2015 to double its production capacity to accommodate the Ford projects. The 2018 model year Expedition saves 300 pounds compared to the previous model.

Aluminium innovation success stories







Constellium has strong innovation capabilities and resources to satisfy the increasing demand for lightweight, energy-efficient products with reduced environmental impact.Dedicated to innovationConstellium’s approach to research and development resembles a multifaceted knowledge hub. We combine our own expertise and resources within leading research facilities with those of customers, universities, labs and other stakeholders.

 Technology Center: At our state-of-the-art Technology Center in Voreppe (France), our team of more than 170 specialists develops lightweight aluminium products, co-creates solutions with customers, and provides technological and analytical services. We also have an R&D team in Neuhausen (Switzerland).
 Technology networks: Our 11 technology networks bring together R&D experts and plant engineers to share best practices and knowledge that drives operational excellence in aluminium processing.
 Partnerships: We draw on our significant R&D resources and cross-pollination strategy with universities and research laboratories to provide customers with tailor-made solutions.

Results in the fieldWith 170 active patent families, Constellium has a proven track record in creating new products and processes to satisfy market needs. Our knowledge hub boasts significant results. Scores of new aluminium products and designs are now making a difference across diverse industries.
Aerospace, where innovation takes flight 










The introduction of C-TEC’s AIRWARE® family, in 20xx alloys, has been a game-changer in the aerospace sector. Having mastered the optimal balance of properties, significant gains can be achieved, be it on weight, build rate and in-service maintenance. Aerospace manufacturers, like Airbus, Bombardier and SpaceX, have quickly seized the potential of AIRWARE®.
C-TEC is now focused on taking AIRWARE® to the next level, with gradual improvements for derivative programs and radical innovations for next-generation aircraft.We are also heavily investigating in new manufacturing techniques. Our ultimate goal is to provide a complete solution that can be efficient in-flight and efficiently industrialized.
Automotive, helping drive the future 




 






C-TEC has developed world-class sheet alloys and process routes for outer skin, forming optimized closure inners and high strength structural and crash alloys. In addition to alloys, we provide complete solutions for the conversion from steel to aluminium. These include advanced enabling technologies for forming or joining.Future developments include closed-loop recycling in manufacturing and efficient recovery from end-of-life vehicles. Naturally high-end car manufacturers will not compromise on design freedom, safety or aesthetics. This means continued pressure to develop alloys with ever-better formability, higher strength and which absorb more energy.
Packaging, creating out-of-the box solutions 




 






For packaging, C-TEC has a particular focus on process improvements to optimize cans and closures that offer differentiation to both customer and consumer. For beverages, we adapted the traditional can stock alloy to the specific needs of the new aluminium bottle.In partnerships with manufacturers, we bring innovative aesthetic and functional attributes to aluminium closures. Recycling remains a strong trend. This is why we develop new sorting and recycling technologies to expand our end-of-life scrap sourcing.Constellium and standardizationConstellium is at the origin of many standards in the aluminium industry and has therefore been involved in a joint project with AFNOR (French standardization body) to develop the AluTool.The tool compiles European general and applications standards for the aluminium industry. The manual features basic information on aluminium standards, while the software provides access to a fuller range of information on the various alloy families and their applications, chemical composition and mechanical characteristics.Key-factInnovation at Constellium is bolstered by more than 170 R&D specialists and 11 technology networks, as well as longstanding cooperation with external scientific networks and other stakeholders.

The Exchange Traded Funds prospectus contains its investment objectives, risks, charges, expenses and other important information you should read and consider carefully prior to making an investment decision.
        Please review the current prospectus, available from the Prospectus link on www.motifinvesting.com, by phone at 1-855-586-6843, or in writing at Motif Investing, Inc., P.O. Box 3548, Rancho Cordova, CA  95741.
ETFs have unique features that you should be aware of, which can include distribution of any gains, risks related to securities within the portfolio, and tax consequences. The data quoted herein represents past performance and is not indicative of future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that your investment, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original value. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data provided.  Please review the prospectus or other research tools provided on this site for more recent information. Contact Motif Investing at 1-855-586-6843 to obtain the most recent month-end performance data.
The 30-Day SEC Yield reflects the dividends and interest earned during the past 30 days after the deduction of the ETF’s expenses.  The 30-day SEC Yield is an annual percentage rate based on the ETF's share price and is calculated by dividing the net investment income per share for the 30 days ended on the date of calculation by that day’s maximum share price.  The Distribution Yield is the trailing 12-Month End Yield derived by adding the trailing 12-month's income distributions and dividing the total by the last month's ending share price. Income refers to interest payments from fixed-income ETFs and dividend payments from stock-based ETFs.
The ETF prospectus is provided by DFS (http://www.rrdonnelley.com/financial-services/). The use of this prospectus is restricted solely to the website of Motif Investing and may not be redistributed, copied or otherwise made available without the express written consent of DFS.

Fixed income investments are subject to various unique risks, including changes in credit quality, market valuations, liquidity, prepayments, early redemption,
    corporate events, tax ramifications, and other factors. Fixed income securities are subject to increased loss of principal during periods of rising interest rates.


The 1-Year Return/Return Since Inception indicates the performance of this particular motif over the last 12 months or, if the motif was created within the past 12 months, since the date the motif was created. See how we calculate returns.


The Motif Index level represents the performance of a benchmark motif (a motif in our catalog) over time. It is set at 
1000 on the date of inception of the motif. For example, a Motif Index of 1100 represents a 10% return since inception. Similarly, the change in the Index over a 
specified period represents the period return on the portfolio holding the same share weights as the benchmark motif.
The Motif Index is a measure created and maintained by the firm, which has the discretion to change the holdings that comprise the index and to make alterations to a particular Motif Index.


Popularity shows you how much interest a motif is attracting, compared to other motifs. We base this score on a proprietary formula that uses factors like how many people are viewing the motif, and how much conversation about it is happening in the community, in a range from Low-to-High.
The Volatility measurement for a Motif represents the annualized standard deviation of daily returns on a portfolio holding the same share weights as the Motif, and is measured in a range from Low to High. Since the standard deviation of returns are commonly used as a measure of portfolio risk, a Volatility measurement that is High is indicative of the fact that holding the motif in the past subjected the holder to larger fluctuations or higher risk.
The Valuation metric represents the present valuation of the stocks in the motif relative to the broader equity market. The Valuation metric is calculated as the composite Price-to-Earnings ratio for the stocks in the motif weighted by their respective share weights in a range from Low to High.


Standard pricing: $9.95 total commission per motif transaction. Other fees may apply. For details on fees and commissions, please

        Performance returns, including 1-month Return/Return Since Inception/1-year returns indicates the performance of this particular motif over that stated period of time as of the date provided.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Aluminium innovation success stories







Constellium has strong innovation capabilities and resources to satisfy the increasing demand for lightweight, energy-efficient products with reduced environmental impact.Dedicated to innovationConstellium’s approach to research and development resembles a multifaceted knowledge hub. We combine our own expertise and resources within leading research facilities with those of customers, universities, labs and other stakeholders.

 Technology Center: At our state-of-the-art Technology Center in Voreppe (France), our team of more than 170 specialists develops lightweight aluminium products, co-creates solutions with customers, and provides technological and analytical services. We also have an R&D team in Neuhausen (Switzerland).
 Technology networks: Our 11 technology networks bring together R&D experts and plant engineers to share best practices and knowledge that drives operational excellence in aluminium processing.
 Partnerships: We draw on our significant R&D resources and cross-pollination strategy with universities and research laboratories to provide customers with tailor-made solutions.

Results in the fieldWith 170 active patent families, Constellium has a proven track record in creating new products and processes to satisfy market needs. Our knowledge hub boasts significant results. Scores of new aluminium products and designs are now making a difference across diverse industries.
Aerospace, where innovation takes flight 










The introduction of C-TEC’s AIRWARE® family, in 20xx alloys, has been a game-changer in the aerospace sector. Having mastered the optimal balance of properties, significant gains can be achieved, be it on weight, build rate and in-service maintenance. Aerospace manufacturers, like Airbus, Bombardier and SpaceX, have quickly seized the potential of AIRWARE®.
C-TEC is now focused on taking AIRWARE® to the next level, with gradual improvements for derivative programs and radical innovations for next-generation aircraft.We are also heavily investigating in new manufacturing techniques. Our ultimate goal is to provide a complete solution that can be efficient in-flight and efficiently industrialized.
Automotive, helping drive the future 




 






C-TEC has developed world-class sheet alloys and process routes for outer skin, forming optimized closure inners and high strength structural and crash alloys. In addition to alloys, we provide complete solutions for the conversion from steel to aluminium. These include advanced enabling technologies for forming or joining.Future developments include closed-loop recycling in manufacturing and efficient recovery from end-of-life vehicles. Naturally high-end car manufacturers will not compromise on design freedom, safety or aesthetics. This means continued pressure to develop alloys with ever-better formability, higher strength and which absorb more energy.
Packaging, creating out-of-the box solutions 




 






For packaging, C-TEC has a particular focus on process improvements to optimize cans and closures that offer differentiation to both customer and consumer. For beverages, we adapted the traditional can stock alloy to the specific needs of the new aluminium bottle.In partnerships with manufacturers, we bring innovative aesthetic and functional attributes to aluminium closures. Recycling remains a strong trend. This is why we develop new sorting and recycling technologies to expand our end-of-life scrap sourcing.Constellium and standardizationConstellium is at the origin of many standards in the aluminium industry and has therefore been involved in a joint project with AFNOR (French standardization body) to develop the AluTool.The tool compiles European general and applications standards for the aluminium industry. The manual features basic information on aluminium standards, while the software provides access to a fuller range of information on the various alloy families and their applications, chemical composition and mechanical characteristics.Key-factInnovation at Constellium is bolstered by more than 170 R&D specialists and 11 technology networks, as well as longstanding cooperation with external scientific networks and other stakeholders.
