Smitty has a wide range of experience in business law and focuses his practice on logistics litigation and insurance coverage. He represents businesses and individuals in matters ranging from physician recruiting agreements to covenants not to compete. From breach of contract to chemical plant explosions, he has litigated complex cases from Georgia to California.
A member of the Savannah Bar, the Georgia Bar, and the Southern, Middle, and Northern Districts of Georgia, Smitty has served as a board member of the Atlanta Council of Younger Lawyers and as president of the Young Lawyers Division of the Savannah Bar. He currently serves on the State Bar of Georgia’s Unlicensed Practice of Law Committee for District 1. Smitty is the recipient of Awards of Achievement from both the American Bar Association and Georgia Bar Association’s Young Lawyers Divisions. Admitted to practice since 1999, he has argued cases in State, Superior, and Federal District Court and in front of the Georgia Court of Appeals and the Georgia Supreme Court. Smitty has served as an expert witness in the area of complex litigation attorney’s fees and is a registered mediator.
Smitty has tried numerous cases to a jury verdict and was nominated to American Board of Trial Advocates (ABOTA) in 2012. He is listed in The Best Lawyers in America and has been named one of Georgia Trend’s Legal Elite as well as a top attorney by Savannah Magazine. He is a graduate of both Leadership Savannah and the State Bar of Georgia’s Leadership Academy.
Active in the community, Smitty has served on the board of the Boys & Girls Club, the Next Generation Advisory Board of Memorial Hospital, and as vice president of the Live Oak Public Libraries Foundation. He has taught for Junior Achievement and coached high school teams in the Georgia Mock Trial Tournament. In the past, he has been an active member of the William Jay Society and the Thirteenth Colony Society. A volunteer lawyer for military families as part of Project Lamplighter, Smitty worked with the youth group at Christ the King Cathedral. He also served on the Friends Committee of Scottish Rite Children’s Hospital and volunteered as a resume writer and job coach at Atlanta’s Union Mission.
A native of Annapolis, Maryland, Smitty played football and lacrosse while serving as the president of Kappa Sigma Fraternity at the College of William and Mary in Virginia. In law school at the University of Georgia, he served on the editorial board for the Journal of International and Comparative Law and was a member of the American Trial Lawyers Association National Mock Trial Team.
