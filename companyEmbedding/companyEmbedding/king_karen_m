YoungNurse PractitionerRatings for Karen King 1Staff 1Punctuality 1Helpfulness 1KnowledgeMost unpleasant experience of my life. And I have had some real unpleasant experiances. Don't trust this woman with any of your needs. HORRIBLE!!!
Was this rating useful? 1 flag | Submitted June 3, 2015 1Staff 1Punctuality 1Helpfulness 1KnowledgeBEWARE!!!NEVER go to family practice and urgent care in Maricopa across from dignity health! Karen Kings office. I have been waiting since 4/21 for them to get medical records so I could schedule an appointment and get a new PCP. As of today they still haven't sent over any of the requests to get the medical records and when I went into the office to confront them about it, the office manager said they had to fire someone, they were short staffed and the fax didn't work for 2 weeks, and then a nurse came forward and said Karen king has decided your case is too complicated !! They are a bunch of frauds who don't take responsibility for their own actions...you want your life in their care?? I doubt it!!!Was this rating useful? 1 flag | Submitted June 3, 2015 5Staff 5Punctuality 5Helpfulness 5KnowledgeI have been a patient of Karen Kings for over 4 years and have never encountered a problem getting in the same day. Her staff is very friend and welcoming. What I like about Karen King is that she actually takes the time to get to know you and to find a solution for any problem. She is great with my kids, and the kids like love her. I would highly recommend her to anyone, she is awesome.Was this rating useful? 0 Submitted September 8, 2014 1Staff 1Punctuality 1Helpfulness 1KnowledgeThe wait was over 45 minutes in a completely disgusting waiting room. Once we were led to the examination room it got even worse. There was a used bloody band-aid on the floor and the examination table was covered in dirt. Dr King was performing a physical on my 10 year old son, when I politely informed her that we were here for a rash on his hands, and not a well check, in which she responded that we would need to make another appointment, informed her that would not be happening. In asking my son questions, she asked him if he
" liked boy's or girl's" which confused him and was totally uncalled for. Now, lastly they billed my insurance for a well check that was not performed, in doing this, she caused me an out of pocket expense of 130.00 when I went to get his shots for school. The entire experience was a complete nightmare. Not only is Dr. King rude so is her entire staff, so be warned, stay away from this office or you will be sorry!!Was this rating useful? 2 flag | Submitted August 15, 2014 1Staff 1Punctuality 1Helpfulness 1KnowledgeAdvertised as Family Practice however; very hard environment to bring children alot of facial products etc. in the waiting room for kids to get into and no family centered TV while you wait (ie cartoons etc). Not your usual family practice setting. Was a patient for about a year but, had to find another family practice more family centered. Always had to wait about a half hour after my actual appt. time and felt pressure to purchase over the counter products that she tried to sale from her office (ie vitamins, reservatrol, and face creams).Was this rating useful? 1 flag | Submitted January 9, 2014 Rate this DoctorKaren King's Credentials Facility AffiliationsKing Karen M Accepting New PatientsUnavailable BiographyUnavailable LanguagesUnavailable EducationUnavailable Other SpecialtiesUnavailable Areas of ExpertiseUnavailable Awards & RecognitionsUnavailable Publications & ResearchUnavailableInsurance accepted by this DoctorOther patients have successfully used these insurance providers, please call the Doctor's office to find out if your insurance plan is accepted.MSP/BC Med

                This review was written for Shadow Over Kiriath - eBook.
            
 
            This was the final book in The Guardian King series. Karen Hancock weaved such an exciting adventureful story that could have been about a Biblical King! I was so enraptured by the story, that I had difficulty stopping at the end of each chapter!


I've read many fiction books in my time, and this series was amazing at grabbing my attention, and not letting it leave! I'm very good at foreseeing the next turn in a plot, but I was pleasantly surprised with the suspense of the storyline!


The best part is the Biblical Allegory, that caused me to evaluate spiritual values in myself! I would give 10 stars if I could! Fabulous series and a must read for fans of: C.S. Lewis, & Tolkien. I'd rate these better than Lord Of The Rings!Ã®â¬Å½Ã®â¬Å½Ã®â¬Å½

            This ranks up at the top and met every expectation of what it is advertised at. The comparison to Scripture in the names and thoughts was fantastic. Really enjoyed this!

            AWESOME!!! I loved this one. It has you on the edge of your seat more than the previous 2. Revealing more truths of our own faith through every page of this astounding allegory. Romance, action, adventure, conspiracy, betrayal, love, and salvation. This book has got it all! I'm recommending this series highly to everyone I know.

            Ok... the romance was good.... and I did like how Abramm did learn how to trust God and not himself. This book seems darker and heavier than the books before, but that doesn't make it any worse. And it ends in suspense so the reader will be sure to read the next.

            Hancock, winner of eight awards for the first two books of the series, plies her great storytelling skills as she carries the reader back into Kiriath. This book concentrates more on the love story than the other two books of the series, though she provides plenty of swashbuckling excitement with Esurhite pirates, rebellious lords, and the vindictive Mataio. As in her other books, she builds on Abramm's growing faith, but he shows a lack of regard about his and Madeline's reputations that is disappointing. At times they do incredibly foolish things. Although Princess Carissa's love for Abramm's best friend, Trap, is foreshadowed, she disappears for long stretches of the book. Hancock makes the Shadow, the forces of evil, appear stronger than the great god of light, Eidon, when she allows a master evil spirit called a Warhast to indwell some who have accepted the Terstan shield, which is a symbol that Eidon burns into the chest of his converts. Hancock does not explain how both could occur.Shadow over Kiriath is a good book and an exciting read. After the first two books in the series were so superb, this one seemed a slight letdown. Others may disagree. Fans of Kiriath, Abramm Kalladorne, and Karen Hancock will want to grab the nearest copy. I'm looking forward to book four in the series. -- Debbie W. Wilson, Christian Book Previews.com

Publisher's Description▼▲
Lost for more than fifteen hundred years, the Gospel of Mary is the only existing early Christian gospel written in the name of a woman. Karen L. King tells the story of the recovery of this remarkable gospel and offers a new translation. This brief narrative rejects Jesus' suffering and death as a path to eternal life and exposes the view that Mary Magdalene was a prostitute for what it is--a piece of theological fiction. "The Gospel of Mary of Magdala offers a fascinating glimpse into the conflicts and controversies that shaped earliest Christianity.
