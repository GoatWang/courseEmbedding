Overview

 







 

Deep Well
                            Oil & Gas, Inc. through its wholly owned subsidiaries,
                            Northern Alberta Oil Ltd. and Deep Well Oil & Gas
                            (Alberta) Ltd., has a 90% working interest in 51
                            sections on six oil sands leases, an 100% working
                            interest in 5 sections on one oil sands lease, and
                            a 25% working interest (post Farmout) in an additional
                            12 sections on two oil sands leases in the Peace
                            River oil sands area of Alberta, all of these sections
                            are contiguous. These nine oil sands leases cover
                            43,015 gross acres (17,408 gross hectares) of land.
                            Of the 68 contiguous sections on nine oil sands leases
                            we are the operator on 56 sections on seven leases
                            where we have working interest ranging from 90% to
                            100%. 
  
Deep

                        Well's management believes that the Sawn Lake Heavy Oil

                        Project is at the same pre-growth stage experienced by

                        other heavy oil companies prior to a major period of

                        growth. 
 Other operators

                        targeting the deeper Slave Point Formation have

                        previously drilled much of the land. Because of the

                        earlier extensive exploration for light oil, Deep Well

                        is able to benefit from data collected by others

                        pertaining to the drilling of more than seventy-five

                        wells that penetrated and partially delineated the heart

                        of the Bluesky Formation heavy oil reservoir.

 EDMONTON, Alberta -- Deep Well Oil & Gas, Inc. and its
subsidiaries ("Deep Well") (PINK SHEETS: DWOG) is pleased to
announce that production testing has re-commenced on the first well of
the Sawn Lake 2006 drill program. The operator, Signet Energy, has
confirmed that the service rig is on site and production flow testing
has resumed on the first successful well of the Sawn Lake heavy oil
project.

 On December 6, 2005 Signet Energy announced that it had
successfully drilled the first well but production testing was
interrupted due to mechanical problems which required a service rig to
be placed back on the well site.

 The operator expects to complete 3 additional wells before the end
of the second quarter of 2006.

 Further information will be released by the company on the status
of the well as flow rates and other relevant information becomes
available.

 Deep Well Oil & Gas, Inc. is a Nevada corporation based in
Alberta Canada. Deep Well and its subsidiaries Northern Alberta Oil Ltd.
and Deep Well Oil & Gas (Alberta) Ltd. have an 80% working interest,
subject to a farmout agreement, in 63 contiguous sections of oil sands
leases and 6.5 sections of oil sands permits in the Sawn Lake heavy oil
area in North Central Alberta. The permits and leases cover 43,964
acres. After Signet Energy drills 10 wells at no cost to Deep Well, they
will fully earn their interest in the project. Deep Well will then
directly hold 40% of the project. In addition, Deep Well owns
approximately 29.5% of Signet's common shares. A previously
published independent engineering report estimated that, there are 819.5
million original barrels of oil in place.
