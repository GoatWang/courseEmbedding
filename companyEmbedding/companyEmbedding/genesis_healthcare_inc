History[edit]
Genesis Health Ventures was established by Michael R. Walker in 1985 with acquisition of nine centers. Between 1985 and 1998, Walker grew Genesis Health Ventures from a $32 million to a $2.4 billion public company through the acquisition of nursing homes and services such as rehabilitation therapy, diagnostic testing, respiratory therapy, and pharmacy.
In 1999, the federal government made cuts to Medicare, which at that time funded virtually all the care for individuals admitted to Genesis Centers from hospitals. Genesis Health Ventures sought Chapter 11 protection in 2000. In 2001, the company reorganized and reemerged from bankruptcy.
In 2003, Genesis Health Ventures separated the company's in-patient care and pharmacy divisions. As part of the separation, Genesis Health Ventures adopted the NeighborCare pharmacy division's trade name, and spun off the company's Genesis ElderCare Skilled Nursing Centers and Assisted Living and Independent Living Communities, as well as Genesis Rehabilitation Therapy Services, into a new entity – Genesis HealthCare Corporation.
On July 13, 2007, Formation Capital and JER Partners completed the acquisition of Genesis HealthCare Corporation. The total enterprise value of the transaction was approximately $2.0 billion. Genesis' shareholders received $69.35 in cash for each share of Genesis' common stock that they held.[1]
On April 1, 2011, Health Care REIT, Inc. (NYSE:HCN) completed the $2.4 billion acquisition of substantially all of the real estate assets of privately owned Genesis HealthCare, which was previously announced on February 28, 2011. In June 2012, Genesis HealthCare announced its plans to acquire Sun Healthcare Group.
On December 1, 2012 Genesis completed the acquisition of Sun Healthcare Group, Inc. (Sun) (NASDAQ GS: SUNH). Sun Healthcare was formally headquartered out of Irvine, California. It operated skilled nursing facilities, assisted and independent living centers, and behavior health centers in 23 states. Sun also owned SunDance Rehabilitation, CareerStaff Unlimited and SolAmor Hospice. Genesis acquired Sun for $8.50 per share. The aggregate amount of the merger was approximately $215, excluding closing costs and the repayment of Sun debts.[2]
Genesis Healthcare merged with Skilled Healthcare Group Inc. on February 2, 2015. This all-stock deal produced one of the nations largest post-acute care operators. The combined company operates more than 500 skilled nursing and assisted/senior living communities in 34 states and more than 1,800 rehab therapy sites in 47 states and the District of Columbia. The combined company employs more than 90,000 employees and has a combined revenue of $5.5 billion. Skilled Healthcare was formally headquartered out of Foothill Ranch, California. The combined company is headquartered out of Kennett Square, Pennsylvania.[3]
In June 2015, Genesis HealthCare announced plans to acquire 24 skilled nursing facilities from Revera, Inc. The transaction is expected to close on December 1, 2015.[4]

Genesis Health Products, Inc 
 

Genesis Health Products, Inc (GHP) is a California based corporation founded in 2000 that develops nutritional products and designs educational programs for populations interested in enhancing their health and wellbeing.
 
GHP Develops Nutritional Products to Optimize Genetic Potential
 
Genesis Health Products offers—Genesis Gold®— a lifetime nutritional support system designed to optimize genetic potential. 
Genesis Gold® is the only product available that addresses the root of dis-ease by balancing the hypothalamus which orchestrates the entire neuro-immune-endocrine system. Unlike most nutritional supplements, Genesis Gold® does not merely address symptoms of disease; it balances the entire system. For most consumers, Genesis Gold® has replaced six to ten bottles of supplements. Many are no longer dependent on medications, hormone replacement, or natural remedies as their systems have come into harmony. 
Initially, Genesis Health Products’ target market consisted of middle aged men and women seeking to age more gracefully. Over the years, patients of Ms. Deborah Maragopoulos, MN APRN BC, Family Nurse Practitioner (FNP) and founder of Genesis, began to see improvements in infertile women, children, young adults with learning disabilities, men and women with hormonal imbalances, as well as adults suffering from insomnia, fatigue, stress related diseases, mood disorders, addictions, and nutritional deficiencies. 
Genesis Gold® offers a unique nutritional support system which is unequaled in the vast array of supplements available. Genesis Gold® is the only organic plant based nutritional supplement that balances the hypothalamus and the neuro-immune-endocrine system as well as digestion, detoxification and mitochondrial energy production.
 
GHP offers Educational Programs to Optimize Health
 
In addition to nutritional support, Genesis Health Products educates the public on harmonizing hormones by way of balancing brain chemistry and enhancing immunity through holistic lifestyle choices. Patients gain the confidence to make the lifestyle changes needed for optimal performance in all life’s journeys with intuitive integrated medicine, coordinated with each individual’s environment and increasing knowledge of body chemistry. 
Educational services have expanded to include conventional and alternative health care providers training in holistically optimizing genetic potential of the body. Knowledge gained through GHP’s education includes how to incorporate integrative medicine into their conventional and alternative practices. Providers can supplement their revenue by promoting sales of Genesis Gold® offering holistic health care effectively and collectively.
 




Our Mission:
To provide educational services and products to empower patients and health care providers to partner with one another to heal themselves and the health care system.




 
GHP Serves the Community
 
Since 2000, Genesis Health Products has served the community by developing nutritional products and designing educational programs to transform the health and wellbeing of the local residents as well as their family and friends across the nation. 
The founder of GHP, Deborah Maragopoulos MN APRN BC FNP, speaks locally in high schools, churches, community centers, wellness and learning centers. GHP focuses on educating the public on how to holistically enhance healing through product and knowledge. GHP offers educational programs and products to help people learn how to optimize health—physically, emotionally and spiritually. 
Through GHP, in-depth specialized professional classes and mentorship are available to colleagues interested in integrative medicine.
 
The GHP Team
 
Deborah Maragopoulos MN APRN BC FNP, the President of Genesis Health Care Products, Inc, seeks to transform health and the health care system. She received both her undergraduate and graduate degrees from UCLA. 
A leader in her field, Deborah used her visionary talents to broaden the horizons of her nurse practitioner colleagues as President of the California Association of Nurse Practitioners. 
As an Intuitive Integrative Medicine Nurse Practitioner, Deborah treats individuals with a focus on the enhancement of the natural biochemistry of the ligands or “hormones” that dictate physical wellbeing. Deborah’s patients travel from across the world to receive her holistic evaluation and treatments. 
Deborah is a passionate and motivating speaker and has been sought out by healers of both traditional and complementary medicine to mentor them into her unique philosophy of health care. As a business consultant, Deborah helps conventional medicine integrate holistic health care into their practice. 
 
With her passion, motivation and in depth knowledge of the complicated biochemistry of the neuro-immune-endocrine system, Deborah Maragopoulos MN APRN BC FNP is the face of GHP.
 
Steve Maragopoulos, Shipping and Warehouse Manager, brings over three decades of support for Deborah's vision. After 30 years of serving the public as a police officer, Steve spends his retirement in charge of product sales and distribution.
 
Gabriela Gonzalez the newest member of the GHP team, Gaby is Deborah's office manager and nurse practitioner assistant. Gaby is in charge of customer relations and assists in special handling of online sales. 
 
GHP works with the following independent contractors to support its mission to transform health and health care naturally.
 
Melanie Balestra NP JD incorporated Genesis Health Products, Inc in December 2000. Ms Balestra serves as legal consult for the California Association of Nurse Practitioners. For the past twelve years, Ms Balestra has provided ongoing legal consult for Genesis, Inc.
 
John Phaneuf provides video production for Genesis’ patient and health care provider education. John is President of Media and Potatoes, a documentary film company which focuses on natural lifestyles. 
 
The Amazing Story of Genesis Health Products' Beginning.... 
 
Deborah Maragopoulos MN APRN BC FNP’s impetus to understand the connection between the hormones and genetic expression began after delivering an intersex infant in 1984. Facing many obstacles in navigating the health care system to find the best care for her child, Deborah sought post graduate education in neuro-immune-endocrinology, genetics, functional integrative medicine, and nutritional therapeutics to assist her child and her patients in healing the biochemical imbalances labeled by allopathic medicine as dis-ease. 
Deborah has been a board certified family nurse practitioner since 1987. In 1997 she started her own business Full Circle Family Health, a medical corporation. With a specialty in neuro-immune-endocrinology, she began treating a wide variety of hormonally challenged patients which led to the development of a revolutionary diagnostic and therapeutic health model that has enabled her to successfully treat hormonally challenged patients these past 25 years. 
With her expertise in Intuitive Integrative Medicine, Deborah began researching how hormones affect genetic expression. Her research led to the creation of a complete nutritional support system—Genesis Gold®— which focuses on the regulating the hypothalamus to harmonize hormones, balance brain chemistry, support the immune system and optimize genetic potential. 
Neuro-immune-endocrine imbalances lie at the root of many of our most costly diseases like diabetes, obesity, heart disease, learning disabilities, depression, anxiety, insomnia, and auto-immune disease. 
Deborah founded Genesis Health Products, Inc to transform the health care delivery system by educating patients and providers on how to heal neuro-immune-endocrine imbalances, how to optimize genetic expression, and how to live healthy lives physically, emotionally, and spiritually.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
