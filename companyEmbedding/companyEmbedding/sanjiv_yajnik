                    The National Academy Foundation (NAF) is a leader in the movement to prepare young people for college and career success.  For 30 years, NAF has refined a proven educational model which includes industry-focused curricula, work-based learning experiences, and business partner expertise from our five themes: Finance, Hospitality & Tourism, Information Technology, Engineering, and Health Sciences.

Founded in 1982 by Sanford I. Weill, Chairman Emeritus of Citigroup Inc., NAF fosters partnerships between the business and education communities to provide opportunities to underserved students. Weill’s original intent was to connect young people to entry-level jobs in New York City's growing financial sector. His program did much more than that.  His vision led to a national movement of preparing students for successful careers.

After Weill received approval for his new academy plan from the New York City Board of Education, the first academy, an Academy of Finance opened at John Dewey High School in Brooklyn, NY in 1982. Since then, the NAF network has grown to 500 academies and serves more than 60,000 students across 39 states, D.C, and the U.S. Virgin Islands each year. NAF's 97% graduation rate and network of dedicated educators, business partners, and students are testament to the effectiveness of this model.

Sanjiv Yajnik, president of Capital One Financial Services and head of its fast-growing Plano campus, wears many hats.
Gov. Greg Abbott in November appointed him chairman of the Texas Economic Development Corp. The corporation supports programs and activities of the Governor’s Division of Economic Development and Tourism, including TexasOne, which markets Texas to businesses outside the state.

He also is chairman of the board of Collin County Business Alliance, which he helped create in 2011 with the goal of making the county a better place to live and work.
I got to spend a morning with Yajnik on the sprawling Capital One campus when I profiled him for the Power Players feature in this week’s print edition, which is devoted to coverage of economic development and corporate relocation and expansion.
Here's some bonus coverage from that interview:
Why is a separate business alliance for Collin County necessary? If you just think about Collin County, we have so many cities. Each city is trying to maximize itself. But there isn’t a business interest that spans all across it. And even though we, for example, are in Plano, our employees live all across the county. So we are interested in what happens across the county.
What’s the annual budget of CCBA? It varies. It depends on what it is that we do. Because we are a private group, that’s not something that we release.
How do you fulfill the mission of the Texas Economic Development Council? A variety of ways. We will enable international trade visits. We’ve had trade visits to Mexico, to Cuba, and we’re doing one to Israel. We will support our governor being able to meet up with the heads of state in those countries. That will happen internationally. We also have visits within the country. So the governor may go to New York or California, etc., and meet up with groups of CEOs or people who are thinking about expanding their businesses or relocating their businesses, and we ensure that he’s got a great forum to do that. We also go to trade shows where economic development professionals get together trying to find places for their clients to locate their companies. We’re also involved in marketing to spread our story. Then finally, we play an important role in getting businesses across Texas who really want to help on this mission to get engaged in a powerful way.

Were you a member of the Texas Economic Development Corp. before being appointed chairman? No. It is not a position that I was seeking. I have my hands full. It was kind of a reluctant acceptance, but I was humbled by the governor asking me to do it, and frankly the reason that I’m doing that is because I love Texas and I want to give back.
Does the board vote on state incentives? No. We keep an arms length from that. The incentive packages are put together on the state level by an office that the governor has for economic development and tourism that’s separate. They handle it at the state level, and then there are local incentives that are done by the local economic development corporations.
Do you think North Texas has the right balance of cooperation and competition in the way that regional organizations and individual cities try to recruit corporations considering relocating here? Competition is always good. It helps us get better. In the business world, the market really helps us get better and get stronger so we are not resting on our successes of yesterday. However, a certain degree of coordination is awesome, because at the end of the day, coordination prevents waste. Too much coordination, or too much centralization, snuffs out the human spirit. In trying to find that balance, one of our roles in TEDC is to bring parties together so that they can see the full picture of what’s going on, but then allow people to do what is right for their local region.
What do you see as the single biggest threat to the jobs machine, the economic development that’s drawing so many companies to North Texas? Longterm economic prosperity starts with the premise that past success does not equal future success. We have to be really careful about that. The other thing I would say is, the world is changing fast. Sometimes we don’t even realize how fast it is changing. I believe that the greatest threat to Texas, and therefore the greatest opportunity for Texas, is to be the place that talent wants to come. That is going to determine the next level of development of things that we do incredibly well at.




 


What concerns keep you awake at night related to economic development? We need to be going to where the puck is going to be, and not where it was. This is a whole arena of where technologies meets industries, and we want (Texas) to be the place where everyone wants to be because of that. I know that is happening, but are we doing enough to make sure we are staying ahead of the curve?
On the Capital One side, what keeps you awake? What keeps me awake on the Capital One Side is excitement. We are the leading edge of technology, and the success that we are enjoying here on the campus is because of many moves that we made over the years to stay ahead of the curve.
