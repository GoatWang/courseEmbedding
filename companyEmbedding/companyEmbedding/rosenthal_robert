Bio

Mr. Rosenthal received a bachelor’s degree in 1972 from California State University, Chico, California, and his Juris Doctor degree in 1975 from the University of the Pacific, McGeorge School of Law in Sacramento, California.
During Robert (Bob) Rosenthal’s 40+ years of practicing law, he has tried over 150 court and jury trials in courts throughout California. He has represented varied prominent individuals including mayors, school district superintendents, real estate developers, attorneys, physicians and professional athletes.
Bob began his career with the Sacramento County District Attorney’s office handling criminal prosecutions. He soon began practicing in Sunnyvale, CA with Scher, Bassett & Rosenthal, a seasoned and renowned personal injury firm.
In 1976, Bob became one of the original sports agent/attorneys in the United States, participating in the formation of the Association of Representation of Professional Athletes (ARPA), the first national sports agent association.  He was authorized by the NFL as a player agent and he and former professional athletes, Y.A. Tittle and Mike McCormick, founded the sports management firm of Propel, LP in 1976.  Rosenthal has represented over 50 professional athletes in all major sports and also represented the San Francisco 49ers in litigation.
In 1978, Bob relocated his family and his practice to the Monterey Peninsula where he opened a sole practice handling personal injury and a full array of legal services.  Soon, he formed a partnership with Rob Wellington and the two practiced as Wellington & Rosenthal. In 1986, Mr. Rosenthal and Thomas Bohnen formed the firm of Bohnen, Rosenthal & Call, later to be Bohnen, Rosenthal & Dusenbury, later to be Bohnen, Rosenthal & Kreeft, an association of partnerships. In 2016, Bob merged his litigation practice with the lawyers at L&G, LLP, where he and his team handle the firm’s clients’ litigation and trial needs.
Mr. Rosenthal’s trial practice includes complex civil litigation, commercial litigation, personal injury and product liability, real estate law, sports & entertainment law matters.  Services offered by he and his team of attorneys include representation in court, arbitrations, mediations, negotiations, drafting important legal documents and generally providing legal advice to his many individual and business clients.
In addition to trying and/or settling several million dollar cases throughout his career, in the fall of 2014, Rosenthal was the lead trial attorney in the Monterey case of Hill v Toyota in which Mr. Rosenthal’s client was awarded the largest jury verdict award in Monterey County, following a five week trial.  In this case, the Superior Court jury found Toyota Motor Corporation primarily liable for $12.6 million in damages as compensation for the devastating injuries suffered by Plaintiff Chelsie Hill.  Mr. Rosenthal successfully convinced the jury that the manufacturer had ignored the known dangers of a lap belt when it manufactured the vehicle and elected to not install a shoulder belt in the one seat Ms. Hill was seated in.  The other passengers were all protected by shoulder belts and walked away from the single vehicle crash, while Ms. Hill jack-knifed over her lap-belt resulting in permanent paralysis.
Mr. Rosenthal has lectured at Santa Clara Law School and McGeorge School of Law, University of Pacific, on the Art of Negotiation.
Personally, Mr. Rosenthal has acted as a charitable auctioneer, raising more than $3 million in charitable giving for local schools and charitable organizations.  He is a board member and director of The Living Breath Foundation; Past President of Monterey Peninsula JayCees; past member of Monterey United Way; founder and director of Pebble Beach Junior Golf Association; past member of Monterey Rotary; past board member of Monterey Chamber of Commerce; founding member of Monterey County Hospitality Association; founder of the Monterey Peninsula Safe School task force; board member of Bronco Little League World Series; founding board member of Association of Representation of Professional Athletes (ARPA). Bob also sought and was publicly elected to the Peninsula School Unified Board of Trustees.
Bob raised three sons on the Monterey Peninsula, each of whom graduated from Monterey High School, all as student body presidents. One son, after graduation from Boston University School of Law, joined the Colorado Rockies Major League Baseball team and is now its Assistant General Manager of Baseball Operations.  Another son also joined the Rockies as its Supervisor of Cultural Development (Latin Players) following a three-year stint in the Peace Corps.  Bob’s youngest son lives in Jackson Hole, Wyoming where he manages a five-star restaurant.  Bob is married to Carol, a medical aesthetician in Monterey.
In 2015, Bob was voted Monterey County’s Best Lawyer 2015 by the readers of the Monterey County Herald.  Bob is also a life-time member of the Million Dollar Advocates Forum and Multi-Million Dollar Advocates Forum; a member of the Who’s Who in Law and Lawyers of Distinction.

						ROSENTHAL, Robert Sylvester In Loving Memory October 20, 1940 July 13, 2017 Robert "Bob" Sylvester Rosenthal (76) of Atlanta, GA passed away on Thursday, July 13th, 2017 while visiting family in Franklin, Tennessee. He is survived by his wife Frances Crossett Rosenthal, his daughter Joy Rosenthal and her husband Jorge Minnic of Blacksburg, VA; grandchildren, Ester Minnic, David Minnic, Ashley Rosenthal, and Michael Petty. He was preceded in death by his son David Rosenthal. Bob graduated from Northside High School (1956), Georgia Tech (1959) with a double major in Electrical Engineering and Physics, Atlanta Law School, and Johns Hopkins with a PhD in Physics. He served as a pilot in the Air Force with tours in Alaska, Asia, and with the Air Weather Service worldwide where he achieved the rank of Major. He taught at Johns Hopkins, The Airforce Academy, Georgia Tech, and The University of Texas at Austin. Bob had over 30 years of experience in the wireless industry. He held executive leadership positions at MRI Systems Corp., Intel Corporation, Symantec Corporation, and retired from Motorola as Vice President. Following his retirement, he founded RSR Ventures. A private service was held following his passing. Memorial donations may be made in Bob's name to Wesley Woods.

Overview



There is a new kind of dad, and he’s doing far more domestic duty than at any time in history, including cooking. Although it’s written with a sense of humor, this book is a serious resource for dads and anyone else interested in upping their game to make great tasting food at home, even if they have never used a chef’s knife or a roasting pan before.Author Robert Rosenthal teaches basic techniques and presents a playbook of simple recipes that achieve the most taste with the fewest ingredients and the least effort.™ The dishes are sophisticated enough for entertaining, yet family table tested as well. Short Order Dad covers all the essentials, from shopping ingredients and cooking tools to appetizers, soups and salads, snacks, entrees, sauces and dressings, sides, desserts, cocktails and more, to make anyone a successful chef.Good cooking doesn’t have to be complicated to be great. In fact, it’s just the opposite. So whether you’re clueless in the kitchen, pan-fry phobic, or already a skilled cook, Short Order Dad is here to help turn your kitchen into a place to play.Skyhorse Publishing, along with our Good Books and Arcade imprints, is proud to publish a broad range of cookbooks, including books on juicing, grilling, baking, frying, home brewing and winemaking, slow cookers, and cast iron cooking. We’ve been successful with books on gluten-free cooking, vegetarian and vegan cooking, paleo, raw foods, and more. Our list includes French cooking, Swedish cooking, Austrian and German cooking, Cajun cooking, as well as books on jerky, canning and preserving, peanut butter, meatballs, oil and vinegar, bone broth, and more. While not every title we publish becomes a New York Times bestseller or a national bestseller, we are committed to books on subjects that are sometimes overlooked and to authors whose work might not otherwise find a home.

Editorial Reviews


Publishers Weekly
05/02/2016This debut cookbook from Rosenthal, an ad executive, comedian, and food writer, contains tips that virtually all novice cooks (of any gender) can put to use. After boldly calling out men on their fears of cooking—they might worry about being seen as incompetent, failing, or having to make a commitment—Rosenthal gets down to brass tacks, offering advice on building a pantry, selecting the right ingredients and cookware, and learning a handful of techniques before continuing to his recipes. He begins with the painfully simple avocado toast—which, like others of his dishes, can barely be called a recipe. Breakfast pizza (flour tortilla, tomato sauce, and cheese) and pigs in blankets set the bar low, making much more complicated recipes such as the crispy lacquered chicken and ancho chili shrimp feel like anomalies. Though the book is fine for readers who have been hesitant to enter the kitchen, let alone prepare a meal, those with even a modicum of confidence will likely find it too elementary. There are many better ways for beginners to learn cooking techniques and recipes than this scattered effort. (May)

From the Publisher
“Rob Rosenthal’s approach to the kitchen is commonsensical, whimsical, and above all intelligiblewhich is by no means always the case in cookbooks these days. He obviously loves preparing good food as much as he loves eating it, and he knows how to convey his affection with those two admirable writerly virtues: clarity and wit. This book will have you cooking, and probably smiling, in, er, short order.”Colman Andrews, editorial director, The Daily Meal; eight-time James Beard award-winning author“When was the last time you smiled your way through an entire cookbook? Every single recipe in Rob Rosenthal’s Short Order Dad is one you want to (and actually can) cook. While incredibly informative and a great handbook for novices and seasoned cooks alike, this book gives you the sense that above all, cooking is about relaxing, creating pleasure, and having fun.”Danny Meyer, restaurateur and author, Setting the Table“I’m convinced that if we all had a dad like Rob Rosenthal, the world would be a happier, healthier place. His command of the stove, and ability to distill even the most complicated cooking techniques into applicable, intuitive recipes and advice, proves that a man’s place is most certainly in the kitchen. Short Order Dad is delicious fun for the whole family! It’s such a great bookI can’t wait to get it for my own dad, brothers, husband, best friend, uncle, and nephew.”Gail Simmons, food expert and author of Talking with My Mouth Full“This book breaks it down; it’s in Robert’s voice too, which cracks me up. It has the power to make the most mannish dad novices earn the confidence in the kitchen to please crowds. I even got some ideas for the menu at Little Owl.”Joey Campanaro, chef and owner, Little Owl (Greenwich Village, NYC)“Short Order Dad is a simple, fun book that encompasses all the aspects of a good home cookbook; his philosophies of never wasting a meal, or his connection to food through his family and heritage, is the way everyone should cook and eat. Robert’s love for food and cooking is evident in the way the book is laid out. His approach to all aspects of cooking a meal, from tools to techniques to shopping, is a great layperson’s guide to everyday cooking. His recipes are well chosen and not fussy or complicated. If you know Robert, the only thing missing while you cook from this book is his physical presence; his voice and joyful character are embodied in every word of the book.”Floyd Cardoz, chef, Paowalla (NYC) and The Bombay Canteen (India); winner, Top Chef Masters“I’ve personally tasted some of Rob’s delicious cooking at parties that he’s thrown and I’m super psyched to see him put all of his recipes into this book. Now dads across America can join in the fun, thanks to Rob.”Bill Telepan, chef, Telepan Restaurant; executive chef, Wellness in the Schools“Listen up, men! Nothing is sexier than a guy who can cook for his family, and Chef Rosenthal delivers the power tools necessary to gain confidence in the kitchen. This hilarious manual provides the road map that every savvy man needs to turn his kitchen into a culinary playground.”David and Veronica James, authors of Going Gypsy: One Couple’s Adventure from Empty Nest to No Nest at All“The ideal handbook for all beginners in the kitchen, but makes the perfect gift to all fathers looking to up their cooking game.”The Daily Meal"[An] inspirational book that will tickle your taste buds as well as broaden [your] view of what cooking is and what it is not."Dad of Divas
