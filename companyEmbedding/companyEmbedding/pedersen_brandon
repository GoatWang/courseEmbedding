We worked together very closely. Brandon is both extremely skilled and a very hard worker. His ability to jump into other people's code, understand what's going on, solve the problem and get it all done in a very short period of time is unsurpassed. He provides wonderful technical and architectural guidance to less experienced team members and everyone on the team loved working with him.

I loved working with Brandon and really appreciate the technical vision he provides. As a non-technical Product Owner, he was always more than willing to help me understand difficult technical aspects of the product so we could make great decisions together. I hope I'll have the privilege of working more with Brandon in the future!See moreSee lessWhile working with Brandon at Novell/NetIQ, I had some opportunities to "pick his brain" to understand how some software features and processes worked. I found him to be very helpful and insightful. Brandon is a very good engineer, with some very deep knowledge. What he doesn't know, he learns through exhaustive research and testing. Brandon is a thorough and practical person. He is friendly and is a great contributor to every team he works on. It was a privilege to work with him.See moreSee lessSign up to see who recommended BrandonGroupsNovell ZENworksNovellBrigham Young University AlumniBYU Information Technology (IT)Novell AlumniUtah County LDS IT ProfessionalsThe BYU NetworkView Brandon’s full profile to...See who you know in commonGet introducedContact Brandon directlyView Brandon’s Full ProfileNot the Brandon you’re looking for?
