	Business

	NAP is a growth oriented limited partnership formed to own, operate and acquire crude oil tankers under long-term employment contracts.

	In the future, to the extent opportunities arise, NAP may also seek to own, operate and acquire refined petroleum product tankers, chemical tankers, and LPG tankers under long-term employment contracts.

	Consistent with the chartering strategy of NAP’s affiliate, Navios Maritime Partners (NYSE: NMM), which charters its dry bulk and container vessels under long-term employment contracts, NAP intends to charter its vessels under long-term employment contracts to international oil companies, refiners, and large vessel operators.

	NAP’s Relationships with Navios Maritime Holdings and Navios Maritime Acquisition

	One of NAP’s key strengths is its relationships with Navios Maritime Holdings (NYSE: NM) $60 million market cap, and Navios Maritime Acquisition (NYSE: NNA) $448 million market cap.

	Navios Maritime Holdings is one of the world’s largest independent drybulk operators with a market capitalization of approximately $635.0 million as of September 30, 2014.

	Navios Maritime Holdings’ business was established by United States Steel Corporation in 1954 and has over 50 years of experience working with raw material producers, agricultural traders and exporters, and industrial end-users. The key members of Navios Maritime Holdings’ management team have on average over 20 years of experience in the shipping industry.

	Navios Maritime Acquisition, NAP’s parent

	Navios Maritime Acquisition, NAP’s parent, owns a large fleet of modern crude oil, refined petroleum product and chemical tankers providing world-wide marine transportation services and has a market capitalization of approximately $411.0 million as of September 30, 2014.

	Navios Maritime Acquisition’s strategy is to charter its vessels to international oil companies, refiners and large vessel operators under long, medium and short-term charters. Navios Maritime Acquisition is committed to providing quality transportation services and developing and maintaining long-term relationships with its customers.

	NAP intends to use Navios Maritime Holdings’ and Navios Maritime Acquisition’s extensive experience and relationships to secure long-term time charters for its vessels.

	Competition

	The market for international seaborne crude oil transportation services is fragmented and highly competitive.

	Seaborne crude oil transportation services generally are provided by two main types of operators: major oil company captive fleets (both private and state-owned) and independent ship owner fleets.

	In addition, several owners and operators pool their vessels together on an ongoing basis, and such pools are available to customers to the same extent as independently owned and operated fleets.

	Many major oil companies and other oil trading companies also operate their own vessels and use such vessels not only to transport their own crude oil but also to transport crude oil for third party charterers in direct competition with independent owners and operators in the tanker charter market. Competition for charters is intense and is based upon price, location, size, age, condition and acceptability of the vessel and its manager. Due in part to the fragmented tanker market, competitors with greater resources could enter the tanker market and operate larger fleets through acquisitions or consolidations and may be willing or able to accept lower prices than us, which could result in NAP’s achieving lower revenues from its vessels.

	5% shareholders post-IPO

	Navios Maritime Acquisition   55.5%

	Dividends

	The amount of the minimum quarterly distribution is $0.4125 per unit, or $1.65 per unit per year, or 8.25% at the price range midpoint of $20.

	Use of proceeds

	NAP expects to receive $148 million from its IPO and use it for the following:

	primarily to fund a portion of the purchase price of the capital stock in the subsidiaries of Navios Maritime Acquisition that own the four vessels in its initial fleet.

Navios Maritime Midstream Partners: OPEC Production Cut Extension A Negative... Sell - Navios Maritime Midstream Partners LP (NYSE:NAP) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Navios Maritime Midstream Partners: OPEC Production Cut Extension A Negative... SellMay.29.17 | About: Navios Maritime (NAP) Morningsidepark Value, special situations, energy, commodities, shipping, long onlySummaryOPEC's decision to extend current production cuts for an additional nine months is a near-term negative for most tanker companies. It will dampen any seasonal recovery in rates during 2017.Navios Maritime Midstream liquidation valuation lowered based on recent sales of comparable tankers. Increased likelihood of additional cash escrow requirements during second and third quarter to avoid debt default.Reader comments on prior article addressed.This is an update to a Navios Maritime Midstream Partners LP (NYSE:NAP) article I published on May 8th, in which I recommended selling NAP. It is essential to read that article, as it provides important background information on NAP and explains why a dramatic reduction in common unit distributions is highly likely after the distribution for the quarter ended September 30, 2017, is paid. OPEC Production Cut Extensions OPEC and non OPEC producers are on course to extend production cuts for an additional nine months beginning July 2017. This will have a modest negative impact on tanker demand and rates during Q3 2017 through Q1 2018 when analyzed on a year-over-year basis. Navios Maritime Midstream Partners' fleet of six vessels is listed below.           Shinyo Ocean VLCC 2001 281,395 Pool Earnings (3) --         38,400 (3) --     Jan-19   Shinyo Kannika VLCC 2001 281,175 Pool Earnings (3) --         38,025 (3) --     Feb-19   Shinyo Saowalak VLCC 2010 298,000   35% above $54,388   Jun-25     40% above $59,388     48,153 50% above $69,388     Shinyo Kieran VLCC 2011 297,066   35% above $54,388   Jun-26     40% above $59,388     48,153 50% above $69,388     C.

(2) Estimated dates assuming midpoint of redelivery of charterers.          (3) Rate backstop by Navios Acquisition for two years at $38,400 per day for the Shinyo Ocean and at $38,025 per day for the Shinyo Kannika.  (4) Rate backstop by Navios Acquisition for two years at $35,000 per day.         All six tankers in the NAP fleet have rate backstops or minimum rates with profit sharing mechanisms that are calculated on an annualized basis. At this juncture, the probability that NAP will only realize the base rates under the various charters and rate backstops during the next 12 months (profit sharing is calculated on an annualized basis) has increased with the extension of the production cuts. Q1 2017 revenue approximated the average annualized daily base (minimum) rate on page 12 of the Q1 2017 earnings presentation and resulted in a distribution coverage ratio of 1.1x (rounded up!) per page 10 of the earnings presentation. The coverage ratio will weaken slightly during 2017 due to the increase in outstanding common units. NAP will generate little to no free cash during the remainder of 2017, and it will need to fund any additional Cash Collateral amounts due under the Term Loan B Credit Facility with cash on hand or proceeds from the continuous offering of common units. Valuation Adjustments There were several sales of comparably aged tankers in secondary market during the last several weeks. These sales are listed below. These comparables resulted in a downward revision in the FMV of NAP's fleet, a valuation that was pretty dire already relative to enterprise value and the LTV covenant under the Term Loan B Credit Facility.

For convenience, I have included the original valuation table from my prior article immediately below and then adjusted it for the values implied by these recent sales.

The value for C. Dream has been adjusted to the 2000 comparable sale. The value for the Nave Celeste is calculated as the average of the two 2002 sales adjusted upwards by $400k. The value for the Shinyo Kieran is the 2011 comparable sale.       Navios Maritime Partners LP                       Age as of Estimated   Adjusted Fleet FMV     Built DWT 2017 Value (millions)                   Shinyo Ocean   VLCC 2001 281,395 16 $21.83   Shinyo Kannika   VLCC 2001 287,175 16 $21.83   Shinyo Saowalak   VLCC 2010 298,000 7 $52.00   Shinyo Kieran   VLCC 2011 297,066 6 $53.00   C.

It should be noted that the vessel sales used as comparables are slightly larger than NAP's vessels of comparable vintage. An adjustment for this difference would further reduce the estimate of FMV. The reduced Fleet FMV based on recent comparable sales indicates that NAP will fail the .85 LTV covenant test again in the Term B Loan Credit Facility during the second and third quarters. Based on the Updated Fleet FMV estimate provided above, it is likely that the company will need to add an additional $20 million to the cash collateral account. Leasing Alternatives A comment on my prior article referenced NAP's statement (page 5 of the Q1 Earnings Release) that it is "exploring financing opportunities, including sale and leaseback structures with Chinese leasing houses." Sounds impressive, right? This SA reader thought it was, but do not fall for this statement. It is abject bunk just like so much of the spin that is liberally larded into almost all of the Navios family of companies' presentations. First, leasing is just another form of leverage. If properly structured to meet GAAP requirements, a lease may be classified as an operating lease. An operating lease is still leverage. It will be disclosed in the financial footnotes, and any rating agency or sophisticated debt investor will factor it in when analyzing the creditworthiness of the company. If the lease does not meet GAAP operating lease requirements, it will be capitalized on the balance sheet as debt with a related asset (since the GAAP conclusion is that it has not really been sold, only financed).
 Second, an operating lease or a capital lease would worsen NAP's current cash flows. The current debt requires a 1% per annum principal payment until maturity. This is a very advantageous deal for a very poor credit. An operating lease, to qualify as such, would require a much higher principal payment. Remember, a lease payment represents principal, interest, and an equity return (the counterparty in a sale leaseback will want a return on its equity that is reflective of the lessee and asset risk). The cash flows will worsen because the principal payments will need to be higher and the cost of capital will be higher (that pesky equity return). Third, the assets that would be the subject of the purported sale leaseback already secure the existing Term Loan B Credit Facility. The reader commenting on the lease rumor was under the mistaken impression that the proceeds would go to NAP. Nonsense. NAP would need to secure a release of the assets from the Term Loan B Creditors. The Term Loan B Creditors, therefore, have the leverage and would agree to such a deal only if it improves their credit position. Basic rule of finance: When you have to ask for permission, you are in the weaker negotiating position. Lastly, Chinese financial institutions are all tied to the central government, either through outright ownership, regulation, or behind-the-scenes political control. Their primary focus is to finance the growth and expansion of the Chinese economy, not to fund the rescue of an overlevered Greek shipping company. Conclusion My conclusions are the same as in my last article, which I will repeat verbatim: "Run to the exits now. November may seem far away, and the temptation to capture a couple of meaty quarterly Common Unit distributions is great, but the market will begin to understand this issue over the next quarter or two and hammer the price down."

Style Scores:



A Value | F Growth | A Momentum | B VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Sell Navios Maritime Midstream Partners - Navios Maritime Midstream Partners LP (NYSE:NAP) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Sell Navios Maritime Midstream PartnersMay. 8.17 | About: Navios Maritime (NAP) Morningsidepark Value, special situations, energy, commodities, shipping, long onlySummaryNavios Maritime Midstream failed its .85 to 1 loan-to-value covenant test at the end of Q1 2017 under its Term Loan B Credit Facility.Under Section 8.3 of the Term Loan B Credit Agreement, Navios Maritime Midstream was forced to contribute $10 million into a restricted cash collateral account to cure the covenant test failure.Navios Maritime Midstream may need to contribute additional cash collateral during the next two quarters as the value of its 6 VLCCs declines faster than Term Loan B principal payments.Additional cash collateral will be funded through the Continuous-Offering-Program equity issuance. Navios Midstream issued $3.77 million of equity during Q1 2017 to help fund the cash collateral requirement.A significant common unit distribution cut is likely after the Subordinated Units' Subordination Period expires subsequent to payment of the Minimum Distribution for the quarter ended September 30, 2017.There was a recent article published on SA recommending Navios Maritime Midstream Partners LP (NYSE:NAP) as an attractive high yielding dividend investment vehicle. Ignore this advice and sell NAP now! NAP failed the .85 to 1 Loan-to-Value covenant test contained in Section 6.1 (NYSE:A) of the Term Loan B Credit Facility ("Credit Facility") for the Quarter Ended March 31st 2017 and, under the terms of Section 8.3 of the Credit Facility, it was obligated to fund $10 million into a Cash Collateral account to cure the covenant test failure. This is surreptitiously disclosed in Footnote 3 of the Q1 2017 Financial Statements included in the 6-K filed April 28th. It is laughably and disingenuously described as "Strengthening Collateral of Term Loan B" on page 5 of the Q1 2017 Earnings Presentation ("Earnings Presentation") and then hidden in footnote 1 on page 7 of the Earnings Presentation. Angeliki Frangou has a history of glossing over these types of financial issues. A .85 to 1 LTV covenant test is extremely lenient from the borrowers perspective. Failing such a lenient LTV covenant test is therefore a big red warning flag for dividend investors. It clearly communicates that NAP is woefully overleveraged in comparison with its underlying assets and that it will not be able to maintain common unit distributions at the current level of $.4225/unit beyond the expiration of the Subordinated Units Subordination Period (see below for more detail). NAP owns six VLCCs and, as detailed in the table below, the FMV of the vessels is in the range of $215 million based on Compass Maritime value estimates for the week ending May 5th, 2017.
       Navios Maritime Partners LP                       Age as of Estimated   Fleet Fair Market Valuation   Built DWT 2017 Value (millions)                   Shinyo Ocean   VLCC 2001 281,395 16 $26.20   Shinyo Kannika   VLCC 2001 287,175 16 $26.20   Shinyo Saowalak   VLCC 2010 298,000 7 $52.00   Shinyo Kieran   VLCC 2011 297,066 6 $56.00   C.

Plus the $10 million in cash collateral equals about $193 million. Based on estimated principal outstanding of $198 million, NAP is already in danger of failing the LTV covenant test again at the end of Q2. The value of NAP's vessels will continue to decline at a rate between 3 and 5% per annum during 2017 as the vessels age. This decline in value is greater than the 1% per annum principal payments due under the Credit Facility, so NAP may need to fund further contributions to the cash collateral account to cure LTV covenant test failures at the end of the second and third quarters. VLCCs have a useful life of 20 years Compass Maritime's estimate of FMV value for a 20 year old VLCC is slightly above scrap (assuming LDT of between 43k and 45k tons and scrap price range of $360 to 380, see table below).       Navios Maritime Midstream Partners LP                   VLCC Scrap Value Calculation                       Value per Ton       LDT Tonnage $360 $370 $380                 43,000 $15,480,000 $15,910,000 $16,340,000     44,000 $15,840,000 $16,280,000 $16,720,000     45,000 $16,200,000 $16,650,000 $17,100,000               Compass Maritime 20 yr VLCC Est. Value $17,000,000     In three to four years, NAP will likely scrap three of its older VLCCs and this will have a big deleterious impact on its future cash flows. The scrapping of these vessels will coincide with the June 2016 maturity date of the Credit Facility. The lenders are in an increasingly poor position relative to the collateral, so they are unlikely to show any flexibility on requirements to cure the LTV covenant test failures. NAP filed a Continuous Offering Program ("COP") for the issuance of $25 million in Common Units during the 2Q of 2016. During Q1, NAP issued $3.77 million in Common Units and the YTD issuance increased to $3.9 million as of April 27th per page 5 of the Earnings Presentation. Additional Common Unit Issuance will likely increase now that the ex-dividend date for the Q1 common units distribution has passed. Between a Rock and a Hard Place Issuing Common Units to fund cash collateral calls to cure Credit Facility LTV covenant test failures equals paying down debt with equity. Under normal circumstances, this may be a good idea. The problem is that NAP is issuing Common Units that yield 15% in order to pay down debt costing 5.5%. This is suicide. The cost of capital nearly triples while the useful lives and the value of the underlying assets continue to decline. It is unsustainable. For instance, just the $3.9 million in Common Units issued YTD will require approximately $585k in incremental distributions per annum at the current Common Unit distribution rate. Let's look at it from an Enterprise Value perspective. Per page 13 of the April 28th 6-K, total units outstanding (common, subordinated, and GP) equaled 21.35 million. At Friday's closing price of $11.27, the equity value of NAP is a bit more than $240 million. Add the amount due under the Credit Facility and the Enterprise Value is north of $440 million. This is more than 2x the FMV of the assets. This is a house of cards about to collapse. Why Is NAP Still Paying Such a High Distribution? Why is NAP paying such a high Common Unit distribution in the face of such an existential financial crisis? In a word, Subordination. The capital structure of NAP was setup with Subordinated Units to provide the Common Unit holders with a distribution cushion or shock absorber in case financial performance deteriorated for any reason. This was a common marketing device deployed by GPs selling interests in LP spinoffs.
 Distribution payments on NAP's Subordinated Units would only occur if the Minimum Quarterly Distribution Amount of $.4125 per unit, and any arrearages from prior periods, had been made to the Common Units. The expiration of this subordination would occur as follows: the second Business Day following the distribution of Available Cash to Partners pursuant to Section 6.1 in respect of any Quarter ending on or after September 30, 2017, in respect of which (NYSE:I) distributions of Available Cash from Operating Surplus on each of the Outstanding Common Units, Subordinated Units, General Partner Units and any other Outstanding Units that are senior or equal in right of distribution to the Subordinated Units (other than Subordinated Series A Units) equaled or exceeded the Minimum Quarterly Distribution during each of the three consecutive, non-overlapping four-Quarter periods immediately preceding such date and (NYSE:B) the Adjusted Operating Surplus for each of the three consecutive, non overlapping four Quarter periods immediately preceding such date equaled or exceeded the sum of the Minimum Quarterly Distribution on all of the Common Units, Subordinated Units, General Partner Units and any other Units that are senior or equal in right of distribution to the Subordinated Units that were Outstanding during such periods on a Fully Diluted Basis with respect to each such period and (ii) there are no Cumulative Common Unit Arrearages; In a nutshell, NAP has successfully paid the Minimum Quarterly Distribution since the issuance of the Common Units and, in fact, increased the distribution to $.4225 beginning in Q3 2015. The Subordination Period will therefore expire two days after the distribution for the quarter ended September 30th, 2017 if it maintains the current Quarterly Distribution. The Q3 Distribution is typically paid the first week of November. At the expiration of the Subordination Period, the Subordinated Units convert to Common Units. Navios Maritime Acquisition Corp (NYSE:NNA), as the GP, is not going to risk the continued subordination of its units by not paying the next two Minimum Quarterly Distributions.
 The following table details the units outstanding and the projected quarterly and annual distributions on the units.         Navios Maritime Midstream Partners LP                 Units Qtrly Distributions Yearly Distributions                 Common units     9,991,641 $4,121,552 $16,486,208   Subordinated Series A units     1,592,920 $657,080 $2,628,318   Subordinated units     9,342,692 $3,853,860 $15,415,442   General Partner interest     427,087 $176,173 $704,694   Total     21,354,340 $8,808,665 $35,234,662   NAP will likely need to reduce its yearly distributions on all its unit by at least $20 million in order to free up cash flow sufficient to pay down or cash collateralize its Credit Facility. That would reduce the yearly distributions to approximately $15 million. If the Subordinated Units remained subordinated, the Common Unit payout would decline by roughly 10%. With the Subordinated Units converting to Common Units, the Common Unit payout would drop from $1.69 to $.70. This would be a major blow to Common Unit holders but it would ameliorate the cash flow hit to NNA. By waiting until after the expiration of the Subordination Period to cut the Common Unit distributions, NNA is placing its interests before the interests of the current Common Unit holders. As detailed in the table above, NAP has three VLCCs that will likely be scrapped within 3 to 4 years. This will dramatically reduce its future cash flows. The best path forward for NAP would be to eliminate the distributions entirely. This would free up more than $35 million a year in cash flow which could be used to purchase 12 year old VLCCs, satisfy the Credit Facility collateralization requirements, and begin the rejuvenation of the NAP fleet. This will not occur, however, because NNA is the GP and it needs to continue to maximize its near-term cash flow. Conclusion Run to the exits now. November may seem far away and the temptation to capture a couple of meaty quarterly Common Unit distributions is great, but the market will begin to understand this issue over the next quarter or two and hammer the price down.
