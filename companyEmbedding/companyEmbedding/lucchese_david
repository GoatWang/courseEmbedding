                                The August 10th final match of the Lucchese Silver Cup held even more significance for Lucchese and ERG, as both teams hailed from Texas. Both fought until the bitter end to determine the champion — a title which Lucchese ultimately took home.

These are awesome !!
The color is perfect, as described. Dark Cherry... elegant and even nicer than I imagined. The Cayman Crocodile vamp is beautiful. They fit great. I actually wear a size up in exotics compared to traditional leather, as exotics supposedly will not stretch as much over time.
Lastly, just to be clear, these are Lucchese 1883 line, not classics. That is, they are made in Mexico, and specifically these are the M1637.14 model. This is why they are not closer to $2000 (which would be the GY1050 model). Rest assured, if you ordered from Lucchese's own site you would get the exact same model in your cart. Their site is good to learn about the heel and toe types, but then come back to Zappos for the fastest delivery and best service.

I followed Lucchese recommendation and ordered a half size smaller than I typically wear, and this was perfect. Very comfortable boot, nice clean look.

This is the third pair of Luchesse boots I have bought on Zappos. They are awesome. True to size and attractive while also functional. 
I'd also recommend:  Have bought other brands in the past. None compare

I suppose I thought I'd grown too old to wear boots. I could not have been more wrong! These were a perfect fit from the moment I put them on, and the best footwear I own for my feet. My arch problems, even aches and pains from fractures... don't bother me in these boots. They feel amazing, look great on me in jeans (my girlfriend's opinion) and are incredibly well made. My second pair of Lucchese Boots. Won't be my last. Thanks, Zappos.

My first pair of western boots. Concerned about width - I usually take 9 1/2 EEE, ordered 9 1/2 EE and they fit great. Just a bit hard on/off but after only a few wearings getting easier. Can't compare to Justins or others that were cheaper - I feel you usually get what you pay for - these look, feel great.

About Lucchese



 The Lucchese™ Bootmaker story starts in 1880 when Sam Lucchese Sr. and his brothers came to America. He was just 17 years old at the time, but Lucchese knew he wanted to be a boot maker. Just three years later, the Lucchese Boot Company was born in San Antonio, Texas. In 1960 the founder´s grandson and namesake took over the family business and decided to rethink the art of boot making. Sam Lucchese Jr.´s fascination and understanding of the human foot inspired him to create a boot design that fit like no other. Although Lucchese´s one-of-a-kind boot's last design required more skill and time, the result was a boot that quickly gained national recognition for its extraordinary comfort, quality and fit. 
No other boot fits the human foot like a Lucchese™ Bootmaker boot, thanks to their original design and meticulous construction. From the exclusive "twisted cone last" design and the careful selection and cutting of the finest grade of leather, to the hand-drive lemon wood pegs and meticulous finishing of a boot. Each step is considered critical to the finished product. The boot designs may demand more money, time and skill, but when you slip your foot into a Lucchese™ Bootmaker boot, you'll know why we insist on only the finest. 
Every Lucchese™ Bootmaker boot is hand inspected twice. In virtually every procedure during the production on a Lucchese boot, human hands are relied upon to complete the task to near-perfection. Every inch of a Lucchese boot is made of the finest grade of leathers. Slip your foot into a Lucchese and experience comfort you never thought possible.

The robin's egg blue Lucchese Robyn is the perfect color for a summer boot. I works with white jeans, capris and skirts. It works with coral and red, it works with an amazing array of colors and the fringe plus the simple feather add a bit of design punch. The style fits like it was custom made for my finicky feet and the arch support is wonderful. A great choice!

These boots are drop dead gorgeous. The pictures don't do them justice.
I'm 5'9" and 140 lbs, with a shoe size of 9, a 14" calf. I ordered these in an 8.5, and the fit is perfect with regular socks. I could have gone down another half size if I wanted to wear thin socks. These hit right at the widest point of my calf, which is a very flattering height for skinny jeans, leggings, skirts, and shorts. I anticipate they will drop about 1" when fully broken in. The foot bed feels true to width. The color is just beautiful, a rich, dark red that goes with just about anything. I was afraid the red would be too bold, but it's subtle enough to match most outfits, and looks especially fabulous with a dark olive green.
As far as comfort, these are pretty reasonable for fashion footwear. They form to the foot well, with no pinching or crowding. I wanted something to wear for dressy occasions that would be more comfortable than heels, and these fit the bill nicely. I normally wear minimalist footwear, so while these aren't quite on that level, they're very comfortable for what they are.
Overall, I would highly recommend these boots. They're gorgeous, versatile, and more comfortable than the average stylish shoe. Love them.

These boots look great and fit perfect. Most of the boots I have purchased were purchased 1/2 size larger than I wear in regular shoes. Only the Ostrich boots fit perfect using my regular shoe size; I have no idea why that is.

Very nice looking boot but not as comfortable as I'd hoped. Only worn a few times though. Expect that with additional wear and break in comfort will improve. Sharp looking boot.

This shoe looks elegant and adventuresome, but seems oddly built with an uncomfortable ankle that doesn't allow much freedom for the foot.

I have a weakness for Luccheses and so these added to my collection. They are beautiful and of course comfortable right out of the box. The red is brighter than it looks on the picture so they really stand out. They really get noticed but I like that I can walk around comfortably all day. I love all my Luccheses! Thanks to Zappos's for carrying small sizes (5) because otherwise I would be shoeless and worse Lucchese-less.

I get so many compliments on this - men tell me it reminds them of Hermes or a Valkyrie or just stare mouth agape. I'm thinking it may be too sexy for work.

OK boot - probably somewhat overpriced for the quality. Very narrow tops - if you calf is even slightly larger than average, you will not be able to fit into this boot. I fit nicely into a pair of American made Lucchese boots, so my calves are big but not huge. These are going back.

OK, so this is my 2nd review on these boots after wearing them for the first time today(I shouldn't have rushed the 1st review). These boots are incredible! Instant comfort right out of the box. I first bought a pair of cheaper boots and they dug into my ankles when I walked and the heel slip was so bad that I almost couldn't walk(returned them) These fit perfectly, like they used my foot for the mold.(very true to size) Yes, they are very distressed, very marked and creased where my ankle and toes bend but that's what makes them so comfortable. I don't think I could buy any other boot after wearing my Lucchese. Love these boots!

These booties are beautiful!! The leather is soft and supple, with a pointed toe. The heels are low and comfortable, with a nicely padded foot bed. The grey braided trim around the ankle provides the perfect finishing touch!! I love them!! Thanks, Zappos!!! You did it again!!

        Look:
        

These shoes are my favorite pair I've ever purchased! I got to try these on in the store so luckily I knew the right size - usually I'm an 8 but a 38 (size 7) fits me like a glove. I have a wide foot and these are the perfect width. They are super duper ridiculously comfortable, they feel like a real shoe with excellent support, legit sole and luxurious materials. But they are also super cute and go well with any outfit! I always get compliments whenever I wear them. :)

So pretty and comfortable. Am always looking for ways to pack less when traveling overseas. This shoe is perfect! Matches every outfit, will keep me warm on the plane or if the weather cools in the evening. I do wear them with (barely there) socks. This shoe is a winner!







About Women's Shoes


Regardless of where you’re going, Zappos will help you get there in style. Because if you give a girl the right shoes, she can take on anything! Running to your next cross training class? We have an assortment of athletic shoes like Nike® and Under Armour® with all the latest technologies to help you catch your stride with ease. And don’t fret if you’re looking for a more casual sneaker, we have plenty of those too. Ready for a night out on the town? Put yourself on a pedestal with a range of high heels, boots, and pumps that’ll have you living the high life. Otherwise relax your feet with some slip-ons, from wedges to flats and everything in between. The details of our peep-toe booties will never be a footnote in your ensemble, so expect to dominate in the bold silhouettes of our Chelsea and Harness boots. And if you come across some hurdles in your journey from here to there, we’ve got you. Give ‘em the old boot in whichever style you wish—knee-high, ankle, outdoor, and more! If you need to feel a little more surefooted, we’ve got orthotic-friendly and safety footwear styles like Dankso® and Clarks® to suit your every need. From the catwalk to the boardwalk, we’ve got a selection that’ll make finding your sole mate a cakewalk.

Tucson Low Steel Toe

Right out of the box these shoes fit great. I was very surprised by how much toe room I had with this shoe being steel toe. I wore them today for the first time and my one complaint would be that my feet got rather hot. Don't know if I just been to break them in a little or if these shoes aren't the best to wear in the summer working out side all day as a swimming pool technician. I always wear moisture wicking shoes that are very breathable and my feet just got slightly sweaty after wearing for just half the day. The shoes are great though. The real test will be to see how long it takes for the sole to start coming apart from the toe area. I'm hoping the steel toe part will help keep that area from separating after only a few months but we will see.

I ran about 10 miles in these during the first week that I had them. They were ready to go with no break in required. My feet did get pretty warm in these though. They may be a little heavier and less ventilated than other Asics I've owned.







About Men's Shoes


Whether you’re strolling into your next big business meeting or hitting the gym, the shoes that you wear can tell a lot about you. Show ‘em you mean business in a stylish and durable pair of Dr. Martens® combat boots. Slick back your hair like Don Draper and step away in a pair of well-crafted leather oxfords from Johnston & Murphy® or Rockport®.
When it comes to men’s footwear, some styles are too classic to ever let go. They’re the ’69 Mustang, tried and true. You can’t get more authentic than a fine pair of Dan Post cowboy boots. For a real blast from the past, try out some Chuck Taylor® All Star® sneakers or America’s favorite boat shoe by Sperry Top-Sider. We even carry Timberland® brand work boots, every hard-working man’s sturdy sidekick in rugged and industrial conditions.
Athletes and outdoorsmen can appreciate our vast collection of sneakers and outdoor shoes for every activity, from hiking to running to rock climbing. Whether you’re looking for a pair of waterproof outdoor boots or top-of-the-line basketball shoes, you’ll find only the best from brands like Nike®, ASICS®, New Balance®, Brooks®, Keen®, DC®, and EVOLV™.
For the fashion-forward male, there are a million ways to showcase your style. Stay sharp in traditional wingtips from Bostonian®, Cole Haan®, or Frye®. Keep it fresh with PF Flyers® high-top sneakers. Go for a pop of color, experiment with non-traditional textures, or make a statement with loud shoe patterns from Vans®. It doesn’t matter if you’re going for traditional or off-the-wall. We have a shoe to fit your personal style.
So feel free to try it all! With our excellent customer service, convenient return policy, and free shipping both ways, we make it easy for you to get exactly what you want.

I searched quite a bit for the right hiking boot and these are great! My feet were a little sore the first time but after that they were very comfortable. They offer a lot of foot and ankle support. This do feel just a smudge too narrow but that may be for support. Overall, happy with the purchase. I got the yellow ones but they are more nude. Love them.

Beautiful pair of shoes. Had to return since I suppose my foot is more of a wider width. But if you can fit your feet into these shoes, they're pretty awesome.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
