Unit Investment Trusts (UITs) are sold only by prospectus. Investors should read the prospectus carefully before investing which contains a detailed explanation of the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Investors should consult their accounting, legal, or tax advisor.


* Information labeled “Fee-Based Account” provides information pertaining to units purchased through registered investment advisers, certified financial planners or registered broker-dealers who in each case either charge investor accounts periodic fees for brokerage services, financial planning, investment advisory or asset management services, or provide such services in connection with an investment account for which a comprehensive “wrap fee” charge is imposed. You should consult your financial advisor to determine whether you can benefit from these accounts and whether your unit purchases are eligible for this discount. To purchase units in these accounts, your financial advisor must purchase units designated with one of the Fee Account CUSIP numbers, if available. The amounts shown are different from what would be applicable for units purchased in other accounts (i.e. “Commission-Based Accounts”) not eligible for this discount.  See your prospectus and consult your financial advisor for more information about eligibility and applicability of the Fee-Based Account discount.

Our VisionOur Team 






 





Capturing Results Through Innovation and Discipline Through a structured and disciplined approach we will provide exclusivity and customized investment strategies for our clients.  We will be distinguishable by the personal relationships we build with our clients, truly listening to and understanding their financial goals and objectives.


Right around the midpoint in life, humans tend to learn that if you make a decision in an emotional state of mind, you have a great chance of making the wrong choice.  Among the most damaging emotions of all are greed and fear.


Fortunately, life experience serves you well and success is achieved in family and in business.  This wisdom brings financial rewards.  Sound decision making allows you to achieve substantial life goals and to surround yourself with friends and colleagues who have the same long-range vision.  


Yet when it comes to investing in the market, seasoned life veterans inadvertently join hands with an entire population that never learned the same lessons.  Unknowingly, their investments are commingled with approximately 85% of the marketplace who make investment decisions based on greed and fear.  This herd mentality drives the market impacting your holdings at this very moment…
