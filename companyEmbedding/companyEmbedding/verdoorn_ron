News Release
Affymetrix Appoints Ronald Verdoorn To Head Global Manufacturing Operations


01/12/1999

Download this Press Release ()

Santa Clara, CA — January 12, 1999 —

Affymetrix, Inc., (NASDAQ: AFFX) today announced the appointment of Mr. Ronald Verdoorn to the position of Executive Vice President, Global Manufacturing.  In this position, Mr. Verdoorn will be responsible for developing and implementing Affymetrix' worldwide manufacturing strategy for its GeneChip®
 products.  Included in Mr. Verdoorn's responsibilities will be overseeing current manufacturing operations in Sunnyvale, California and the completion and validation of   Affymetrix' newest manufacturing facility in West Sacramento, California. 


Prior to joining Affymetrix, Mr. Verdoorn most recently held the position of Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer at Seagate Technology.  While in that capacity, Mr. Verdoorn had overall responsibility for the core operational units of Seagate including six design centers, materials and logistics, quality, reliability and all hard disk drive manufacturing in the United States, Asia and Europe.  During his 15-year tenure at Seagate, he served in various capacities including Senior Vice President, Worldwide Manufacturing Operations; Vice President and General Manager, Thailand Operations; Vice President, Far East Manufacturing, Singapore; and Vice President Manufacturing.  While at Seagate, Mr. Verdoorn oversaw Seagate's operations which resulted in a 175-fold revenue growth increase over a 15 year period. 


"We are delighted to welcome Ron, and to add a seasoned operating veteran to the Affymetrix team. Throughout his career, he has repeatedly demonstrated an ability to build and manage high volume manufacturing processes necessary to successfully bring technology-based products to a mass market.  Ron's experience in growing Seagate into the world's largest manufacturer of disc drives, magnetic discs and read-write heads with 13 manufacturing sites worldwide will be invaluable as Affymetrix scales up its own production capabilities to serve a global market," said Stephen P.A. Fodor, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer.  "We are fortunate to have attracted someone with this caliber of experience at this important stage in our operational development." added Fodor


"From my first introduction to Affymetrix, I have been impressed with the elegance of the technology and the Company's progress toward making this technology a standard tool for molecular biology research and patient management," commented Ron Verdoorn.  "To achieve the Company's goal of making its GeneChip technology accessible to a global audience, it must now focus on completing and refining its manufacturing infrastructure to ensure that its products maintain a cost and performance advantage.  I have been fortunate to have managed through this same phase of growth in the past and I look forward to doing it again with Affymetrix," added Verdoorn.    


Affymetrix has developed and intends to establish its GeneChip®
 system as the platform of choice for acquiring, analyzing and managing complex genetic information in order to improve the diagnosis, monitoring and treatment of disease.  The Company's GeneChip system consists of disposable DNA probe arrays containing gene sequences on a chip, reagents for use with the probe arrays, a scanner and other instruments to process the probe arrays and software to analyze and manage genetic information.  Additional information on Affymetrix and GeneChip technology can be found at www.affymetrix.com.


All statements in this press release that are not historical are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act, including statements regarding the Company's "expectations", "beliefs", "hopes", "intentions", "strategies" or the like.  Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially for Affymetrix from those projected, including, but not limited to, uncertainties relating to technological approaches, product development, manufacturing, and market acceptance, uncertainties related to cost and pricing of Affymetrix products, dependence on collaborative partners, uncertainties relating to sole source suppliers, uncertainties relating to FDA and other regulatory approvals, competition, risks relating to intellectual property of others and the uncertainties of patent protection and litigation.  These and other risk factors are discussed in Affymetrix' Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1997 and 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 1998.  Affymetrix expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect any change in Affymetrix' expectations with regard thereto or any change in events, conditions, or circumstances on which any such statements are based.
