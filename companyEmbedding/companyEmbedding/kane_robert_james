Service History Note
In his interview, James Kane recalls advancing on the Dutch town, Gylekirchen, on the way to the Ruhr River during the Battle of the Bulge. The town had been reduced to ruins and the forces met very little resistance beyond an artillery barrage. They later dealt with heavier fighting. Kane talks about receiving the Bronze Star for rescuing another soldier and describes seeing Germans fleeing the Russians across the Elbe River.

Retired West Aurora teacher charged with child pornography

Beacon-News staffPrivacy Policy





A retired, longtime West Aurora High School teacher has been charged with possessing multiple images of child pornography.Robert L. James, 61, of the 1600 block of Garfield Avenue in Aurora, is accused of producing multiple images of child pornography and having multiple images of children younger than 13 years old, according to the Kane County State's Attorney's office. He is also accused of exposing himself before Aug. 14 to a child he knew and soliciting a sexual act from that child, who was younger than 13 at the time.He is charged with two counts of producing child pornography, six counts of possession of child pornography, indecent solicitation of a child and sexual exploitation of a child, all felonies, according to the state's attorney's office.James was a West Aurora High School math teacher and student council advisor for almost 30 years before he retired in June 2014, said West Aurora School District 129 spokesman Tony Martinez.

James is no longer involved at West Aurora High School, Martinez said, and the charges so far appear to have no connection to West Aurora students.He said the allegations came as a surprise to the district."Everyone we've talked to has had glowing remarks about him," Martinez said. "So this is kind of seen as a surprise to everyone."Aurora police took James into custody Thursday, and his bail was set at $300,000 during a hearing in Kane County bond court Friday, according to the state's attorney's office.

If James posts bond, he is not allowed to have contact with anyone younger than 18, according to the state's attorney's office. If convicted, he could face a minimum of six years in prison and would be required to register as a sex offender.





The case is still under investigation. Kane County authorities asked anyone with information to contact their local police department, the Aurora Police Department at 630-256-5500 or the Kane County Child Advocacy Center at 630-208-5160.James is scheduled to be in court again Jan. 15.
