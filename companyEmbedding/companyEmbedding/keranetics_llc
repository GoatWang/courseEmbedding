Walt Unks/Journal





























































KeraNetics LLC, a Winston-Salem biotechnology company, is in the midst of a pivotal transition from focusing on research and development of therapeutic products to being a manufacturer.A major part of that shift was put on display Monday – a 9,000-square-foot facility in Wake Forest Innovation Quarter that more than doubles its previous space.KeraNetics is a biomaterials company with 23 employees, including eight with doctorate degrees.It is using keratin, which is found in hair, nails and skin, in four areas: trauma applications for the healing of wounds; burns and resuscitation fluids; bone and nerve regeneration; and cell growth. Keratin can be formulated into several different commercial products, such as topical gels, putties and rigid scaffolds.The new space in 200 E. First St. includes laboratory and manufacturing areas that once belong to Targacept Inc., which has downsized drastically the past three years. A $250,000 small-business research loan from the N.C. Biotechnology Center helped pay for much of the upgrade.“We feel very lucky to have this space become available to us,” said Kim Westmoreland, chief executive of KeraNetics. “The space perfectly fits our needs for the next decade with not a lot of additional expense. It is the right place at the right time.”Westmoreland said the company is wasting little time putting the new space to use.“We’re turning the equipment on next week,” he said. “We’re pleased to be able to stay downtown because it allows us to expand our work, particularly on projects with the university. The space perfectly fits our needs.”KeraNetics has two main business lines: KeraStat concentrates on thermal burns, such as from radiation exposure, and antibiotic drug delivery and KeraGenics focuses on bone, muscle and nerve regeneration, with bone the lead product.Westmoreland said he believes in a “just in time” business model, in part to control costs.For example, Westmoreland said KeraNetics can produce keratins for both products on one manufacturing line.However, the new space gives it the ability to operate two lines, which would reduce the down time necessary to switch production.KeraNetics is in the process of requesting Food and Drug Administration approval to begin human clinical trials. Westmoreland said that if it gains FDA approval, it could have product available for consumers at the earliest in late 2016 and the latest by early 2018.“When these products get to market, we believe they will make a big impact,” Westmoreland said.
Sharon Decker, who is stepping down as state Commerce secretary at year’s end, cited KeraNetics as the kind of grassroots biotechnology companies “that are critical important to the economic future of Winston-Salem and North Carolina.”Decker said one area where North Carolina “can do better” is in terms of technology transfer, in particular commercializing research and development. Wake Forest Innovations debuted in December 2012 to give a higher profile to the commercializing of its academic and clinical research by creating a new division.KeraNetics is a Wake Forest spinoff. It holds an exclusive license agreement for nine issued and four pending U.S. patents. It also has five internally derived pending patent applications.KeraNetics has been awarded a combined $15.2 million in grant funding from the U.S. Defense Department and has attracted $13 million in private-equity funding.The company recently received a $1.5 million federal defense grant for research related to injectable bone regeneration products, and a separate $1 million federal defense grant for 3-D printed dressing to treat severe facial thermal burn injuries.rcraver@wsjournal.com (336) 727-7376

KeraNetics






A Model Member of the Innovation Quarter Community
To keep moving forward, KeraNetics LLC has moved into a new home in Wake Forest Innovation Quarter.
KeraNetics, an advanced biomaterials company focused on researching, creating and commercializing keratin-based products for therapeutic and regenerative medical applications, now occupies approximately 9,000 square feet of laboratory, manufacturing and office space at 200 E. First St. That’s more than twice the space it had in the nearby Richard H. Dean Biomedical Research Building.
“We feel very lucky to have this space become available to us,” Kim Westmoreland, KeraNetics’ CEO, said at the December 8 event that marked the official opening of the company’s new home. “The space perfectly fits our needs for the next decade with not a lot of additional expense. It is the right place at the right time.”
The move to First Street allows KeraNetics to improve and expand its manufacturing capabilities, a vital step for the company as it prepares to begin human clinical trials, pending U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval.
Producing substances for use in human clinical trials requires a “higher standard of cleanliness,” Westmoreland said, and the company’s new site offers the ventilation, hygiene and process-control features necessary for medical manufacturing.
KeraNetics has two main product lines, both based on the keratin proteins present in human hair, nails and skin that are notable for their toughness and durability. The KeraStat product line is centered on wound care and management while the KeraGenetics line is devoted to bone, nerve and muscle regeneration.
If the two clinical trial applications currently under review are given the green light and their results merit FDA approval, Westmoreland said, KeraNetics products could be available to consumers by late 2016.
“When these products get to market, we believe they will make a big impact,” he said.
KeraNetics’ upgrading of its new space at 200 E. First St. was supported by a $250,000 small business research loan from the North Carolina Biotechnology Center.
KeraNetics, which was spun out of research at the Wake Forest Institute of Regenerative Medicine, currently has 23 employees, including eight with doctorates and three with M.B.A. degrees.
Since it was established in 2008, KeraNetics has raised approximately $13 million in private-equity funding and received more than $15 million in grants from various government sources. Recently, the U.S. Department of Defense awarded the company $1.5 million for research and development related to injectable bone-regeneration products and $1 million for research and development of three-dimensional printed dressing to treat severe facial thermal burn injuries.
“We are really proud to be partnering with the U.S. government in developing these products to help soldiers who receive horrific injuries,” Westmoreland said.
KeraNetics has an exclusive licensing agreement with Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center for nine issued and four pending U.S. patents covering production methods and uses for six fields of keratin biomaterials. The company also has five internally developed pending patent applications to support products in development.
“KeraNetics has been a model member of the Innovation Quarter community,” said Eric Tomlinson, president of Wake Forest Innovation Quarter. “We are delighted to be able to accommodate the company’s growth within the Innovation Quarter and we’re confident that its new home will be the site of continued growth and success in bringing important products to the market for the benefit of patients.”

Antibiotic Drug Delivery - Keranetics





























































 










 
 






Antibiotic Drug Delivery
 

Drug Delivery Product Line
Local, tissue-specific drug delivery is a growing need for many therapeutic and regenerative medicine strategies.  Unfortunately, the majority of current biomaterial delivery vehicles are unable to provide desirable release kinetics, formulation options, degradation profiles, and/or biocompatibility characteristics necessary for successful drug delivery.  KeraNetics is developing an ideal solution to these problems with a system that resists enzymatic degradation and that can be formulated into a wide variety of carrier options with varying viscoelastic properties.  These formulations can also be tailored to provide short- or long-term release profiles for a wide range of drug chemistries.
Pre-Clinical Models Show:

Controlled release delivery system for a variety of drugs with various chemical profiles including: ciprofloxacin, neomycin, and others
Highly biocompatible; passed FDA ISO 10993 tests for immunogenicity, cytotoxicity, sensitization, systemic toxicity, and irritation

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
