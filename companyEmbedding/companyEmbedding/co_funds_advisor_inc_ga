Biography
Curtis began his career in financial services at a boutique wealth management firm in his hometown of Greenville, South Carolina. While he always had an interest and inclination towards finance and economics, he quickly discovered he also had a passion for teaching and working with people. During that time, he went back to school at night to complete his MBA from Southern Wesleyan University, and was subsequently promoted to Director of Financial Planning Operations. Later, he would go on to earn the CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER® certification through Boston University.
Soon thereafter, Curtis joined JPH Advisory Group, as a Senior Financial Advisor, to serve clients in all areas of the wealth management process. Curtis works with clients to design financial plans, oversee investment strategies, and most importantly listen.  His strengths lie in taking complex financial problems, simplifying them into manageable choices, and then communicating options to clients in a straightforward and easy-to-understand manner. Curtis's goal is to guide his clients to their desired financial future.
In his free time, Curtis enjoys traveling, water sports, staying fit, and reading. He also enjoys blogging on personal finance issues at smartmoneynation.com.

Biography
As a minister’s son, Jon grew up with a fundamental sense of right and wrong, and a strong respect for ethics and relationships. Pairing his talent, insight and knowledge with a warm, candid personality, he has become a trusted professional for many Atlanta families.Jon entered the financial services industry back in 1985, and he’s advised clients for more than 25 years, in bull and bear markets, doing the work he’s passionate about. In fact, his personal mission statement is “to do all things with integrity and passion, all the while staying connected and committed to my God and my family.”At age 25, Jon was selected by a major financial services company to open and manage its new branch office in Birmingham. A year later, he became a regional manager for that same company in Atlanta. However, Jon soon realized that he wanted to be as independent and unique as the clients he advised. He realized that most large financial services corporations were not always working toward the benefit and best interest of the client.    Keeping this in mind, Jon created JPH Advisory Group, and he became the client-based advisor his clients wanted. Jon knew that only by creating an independent, client-centric firm could he have the time to develop deep relationships with his existing clients and thereby help them create financial success for the long run.Jon has built JPH into a team of like-minded associates, all focused on providing exceptional wealth management advice and guidance. All advisors at JPH listens to their client's goals and objectives, develops a strategy to achieve them, and then help them along the way to implement the plan. They understand that every individual financial decision affects one's whole life, and all this must be coordinated together.Jon and his wife, Christine, are involved parents who understand the importance of passing along their values and sense of ethics to their children. They maintain active roles in their children’s team sports, church, and school. Jon is devoted to making a difference in the lives of others, whether volunteering on a baseball field or working with a client to help them achieve their goals for the future.

Biography
Jason Lina is the Lead Advisor at Resource Planning Group, a Fee-Only Registered Investment Advisory firm that provides wealth management and financial planning solutions. Jason and his team try to ease the workload of busy families by helping with retirement planning, forward-looking tax planning, cash flows, debt prioritization, and getting the children through college. Even though Jason is highly analytical, his clients appreciate the way he simplifies “complex stuff” into real life context in a way they understand. Jason's professional fulfillment comes from guiding clients through financial decisions that really matter so that they can focus on the parts of life that really matter.Jason was an avid golfer in college, ranking 3rd nationally in driving accuracy. The two golfers ahead of him went on to PGA Tour careers. But, less glamorously, Jason spent 3 years completing the program to earn the Chartered Financial Analyst® designation and working as an equity analyst for two large mutual fund companies. He analyzed and projected every line item on corporate financial statements. He spoke with suppliers, merchants and executives. Jason learned way too much about the economics of soft drinks and chip-and-dip markets. Jason knew this career was neither personally gratifying nor did it provide what consumers truly needed. He then completed business school, as well as the certification to become a CFP® professional. He began working directly with families — a much better fit for him.In his early golfing days, the driving range was Jason's second home. With thousands of hours of practice, his consistency in hitting the fairways puts him in a good position to score well on every hole, almost every day. Likewise, financial planning rewards those who intelligently prepare in advance and create favorable probabilities for themselves. His job now is to help families do just that: consistently find the fairway.

Biography
Roy Larsen founded Larsen Wealth Management, LLC in late 2005 with a very clear vision of the kind of firm he wanted to create. After years at a typical Wall Street firm which stressed selling products and shareholder value, Roy first wanted to take the emphasis off of selling products; and second off of the multiple interests of the public company. Thus, Larsen Wealth Management was born offering solutions which focus on the client only and their very specific issues and needs.
Roy has had a love for studying the markets since the age of 18 and has always considered investing more of an art than a science. His investment philosophy blends various forms of fundamental and technical analysis and he uses his keen understanding of highly complex market theories, tools and strategies to create custom asset allocations. Most importantly, he presents this information in a “user friendly” format to his clients free from industry jargon. 
Roy graduated from Temple University and received his BS in Business Administration. He has concentrated his post secondary education on the issues and needs of retirees earning designations from the Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards as a Certified Financial Planner ™ and the College for Financial Planning as an Accredited Asset Management Specialist (AAMS). 
Roy is the former Director of Medicare in Georgia for Aetna which has allowed him to deliver additional value by consulting on health strategies. Roy has also served in the role of educator and taught a class at Clayton State University called “Successful Retirement Living” where he emphasizes the importance of linking wealth, health and estate planning strategies together to ensure all major issues in retirement are in concert. Roy also has written financial columns for local and national publications as well as numerous online outlets. 
A resident of Cumming, Georgia for 19 years, Roy is active in his community. He is past chairman of the Forsyth County Chamber of Commerce Ambassador program and a past member of the Board of Directors for Leadership Forsyth. Roy also served the Citizens Review Panel for the Forsyth County Juvenile Court. Currently he volunteers for the Atlanta Food Bank each month. In his free time, Roy enjoys being a great Dad to his two lovely daughters, playing adult baseball, and acting occasionally in feature films.

Once she understands their vision, she can help them save for their lifestyle. She is frequently quoted sharing her insights on money and life.

Her work history includes firms such as Korn/Ferry International, Northern Trust, Merrill Lynch, and Commerzbank AG. She attained her Certified Financial Planner™ professional designation in 2005. She also holds a Chartered Retirement Planning Counselor℠ designation and a Certified Divorce Financial Analyst® designation.

Whether you need to invest for retirement, your child’s education or for that dream vacation, look to an independent financial consultant from Securities America. When you work with an independent consultant, you can rest assured that the advice and guidance you receive is based on what’s best for YOU, and not because your advisor is hindered by a limited range of products or a corporate mandate dictating what they can sell or do.

We want you to be fully informed when it comes to making investment decisions, and to be aware of how those choices and associated costs may impact you.

The cash balance in your Brokerage Account(s) will be automatically deposited or “swept” into an interest-bearing FDIC-insured Program deposit account. Greater safety and competitive yield on the cash in your investment account – that’s why Securities America created the Bank Deposit Sweep Program, which provides up to $1.5 million maximum cumulative FDIC coverage and a competitive yield with deposits held at a network of multiple banks.

NAVIGATING THE DOL FIDUCIARY RULE

Resources for building better portfolios after the rule
















































 
 
























Select country 


Select country 
























 


Narrow the growth gap in your portfolio








 
What you need to know: 2Q 2017





We see low returns ahead and volatility is likely to increase amid global risks.





A gap exists between the risk-reward relationship investors have come to expect and the outlook for markets.





Investors may need to adapt their portfolios for the new reality to keep their long-term goals on track.











What’s happening: What worked before isn’t likely to work anymore.
After several years of strong returns and relatively low volatility, the U.S. equity rally looks to be tapping the brakes. Investment return expectations are in the low- to mid-single digits for the next five years.* And in a world where political and policy risks abound, there is no lack of potential catalysts for higher volatility.









Where does this leave growth-seeking investors? At a fork in the road.*







Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Index performance is shown for illustrative purposes only. It is not possible to invest directly in an index.






 


Take action: Narrow the gap to keep growth on track
Consider markets with higher return potential — international or emerging markets — using strategies that seek to minimize volatility.

*Left chart source: Bloomberg. As of Sept. 30, 2016. Indexes are unmanaged and used for illustrative purposes only. It is not possible to invest directly in an index. U.S. balanced portfolio consists of 60% S&P 500 Index, 40% BofA/ML Current 10-Year U.S. Treasury Index. Return expectation is calculated using the earnings yield of the S&P 500 and the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield. Right chart source: Callan Associates, cited in the Wall Street Journal, “Pension Funds Pile on Risk to Get a Reasonable Return.” May 2016. Expected return of 7.5% in 1995 based on a portfolio comprised of 100% bonds with standard deviation of 6.0%; in 2005 based on a portfolio comprised of 52% bonds, 20% US large cap stocks, 5% US small cap stocks, 14% non-US stocks, 5% real estate and 4% private equity, with a standard deviation of 8.9%; in 2015 based on a portfolio comprised of 12% bonds, 33% US large cap stocks, 8% US small cap, 22% non-US equity, 13% real estate and 12% private equity, with standard deviation of 17.2%.






Carefully consider the Funds' investment objectives, risk factors, and charges and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the Funds' prospectuses or, if available, the summary prospectuses which may be obtained visiting the iShares ETF and BlackRock Mutual Fund prospectus pages. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.






Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal.






Diversification and asset allocation may not protect against market risk or loss of principal.






International investing involves risks, including risks related to foreign currency, limited liquidity, less government regulation, and the possibility of substantial volatility due to adverse political, economic or other developments. These risks often are heightened for investments in emerging/ developing markets, in concentrations of single countries or smaller capital markets.






There can be no assurance that performance will be enhanced for funds that seek to provide exposure to certain quantitative investment characteristics ("factors"). Exposure to such investment factors may detract from performance in some market environments, perhaps for extended periods. In such circumstances, a fund may seek to maintain exposure to the targeted investment factors and not adjust to target different factors, which could result in losses.






The strategies discussed are strictly for illustrative and educational purposes and should not be construed as a recommendation to purchase or sell, or an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any security. There is no guarantee that any strategies discussed will be effective.






The iShares Minimum Volatility ETFs may experience more than minimum volatility as there is no guarantee that the underlying index's strategy of seeking to lower volatility will be successful.






There is no guarantee that stocks or stock funds will pay dividends.






The Funds are distributed by BlackRock Investments, LLC (together with its affiliates, “BlackRock”).






The iShares Funds are not sponsored, endorsed, issued, sold or promoted by Barclays, Bloomberg Finance L.P., Cohen & Steers Capital Management, Inc., European Public Real Estate Association (“EPRA® ”), FTSE International Limited (“FTSE”), India Index Services & Products Limited, Interactive Data, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Japan Exchange Group, MSCI Inc., Markit Indices Limited, Morningstar, Inc., The NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc., National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”), New York Stock Exchange, Inc., Russell or S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC.

Before investing, consider the funds' investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.







Past performance is no guarantee of future results.



Diversification and asset allocation do not ensure a profit or guarantee against loss.


          * Fidelity's goal is to make financial expertise broadly accessible and effective in helping people live the lives they want. With assets under administration of $5.6 trillion, including managed assets of $2.1 trillion as of September 30, 2016, we focus on meeting the unique needs of a diverse set of customers: helping more than 24 million people invest their own life savings, nearly 20,000 businesses manage employee benefit programs, as well as providing nearly 10,000 advisory firms with technology solutions to invest their own clients' money.
	
    

          1. Fidelity Management & Research Company and Fidelity Institutional Asset Management, as of 9/30/16. Data is unaudited. These figures reflect the resources of Fidelity Management & Research Company, a U.S. company, and its subsidiaries. Research professionals include portfolio managers, research analysts and research associates.
	
    

          2. Highly rated funds are defined as those funds that have a 4- or 5-Star Morningstar rating. For each fund, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar RatingTM metric each month by subtracting the return on a 90-day U.S. Treasury Bill from the fund's load-adjusted return for the same period, and then adjusting this excess return for risk. The top 10% of funds in each broad asset class receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.) Although gathered from reliable sources, data completeness and accuracy cannot be guaranteed by Morningstar.
	
    

          3. You could lose money by investing in a money market fund. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Fidelity Investments and its affiliates, the fund’s sponsor, have no legal obligation to provide financial support to the fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the fund at any time. Fidelity's government and U.S. Treasury money market funds will not impose a fee upon the sale of your shares, nor temporarily suspend your ability to sell shares if the fund's weekly liquid assets fall below 30% of its total assets because of market conditions or other factors.
	
    

          4. You could lose money by investing in a money market fund. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. The fund may impose a fee upon the sale of your shares or may temporarily suspend your ability to sell shares if the Fund's liquidity falls below required minimums because of market conditions or other factors. An investment in the fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Fidelity Investments and its affiliates, the fund's sponsor, have no legal obligation to provide financial support to the fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the fund at any time.


          5. You could lose money by investing in a money market fund. Because the share price of the fund will fluctuate, when you sell your shares they may be worth more or less than what you originally paid for them. The fund may impose a fee upon the sale of your shares or may temporarily suspend your ability to sell shares if the fund's liquidity falls below required minimums because of market conditions or other factors. An investment in the fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Fidelity Investments and its affiliates, the fund's sponsor, have no legal obligation to provide financial support to the fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the fund at any time.


Because of their narrow focus, sector investments tend to be more volatile than investments that diversify across many sectors and companies.


          Foreign securities are subject to interest rate, currency exchange rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.
	
    

The securities of smaller, less well known companies can be more volatile than those of larger companies.


Because of their narrow focus, sector investments tend to be more volatile than investments that diversify across many sectors and companies.


In general, the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk, liquidity risk, call risk, and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a maturity date, so holding them until maturity to avoid losses caused by price volatility is not possible.



Indexes are unmanaged. It is not possible to invest directly in an index.
