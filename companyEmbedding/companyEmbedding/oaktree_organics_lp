Subscription Agreement
 
On the Closing Date, the Issuer and SunOpta Foods entered into the Subscription Agreement with the Oaktree Funds.  Pursuant to the Subscription Agreement, SunOpta Foods issued an aggregate of 85,000 shares of Preferred Shares to the Oaktree Funds for consideration in the amount of $85,000,000 (the Aggregate Proceeds).  The Aggregate Proceeds have been used to prepay a portion of the principal outstanding under SunOpta Foods second lien loan agreement and pay expenses associated with the transaction.
 
The Subscription Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants of the Issuer, SunOpta Foods and the Oaktree Funds, and the parties have agreed to indemnify each other against certain losses resulting from breaches of their respective representations, warranties and covenants.
 
In connection with the Subscription Agreement, on the Closing Date the Issuer and SunOpta Foods, as applicable, also entered into the Investor Rights Agreement, the Observer Agreement, the Exchange and Support Agreement and the Voting Trust Agreement (each as defined below).
 
This summary description of the Subscription Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Subscription Agreement filed with this report as Exhibit 4 and incorporated herein by reference.
 
Preferred Shares
 
In connection with the Subscription Agreement, SunOpta Foods has executed and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware an Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to, among other things, authorize and establish the rights and preferences of the Preferred Shares.  The Preferred Shares are a new class of equity securities that will rank senior to the Common Shares and any other shares junior to the Preferred Shares in the capital of SunOpta Foods with respect to distribution rights and rights upon liquidation.
 
The holders of Preferred Shares (the Holders) will be entitled to receive quarterly distributions (Dividends) on each such share.  The annualized rate of the Dividends will be 8.0% prior to October 5, 2025, and 12.5% thereafter, in each case of $1,000 per share (the Liquidation Preference), subject to certain adjustments.  Prior to October 5, 2025, SunOpta Foods may pay Dividends in cash or elect, in lieu of paying cash, to add the amount that would have been paid to the Liquidation Preference.  On the occurrence of certain events of noncompliance (an Event of Noncompliance), following a 30-day cure period, the rate of Dividends payable will increase by 1.0% quarterly, subject to a maximum increase of 5.0%.  The failure to pay Dividends in cash after October 4, 2025 will be an Event of Noncompliance.
 
At any time the Holders may exchange their Preferred Shares, in whole or in part, for a number of Common Shares equal to, per Preferred Share, the quotient of the Liquidation Preference divided by $7.50 (such price, the Exchange Price and such quotient, the Exchange Rate).  The Exchange Price is subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, including weighted-average adjustment for issuances of Common Shares below the Exchange Price, provided that the Exchange Price may not be lower than $7.00 (subject to adjustment in certain circumstances).
 
SunOpta Foods may cause the Holders to exchange all of the Preferred Shares into a number of Common Shares equal to the number of shares of Preferred Shares outstanding multiplied by the Exchange Rate if (i) fewer than 10% of the Preferred Shares issued on the Closing Date must remain outstanding or (ii) on or after the third anniversary of the Closing Date, the average volume-weighted average price of the Common Shares during the then preceding 20 trading day period must be greater than 200% of the Exchange Price.  Common Shares delivered on an exchange caused by SunOpta Foods must be freely tradable by the Holders under applicable securities laws.
 
At any time on or after the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date, SunOpta Foods may redeem all of the Preferred Shares.  The amount to be paid by the Issuer to the Holders on redemption is an amount, per Preferred Share, equal to the Liquidation Preference.
 
17





 
Upon certain events involving a change of control of the Issuer, SunOpta Foods must use reasonable efforts to provide the Holders with the option to exchange Preferred Shares for a security in the surviving or successor entity that has the same rights, preferences and privileges as the Preferred Shares as adjusted for the change of control.  SunOpta Foods will also offer to redeem the Preferred Shares at an amount per share equal to the greater of (i) the Liquidation Preference plus an amount equal to the value of incremental Dividends through to the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date and (ii) the amount payable per Common Share in such change of control multiplied by the Exchange Rate. Such offer to redeem by SunOpta Foods will be made at an amount per share equal to the Liquidation Preference if the aggregate number of Common Shares delivered in exchange for Preferred Shares exceeds 17,130,757, which is 19.99% of the outstanding Common Shares on the day preceding the Closing Date (such number, Closing Date Shares).  If, following an offer by SunOpta Foods on a change of control, any Preferred Shares are redeemed at a per share price above the Liquidation Preference, the number of Preferred Shares that may thereafter be exchanged for Common Shares must not exceed the Closing Date Shares.
 
At any time if a Holder elects to exchange, or SunOpta Foods causes an exchange of, Preferred Shares, the number of Common Shares delivered to each applicable Holder may not cause such Holders beneficial ownership (as defined in Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) to exceed 19.99% of the Common Shares that would be outstanding immediately following such exchange (the Beneficial Ownership Exchange Cap),  unless the Shareholder Approval has been obtained (as defined below).
 
So long as any Preferred Shares are outstanding, the affirmative vote or consent of the Holders of at least a majority of the outstanding Preferred Shares, voting together as a separate class, will be necessary for effecting or validating: (i) any issuance of stock on parity or senior to the Preferred Shares, (ii) any increase in the issued or authorized amount of Preferred Shares, (iii) any exchange, reclassification or cancellation of the Preferred Shares, except as provided and (iv) any amendment, modification or alteration of, or supplement to, the certificate of incorporation of SunOpta Foods that would materially and adversely affect the rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers of the Preferred Shares or any Holder.
 
This summary description of the terms of the Preferred Shares does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of SunOpta Foods filed with this report as Exhibit 2 and incorporated herein by reference.
 
Investor Rights Agreement
 
In connection with the Subscription Agreement, the Issuer, SunOpta Foods and the Oaktree Funds entered into the Investor Rights Agreement dated October 7, 2016 providing for certain additional rights and obligations of the Oaktree Funds.
 
Pursuant to the Investor Rights Agreement, for so long as the Oaktree Funds beneficially own or control at least 50% of the Preferred Shares issued on the Closing Date, including any corresponding Common Shares into which such Preferred Shares are exchanged, the Oaktree Funds will be entitled to:
 
(a)                                 participation rights with respect to future equity offerings of the Issuer; and
 
(b)                                 governance rights, including the right to approve certain actions proposed to be taken by the Issuer and its subsidiaries, as more particularly set out in the Investor Rights Agreement.
 
The Oaktree Funds will be entitled to designate two nominees (each an Investor Nominee) for election to the board of directors of the Issuer (the Board) for so long as the Oaktree Funds beneficially own or control at least 11.1% of the Common Shares, on an as-exchanged basis.  If the Oaktree Funds beneficially own or control less than 11.1% but more than 5% of the Common Shares, on an as-exchanged basis, they shall be entitled to designate one Investor Nominee.  Each Investor Nominee must be an individual acceptable to the Issuer, acting reasonably, and eligible to serve as a director of the Issuer pursuant to applicable Law.  In addition, for so long as the Oaktree Funds beneficially own or control at least 5% of the Common Shares, on an as-exchanged basis, the Oaktree Funds have the right to designate one individual (and one alternate) to attend meetings of the Board as a non-voting observer (the Observer);
 
The initial Investor Nominees are Dean Hollis and Albert D. Bolles, and were appointed as directors of the Issuer on October 7, 2016.
 
The Oaktree Funds have also been granted certain registration rights relating to the registered resale of Common Shares issuable or deliverable upon exchange of the Preferred Shares and certain Common Shares which may be purchased in the market or privately by the Oaktree Funds subject to limitations set forth in the Investor Rights Agreement (Registrable Shares).  Pursuant to the Investor Rights Agreement, the Issuer is required to file a registration statement or prospectus, as
 
18





 
applicable, covering Registrable Shares that the Oaktree Funds request to be registered from time to time, but not more than twice in any 12-month period and subject to certain additional conditions set out in the Investor Rights Agreement.  In certain circumstances, the Oaktree Funds will have piggyback registration rights on offerings initiated by the Issuer.  The registration rights granted to the Oaktree Funds pursuant to the Investor Rights Agreement terminate on the first day following the date on which the direct or indirect ownership interest of the Oaktree Funds of Common Shares on an as-exchanged basis is less than 5%.
 
Pursuant to the Investor Rights Agreement, the Oaktree Funds have agreed to a standstill with respect to the acquisition of additional securities of the Issuer, subject to certain exceptions.  Such exceptions include (a) pursuant to an agreement with the Issuer and the consent of the Board, acquiring Common Shares pursuant to a formal tender offer or take-over bid, which when aggregated with the existing Common Shares beneficially owned or controlled by the Oaktree Funds, on an as-exchanged basis, does not exceed 27% of the outstanding Common Shares, on a partially diluted basis and (b) the ability of the Oaktree Funds to purchase up to 3,000,000 Common Shares on the market or in private transactions within 12 months of the Closing Date without the prior written consent of the Issuer.  The standstill continues until the later of (a) 24 months following the Closing Date and (b) 12 months following the later of the date on which (i) no Investor Nominee serves on the Board and (ii) the governance rights referred to above are terminated.  The Oaktree Funds have also agreed to a lock-up that prohibits them from selling Preferred Shares or Common Shares issuable upon exchange of the Preferred Shares prior to April 7, 2018, subject to certain exceptions.
 
Pursuant to the Investor Rights Agreement, the Oaktree Funds may request that the Issuer seek to obtain approval by the shareholders of the Issuer of a resolution to (i) remove the Beneficial Ownership Exchange Cap, (ii) remove the Voting Cap (as defined below under Special Voting Shares and Voting Trust Agreement) and (iii) waive the application of the Issuers shareholder rights plan to the acquisition by the Oaktree Funds of beneficial ownership of the Special Voting Shares and Common Shares issued on exchange of the Preferred Shares (collectively, the Shareholder Approval).
 
In connection with the designation of the Observer pursuant to the Investor Rights Agreement, on October 7, 2016, the Issuer also entered into a board observer and confidentiality agreement (the Observer Agreement) with the Observer providing for certain rights and obligations of the Observer as a non-voting observer of the Board.
 
This summary description of the Investor Rights Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Investor Rights Agreement filed with this report as Exhibit 5  and incorporated herein by reference.
 
Exchange and Support Agreement
 
In connection with the Subscription Agreement, the Issuer, SunOpta Foods and the Oaktree Funds entered into an exchange and support agreement dated October 7, 2016 (the Exchange and Support Agreement), providing for, among other things, the grant by the Issuer to each Holder, from time to time, of the right to exchange such Preferred Shares with the Issuer for Common Shares.
 
This summary description of the Exchange and Support Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Exchange and Support Agreement filed with this report as Exhibit 6 and incorporated herein by reference.
 
Special Voting Shares and Voting Trust Agreement
 
On October 7, 2016, the Issuer filed Articles of Amendment to designate a series of special shares as Special Shares, Series 1 (the Special Voting Shares).  The Special Voting Shares entitle the holder thereof to one vote per Special Voting Share on all matters submitted to a vote of the holders of Common Shares, together as a single class, subject to certain exceptions.
 
In connection with the Subscription Agreement, 11,333,333 Special Voting Shares were issued to and deposited with an affiliate of the Oaktree Funds (the Trustee), as trustee for and on behalf of the Oaktree Funds and their affiliates that may hold the Preferred Shares from time to time pursuant to a voting trust agreement dated October 7, 2016 (the Voting Trust Agreement) between the Issuer, SunOpta Foods, the Oaktree Funds and the Trustee.  Pursuant to the Voting Trust Agreement, additional Special Voting Shares will be issued, or existing Special Voting Shares shall be redeemed, as necessary to ensure that the aggregate number of Special Voting Shares outstanding is equal to the number of Preferred Shares outstanding from time to time multiplied by the quotient obtained by dividing the Liquidation Preference at such time by the Exchange Price in effect at such time (subject to adjustment in certain circumstances), subject to certain restrictions.

Oaktree Acquires Additional Securities of SunOpta in Q2 2017 | Business Wire


























































Oaktree Acquires Additional Securities of SunOpta in Q2 2017






June 21, 2017 04:30 PM Eastern Daylight Time



LOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oaktree Capital Management, L.P. ("Oaktree"), a leading 
      global alternative investment management firm, announced today that 
      funds managed by Oaktree (the "Investors") have increased 
      their beneficial ownership in common shares (the "Common Shares") 
      of SunOpta Inc. ("SunOpta") during the second quarter of 
      2017.
    

      On May 12, 2017, the Investors acquired 1,392,699 Common Shares in the 
      aggregate through the facilities of the NASDAQ exchange, at a price of 
      US$8.00 per share.
    

      Following such acquisition, the Investors now beneficially own an 
      aggregate of: (i) 4,392,699 Common Shares that they acquired through the 
      facilities of the NASDAQ exchange; and (ii) 85,000 Series A preferred 
      shares (the "Preferred Shares") of SunOpta Foods, Inc., a 
      subsidiary of SunOpta, which were acquired in connection with the 
      previously announced private placement transaction completed on October 
      7, 2016 (the "Private Placement").
    

      The Preferred Shares are currently exchangeable into 11,333,333 Common 
      Shares, representing approximately 11.64% of the outstanding Common 
      Shares on a partially diluted basis (excluding all other securities 
      convertible or exchangeable into Common Shares). Taken together with the 
      4,392,699 Common Shares acquired through the facilities of the NASDAQ 
      exchange, the Investors beneficially own an aggregate of 15,726,032 
      Common Shares on an as-exchanged basis, representing approximately 
      16.16% of the outstanding Common Shares on a partially diluted basis 
      (excluding all other securities convertible or exchangeable into Common 
      Shares).
    

      The Investors acquired the Common Shares and the Preferred Shares for 
      investment purposes, and the Investors intend to continuously 
      evaluate the businesses and prospects of SunOpta and its subsidiaries, 
      alternative investment opportunities and all other factors deemed 
      relevant in determining whether additional securities of SunOpta will be 
      acquired by the Investors or by other accounts or funds associated with 
      the Investors, or whether the Investors or any such other accounts or 
      funds will dispose of the Preferred Shares or Common Shares. At any 
      time, subject to the limitations set forth in the definitive agreements 
      entered into in connection with the Private Placement, additional 
      securities of SunOpta or its subsidiaries may be acquired or some or all 
      of the securities beneficially owned by the Investors may be sold, in 
      either case in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions or 
      otherwise, including, without limitation, by electing to exchange 
      Preferred Shares into Common Shares, or by increasing or decreasing 
      holdings in Preferred Shares or in Common Shares.
    

      An early warning report with additional information in respect of the 
      foregoing matters has been filed and made available on the System for 
      Electronic Document Analysis and Review (SEDAR) at www.sedar.com 
      under SunOpta's issuer profile. The Investors are Oaktree Organics, L.P. 
      and Oaktree Huntington Investment Fund II, L.P. In order to obtain a 
      copy of the early warning report, you may also contact Alyssa Linn of

Forward-Looking Information


      Certain statements in the press release are forward-looking statements

      results to differ materially from the future results expressed or 
      implied by the forward-looking statements. Such statements are qualified 
      in their entirety by the inherent risks and uncertainties surrounding 
      future expectations. Such forward-looking statements should therefore be 
      construed in light of such factors, and Oaktree is not under any 
      obligation, and expressly disclaims any intention or obligation, to 
      update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of 
      new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by 
      applicable law.

SunOpta Announces Strategic Partnership with Oaktree


Secures $85 Million Equity Investment


Company Appoints Three Independent Directors to the SunOpta Board

 TORONTO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--

      SunOpta Inc. ("SunOpta") (Nasdaq:STKL) (TSX:SOY), a leading global

      company focused on organic, non-genetically modified and specialty

      foods, today announced that it has entered into an agreement with funds

      managed by Oaktree Capital Management, L.P. ("Oaktree"), a leading

      global alternative investment management firm. Oaktree is an experienced

      investor in the consumer and retail industry, with a track record of

      driving growth in complex consumer businesses, including AdvancePierre

      Foods, Campofrío Food Group and Diamond Foods. In reaching this

      agreement with Oaktree, SunOpta has concluded the previously announced

      review of strategic alternatives for the Company.

    


      Under the agreement, Oaktree invested $85 million in SunOpta in the form

      of exchangeable preferred shares. Proceeds from the investment have been

      used to reduce the Company's 2nd lien debt and to increase financial

      flexibility.

    


      In partnership with representatives of Oaktree and with representatives

      of Engaged Capital (SunOpta's second largest shareholder), SunOpta is

      conducting a thorough review of the Company's operations, management and

      governance, with the objective of maximizing the Company's ability to

      deliver long-term value to its shareholders. The Company expects to

      provide an update on these efforts in conjunction with the Company's

      third quarter earnings release, along with an updated mid-range plan

      which will include performance improvements and cost savings to be

      realized in 2017.

    


      As announced on June 27, 2016, the SunOpta Board of Directors hired

      independent financial and legal advisors to support a review of the

      Company's operating plan and evaluate a complete range of strategic and

      financial actions that SunOpta could undertake to maximize shareholder

      value. This review was comprehensive in its evaluation of all potential

      alternatives.

    


      "After concluding a comprehensive review of strategic and financial

      alternatives, we are excited to have a partner in Oaktree that truly

      appreciates SunOpta's unique position in the market and the potential

      value that can be created for all our shareholders through performance

      improvement and accelerated growth," said Alan Murray, Chairman of the

      Board of SunOpta. "Given Oaktree's deep industry knowledge and

      operational expertise, we believe they are the ideal partner for SunOpta

      as we seek to strengthen the company's operations in a way that can

      reduce operational volatility and realize sustainable growth and value

      creation. We believe this strategic option provides the highest risk

      adjusted return from the many options available and evaluated by the

      Board."

    


      "With its strong and diverse portfolio of products and having recently

      undergone a period of significant investment in the business, we believe

      SunOpta has a substantial opportunity for growth in the rapidly

      expanding market for healthy and organic foods," said Matt Wilson,

      Managing Director and Co-Portfolio Manager of Oaktree. "SunOpta is a

      natural fit for Oaktree given our experience in the consumer and food

      industries, and we see a significant opportunity to provide strategic,

      operational and financial support that will accelerate the Company's

      value-enhancing initiatives and position it for long-term success."

    


      In concert with today's announcement, SunOpta is also announcing

      significant enhancements to the Company's corporate governance. First,

      the Board of Directors has appointed two Oaktree-nominated independent

      directors, Dean Hollis and Al Bolles, Ph.D., to the Board. Both

      appointees bring extensive sector experience. Mr. Hollis is a Senior

      Advisor at Oaktree with highly relevant sector experience as the

      Chairman of the Board of AdvancePierre Foods and the former President

      and Chief Operating Officer of the Consumer Foods Division of ConAgra

      Foods and former Chairman of Boulder Brands. Mr. Bolles has demonstrated

      leadership across multiple organizations in global innovation, research

      and development and supply chain management, most recently as the former

      Executive Vice President, Chief Technology & Operations Officer of

      ConAgra Foods. Additionally, the Board has also appointed Brendan

      Springstubb of Engaged Capital to the Board. Engaged Capital is the

      Company's second-largest shareholder and has extensive investment

      experience in the healthy living industry. The Board has committed to a

      further review of governance and leadership with a particular focus on

      continuing to add independent directors with significant operating and

      supply chain expertise in the food industry. The Board would expect to

      announce additional changes shortly. Concurrent with these appointments,

      Douglas Greene, a pioneer in the natural foods industry who has served

      on the SunOpta board for eight years, has resigned from the Board,

      effective today.

    


      "On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank Doug for all his hard

      work over the years and his dedication to SunOpta," said Alan Murray.

      "We would also like to welcome Dean, Al and Brendan to the Board. The

      company will benefit greatly from their respective industry and capital

      markets experience and we look forward to their contributions."

    

Oaktree is investing in the company by purchasing $85 million of newly

      created Series A exchangeable preferred shares issued by SunOpta Foods

      Inc. (the "Series A Preferred") as well as the right to purchase up to 3

      million shares of SunOpta common stock in the open market for a period

      of one year. The Series A Preferred is immediately exchangeable into

      shares of the Company's common stock at an initial exchange price of

      $7.50 per share and pays a cumulative dividend of 8% per year that may

      be paid-in-kind or cash at SunOpta's option. This exchange price

      represents a 80.3% premium to the closing price of US$4.16 per share on

      June 24, 2016, the day before the strategic review was announced, and a

      12.1% premium to the 60-day average closing price of US$6.69 per share.

      The Series A Preferred cumulative dividend will increase from 8% per

      year to 12.5% beginning in the tenth year. The agreement also entitles

      Oaktree to designate two nominees for election to SunOpta's Board of

      Directors. Oaktree will be entitled to vote the Series A Preferred with

      the common shares on an as-exchanged basis. The Series A Preferred

      constitute on an as-exchanged basis a partially diluted ownership level

      of approximately 11.7% of the company. Currently, Oaktree's ownership is

      subject to a 19.99% cap under the agreement unless and until shareholder

      approval is obtained to remove the cap.

    


      Additional information regarding the investment will be included in a

      Form 8-K to be filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange

      Commission. In connection with the transaction, SunOpta intends to rely

      on the exemption set forth in Section 602.1 of the TSX Company Manual

      which provides that the TSX will not apply certain of its requirements

      to issuers whose shares are listed on another recognized stock exchange

      such as the Nasdaq.

    

Rothschild Inc. is acting as financial advisor to SunOpta and Davies

      Ward Phillips & Vineberg LLP and Stoel Rives are acting as its legal

      advisors. Oaktree is represented by Kirkland & Ellis LLP and Stikeman

      Elliott LLP.
