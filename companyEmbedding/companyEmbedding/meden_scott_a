Nordstrom announced Monday two changes to its executive team. Scott Meden will take the reins as executive vice president and chief marketing officer, while Kristin Frossmo has been named executive vice president of the shoe division.
Meden replaces Brian Dennehy, who left the company recently. According to a company statement, Dennehy’s departure was a mutual decision.

Speaking of Meden, co-president Pete Nordstrom said, “Through Scott’s 31-year history with Nordstrom, he’s had an impressive breadth of experiences and success as both a great leader and merchant. His deep knowledge of our business and retail will play an integral role in helping us to better leverage our marketing efforts. He understands the brand DNA of Nordstrom and our commitment to serving customers as well as, if not better than, anyone.”

Frossmo has been with the company for 28 years, covering various positions throughout the shoes division.
“Kristin’s great diversity of experience over her past 28 years here at Nordstrom and the fact that she has worked in almost every area of our shoes division make her well-suited for this position, which supports one of our most important and brand-defining divisions in the company. 
“From buying to merchandising, to store management and our private label group, her extensive knowledge of our business, product and taking care of the customer will serve Nordstrom well,” said Nordstrom.
