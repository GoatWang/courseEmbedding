Intrawest Resort Holdings - Will Investors Be Left In The Cold? - Intrawest Resorts Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:SNOW) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Intrawest Resort Holdings - Will Investors Be Left In The Cold?Mar.14.17 | About: Intrawest Resorts (SNOW) WestPeak Research Association Value, Growth, long/short equity, long onlyWestPeak Research AssociationSummaryGrowth is dependent on the success of off-season operations at Intrawest's resorts.As Intrawest's revenues are dependent on snowfall, climate change poses a real threat to the company.Given the uncertainty of future weather conditions and the success of the company's summer operations, we believe Intrawest Resorts is currently fairly valued.Analyst: Adam Velji, BCom '19 Uncertainty Surrounding Summer Operations Justifies Market's Valuation While Intrawest Resort Holdings (NYSE:SNOW) has successful winter operations - from their mountain and adventure segment - their yearly performance is regularly depleted due to the seasonality of their business. However, Intrawest is well positioned to invest more in their summer operations due to the recent sale of Intrawest Resort Club Gro up, which unlocked capital for the company. If Intrawest could successfully implement an established summer business, they would have the opportunity to reduce seasonality, and increase their summer earnings. However, due to stiff competition during the summer, climate change, and the capital intensity, it could be a hard task for company, which provides uncertainty for consistent future growth. Valuation & Recommendation We determined a weighted target share price of $25.50 on Intrawest Resort Holdings. Using our implied DCF share price and our average EV/EBITDA multiple, we decided to weight the stock 70% and 30% respectively. Due to significant risks within the industry such as climate change, competition, and capital intensity versus the ability for the company to grow its summer operations, we think the market is pricing the stock fairly; therefore, we decided to place a hold rating. Business Overview/Fundamentals Business Overview Intrawest is a mountain resort, adventure, and real estate development company. The company operates within these three segments with mountain resorts making up most of their business. This segment operates and maintains six wholly owned mountain resorts throughout North America. The adventure segment focuses on the operation of Canadian Mountain Holidays (CMH), which provides heli-skiing services, while the real estate division consists of development and real estate operations.
 Intrawest is based out of Delaware, Colorado and was previously known as Intrawest Caymans L.P., before going public on January 30th, 2014. The company provides customers with over 8000 skiable acres from the mountain segment, approximately 3.0 million tenured acres from the adventure segment, and 1120 acres of land held for real estate development. Mountain Segment Intrawest's mountain segment includes the operations of their ski resorts and lodges located throughout several cities in North America. They wholly own and operate six of their four-season resorts which include a total of 8000 skiable acres of land which are geographically diversified across major ski regions which include the Eastern United States, the Rocky Mountains, and Eastern Canada. Intrawest has located their ski resorts with an average proximity of 160 miles (257 kilometers) around major urban markets, which include high concentrations of beginner to affluent snowboarders and skiers. These major areas include: New York City, Boston, Washington, Denver, Pittsburgh, Montreal, and Toronto. 

 Steamboat Ski Resort is located in the Rocky Mountains 157 miles west from Denver, Colorado and has been operating since 1963. The town of Steamboat Springs has a long heritage of winter sports and is known for its powder snow. As of January 6th, 2017, the total accumulated snowfall at Steamboat is 411cm (162in). This is an increase compared to approximately 309cm (122in) during the same period last year. Steamboat has 2965 skiable acres with a maximum vertical drop of 3668 feet. During the summer, Steamboat also has a golf course, mountain bike trail, and an adventure zone. 


 Winter Park Resort is located in the Rocky Mountains 67 miles west from Denver, Colorado and has been operating since 1939. Winter Park is one of the closest resorts to Denver's 3.0 million urban population. As of January 6th, 2017, the total cumulative snowfall at Winter Park is 381cm (150in); this is slightly more compared to approximately 363cm (142in) during the same time last year. Winter Park Resort has more than 3000 skiable acres and a maximum vertical drop of 3060 feet. Winter Park also offers a range of summer amenities, which include a rock climbing wall, putting green, spas, and adventure zones. 

 Mont Tremblant Resort is located in Quebec, Canada within a few hours' drive from Montreal and Ottawa and has been operating since 1939. As of January 6th, 2017, Mont Tremblant has a cumulative snowfall of 286cm (112in); this is compared to 120cm (47in) at approximately the same time last year. Mont Tremblant has a total of 600 skiable acres of land with a vertical drop of 2116 feet and snowmaking on 70% of trails. In the summer, Mont Tremblant plays host to an 18-hole golf course and mountain bike trails. 

 Blue Mountain Ski Resort is located in Ontario, Canada, which is 90 miles (144km) northeast of Toronto's 6.0 million urban population and has been operating since 1941. As of January 6th, 2017 Blue Mountain has a cumulative snowfall 146cm (57in) compared to 35cm (14in) at approximately the same time last year. The resort contains 360 skiable acres of land with 93% of its trails operating snowmaking machines. Blue Mountain Resort operates a conference center in addition to summer amenities, which include an 18-hole golf course, an adventure and water park, and mountain bike trails.
 

 Stratton Mountain Resort has been operating since 1961 and is located in Southern Vermont with a close proximity to New York City and Boston. Two months into the season, Stratton has 216cm (85in) of snowfall compared to 84cm (33in) during approximately the same time last year. They also have 333 acres of skiable terrain of which 93% has operating snowmaking machines. Stratton summer amenities include a 27-hole golf course, golf school, and sports and tennis complex. 

 Snowshoe Mountain Resort has been operating since 1974 and is located in West Virginia and primarily attracts visitors from Pittsburgh, Baltimore, and the Washington D.C. area. As of January 6th, 2017, Snowshoe has a cumulative snowfall of 76cm (30in) compared to approximately 23cm (9in) during the same time last year. Snowshoe has 155 skiable acres with a vertical drop of 1500 feet. The resort contains a village, which offers guests with a variety of dining, nightlife, and retail options. 

 (Source: SEC Filings) On a yearly average, close to 75% of Intrawest's revenue comes from their mountain operations. This revenue comprises of many elements, which may include items such as lift, lodging, and ski school revenues. In Intrawest's 2016 fiscal year, it was reported that 43% of the $421M in revenue derived from mountain operations came from lift activities. This includes the sale of lift tickets, season passes, and other items and packages.
 Adventure Segment 

 (Source: SEC Filings) The adventure segment is mainly focused on the operations of Canadian Mountain Holiday (CMH), which is a heli-skiing adventure company based out of Canada. The business currently operates in the Purcell, Selkirk, Monashee, and Cariboo mountains in eastern British Columbia from 11 lodges, 9 of which Intrawest owns. The company also plans on building another lodge to increase their capacity in order to meet demands. The lodges provide visitors with approximately 3.0 million skiable acres, which is granted under 10 and 30-year renewable licenses from British Columbia. Historically, most of CMH customers are repeat customers mainly coming from Canada and the United States. However, customers also come from Europe and other countries throughout the world. During off peak seasons, CMH offers a variety of summer adventure packages, which include heli hiking, rock climbing, and other lodging experiences. Intrawest also owns 36 helicopters in addition to operating Alpine Aerotech L.P., which is a helicopter repair, maintenance, and overhaul business. In addition to servicing Intrawest's own fleet of helicopters, Alpine Aerotech also caters their business to 500 customers throughout the world. Intrawest also leases their helicopters during the summer period in order to combat against wildfire disasters. As a whole, the adventure segment has contributed a total of 18% of Intrawest's revenue during the 2016 fiscal year. Real Estate Segment Intrawest's real estate segment includes the operations of real estate management, marketing and sales, in addition to real estate development activities. The segment includes Intrawest Hospitality Management (IHM), Playground, and Intrawest Resort Club Group (IRCG) before the sale of that business on January 29th, 2016.
 IHM manages hotel condominium properties throughout North America and focuses on providing management services to properties owned by third parties. Those third party resorts include Honua Kai Resort and Spa in Maui, Hawaii and the Westin Monache Resort at Mammoth Lakes, California. Playground acts as a real estate sales and marketing business for Intrawest's development projects. The brand is used in resale and brokerage operations at Intrawest resorts. Intrawest hopes to use playground to provide sales and marketing expertise for the properties they develop surrounding the land of their resorts. IRCG develops, sells, and manages a points-based timeshare vacation club called Club Intrawest. Club Intrawest was sold to Diamond Resorts International in which Intrawest profited from a $40.4 million gain. The transaction included all of nine Club Intrawest sites, which are located throughout Canada, the United States, and Mexico. Without having to spend capital on operating IRCG, we think Intrawest can now allocate more funds towards their mountain and adventure segment in the future. In the 2016 fiscal year, the real estate segment accounted for 7% of Intrawest's total revenue. 

 M.A.X. Pass Multi Resort Product The M.A.X. pass is a season pass created by Intrawest, Powdr, and Boyne Resorts that provides pass holders with the opportunity to gain access to 39 different resorts across North America. Pass holders will obtain 5 days at each of those resorts and will not be limited to any blackout periods. The pass costs $749 for adults, $549 for teenagers, $449 for youth, and $59 for children. Intrawest credits the pass with providing strong growth towards lift revenues as all of Intrawest's six resorts can be accessed with the pass. The M.A.X pass also helps to reduce risk as a majority of sales occur before the start of the ski season which protect Intrawest from uncertain weather conditions.
 Growth Strategy Historically, Intrawest has experienced stagnant growth over the last five years. On average, the company has achieved 3% annual growth in revenues, with the 11% increase between the 2014 and 2015 fiscal years contributing significantly to that figure. This was mostly caused by good weather conditions at Intrawest resorts, which caused visitation rates to increase from 3.41M visitors to 4.19M visitors. However, Intrawest felt a slight decrease in revenue during their 2016 fiscal year mostly contributed from a third quarter decrease in revenue from their mountain segment compared to 2015 fiscal figures. 

 (Source: SEC Filings) Looking into the fiscal 2016 quarters, Intrawest experiences most of their earnings during Q3. This is mainly because of optimal weather conditions that attract customers to Intrawest's mountain resorts and CMH. Conversely, due to poor ski conditions during Q1 and Q4, Intrawest often produces lower earnings during those seasons of the year. Historically, this has been the case for Intrawest and has forced the company to think beyond just winter operations. 

 (Source: SEC Filings) In the future, Intrawest expects to grow their operations and increase their earnings during off snow seasons by growing the amount of summer amenities available at their resorts. They have integrated this strategy at both Steamboat and Winter Park Resorts. Both resorts accompanied with adventure zones, golfing, mountain biking, water sports, rock climbing, villages, and other experiences and activities.
 Most recently, Intrawest has developed their blue mountain summer amenities and plans to expand their Mont Tremblant resort. Because Intrawest has seen success with the new integration of summer amenities, their plan to grow their summer operations organically could reduce to seasonality of the business; however, they do face significant competition. We believe Intrawest's investment into their summer operations is vital for the growth of the business as the threat of climate change and unpredictable weather conditions will continue to provide volatility for their winter operations. A lack of snowfall could significantly hurt Intrawest winter operations, which could hurt their future growth as that is when the company earns most of their revenue. However, aside from investment into summer operations, we think Intrawest could grow their earnings with inorganic growth through acquisitions, and investment into their snow-making capabilities. A future acquisition could help geographically diversify Intrawest's resort portfolio, which would protect it from poor regional weather conditions, while greater snow-making capabilities will produce snow for less optimal conditions. We feel that for this season, the number of visitation rates will increase due to optimal conditions that have been experienced at Intrawest resorts. However, due to risks such as climate change, competition, and the seasonality of the business, we feel that future revenues could be volatile in the few years after this season. Nevertheless, we do believe Intrawest management will adapt to the effects of climate change and competition by increasing investment into summer and winter operations, which in turn could increase future revenues. The Macro Environment Industry Overview 


 Intrawest operates in a mature, highly competitive industry with a significant level of capital intensity. Historically, mountain resorts have felt modest growth in the last five years, despite unpredictable weather conditions. According to IBISWorld, the North American ski and snowboard industry has generated $3.56B in revenue and has grown at a rate 1.3% and 2.2% in Canada and the United States respectively. The North American industry is expected to grow at an annualized rate of 1.2% in the next five years until 2021. This is mainly due to the threat of climate change that may have a negative impact on the industry as a whole. In Canada, a lower growth rate could be expected as the Canadian dollar is in a volatile state. 

 (Source: IBISWorld.com) 

 (Source: IBISWorld.com) Although many domestic travelers may be attracted to visit mountain resorts, international travelers may be less inclined to come overseas into Canada because the Canadian dollar may be unstable against their currency. However, an expected increase in per capita disposable income and the ability of large corporations such as Intrawest and Vail (NYSE:MTN) to enjoy greater economies of scale will help the industry grow at a steady rate. Demand for ski and snowboard services are seasonal and greatly dependent on weather conditions. Resorts earn a significant portion of their annual revenue during the periods between November to April. Unfavourable weather conditions would cause the demand for these services to decrease which could have a severe impact on annual revenue. The present state of economic conditions in addition to the amount of available leisure time are also demand determinants for the industry.
 Concentration in the industry is also very high with only four firms making up 69.4% of the U.S. market. With that being said, we think these companies will be able to expand their operations as they will have the capability to acquire many of the smaller companies that make up the rest of the market. There are also significant barriers to entry for the industry due to land and government restrictions. The amount of private land there is to successfully build a ski resort is often limited and secluded from large towns and main travel roads. For public land, getting provincial/state or federal approval is difficult although it is possible to lease land in the form of renewable permits or licenses from the government. However, these permits often come with many environmental regulations and supervision of development of the resort. Developing mountain resorts also requires vast capital investments, with the probability that it may take a few years to make a return. Small firms looking to enter this market may not be able to withstand the capital requirements compared with larger firms, which have access to more financing and the capital markets. External Drivers The mountain resort industry is led by certain external economic scenarios that drive revenue for the company. These drivers include: leisure time, per capita disposable income, and international travel. The amount of leisure time available is an important factor because it provides an illustration of how much time an individual can allocate towards vacations and time off. When the amount of leisure time increases, the more likely an individual would take time off to go ski. Historically, the hours per day per capita has remained steady in Canada and the United States at approximately 5.8 hours and 5.2 hours per day per capita respectively. Forecasts for the future indicate that these levels will remain the same due to low unemployment rates and more leisure time allocated towards the elderly. 


 (Source: IBISWorld.com) Per capita disposable income is also an important measure in the mountain resort industry as it determines an individual's ability to purchase goods and services. The more income an individual has after tax and other dues, the more they have to spend on other items such as holidays, which could translate into more spending at a ski resort. In the United States, per capita disposable income is expected to grow at an average of 1.96% per year until 2021, whereas in Canada, it is expected to increase at an average rate of 2.64% per year until 2021. This is slightly higher than their 1.6% and 2.1% historical averages respectively. The amount of inbound travel made by international individuals is also a key driver for mountain resorts as many visitors often live overseas. In Canada, this number of inbound trips has been increasing at an annualized rate of 3.4%. However, this number is expected to decrease at an annualized rate of -1.7% for the next five years. This is due to the strength of the Canadian dollar against other major currencies, which make it more expensive for international travelers to visit Canada. In the United States, inbound travel by internationals has been increasing at an annualized rate of 4.5% over the last five years, and will continue to grow at an annualized rate of 4.0% over the next five years. Climate Change Climate change is continuing to be a major threat to the planet as there is increasing evidence that human emitted greenhouse gas emissions are the core reason for rising temperatures and unpredictable weather conditions. The effects of global climate change are causing temperatures to rise, sea levels to increase, declining arctic ice, warming oceans, glacier retreat, decreasing snow coverage, and more. Historically, over the period of 1948 to 2013, the average temperature in Canada has risen by 1.6 degrees Celsius. According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the average temperature is expected to increase by 5 degrees Celsius by 2100. The agency also states that temperatures are expected to rise more on land, rather than over the ocean, and the level of precipitation is expected to decrease which would impact the level of snowfall. We believe this would have an extremely negative impact to the mountain resort industry, as a significant portion of their revenues are derived from their lift operations.
 In the past, seasons without significant snowfall generated losses for mountain resorts and often make customers skeptical on future conditions, which have delayed them from buying season passes. If temperatures continue to increase, the level of snowfall is expected to decrease, which in turn would cause mountain resorts to earn less revenue. Mountain resorts are taking part in many initiatives to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, in addition to educating their customers on more sustainable environmental practices. Many resorts have set goals to make renewable energy purchases in the future, in addition to using biofuels and renewable energy sources as well as promoting public transportation and recycling. In the future, we feel that Intrawest should be increasing their capital expenditures to include a higher percentage of snow-making machines. This will enable Intrawest to produce an adequate amount of snow during seasons with unpredictable snowfall. New integrations of renewable energy sources will also allow Intrawest to reduce their operating expenses in the long term, while also reducing their carbon footprint. Competitors The industry in which Intrawest operates in is highly competitive, and is forecasted to continue being competitive into the future. In Canada, the main competitors Intrawest faces are Whistler Blackcomb, which was recently acquired by Vail Resorts, as well as other smaller and local resorts, which include Revelstoke, Banff, Big White, and others. In the United States, the competition is fiercer with four of the largest operators controlling approximately 70% of the market. Those operators include, Vail Resorts, Boyne Resorts, Intrawest, Powdr, and other small operators.

 (Source: IBISWorld.com) As there are strong barriers to entry for the industry, the likelihood that new operators will join the market is highly unlikely. However, competitors have to pay close attention to the moves of each other to gain a competitive advantage. Resorts can do this by having effective cost control measures, obtaining economies of scale, being located close to major urban cities, and increasing the number of snow-making machines throughout their resort trails. As the industry typically has high fixed costs, a resort that can conduct a more efficient way of doing business, and lower their costs could increase margins. Keeping these factors in mind, Intrawest fares particularly well against their competitors. This is because the company is located in many key markets such as Denver, New York, Boston, and Toronto. They also have snow-making machines on 93% of their trails at their resorts with more risk to unpredictable weather changes. However, we think that Intrawest could be more competitive in the industry by decreasing their costs as approximately 80% of the company's revenue is used towards operating expenses. We believe this could be done by further investment into renewable energy resources, which would be more cost efficient in the future. Furthermore, Intrawest's investment into their technology and data analytics capabilities could also prove to decrease the amount of SG&A used to obtain and handle clients of the resorts. Intrawest should also increase the coverage of their snow-making capabilities at all of their resorts as a precaution towards unpredictable weather conditions and climate change. Because it is harder for companies to build new resorts from the ground up due to regulation and high capital commitments, firms usually try to gain an advantage by acquiring small operators that are close to key markets to achieve economies of scale. Also, due to the risk of climate change or unpredictable weather conditions, firms that invest more in snow-making capabilities will be able to operate more efficiently during these periods.
 Although mountain resorts face aggressive competition within their own industry, they also have external competitors, which reside in other industries. This is because there is a variety of other leisure activities individuals can decide to take part in besides visiting a mountain resort. These competitors include but are not limited to: casinos, golf clubs, adventure parks, movie theaters, cruise lines, and hotels. Economic Moats The most significant economic moat for the industry is a barrier to entry. This is due to the intense regulation and capital commitments required to develop a new resort. The amount of private land available for development is often away from major key markets, and secluded from main roads. Furthermore, gaining approval for resort development by the government is extremely difficult and comes with strict supervision, and environmental regulation. For new entrants, the amount of capital required to start developing a resort can also be overwhelming, especially due to the continuous cost of having to fund capital expenditures which could include maintenance and restoration. Smaller operators could potentially enter the market by acquiring resorts that have already been developed. However, they may not be able to withstand the length of time it takes to make a profitable return on a resort. They also face fierce competition from larger operators that have allocated funds towards acquisitions, and have other resorts in their portfolio to help them withstand the time it takes to earn a return. Resorts like Intrawest can also fund the amount of capital expenditures required to maintain a new resort, in addition to achieving economies of scale due to their network of mountains. Because of this barrier to entry, we think this would give Intrawest the opportunity to make an acquisition of another resort in the future. Because no new smaller entrants are expected to be a major threat in the industry, this leaves smaller operators to be acquired by the larger corporations looking to gain a competitive advantage. With a new resort, Intrawest will be able to geographically diversify their portfolio even more, which could potentially increase the number of visitors at their resorts.
 However, although larger resorts have more capital, the risk of capital intensity and an increase in capital expenditures is still a threat. Another economic moat Intrawest has is in their adventure segment with the vertical integration of Alpine Aerotech L.P. Because Intrawest owns their own fleet of 36 helicopters used by CMH, having this subsidiary will benefit Intrawest if they acquire more helicopters, in addition to keeping costs low when doing repairs and maintenance work on their current fleet. We believe that the use of Alpine Aerotech could contribute to the growth of the adventure segment as the fleet of helicopters will be readily available to service CMH clients. Catalysts Earnings Report Intrawest is expected to release Q3 2017 earnings during May 2017. The company usually has volatile earnings due to the seasonality of their business. The last time Intrawest reported positive earnings per share was during Q3 2016 because of the revenue they generate during the ski season. However, the other three quarters reported negative earnings. Last quarter, Intrawest reported -$0.47 earnings per share which beat analyst expectations of -$0.54. This could be due to positive winter earnings, which caused the stock to rise approximately 10%. Depending on what kind of earnings Intrawest reports could have a dramatic impact on the performance of the stock. Due to positive snow conditions that will take place over the second half of the 2017 ski season, we expect that visitation rates to increase for Intrawest, which will contribute to stronger earnings for their third quarter. Weather Conditions A good indicator of Intrawest's future earnings to investors could be the amount of snowfall received at their resorts. Typically, seasons with good snowfall tend to be good quarters for the company, because more customers visit their resorts. This relationship is also true with seasons with bad snowfall, which tend to be the worst quarters for the business. Because Intrawest earns approximately 75% of their annual revenues during their Q3 earnings, it is extremely important to the company and their stock that the weather participates with them.
 In the short term, we think Intrawest stock could become overvalued due to positive snow conditions compared to previous seasons, which have experienced poor conditions. We believe that this is the reason that the stock has had a 30% run up from the beginning of November 2016 to mid-January 2017. However, in the long term due to various external reasons that could harm revenue such as climate change, we think that this could have a negative effect on stock performance if the value of the stock keeps increasing. Acquisitions Because it is difficult for companies that operate within the mountain resort industry to gain the approval or raise the funds to build a new resort, they often look to grow inorganically by acquisitions of fully functioning ones. For Intrawest to make another acquisition could mean that they have put themselves in a position to grow as purchasing a resort is a big commitment. We think that the likelihood that Intrawest will make a future acquisition of another resort in the United States or Canada is positive. This would be a strategic acquisition to further geographically diversify their resorts, which would reduce the effect that climate change and unpredictable weather conditions may have. However, an acquisition could also have an inverse effect and cause the company to perform poorly because of the additional expenses the business has to take on in order to maintain the resort. We think that an acquisition would decrease the value of Intrawest stock in the short term due to this reason. However, if executed correctly, an acquisition that could diversify Intrawest's portfolio could increase total revenues for the company. Deal Rumors In recent months, Intrawest has been included in many reports, which have stated that the company may be looking for a possible sale of its business. We believe that buyers could include other private equity firms, as well as buyout firms and real estate holding companies. Although the management of Intrawest has stated that they would not comment on any market speculation, we do have reason to believe that Intrawest could realistically be involved in a future acquisition.
 One reason could be that Intrawest's stock price has nearly doubled since Fortress Investment Group (Intrawest majority stake holder) took it public in early 2014. The company's IPO price was initially $12 and has increased by approximately 100% to $23.49 during February 2017. Because of this, we believe that Fortress would be looking for an exit opportunity as the company has made a significant profit on its investment in Intrawest. Another reason why Fortress may want to sell Intrawest could be because Fortress was recently acquired by SoftBank (OTCPK:SFTBY), which is a Japanese telecommunications company. The reason we believe that this could be a possible motivator for the sale of Intrawest, is because SoftBank has recently been acquiring many firms to diversify its reach into technology, and Fortress could be a potential gateway to acquiring more firms. Lastly, another reason why Intrawest's management could be looking for a potential sale could be to free itself from having a company with a majority stake in it. This could provide more flexibility to management in the way they conduct their business. Conversely, they could also be looking for a potential sale of the entire business, to a company that is more aligned with Intrawest's strategic goal of becoming a geographically diversified four-season vacation resort. Any sale of Intrawest would potentially increase the stock price, as a buyer would usually have to pay a price of above the current market price as goodwill. However, a sale could also delist Intrawest from the NYSE, and possibly make it a private company once again. Management Team Mr. Thomas Marano - CEO, Director Thomas Marano is the Chief Executive officer (NYSE:CEO) of Intrawest, and acquired the position on November 21st, 2014. Prior to Intrawest, Mr. Marano has held various executive positions with a number of financial institutions. Most significantly, Mr. Marano was the Senior Managing Director of Mortgage and Asset Backed Securities at Bear Stearns & Co. Mr. Marano's fiscal 2016 annual compensation was $1,394,228, which is composed of a base salary of $732,638, a bonus of $627,200, and other compensation of $34,390.
 Mr. Marano owns 10,000 shares of Intrawest common stock, with the option to buy 1,350,000 more. Because both Mr. Mayer and Mr. Foulkes own more stock than Mr. Marano, we feel as though Mr. Marano should exercise his options to make his goals and responsibilities more aligned with the company. Although we feel confident in Mr. Marano's leadership ability, which is demonstrated through his various executive roles, we think that he may be lacking the necessary knowledge and expertise that may be required to operating a mountain resort. Travis Mayer - CFO, Executive Vice President, Treasurer Travis Mayer is the Chief Financial Officer (NASDAQ:CFO) of Intrawest, and joined the firm in January 2008 as a financial analyst. Prior to Intrawest, Mr. Mayer was a world class Olympic Skier winning the Olympic Silver medal, in addition to various other awards. Mr. Mayer also obtained a Masters of Business Administration (MBA) from Harvard Business School. Mr. Mayer's fiscal 2016 annual compensation was $540,591, which is composed of a base salary of $302,308, a bonus of $233,100, and other compensation of $5,183. Mr. Mayer owns 36,890 shares of Intrawest common stock, which is 0.09% of all shares outstanding. From the many skiing competitions that Mr. Mayer has taken part in during his time as a professional skier, we see that he has an obvious passion and commitment to the industry. Paired with his education, we feel that Mr. Mayer has the required drive and knowledge that may be required to continue the growth of Intrawest into the future. Sky Foulkes - COO, Executive Vice President Sky Foulkes is the Chief Operating Officer (NYSE:COO) of Intrawest, and obtained the position on November 21st, 2014. Prior to Intrawest, Mr. Foulkes was the Vice President of Operations at Stratton Mountain Resorts where he started as a professional ski patrol officer in 1982 - years before the resort was acquired by Intrawest. Mr. Foulkes's fiscal 2016 annual compensation was $642,547, which is composed of a base salary of $333,872, a bonus of 303,225, and other compensation of $5,450.
 Mr. Foulkes owns 17,950 shares of Intrawest common stock, which is 0.04% of all shares outstanding. Due to Mr. Foulkes's long time history in the mountain resort industry, we feel extremely confident in his ability to draw upon his past experience when making key decisions regarding resort operations. Risks Climate Change Risks There has been an increasing amount of evidence that the emission of greenhouse gases is contributing to global warming and irregular climate change. A core part of Intrawest's business relies on participating in future weather conditions. Warm weather could result in rain, melting snow, and inadequate snowfall, which may affect the seasonal operations of a resort. Obviously, without snow, customers will not be able to ski or snowboard thus rendering Intrawest's services as useless. Conversely, having weather that is too cold or extreme may also affect business at the mountain resorts, as it may make access to the resort and lift operations more difficult. Seasonality Risks Intrawest wholly owns and operates six four-season mountain resorts. However, a significant amount of revenue is derived from their second and third fiscal quarters during peak ski season due to optimal weather conditions. Because of the seasonality of their business, some of the mountain resorts and CMH could experience operating losses or insignificant profits during the first and fourth fiscal quarters. This is because of warmer weather that occurs during those quarters that alter the ability to ski, in addition to lack of business towards Intrawest summer amenities. Operating Leverage Risks The industry in which Intrawest operates in has extremely high fixed costs with little variable costs, and is capital intensive as equipment and property must always be operated, maintained, and eventually restored. Intrawest regularly has to spend on its fixed costs, which include the construction, maintenance, and renovation of its equipment and property in order to operate and remain competitive and safe with global competitors and regulations respectively.
 However, these capital expenditures can be costly and unpredictable in nature due to forces outside of the company's control. High fixed costs also pose high significant operating leverage risk in quarters with slow earnings because Intrawest must still keep its resort operational, which could cause major losses for the company. The fixed costs and capital expenditures can include a variety of expenses such as operations of lifts, facilities, snowmobiles, helicopters etc. Foreign Exchange Risks Intrawest is exposed to currency fluctuation risk as a significant portion of their revenues and operating expenses are derived from their Canadian operations. During the fiscal 2016 year, 41% of the revenue earned by Intrawest was denominated in Canadian dollars. The Canadian operations that Intrawest earn revenue from include Blue Mountain and Mont Tremblant Resorts, in addition to CMH. Volatile movements in the Canada/US exchange rate could have a significant impact on net income after converting Canadian operations into US dollars. However, Canadian-dominated operating expenses would naturally hedge any negative impact the exchange rate would have on revenue. Foreign exchange risk could also affect Intrawest sales revenue at their Canadian mountain resorts and CMH. Volatility in the exchange rate could impact the willingness international customers have of purchasing lift tickets or packages. For example, increase in the Canadian dollar compared to the Euro may make Intrawest's Canadian attractions less attractive to European customers. Shareholder Base, Liquidity, Market Depth 

 Intrawest had their IPO on January 31st, 2014 at a price of $12 per share and is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under SNOW. Today they have 39,770,271 common shares outstanding. The company has no restricted or preferred shares, and no debt instruments other than a loan of $539.1 million. The average three-month trading volume for SNOW is approximately around 76.19 thousand shares a day, which shows that the stock is generally liquid.
 68% of Intrawest is owned by Fortress Investment Group which is a diversified asset management company based out of New York. Fortress purchased all of Intrawest's stock in a leveraged buyout during August 2006 at a price of $2.8B. However, because of the rise in demand for leisure activities, Fortress took Intrawest public but still holds a majority stake in the company. Valuation Trading Comparable Analysis For our trading comparable analysis, it was difficult to find companies that we could compare against Intrawest. This is because the only public mountain resort operator in the United States and Canada is Vail Resorts. Thus, we included alternative businesses that provide customers with a service that they would use during their leisure time that are also seasonal. This included companies such as Six Flags Entertainment (NYSE:SIX), Cedar Fair (NYSE:FUN), Club Corp. Holdings, and others. We used these companies because we felt they provided us with a reasonable representation of the alternatives consumers had besides visiting a mountain resort during both winter and summer operations. Intrawest's EV/EBITDA multiple of 11.9x could be seen as slightly undervalued compared to the comparable average of 13.4x providing an implied share price of $27.51. Additionally, Intrawest's P/E ratio of 54.6x could also be looked at as overvalued compared against the comparable average of 37.6x, which gave us an implied share price of $15.81. Due to the similar environment and consumer of the comparable companies, we feel that they still provide a reasonable valuation of Intrawest. We therefore decided to place a total of 30% weighting on our comparable analysis, utilizing our average EV/EBITDA multiple. Discounted Cash Flow Analysis For most of our analysis, we assumed consistent operating conditions that have happened historically. This is because of the competitive nature of the industry, in addition to the uncertainty of what the threat of climate change will do to the business. However, because of Intrawest's investment into their summer operations we assumed steady long-term growth for Intrawest.
 Assumptions: Revenues For the current year, we forecasted an increase in revenue as we expect the number of visitors to increase due to positive weather conditions. However, because we factored in a number of risks into our revenue analysis, such as: competition, climate change, and the overall seasonality of the business, we assumed that Intrawest's revenue will experience future volatility. Furthermore, we believe that Intrawest's management will increase their investment into both winter and summer operations, which will help them adapt to unpredictable weather conditions and competition. This will start increasing revenue 2019 to 2022. Operating Margin We expect Intrawest's operating margin to decrease at a slow rate from 82% to 78% of revenue from 2018 to 2022 respectively. For the current season, we assumed an operation margin of 80% due to positive weather conditions. As the industry is typically faced with high fixed costs, we assume that the companies within it will find ways to become more cost effective in order increase their margins. We believe this will be done through investment into renewable energy sources, which will reduce Intrawest's carbon footprint and overall operating expenses. Depreciation and Amortization Because the industry has a high rate of capital intensity, we expected depreciation and amortization to increase as the company continues to grow. As Intrawest will have to make further expenditures on new operating machinery, their depreciation and amortization expense will increase alongside this growth. Taxes Although Intrawest does defer their tax payments, we assumed a flat tax rate of 27.5%, which is equivalent to their statutory rate. Capital Expenditures As competition within the industry increases, Intrawest will have to increase their spending on capital expenditures. This will include upgrades to lifts, facilities, snowmobiles, helicopters, and other assets that may be used when operating a mountain resort. Intrawest will also have to purchase new snow-making machines and renewable energy resources in the future to deal with climate change and unpredictable weather conditions.
 Weighted Average Cost of Capital (OTC:WACC) To determine Intrawest's cost of debt, we used the interest rate they currently have on their long-term debt, which is 4.2%, which we found on Bloomberg. We also used Intrawest's last statutory tax rate of 27.5%. To calculate their cost of equity, we used a market risk premium of 5%. Next we used the risk free rate of 1.75%, which can be found on a 10-year US government bond as of February 6th, 2017. Finally, we used a LTM beta of 1.13, which was found on Bloomberg. Using all these numbers within our calculation, we calculated a WACC of 5.86% Conclusion: Our discounted cash flow analysis generated an implied share price of $25.03/share. We believe that we used conservative and realistic assumptions going into the future, due to the competitive and uncertain nature of the industry. It is unlikely that Intrawest will deviate from their current course of business, and therefore think the valuation provides us with a reasonable intrinsic value. Weighted Price Target Because Intrawest operates in a volatile and highly competitive industry, we felt that taking a slightly more intrinsic approach when valuing Intrawest will provide us with a more reasonable share price. We also believe there has been a sharp increase in the value of Intrawest stock by 16% in January 2017. This could be because of a variety of reasons, which include recent weather conditions and deal rumors. For this reason, we decided to weight our implied share price of $25.03/share calculated from our discounted cash flow and our EV/EBITDA implied share price of $27.51/share from our comparable model 70% and 30% respectively. This gave us a share price of $25.50. Conclusion & Recommendation Overall, Intrawest is a stable company with successful winter operations from their mountain and adventure segments. However, the company continues to deliver inconsistent earnings during their summer operations. If Intrawest can successfully implement a successful summer business, they will have the opportunity to possibly achieve consistent earnings throughout the year and in turn increase the value of their stock. Nevertheless, this could prove to be difficult for Intrawest, as the summer is a highly competitive space with many substitutes.
 We can expect management to continue their investment into growing their summer operations by increasing the amount of off season amenities at their resorts. However, in order to successfully implement a strong summer business, management will need to think outside of the box and produce attractive amenities in order to provide customers with a reason to travel to Intrawest resorts during the off season. If the value of the stock were to decrease, we feel that Intrawest could prove to be a buying opportunity due to their strong winter business. Though, we feel this highly reliant on future weather conditions and if Intrawest can continue to geographically diversify themselves through acquisitions and invest in their snow-making capabilities. However, based on our current assumptions, we do feel that the market is pricing the stock fairly, and therefore decided to place a hold rating at a target price of $25.50 for Intrawest Resort Holdings.

Intrawest Resorts Holdings, Inc is a developer and operator of destination resorts and a luxury adventure travel company. The company was founded in 1976 as a privately funded real estate development company. In 2006, Intrawest was purchased by Fortress Investment Group, a private equity investment company,[1] which resulted in the company being delisted from the Toronto Stock Exchange and New York Stock Exchange. Fortress was under financial pressure related to the Intrawest debt, but a new loan with a single lender was completed in April 2010 and all prior lenders were repaid in full.[2]
In recent years, Intrawest has strengthened its cash flows, despite 2012 proving to be a challenging year for the American ski industry with warmer than normal temperatures and snowfall at 50% of historical averages.[3] Western Canada experienced above average and record snowfall amounts in some areas.

History[edit]
In 1986, Intrawest acquired Blackcomb Mountain from the Federal Business Development Bank, a Canadian Crown Corporation, and Fortress Mountain of Alberta (no relation to Fortress Investments LLC), a wholly owned division of Aspen Skiing Company. The company later went public, listed on the Toronto and New York Stock Exchanges and, in 1996, merged with Whistler Mountain Ski Corporation to form Whistler-Blackcomb resort, a venue of the 2010 Winter Olympics and Paralympic Games. Intrawest eventually spun off Whistler-Blackcomb and sold the last of its shares in that company in 2012.
Today, the Intrawest network includes mountain resorts. Intrawest also operates Club Intrawest, a private resort club with nine locations in North America. The company is the largest developer and operator of resort properties in North America offering skiing, snowboarding, golf, mountain biking, lodging, and real estate opportunities at each of its resorts. Intrawest develops real estate at its resorts and at other locations across North America. The company owns Canadian Mountain Holidays, the largest heli-skiing operation in the world.[4]
On November 12, 2013, Intrawest filed an initial public offering (IPO) with the New York Stock Exchange to raise up to $100 Million. The filing states that the money is being raised, "for working capital and other general corporate purposes, which may include potential investments in, and acquisitions of, ski and adventure travel businesses and assets."[5]
In 2016, Intrawest initiated significant reductions in full time staff to achieve rapid cost reductions.[6] Numerous key staff positions have been eliminated at its corporate headquarters and resort locations. This follows the sale[7] of the Club Intrawest time share lodging operation to Diamond Resorts International at the end of 2015. It is unclear regarding the company's longer term strategies as it continues to display inconsistent approaches in its business and staffing model. In 2017, Intrawest was sold back to Aspen Skiing Company for $1.5 billion.[8]

Intrawest Resorts Holdings, Inc is a developer and operator of destination resorts and a luxury adventure travel company. The company was founded in 1976 as a privately funded real estate development company. In 2006, Intrawest was purchased by Fortress Investment Group, a private equity investment company,[1] which resulted in the company being delisted from the Toronto Stock Exchange and New York Stock Exchange. Fortress was under financial pressure related to the Intrawest debt, but a new loan with a single lender was completed in April 2010 and all prior lenders were repaid in full.[2]
In recent years, Intrawest has strengthened its cash flows, despite 2012 proving to be a challenging year for the American ski industry with warmer than normal temperatures and snowfall at 50% of historical averages.[3] Western Canada experienced above average and record snowfall amounts in some areas.

History[edit]
In 1986, Intrawest acquired Blackcomb Mountain from the Federal Business Development Bank, a Canadian Crown Corporation, and Fortress Mountain of Alberta (no relation to Fortress Investments LLC), a wholly owned division of Aspen Skiing Company. The company later went public, listed on the Toronto and New York Stock Exchanges and, in 1996, merged with Whistler Mountain Ski Corporation to form Whistler-Blackcomb resort, a venue of the 2010 Winter Olympics and Paralympic Games. Intrawest eventually spun off Whistler-Blackcomb and sold the last of its shares in that company in 2012.
Today, the Intrawest network includes mountain resorts. Intrawest also operates Club Intrawest, a private resort club with nine locations in North America. The company is the largest developer and operator of resort properties in North America offering skiing, snowboarding, golf, mountain biking, lodging, and real estate opportunities at each of its resorts. Intrawest develops real estate at its resorts and at other locations across North America. The company owns Canadian Mountain Holidays, the largest heli-skiing operation in the world.[4]
On November 12, 2013, Intrawest filed an initial public offering (IPO) with the New York Stock Exchange to raise up to $100 Million. The filing states that the money is being raised, "for working capital and other general corporate purposes, which may include potential investments in, and acquisitions of, ski and adventure travel businesses and assets."[5]
In 2016, Intrawest initiated significant reductions in full time staff to achieve rapid cost reductions.[6] Numerous key staff positions have been eliminated at its corporate headquarters and resort locations. This follows the sale[7] of the Club Intrawest time share lodging operation to Diamond Resorts International at the end of 2015. It is unclear regarding the company's longer term strategies as it continues to display inconsistent approaches in its business and staffing model. In 2017, Intrawest was sold back to Aspen Skiing Company for $1.5 billion.[8]

Resorts owned at least in part by Intrawest include:

Blue Mountain, Ontario
Snowshoe Mountain, West Virginia
Steamboat Ski Resort, Colorado
Stratton Mountain Resort, Vermont
Mont Tremblant Resort, Quebec

Intrawest Resorts Holdings, Inc. to be Acquired by Affiliates of Aspen Skiing Company and KSL Capital Partners | Business Wire


























































Intrawest Resorts Holdings, Inc. to be Acquired by Affiliates of 
      Aspen Skiing Company and KSL Capital Partners






April 10, 2017 06:30 AM Eastern Daylight Time



ASPEN,Colo. & DENVER--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Intrawest Resorts Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: SNOW), a leading North 
      American mountain resort and adventure company, today announced that it 
      has entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by a newly-formed 
      entity controlled by affiliates of the Aspen Skiing Company, L.L.C. 
      (“Aspen”) and KSL Capital Partners, LLC (“KSL”). Under the terms of the 
      merger agreement, Intrawest stockholders will receive $23.75 in cash for 
      each share of Intrawest common stock, representing a total valuation of 
      approximately $1.5 billion including debt obligations to be assumed or 
      refinanced net of cash at closing. The transaction was unanimously 
      approved by the board of directors of Intrawest. Following the execution 
      of the merger agreement, stockholders representing a majority of the 
      voting shares of Intrawest delivered a written consent approving and 
      adopting the merger agreement. The transaction is expected to close by 
      the end of the third quarter of calendar year 2017 and is subject to 
      certain closing conditions including regulatory approvals.
    


      “This transaction creates significant opportunity for Intrawest and 
      delivers tremendous value to our current shareholders,” said Thomas 
      Marano, Intrawest’s chief executive officer. “The cash consideration of 
      $23.75 per share represents a 40% premium over $16.97 per share, 
      Intrawest’s closing stock price on January 12, 2017, the trading day 
      prior to Reuters’ report speculating that the Company was exploring a 
      potential sale. We are excited to work with Aspen and KSL. Our new 
      partners bring additional financial resources and a shared passion for 
      the mountains and our mountain communities. Both Aspen and KSL are 
      committed to helping Intrawest accelerate our plans to bring more value 
      to our guests, more opportunities for our employees and more investment 
      into our local communities.”
    

      “Intrawest is a collection of remarkable properties in exceptional 
      locations. Each has its own unique story and its own unique sense of 
      place,” said Eric Resnick, chief executive officer of KSL. “We are 
      committed to honoring the deep traditions of each resort, while working 
      with Intrawest’s talented management team and employees to continue to 
      serve both their guests and local communities.”
    

      “The enthusiasm that Intrawest’s employees exhibit for the guest 
      experience and for being responsible members of their communities is 
      apparent in all they do. We are excited to be part of the investment 
      group that is going to work hard to help realize the collective 
      potential of Intrawest’s portfolio of resorts,” said Mike Kaplan, chief 
      executive officer of Aspen.
    

Season Passes


      For the full 2017-18 winter season, each Intrawest resort will continue 
      to honor the resort’s existing pass products that are currently on sale, 
      including the Rocky Mountain Super Pass + and the M.A.X. Pass.
    

Squaw Valley Ski Holdings


      While not a condition to the merger, Squaw Valley Ski Holdings, the 
      parent company of Squaw Valley/Alpine Meadows resort and an affiliate of 
      KSL, will also become part of the entity at closing, but continue to 
      operate under its current management.
    

Additional Transaction Details


      Further information regarding the transaction will be included in an 
      information statement to be mailed to Intrawest shareholders.

Intrawest Resorts Holdings, Inc is a developer and operator of destination resorts and a luxury adventure travel company. The company was founded in 1976 as a privately funded real estate development company. In 2006, Intrawest was purchased by Fortress Investment Group, a private equity investment company,[1] which resulted in the company being delisted from the Toronto Stock Exchange and New York Stock Exchange. Fortress was under financial pressure related to the Intrawest debt, but a new loan with a single lender was completed in April 2010 and all prior lenders were repaid in full.[2]
In recent years, Intrawest has strengthened its cash flows, despite 2012 proving to be a challenging year for the American ski industry with warmer than normal temperatures and snowfall at 50% of historical averages.[3] Western Canada experienced above average and record snowfall amounts in some areas.

History[edit]
In 1986, Intrawest acquired Blackcomb Mountain from the Federal Business Development Bank, a Canadian Crown Corporation, and Fortress Mountain of Alberta (no relation to Fortress Investments LLC), a wholly owned division of Aspen Skiing Company. The company later went public, listed on the Toronto and New York Stock Exchanges and, in 1996, merged with Whistler Mountain Ski Corporation to form Whistler-Blackcomb resort, a venue of the 2010 Winter Olympics and Paralympic Games. Intrawest eventually spun off Whistler-Blackcomb and sold the last of its shares in that company in 2012.
Today, the Intrawest network includes mountain resorts. Intrawest also operates Club Intrawest, a private resort club with nine locations in North America. The company is the largest developer and operator of resort properties in North America offering skiing, snowboarding, golf, mountain biking, lodging, and real estate opportunities at each of its resorts. Intrawest develops real estate at its resorts and at other locations across North America. The company owns Canadian Mountain Holidays, the largest heli-skiing operation in the world.[4]
On November 12, 2013, Intrawest filed an initial public offering (IPO) with the New York Stock Exchange to raise up to $100 Million. The filing states that the money is being raised, "for working capital and other general corporate purposes, which may include potential investments in, and acquisitions of, ski and adventure travel businesses and assets."[5]
In 2016, Intrawest initiated significant reductions in full time staff to achieve rapid cost reductions.[6] Numerous key staff positions have been eliminated at its corporate headquarters and resort locations. This follows the sale[7] of the Club Intrawest time share lodging operation to Diamond Resorts International at the end of 2015. It is unclear regarding the company's longer term strategies as it continues to display inconsistent approaches in its business and staffing model. In 2017, Intrawest was sold back to Aspen Skiing Company for $1.5 billion.[8]
Current resorts[edit]
Resorts owned at least in part by Intrawest include:

Intrawest Resorts Holdings, Inc is a developer and operator of destination resorts and a luxury adventure travel company. The company was founded in 1976 as a privately funded real estate development company. In 2006, Intrawest was purchased by Fortress Investment Group, a private equity investment company,[1] which resulted in the company being delisted from the Toronto Stock Exchange and New York Stock Exchange. Fortress was under financial pressure related to the Intrawest debt, but a new loan with a single lender was completed in April 2010 and all prior lenders were repaid in full.[2]
In recent years, Intrawest has strengthened its cash flows, despite 2012 proving to be a challenging year for the American ski industry with warmer than normal temperatures and snowfall at 50% of historical averages.[3] Western Canada experienced above average and record snowfall amounts in some areas.

History[edit]
In 1986, Intrawest acquired Blackcomb Mountain from the Federal Business Development Bank, a Canadian Crown Corporation, and Fortress Mountain of Alberta (no relation to Fortress Investments LLC), a wholly owned division of Aspen Skiing Company. The company later went public, listed on the Toronto and New York Stock Exchanges and, in 1996, merged with Whistler Mountain Ski Corporation to form Whistler-Blackcomb resort, a venue of the 2010 Winter Olympics and Paralympic Games. Intrawest eventually spun off Whistler-Blackcomb and sold the last of its shares in that company in 2012.
Today, the Intrawest network includes mountain resorts. Intrawest also operates Club Intrawest, a private resort club with nine locations in North America. The company is the largest developer and operator of resort properties in North America offering skiing, snowboarding, golf, mountain biking, lodging, and real estate opportunities at each of its resorts. Intrawest develops real estate at its resorts and at other locations across North America. The company owns Canadian Mountain Holidays, the largest heli-skiing operation in the world.[4]
On November 12, 2013, Intrawest filed an initial public offering (IPO) with the New York Stock Exchange to raise up to $100 Million. The filing states that the money is being raised, "for working capital and other general corporate purposes, which may include potential investments in, and acquisitions of, ski and adventure travel businesses and assets."[5]
In 2016, Intrawest initiated significant reductions in full time staff to achieve rapid cost reductions.[6] Numerous key staff positions have been eliminated at its corporate headquarters and resort locations. This follows the sale[7] of the Club Intrawest time share lodging operation to Diamond Resorts International at the end of 2015. It is unclear regarding the company's longer term strategies as it continues to display inconsistent approaches in its business and staffing model. In 2017, Intrawest was sold back to Aspen Skiing Company for $1.5 billion.[8]
Current resorts[edit]
Resorts owned at least in part by Intrawest include:

Blue Mountain, Ontario
Snowshoe Mountain, West Virginia
Steamboat Ski Resort, Colorado
Stratton Mountain Resort, Vermont
Mont Tremblant Resort, Quebec
Canadian Mountain Holidays, Alberta
Winter Park, Colorado (Intrawest is contracted to operate this city park which is owned by the City of Denver.[9])
Zihuatanejo, Mexico

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Industry Update




Press Release12 April 2017Intrawest Resorts Holdings, Inc. to Be Acquired by Affiliates of Aspen Skiing Company and KSL Capital Partners

Intrawest Resorts Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: SNOW), a leading North American mountain resort and adventure company, today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by a newly-formed entity controlled by affiliates of the Aspen Skiing Company, L.L.C. ("Aspen") and KSL Capital Partners, LLC ("KSL"). Under the terms of the merger agreement, Intrawest stockholders will receive $23.75 in cash for each share of Intrawest common stock, representing a total valuation of approximately $1.5 billion including debt obligations to be assumed or refinanced net of cash at closing. The transaction was unanimously approved by the board of directors of Intrawest. Following the execution of the merger agreement, stockholders representing a majority of the voting shares of Intrawest delivered a written consent approving and adopting the merger agreement. The transaction is expected to close by the end of the third quarter of calendar year 2017 and is subject to certain closing conditions including regulatory approvals.

"This transaction creates significant opportunity for Intrawest and delivers tremendous value to our current shareholders," said Thomas Marano, Intrawest's chief executive officer. "The cash consideration of $23.75 per share represents a 40% premium over $16.97 per share, Intrawest's closing stock price on January 12, 2017, the trading day prior to Reuters' report speculating that the Company was exploring a potential sale. We are excited to work with Aspen and KSL. Our new partners bring additional financial resources and a shared passion for the mountains and our mountain communities. Both Aspen and KSL are committed to helping Intrawest accelerate our plans to bring more value to our guests, more opportunities for our employees and more investment into our local communities."

"Intrawest is a collection of remarkable properties in exceptional locations. Each has its own unique story and its own unique sense of place," said Eric Resnick, chief executive officer of KSL. "We are committed to honoring the deep traditions of each resort, while working with Intrawest's talented management team and employees to continue to serve both their guests and local communities."
"The enthusiasm that Intrawest's employees exhibit for the guest experience and for being responsible members of their communities is apparent in all they do. We are excited to be part of the investment group that is going to work hard to help realize the collective potential of Intrawest's portfolio of resorts," said Mike Kaplan, chief executive officer of Aspen.
Season Passes
For the full 2017-18 winter season, each Intrawest resort will continue to honor the resort's existing pass products that are currently on sale, including the Rocky Mountain Super Pass + and the M.A.X. Pass.
Squaw Valley Ski Holdings
While not a condition to the merger, Squaw Valley Ski Holdings, the parent company of Squaw Valley/Alpine Meadows resort and an affiliate of KSL, will also become part of the entity at closing, but continue to operate under its current management.
Additional Transaction Details
Further information regarding the transaction will be included in an information statement to be mailed to Intrawest shareholders.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

The net proceeds to us from the sale of the 3,125,000 shares of common stock
offered by us hereby are estimated to be approximately $32.0 million, after
deducting the estimated underwriting discounts and offering expenses payable by
us. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of our common stock by the
selling stockholder, including any shares sold by the selling stockholder
pursuant to the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares. We have no
specific plan for the net proceeds to us from this offering and intend to use
such proceeds for working capital and other general corporate purposes, which
may include potential investments in, and acquisitions of, ski and adventure
travel businesses and assets. No material acquisitions are probable at this
time.

Our management will have broad discretion over the use of the net proceeds to us
from this offering and investors will be relying on the judgment of our
management regarding the application of these proceeds. Pending their use, we
plan to invest the net proceeds to us from this offering in short term, interest
bearing obligations, investment grade instruments, certificates of deposit or
direct or guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government.


There are significant barriers to entry for new ski resort development in North
America resulting from the limited number of remaining suitable sites, the
difficulty in obtaining necessary government permits and the significant capital
required for development and construction. As such, no major ski resorts have
been developed in the past 30 years, with the last major resorts opened being
Blackcomb Mountain and Beaver Creek in 1980 and Deer Valley in 1981.

Competition within the ski resort industry is based on multiple factors,
including location, price, weather conditions, the uniqueness and perceived
quality of the terrain for various levels of skill and ability, the atmosphere
of the base village, the quality of food and entertainment and ease of travel to
the resort (including direct flights by major airlines). We believe we compete
effectively and our competitive position is protected, due to the unique
attributes and geographic diversity among our portfolio of mountain resorts. We
believe that our mountain resorts feature a sufficient quality and variety of
terrain and activities to make them highly competitive with other mountain
resorts.

Our resorts directly compete with other mountain resorts in their respective
local and regional markets, as well as with other major destination resorts. Our
individual mountain resorts primarily compete as follows:

• Steamboat’s primary competition is from Breckenridge Ski Resort in        
  Colorado, Park City Mountain Resort in Utah and other large international 
  ski destinations.                                                         

• Winter Park’s primary competition is from Copper Mountain Resort, Keystone
  Resort and other ski resorts located in Colorado’s Front Range.           

• Tremblant’s primary competition is from Mont-Sainte-Anne, Mont Blanc, Le  
  Massif and Mont Saint-Sauveur, all located in Quebec, other resorts in the
  Laurentian Mountains, and both Jay Peak and Stowe Mountain in Northern    
  Vermont.                                                                  

• Stratton’s primary competition is from other mid-to-large size ski resorts
  in Southern Vermont, including Okemo, Mount Snow and Killington Resort.   

• Snowshoe’s primary competition is from ski resorts in the mid-Atlantic,   
  such as Seven Springs Mountain Resort located in Pennsylvania, and Bryce  
  Resort and Wintergreen Resort, both located in Virginia.                  

• Blue Mountain’s primary competition is from Horseshoe Valley Resort and   
  Mount St. Louis, both located in Ontario, and Holiday Valley Resort in    
  western New York.
---

CMH directly competes with other heli-skiing and snowcat operations in Canada 
and the United States. We believe that there are currently less than 75 
heli-skiing and catskiing operators in North America, with most heli-skiing 
and catskiing occurring in British Columbia due to the vast alpine wilderness 
and consistent annual snowfall. CMH also competes to a lesser extent with 
lift-accessed ski resorts in North America and other parts of the world. 
---

We compete with other vacation club and fractional ownership businesses in our
efforts to sell points (memberships) in Club Intrawest. In addition, we compete
with other property management companies in providing management services at 
IHM’s properties. Our managed properties compete with rental management 
companies, locally owned independent hotels, as well as facilities and 
timeshare companies that are owned or managed by national and international 
chains. These properties also compete for convention and conference business 
across the North American market. Competition within the hotel and lodging 
industry is generally based on quality and consistency of rooms, restaurants 
and meeting facilities and services, attractiveness of locations, availability 
of a global distribution system, price and other factors.


Company Description
We are a North American mountain resort and adventure company, delivering
distinctive vacation and travel experiences to our customers for over three
decades. We own interests in seven four-season mountain resorts with more than
11,000 skiable acres and more than 1,150 acres of land available for


 real estate
development. Our mountain resorts are geographically diversified across North
America’s major ski regions, including the Eastern United States, the Rocky
Mountains, the Pacific Southwest and Canada, which we believe helps reduce our
financial exposure to any single geographic area as weather patterns and
economic conditions vary across these regions. Our mountain resorts are located
within an average of approximately 160 miles of major metropolitan markets with
high concentrations of affluent skiers and major airports, including New York
City, Boston, Washington D.C., Pittsburgh, Denver, Los Angeles, Montreal and
Toronto. During fiscal 2013, our portfolio of resorts received more than six
million visitors from all 50 states and more than 100 countries. We also operate
an adventure travel business, the cornerstone of which is Canadian Mountain
Holidays (“CMH”), the leading heli-skiing adventure company in North America.
CMH provides helicopter accessed skiing, mountaineering and hiking to more
skiable terrain than all lift accessed mountain resorts in North America
combined. Additionally, we operate a comprehensive real estate business through
which we manage, market and sell vacation club properties; manage condominium
hotel properties; and sell and market residential real estate.

We operate within the leisure industry, with a business that benefits from
improvements in the economy and associated increases in consumer discretionary
spending. Numerous economic trends support the notion that the health of the
general economy is continuing to improve. As the economy continues to improve,
we believe that consumers will have more disposable income and a greater
inclination to engage in and spend on leisure activities. We also expect
recreational adventure and experiential travel to continue to gain in popularity
as individuals, including the important “baby boomer” generation, live longer,
healthier lives. We intend to capitalize on these favorable trends within the
leisure industry to drive growth within our business by increasing visitation at
our resorts and at CMH, increasing product pricing and growing the scale of our
businesses through targeted growth capital investments and acquisitions. We
evaluate acquisition opportunities both domestically and internationally where
the opportunity would provide a strategic fit within our existing portfolio of
businesses. No material acquisitions are probable at this time.

We manage our business through three reportable segments:

• Mountain ($339.0 million, or 65.5%, of fiscal 2013 reportable segment     
  revenue): Our Mountain segment includes our mountain resort and lodging   
  operations at Steamboat Ski & Resort, Winter Park Resort, Mont Tremblant  
  Resort, Stratton Mountain Resort and Snowshoe Mountain Resort. We also    
  hold a 50% interest in Blue Mountain Ski Resort within our Mountain       
  segment.                                                                  

• Adventure ($113.6 million, or 22.0%, of fiscal 2013 reportable segment    
  revenue): The cornerstone of our Adventure segment is CMH. Within our     
  Adventure segment, we also own and operate aviation businesses that       
  support CMH and provide services to third parties.                        

• Real Estate ($64.7 million, or 12.5%, of fiscal 2013 reportable segment   
  revenue): Our Real Estate segment includes our real estate development    
  activities, as well as our real estate management, marketing and sales    
  businesses, including Intrawest Resort Club Group (“IRCG”), Intrawest     
  Hospitality Management (“IHM”) and Playground. We currently own core      
  entitled land surrounding the base of our resorts totaling more than 1,150
  acres, much of which is located adjacent or proximate to the ski trails at
  our resorts, including ski-in and ski-out parcels. As of December 31,     
  2013, this land had an appraised value of $153.4 million.                 

Our mountain resorts offer a breadth of activities for individuals of all ages
that combine outdoor adventure and fitness with a wide variety of resort-based
services and amenities, including retail, equipment rental, dining, lodging, ski
school, spa services, golf, mountain biking and other summer activities. We own
or manage many of these services and amenities, which allows us to capture a
larger proportion of customer spending as well as ensure product and service
quality at our resorts.
