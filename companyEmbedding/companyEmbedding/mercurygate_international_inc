Our Inspiration
MercuryGate’s inspiration is to provide a high-quality Transportation Management System at an affordable price to all industry segments, large and small.
The MercuryGate Solution
Designed as an Enterprise solution focused at the operations level to manage mission-critical logistics, planning, optimization, execution, and settlements.  MercuryGate TMS in the cloud automates an evolutionary path for revolutionizing the shipment management process. A TMS provides the common data and message sharing offered by pure exchanges and based on the actual transaction versus today’s translation. Data is no longer duplicated across the Enterprise, and data-mapping expense is reduced or eliminated. Users share a common execution platform and view the same data, at the same time, in the same format in a true operations level, collaborative environment. Proactive capabilities allow practitioners to focus on exception management.
MercuryGate’s designers also know that new solutions can be cost prohibitive for many organizations. Because of this, MercuryGate provides a low-cost and low-risk method of implementation. This allows logistics managers to realize rapid time to value without the large initial investment typically associated with new technology solutions. MercuryGate’s single platform open architecture enables rapid delivery of new product ensuring that MercuryGate Clients continue to operate in a best of breed technology environment.  Let MercuryGate help you automate and grow your business and enable you to meet your ever-changing market requirements.
The Future
The transportation industry is poised to leverage new technologies to enable smarter decisions and superior customer service and MercuryGate is leading the way. The cloud is the future and is here to stay.  MercuryGate has built its platform from the ground up to be in the cloud and to be deployed in a multi-tenant shared or dedicated environment.  Users leverage the power of MercuryGate’s transportation network to tap into a ready-made community of logistics trading partners to manage their complete transportation network.  This enables not just connectivity but enables a collaborative workflow that transcends enterprise borders to ensure seamless transportation planning, execution, and settlements.
MercuryGate continues to invest in research and development to leverage the latest technologies such as in-memory data grids, big data, mobile and UI technologies to capture the next S curve of efficiency gains. MercuryGate is also continuously expanding its eco-system of technology partners who bring niche capabilities such as telematics, GPS, geo-mapping and other technologies that enable MercuryGate to be one step ahead of the competition.
MercuryGate’s commitment is to deliver a system that is always one generation ahead of its time to support your transportation management requirements – a solution for today and tomorrow.

Mojo - Transportation Optimization - MercuryGate International






















































 







			TMS That Delivers Events News(919) 469-8057
 Request A Demo 
























 











Mojo – Transportation Optimization

























Mojo is an affordable, easy to use, and powerful transportation optimization solution that analyzes shipments, rates, and constraints to produce realistic load plans that reduce overall freight spend. Learn how companies of all sizes and industries leverage Mojo to realize cost savings and gain efficiencies in their transportation networks.
 “By using Mojo as both a modeling tool and for execution, you can ensure that the savings you expected come true and you are using the same optimization parameters in both scenarios. This makes the implementation a lot easier and drives the expected results,”  – Sr. Vice President. Transportation Management, OHL.
The magic of Mojo starts with the data you use every day to move freight. Actual rates, approved carriers, specified capacities, transit times, and other available data are entered into Mojo to produce realistic and executable load plans. Orders from anywhere in the world, from multiple customers, locations or vendors can be combined into multi-pick/drop movements, continuous move shipments, backhauls, and pooling scenarios.
 Real Data – Real Savings


Mojo Powers a Wide Range of Business Processes

 
Import Current Shipments and Rates into Mojo
You can easily import your current shipments to Mojo from your TMS, ERP, WMS or from a spreadsheet. Mojo automatically determines the most cost effective route and load to consolidation.
We’ve done a number of different modeling scenarios in Mojo to figure out what the best way was to set up that freight network. It’s a fantastic product – I still haven’t used every possible variable that it provides – but certainly it has very extensive cost optimization capabilities – Logistics Director, Celestica
Configure Optimization Parameters
Establish Mojo parameters that are optimized according to your business practices – across all modes, including parcel, LTL, TL, rail, intermodal, air freight, ocean and multimodal. For example, you can consider pooling points and backhaul opportunities. Mojo will even optimize across multiple modes and international shipments, and identify shipments that should be a parcel shipment or consolidated with others onto a multi-stop truckload. The application will also determine the optimal ship dates and delivery appointments based on carrier resources, available docks, and delivery windows.
Get Rapid Results
Mojo analyzes every possible load optimization scenario while you wait. It then provides you with a thorough explanation of how Mojo organized your shipments in the most optimal way, given the provided parameters. Mojo will show the cost, mileage and CO2 emissions reduction for the planned shipments compared to point-to-point loads. Each load itinerary will be described in detail and you’ll have the opportunity to make detailed adjustments if necessary.
To perform some ‘what-if’ analysis on your plan, simply adjust an optimization parameter and re-run the optimizer to see the difference. Mojo will save your initial run and show you the effect of your change(s).
 

Upload Optimized Results to the TMS
When the loads are optimized to your satisfaction, one click sends them to the TMS to be distributed to network-wide operational personnel. Integrated with MercuryGate TMS, Mojo but is also available as a standalone application that is easily configured to share information with any TMS.

MercuryGate University Graduate Testimonial 
“Earlier this morning, I was offered an internship with Accenture for supply chain management position. At the interview, I talked about the tutorials we have been assigned in this class and how we are learning about incorporating such a system in the real world. This set me apart from the other candidates and became one of the main ways that I was a competitive and allowed me to get the internship!”
– Former Central Washington University Student

BBB Reason for Ratings


        BBB rating is based on 13 factors: Get the details about the factors considered.










BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.
                    





Out of Business









                        BBB reports on a company that is out of business for three years from the date the company closes its doors or ceases to do business.
                    





Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.
                    





Mail Returned









                        BBB reports when mail sent to the business was returned by the Postal Service.

The world today moves too fast for pen and paper, and the founders of MercuryGate International Inc. recognized this early on. Monica Wooden and Steve Blough founded the company in 2000 to provide transportation management software that was based in the cloud. Their goal was to provide clients with faster and more efficient access to the vital information they needed to keep their supply chains moving at the speed of business.
At the time, Director of Business Development Peter Yost explains, that was quite the quantum leap for the  industry.
“When you think about the year 2000 and what the information technology world looked like at the time, transportation management systems were cumbersome, inflexible and expensive,” Yost says.
What’s more, Wooden and Blough wanted to create a transportation management software platform that could be scalable and applicable to any size business. “The founders of our company envisioned transportation management software that was affordable, configurable and easy to implement,” Yost adds. “That was a radical thought around the year 2000.”
That radical thought has put MercuryGate in a leadership position in the transportation management software market, with dozens of other companies trying to play catch-up with their own cloud-based products. Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer Daniel Vertachnik says the company’s customer base is diverse and continues to grow, with a number of large, multinational clients as well as mid-tier and start-up clients. With the company’s versatile product and dedication to service, MercuryGate has reason to believe it will continue to be a powerhouse in the market for years to come.
All Things to All People
The designers of the MercuryGate transportation management platform come out of logistics backgrounds, with experience that ranges from the warehouse floor to executive management. This gives the company the ability to develop solutions that fit a number of transportation scenarios.
MercuryGate offers solutions for shippers, third-party logistics, freight-forwarding and brokerage. This puts the company in a unique position because few solutions providers have this kind of breadth to their product lines.
“We see a lot of different competitors because most other companies handle point solutions that serve a single segment of the market,” says Yost.
“Indeed,” Vertachnik says, “We seldom run into the same competitor [in each market segment.]”
Because of the multiple areas of expertise MercuryGate has under its roof, its platform can plan, optimize and execute complete transportation operations from pick-up to delivery.
“We are truly a global, multimodal, end-to-end transportation system,” Vertachnik says. “We manage across all transportation requirements, across oceans and across borders.”
Specific Solutions
Not only does MercuryGate create solutions that fit virtually any transportation environment, the company also has the ability to configure in the cloud for each client’s specific operation, Yost says. “Our diverse customer base is a testament to the flexibility and scalability of the software.”
Yost adds, “Competitors tell clients they can have a self-hosted application or configurability, but not both. MercuryGate, on the other hand, gives customers free rein over their systems while also providing them with the support to tailor it to their specific requirements.” This includes the ability to create templates for commonly used functions, such as loading contracts and rates, he explains.
“You do something once, and then you can set that as a template and use it again,” Yost says.
“MercuryGate’s platform is built as a data warehouse,” Vertachnik adds. When you combine this rich data content with end-to-end control tower visibility, you have the operational data and the control to quickly respond and adapt to changes in the transportation management network.
“We implement quickly,” Vertachnik says. “We’re a product company and we’re very proud of being a product company. Our goal is to get clients operational quickly so they can begin to derive value from the system and see a rapid return on their investment.”
Because MercuryGate views itself as a product company and not a consultant, it is up-front with clients about the cost of the system. “We quote early in the sales process so there are no surprises for the prospect,” Vertachnik says. Clients pay MercuryGate no product or implementation services fees until the system is in production, something we believe no other transportation management system provider does for clients.” The company also does not charge clients for EDI messages they send through the system.
“Once the system is live, MercuryGate is still there for our clients,” Vertachnik says. “While the system is easy to use and configure by our clients and their users, if they need us, our 24/7/365 support is there for them.” Yost adds that the company does not require clients to enter into long-term contracts with MercuryGate, allowing them the freedom to drop the system with 30 days’ notice if it no longer meets their needs – something that has seldom happened in MercuryGate’s twelve year history.
Keeping Up
Yost says the fact that so many different companies across so many industry segments use the same single platform product in so many different ways speaks to the strength and flexibility of MercuryGate’s product. The greatest challenge has been to keep up with the demand.
“The company continues to add employees to support our existing client requirements as well as our rapidly growing domestic and international markets,” Vertachnik says. “We think we’re going to continue to see this rapid growth, the market is hungry for a global enterprise transportation management system to meet their ever changing and growing international transportation requirements and MercuryGate TMS meets the challenge.”
Even though the company is getting bigger with each passing month, Yost says there’s one area of MercuryGate that will never change. “MercuryGate has always been and will always be a customer-driven, customer-focused organization,” he says. ­­­
