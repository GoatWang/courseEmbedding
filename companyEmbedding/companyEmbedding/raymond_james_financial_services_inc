            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.source> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11x1gf2m6>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million
Updated: June 9, 2013
Data Format: CSV
License: CC-BY

2 GB gzip8 GB uncompressed

Download



The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

History[edit]
Raymond James was founded in 1962 when St. Petersburg broker Robert James formed Robert A. James Investments. In 1964, it merged with Raymond & Associates, founded by Edward Raymond in 1963, to form Raymond James & Associates.[2] Robert James' son, Tom James, joined his father's company in 1966 and assumed leadership of the firm in 1970. The firm initially planned to go public in 1969, but market conditions delayed its plan until 1983.[3] Tom turned over the CEO's post to Paul Reilly in 2010,[4] and transitioned his title as Chairman of the Board to Paul Reilly in 2016.[5] Tom still remains on the leadership team as Chairman Emeritus.
In 2012, the firm purchased the Canadian assets of Allied Irish Bank.[3] In April 2012, Raymond James merged with Morgan Keegan & Company. The merger created one of the country's largest full-service wealth management and investment banking firms not headquartered in New York.[6]
In January 2013, the firm reported 100 consecutive quarters of profitability.[7]
In June 2016, it was announced that Raymond James had joined the Fortune 500 for the first time.[8]
In September 2016, Raymond James announced its acquisition of Deutsche Bank Wealth Management's US private client services unit, Alex. Brown.[9]
As of April 2017, Raymond James has 7,100 financial advisors serving approximately 3 million client accounts in more than 2,900 locations throughout the United States, Canada and overseas. Total client assets under management are approximately $643 billion.[10] Raymond James corporate headquarters is located in St. Petersburg, Florida.
Activities[edit]
Raymond James Financial has three wholly owned broker-dealers, Raymond James & Associates (RJ&A), Raymond James Financial Services (RJFS) and Raymond James Limited (RJL); and Raymond James Investment Services Limited (RJIS), a majority-owned independent contractor subsidiary in the United Kingdom.[11] Through Eagle Asset Management, the firm manages $56 billion in assets mostly for institutions, as of October 2013.[3]
Controversies[edit]
Auction rate securities[edit]
On June 29, 2011, Raymond James announced an agreement to repurchase at par auction rate securities (ARS) sold to clients through its domestic broker/dealer subsidiaries prior to February 13, 2008. The agreement—reached with the Securities and Exchange Commission and with state securities regulators led by Florida and Texas—resolved more than three years of investigation related to activity in the ARS market. Without admitting or denying the allegations, the firm also agreed to pay a fine totaling $1.75 million to the state regulators, but was not fined by the SEC.
As a result of this agreement, a pre-tax charge of $45 million was recorded in the quarter ending June 30, 2011. This charge was a result of an estimate of the current fair value of the securities to be repurchased by the company being less than their par value. It is expected that the ultimate realized loss will be substantially less as issuers refinance or redeem these securities, interest rates rise and/or collateral values improve.
Raymond James sold $2.3 billion worth of ARS, underwrote $1.2 billion, and was the auction dealer for over $725 million. Since the $330 billion market for ARS crashed in 2008, at least 19 underwriters and broker-dealers were sued in class action suits.[12][13]
Excessive commissions[edit]
In September 2011, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ordered Raymond James & Associates, Inc. (RJA) and Raymond James Financial Services, Inc. (RJFS) to pay restitution of $1.69 million to 15,500 clients for charging excessive commissions on more than 27,000 securities transactions. The trades were made in client accounts between 2006 and 2010. FINRA also fined RJA $225,000 and RJFS $200,000.[14]

History[edit]
Raymond James was founded in 1962 when St. Petersburg broker Robert James formed Robert A. James Investments. In 1964, it merged with Raymond & Associates, founded by Edward Raymond in 1963, to form Raymond James & Associates.[2] Robert James' son, Tom James, joined his father's company in 1966 and assumed leadership of the firm in 1970. The firm initially planned to go public in 1969, but market conditions delayed its plan until 1983.[3] Tom turned over the CEO's post to Paul Reilly in 2010,[4] and transitioned his title as Chairman of the Board to Paul Reilly in 2016.[5] Tom still remains on the leadership team as Chairman Emeritus.
In 2012, the firm purchased the Canadian assets of Allied Irish Bank.[3] In April 2012, Raymond James merged with Morgan Keegan & Company. The merger created one of the country's largest full-service wealth management and investment banking firms not headquartered in New York.[6]
In January 2013, the firm reported 100 consecutive quarters of profitability.[7]
In June 2016, it was announced that Raymond James had joined the Fortune 500 for the first time.[8]
In September 2016, Raymond James announced its acquisition of Deutsche Bank Wealth Management's US private client services unit, Alex. Brown.[9]
As of April 2017, Raymond James has 7,100 financial advisors serving approximately 3 million client accounts in more than 2,900 locations throughout the United States, Canada and overseas. Total client assets under management are approximately $643 billion.[10] Raymond James corporate headquarters is located in St. Petersburg, Florida.
Activities[edit]
Raymond James Financial has three wholly owned broker-dealers, Raymond James & Associates (RJ&A), Raymond James Financial Services (RJFS) and Raymond James Limited (RJL); and Raymond James Investment Services Limited (RJIS), a majority-owned independent contractor subsidiary in the United Kingdom.[11] Through Eagle Asset Management, the firm manages $56 billion in assets mostly for institutions, as of October 2013.[3]
Controversies[edit]
Auction rate securities[edit]
On June 29, 2011, Raymond James announced an agreement to repurchase at par auction rate securities (ARS) sold to clients through its domestic broker/dealer subsidiaries prior to February 13, 2008. The agreement—reached with the Securities and Exchange Commission and with state securities regulators led by Florida and Texas—resolved more than three years of investigation related to activity in the ARS market. Without admitting or denying the allegations, the firm also agreed to pay a fine totaling $1.75 million to the state regulators, but was not fined by the SEC.
As a result of this agreement, a pre-tax charge of $45 million was recorded in the quarter ending June 30, 2011. This charge was a result of an estimate of the current fair value of the securities to be repurchased by the company being less than their par value. It is expected that the ultimate realized loss will be substantially less as issuers refinance or redeem these securities, interest rates rise and/or collateral values improve.
Raymond James sold $2.3 billion worth of ARS, underwrote $1.2 billion, and was the auction dealer for over $725 million. Since the $330 billion market for ARS crashed in 2008, at least 19 underwriters and broker-dealers were sued in class action suits.[12][13]
Excessive commissions[edit]
In September 2011, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ordered Raymond James & Associates, Inc. (RJA) and Raymond James Financial Services, Inc. (RJFS) to pay restitution of $1.69 million to 15,500 clients for charging excessive commissions on more than 27,000 securities transactions. The trades were made in client accounts between 2006 and 2010. FINRA also fined RJA $225,000 and RJFS $200,000.[14]

BBB Accreditation





                BBB Accredited Since 02/18/2004
            

                BBB has determined that Raymond James Financial Services, Inc. meets Standards of BBB Accreditation, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            

                BBB accreditation does not mean that the business's products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business's product quality or competency in performing services.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry

4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    6. Avoid misleading customers by creating the false impression of sponsorship, endorsement, popularity, trustworthiness, product quality or business size through the misuse of logos, trustmarks, pictures, testimonials, or other means

1. Resolving the complaint directly with the complainant and notifying BBB, or

                            2. Providing BBB with a response that BBB determines: 

                                    1. is professional,

                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB. Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed. BBB may consider a business' willingness to participate in recommended dispute resolution options in determining compliance with these standards.
                

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

Working with a Raymond James Advisor
It starts by being personal.
Your relationship with a Raymond James advisor begins with a meaningful conversation – about you. Your goals, your wants, your needs, your concerns, your family, your passion, your vision for the future. It’s about working together to understand the strategies and services that will give you the optimal chance to fulfill your objectives – to live the life you want.
Next, you and your advisor will develop a comprehensive plan.
 Just like you, your plan is unique. It will be customized to help you reach major milestones – the ones you know are coming, and perhaps a few you haven’t considered yet. With comprehensive, institutional-quality resources, your advisor can provide a wide array of wealth management services, from investment strategies backed by award-winning research to estate planning vehicles that ensure your wishes are carried out exactly as you intend.
In implementing the plan, your advisor will work in collaboration with other professionals, such as attorneys and accountants, to assure your financial plan is holistic – all aspects working together. Through Investor Access, you will have online access to up-to-date account information, all while your accounts and information are protected by cybersecurity technology that goes well beyond the industry standard.
Through the years, your plan will evolve with you.
 The relationship with your advisor will grow deeper as you monitor the progress of your investments and review your strategy. Life events might require adjustments. Whatever the need, whatever phase of life you are in, your advisor will see you through.

Working with a Raymond James advisor means you have more than a financial planner. 
You have a trusted financial partner – for life.

The right advice
starts with a trusted relationship. 


We believe financial advice is about more than just having a plan. It’s about having the right plan for you. And that only happens with a true understanding of your whole life, beyond just your finances. Because as your needs become more complex, sophisticated advice and a relationship built for the long term become even more important.

And built for the long term. Each advisor is empowered with the latest technology so you get the information you need, when you need it, from virtually anywhere. From tracking all of your accounts in one secure place to access to industry-leading research, it all starts right here.

About Raymond James
Our deliberate nature and thoughtful approach to financial planning have led to a history of strength and steady, stable growth. Our company’s conservative approach began in 1962 when Robert James put the word “Investments” after his name. And since then, Raymond James advisors have been crafting meticulously tailored, holistic financial plans to help ensure their clients can retire and realize their individual financial goals.

The right advice
starts with a trusted relationship. 


We believe financial advice is about more than just having a plan. It’s about having the right plan for you. And that only happens with a true understanding of your whole life, beyond just your finances. Because as your needs become more complex, sophisticated advice and a relationship built for the long term become even more important.

The right advice
starts with a trusted relationship. 


We believe financial advice is about more than just having a plan. It’s about having the right plan for you. And that only happens with a true understanding of your whole life, beyond just your finances. Because as your needs become more complex, sophisticated advice and a relationship built for the long term become even more important.

Raymond James

 


The right advice
starts with a trusted relationship. 


We believe financial advice is about more than just having a plan. It’s about having the right plan for you. And that only happens with a true understanding of your whole life, beyond just your finances. Because as your needs become more complex, sophisticated advice and a relationship built for the long term become even more important.
