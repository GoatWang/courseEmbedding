BEAVERTON, Ore. — Nike Inc. Chairman Phil Knight said Monday he has replaced CEO William D. Perez after only a year on the job because the former S.C. Johnson & Son Inc. leader could not make the transition from the household products industry to head the world’s largest athletic-shoe company.
    
“Basically the distance between the company that Bill managed in the packaged goods business and Nike and the kind of new athletic equipment business was too great for him to make that leap,” Knight said during a conference call with industry analysts.
The Nike founder called his decision “painful” and came down to “lots of little incidences over a year.”
Knight named longtime co-president Mark Parker as CEO to replace Perez, whose resignation was accepted last Friday by the Nike board of directors.
Perez was the first outsider ever hired to lead Nike after Knight decided late in 2004 to hand over the day-to-day management responsibilities he had held as chairman, CEO and president.
Nike will pay Perez at least $4.5 million in salary and bonus, and buy his Portland house and reimburse him for remodeling expenses, totaling about $3.6 million, the company said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Knight said he felt the Beaverton-based company was “operating at 80 percent efficiency” under Perez.

“Personally, I think the failure to really kind of get his arms around this company and this industry led to confusion on behalf of the management team,” Knight said. “And I didn’t see that getting any better.”
He noted that Nike still has been generating record sales and earnings, but “I thought we can and will be so much better under Mark Parker’s leadership.”
In a statement released Monday, Perez said he and Knight “weren’t entirely aligned on some aspects of how to best lead the company’s long-term growth. It became obvious to me that the long-term interests of the company would be best served by my resignation.”
Last month, when Nike announced its second quarter earnings, Perez joked that his “rookie status” was about to end with completion of his first year on a job whose mission as CEO was “to make sure this company has the right strategies in place to sustain long term growth and to ultimately double the size and value of our business.”
But Knight said Monday that he and Perez eventually could not agree on that strategy.
“It was too much a difference in industries, too much a difference in companies, too much a difference in brands and too much a difference in culture,” Knight said.
John Horan, publisher of the Sporting Goods Intelligence, said Knight originally chose Perez because of his experience marketing multiple brands of products.
“It’s a very, very unique culture,” Horan said of Nike and the athletic shoe industry, which was built around performance products that appealed to runners and other athletes before it began expanding to a broader consumer base.
Now Nike owns other brands, such as Converse and the Cole Haan fashion shoes and accessories line, and it is moving into more diverse markets.
“The whole reason for bringing Perez in was because he had a real multibrand background,” Horan said.
Parker said during the analyst conference call that he plans no changes in strategy for Nike.
“I really think we’re confident that our Nike Inc. growth strategy is the right one,” Parker said.

Parker, 50, joined Nike in 1979 and is considered the visionary behind the Nike Air franchise and many other innovations, Nike said, and one of the key executives leading the company’s long-term strategic planning
Charlie Denson, who had been co-president of the Nike brand, will remain as president.
Knight, 67, who founded Nike in 1968 along with Bill Bowerman, stepped down as CEO in December 2004 — at age 66 — but remained chairman. At the time, Knight suggested he would still play a major role as “an active chairman.”
Analyst John Shanley of Susquehanna Financial Group said Perez was a rare outsider in the Nike house and had a different idea about how to move shoes. Rather than relying on Nike’s high-profile advertising campaigns, Perez worked the phones and met with retailers, Shanley said.
Knight “has always felt that retailers get in his way,” Shanley said. “Perez took a very opposite way in reaching out. ... That sounds a little bizarre, but some of the retailers that had been in Nike’s top 10 accounts had not spoken with a Nike CEO.”
Shanley said, though, that it was too early to say whether Perez’s attempts to change the marketing culture were part of the reason for his departure.

He went to high school at Western Reserve Academy, a private coeducational boarding school in Hudson, Ohio, before attending Cornell University, where he was a member of Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity. In addition, Perez has a graduate degree from the Thunderbird School of Global Management.

Perez received $8 million in severance pay.[2]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
