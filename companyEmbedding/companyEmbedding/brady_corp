Products[edit]
The company's main product lines are in safety identification, regulatory compliance, brand protection, laboratory identification and specimen tracking, visitor access, voice and data communications and precision die-cut components. They include do-it-yourself printing systems, labeling materials,[4] signs and software, and lockout/tagout, spill control and regulatory compliance devices. Brady sells through distribution channels and e-commerce websites like bradyid.com.
As a specialty business-to-business manufacturer, the company's products are rarely obvious to the general public, being mainly used inside manufacturing facilities, public buildings, computers, airplanes, and mobile phones. Prominent usages include:

Brady markers identified every pipe in the Manhattan Project's weapons plant in the 1940s.
Brady has supplied helmet logos for a number of NFL teams including the Green Bay Packers.
Brady Contract Services used on North Slope during construction of the Alaska gas pipeline.
Brady SPC sorbent products helped clean up the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.[5] More than 500,000 feet of oil booms, thousands of nets, 600 bales of absorbent pads, and more than a million feet of other materials absorbed spilled oil from the water.

History[edit]
Brady's first products were promotional calendars, painted signs and point of purchase displays. The company survived the Great Depression by producing hundreds of millions of push cards: small paperboard cards with rows of perforated circles concealing numbers, which fitted into Brady's established business of printing, die cutting and laminating.
1940s—During World War II, Brady developed the wire marker card - numbered cloth strips on an adhesive card. These strips could be used by electricians and assembly workers by wrapping them around electrical wires, creating a numbering system to identify components.
1950s & 1960s—Brady moved to Milwaukee, in an era of sustained growth. Brady became known as a specialist in identification materials, improving its existing products and developing new ones. In addition to new products, the company developed proprietary machines that could laminate, die cut, print and cut to length in a single operation, boosting production volumes and reducing costs.
1970s—Having sold their products through distribution and mail order since 1947, the company in 1970s established subsidiaries in England, Belgium, Germany, France and Australia. By 1980, international subsidiaries accounted for 20 percent of sales.
1980s—In 1981, Brady acquired Seton, a direct marketing business that sold nearly identical products. Seton's catalog mailings rose from 1 million in 1981 to 8 million in 1988 and in 1985. Subsidiaries were established in England, Canada and Germany by 1988.
1990s—Product lines evolved with developments in technology. The company introduced printing systems enabling customers to print their own safety signs, labels and identification products on-site. Software, along with printers, scanners and bar code labels introduced automatic identification and data collection. New high-performance materials were developed for circuit board manufacturing, and mobile phones opened a new market for the company's die-cut products.
2000s—was a period of growth through acquisition. More than 35 acquisitions led to a tripling in size[6] between 2003 and 2010.
Sustainability[edit]
The Brady Corporation says it takes a comprehensive approach to the sustainability of the company, its customers and the communities in which it operates. In 2012, it issued its first annual sustainability report.
The company says its operations focuses on reducing waste, conserving energy,[7] using natural resources responsibly and promoting employee safety. For example, in 2010 Brady became a Smartway Transport partner in the U.S. while in 2009 it opened a facility in Egelsbach, Germany, that uses a geothermic heating and cooling system. It says it uses Design for Environment principles to design eco-friendly products including halogen-free flame-retardant labels and ribbons.
In its communities, it operates through strategic philanthropy and employee engagement. Charitable giving through the Brady Corporation Foundation and Brady Corporation has increased 10-fold over the past five years and gift-in-kind donations have surpassed $1 million. Recent projects include a third China Hope School[8] in Sichuan Province; "Brady Corporation, Jr.,"[9] an interactive exhibit that teaches preschoolers about manufacturing at the Betty Brinn Children's Museum in Milwaukee; and funding college educations through I Have a Dream[5] for a class of students at Clarke Street Elementary School.
International Expansion[edit]
1947: Brady began selling its products internationally, to South Africa.
1950s: First European sales office in U.K., and operations in Canada.
1960s & 1970s: Expansion throughout Europe with operations in Belgium, Germany, France and Sweden.
1980s: Entered Asia, Australia, Hong Kong, Japan and Singapore.
1990s: Began operating in Mexico and Brazil with further expansion in Asia to China, Malaysia, Philippines, South Korea, and Taiwan.
2000s (decade): Continued expansion in Asia, Thailand and India as well as expansion into Slovakia in Eastern Europe; Turkey in the Middle East and the United Arab Emirates.
Brady brands[edit]
As a result of acquisitions Brady products are traded under a variety of names and brands, including IDenticard, Seton, Electromark, PDC, Safetyshop, Emedco, JAM, Welco, Scafftag DAWG, Clement Communications & Peronnel Concepts Compliance, BIG Badges, ID Warehouse, Securimed, Stickolor, Precision Dynamics Corporation, Accidental Health & Safety, SPC, Transposafe.

Products[edit]
The company's main product lines are in safety identification, regulatory compliance, brand protection, laboratory identification and specimen tracking, visitor access, voice and data communications and precision die-cut components. They include do-it-yourself printing systems, labeling materials,[4] signs and software, and lockout/tagout, spill control and regulatory compliance devices. Brady sells through distribution channels and e-commerce websites like bradyid.com.
As a specialty business-to-business manufacturer, the company's products are rarely obvious to the general public, being mainly used inside manufacturing facilities, public buildings, computers, airplanes, and mobile phones. Prominent usages include:

Brady markers identified every pipe in the Manhattan Project's weapons plant in the 1940s.
Brady has supplied helmet logos for a number of NFL teams including the Green Bay Packers.
Brady Contract Services used on North Slope during construction of the Alaska gas pipeline.
Brady SPC sorbent products helped clean up the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.[5] More than 500,000 feet of oil booms, thousands of nets, 600 bales of absorbent pads, and more than a million feet of other materials absorbed spilled oil from the water.

History[edit]
Brady's first products were promotional calendars, painted signs and point of purchase displays. The company survived the Great Depression by producing hundreds of millions of push cards: small paperboard cards with rows of perforated circles concealing numbers, which fitted into Brady's established business of printing, die cutting and laminating.
1940s—During World War II, Brady developed the wire marker card - numbered cloth strips on an adhesive card. These strips could be used by electricians and assembly workers by wrapping them around electrical wires, creating a numbering system to identify components.
1950s & 1960s—Brady moved to Milwaukee, in an era of sustained growth. Brady became known as a specialist in identification materials, improving its existing products and developing new ones. In addition to new products, the company developed proprietary machines that could laminate, die cut, print and cut to length in a single operation, boosting production volumes and reducing costs.
1970s—Having sold their products through distribution and mail order since 1947, the company in 1970s established subsidiaries in England, Belgium, Germany, France and Australia. By 1980, international subsidiaries accounted for 20 percent of sales.
1980s—In 1981, Brady acquired Seton, a direct marketing business that sold nearly identical products. Seton's catalog mailings rose from 1 million in 1981 to 8 million in 1988 and in 1985. Subsidiaries were established in England, Canada and Germany by 1988.
1990s—Product lines evolved with developments in technology. The company introduced printing systems enabling customers to print their own safety signs, labels and identification products on-site. Software, along with printers, scanners and bar code labels introduced automatic identification and data collection. New high-performance materials were developed for circuit board manufacturing, and mobile phones opened a new market for the company's die-cut products.
2000s—was a period of growth through acquisition. More than 35 acquisitions led to a tripling in size[6] between 2003 and 2010.
Sustainability[edit]
The Brady Corporation says it takes a comprehensive approach to the sustainability of the company, its customers and the communities in which it operates. In 2012, it issued its first annual sustainability report.
The company says its operations focuses on reducing waste, conserving energy,[7] using natural resources responsibly and promoting employee safety. For example, in 2010 Brady became a Smartway Transport partner in the U.S. while in 2009 it opened a facility in Egelsbach, Germany, that uses a geothermic heating and cooling system. It says it uses Design for Environment principles to design eco-friendly products including halogen-free flame-retardant labels and ribbons.
In its communities, it operates through strategic philanthropy and employee engagement. Charitable giving through the Brady Corporation Foundation and Brady Corporation has increased 10-fold over the past five years and gift-in-kind donations have surpassed $1 million. Recent projects include a third China Hope School[8] in Sichuan Province; "Brady Corporation, Jr.,"[9] an interactive exhibit that teaches preschoolers about manufacturing at the Betty Brinn Children's Museum in Milwaukee; and funding college educations through I Have a Dream[5] for a class of students at Clarke Street Elementary School.
International Expansion[edit]
1947: Brady began selling its products internationally, to South Africa.
1950s: First European sales office in U.K., and operations in Canada.
1960s & 1970s: Expansion throughout Europe with operations in Belgium, Germany, France and Sweden.
1980s: Entered Asia, Australia, Hong Kong, Japan and Singapore.
1990s: Began operating in Mexico and Brazil with further expansion in Asia to China, Malaysia, Philippines, South Korea, and Taiwan.
2000s (decade): Continued expansion in Asia, Thailand and India as well as expansion into Slovakia in Eastern Europe; Turkey in the Middle East and the United Arab Emirates.
Brady brands[edit]
As a result of acquisitions Brady products are traded under a variety of names and brands, including IDenticard, Seton, Electromark, PDC, Safetyshop, Emedco, JAM, Welco, Scafftag DAWG, Clement Communications & Peronnel Concepts Compliance, BIG Badges, ID Warehouse, Securimed, Stickolor, Precision Dynamics Corporation, Accidental Health & Safety, SPC, Transposafe.

Products[edit]
The company's main product lines are in safety identification, regulatory compliance, brand protection, laboratory identification and specimen tracking, visitor access, voice and data communications and precision die-cut components. They include do-it-yourself printing systems, labeling materials,[4] signs and software, and lockout/tagout, spill control and regulatory compliance devices. Brady sells through distribution channels and e-commerce websites like bradyid.com.
As a specialty business-to-business manufacturer, the company's products are rarely obvious to the general public, being mainly used inside manufacturing facilities, public buildings, computers, airplanes, and mobile phones. Prominent usages include:

Brady markers identified every pipe in the Manhattan Project's weapons plant in the 1940s.
Brady has supplied helmet logos for a number of NFL teams including the Green Bay Packers.
Brady Contract Services used on North Slope during construction of the Alaska gas pipeline.
Brady SPC sorbent products helped clean up the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.[5] More than 500,000 feet of oil booms, thousands of nets, 600 bales of absorbent pads, and more than a million feet of other materials absorbed spilled oil from the water.

History[edit]
Brady's first products were promotional calendars, painted signs and point of purchase displays. The company survived the Great Depression by producing hundreds of millions of push cards: small paperboard cards with rows of perforated circles concealing numbers, which fitted into Brady's established business of printing, die cutting and laminating.
1940s—During World War II, Brady developed the wire marker card - numbered cloth strips on an adhesive card. These strips could be used by electricians and assembly workers by wrapping them around electrical wires, creating a numbering system to identify components.
1950s & 1960s—Brady moved to Milwaukee, in an era of sustained growth. Brady became known as a specialist in identification materials, improving its existing products and developing new ones. In addition to new products, the company developed proprietary machines that could laminate, die cut, print and cut to length in a single operation, boosting production volumes and reducing costs.
1970s—Having sold their products through distribution and mail order since 1947, the company in 1970s established subsidiaries in England, Belgium, Germany, France and Australia. By 1980, international subsidiaries accounted for 20 percent of sales.
1980s—In 1981, Brady acquired Seton, a direct marketing business that sold nearly identical products. Seton's catalog mailings rose from 1 million in 1981 to 8 million in 1988 and in 1985. Subsidiaries were established in England, Canada and Germany by 1988.
1990s—Product lines evolved with developments in technology. The company introduced printing systems enabling customers to print their own safety signs, labels and identification products on-site. Software, along with printers, scanners and bar code labels introduced automatic identification and data collection. New high-performance materials were developed for circuit board manufacturing, and mobile phones opened a new market for the company's die-cut products.
2000s—was a period of growth through acquisition. More than 35 acquisitions led to a tripling in size[6] between 2003 and 2010.
Sustainability[edit]
The Brady Corporation says it takes a comprehensive approach to the sustainability of the company, its customers and the communities in which it operates. In 2012, it issued its first annual sustainability report.
The company says its operations focuses on reducing waste, conserving energy,[7] using natural resources responsibly and promoting employee safety. For example, in 2010 Brady became a Smartway Transport partner in the U.S. while in 2009 it opened a facility in Egelsbach, Germany, that uses a geothermic heating and cooling system. It says it uses Design for Environment principles to design eco-friendly products including halogen-free flame-retardant labels and ribbons.
In its communities, it operates through strategic philanthropy and employee engagement. Charitable giving through the Brady Corporation Foundation and Brady Corporation has increased 10-fold over the past five years and gift-in-kind donations have surpassed $1 million. Recent projects include a third China Hope School[8] in Sichuan Province; "Brady Corporation, Jr.,"[9] an interactive exhibit that teaches preschoolers about manufacturing at the Betty Brinn Children's Museum in Milwaukee; and funding college educations through I Have a Dream[5] for a class of students at Clarke Street Elementary School.
International Expansion[edit]
1947: Brady began selling its products internationally, to South Africa.
1950s: First European sales office in U.K., and operations in Canada.
1960s & 1970s: Expansion throughout Europe with operations in Belgium, Germany, France and Sweden.
1980s: Entered Asia, Australia, Hong Kong, Japan and Singapore.
1990s: Began operating in Mexico and Brazil with further expansion in Asia to China, Malaysia, Philippines, South Korea, and Taiwan.
2000s (decade): Continued expansion in Asia, Thailand and India as well as expansion into Slovakia in Eastern Europe; Turkey in the Middle East and the United Arab Emirates.
Brady brands[edit]
As a result of acquisitions Brady products are traded under a variety of names and brands, including IDenticard, Seton, Electromark, PDC, Safetyshop, Emedco, JAM, Welco, Scafftag DAWG, Clement Communications & Peronnel Concepts Compliance, BIG Badges, ID Warehouse, Securimed, Stickolor, Precision Dynamics Corporation, Accidental Health & Safety, SPC, Transposafe.

Brady Corporation Acquires Sorbent 
      Products Co., Inc.






April 12, 2007 09:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



MILWAUKEE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Brady Corporation (NYSE:BRC) has announced that it has acquired Sorbent 
      Products Co., Inc. (SPC) headquartered in Somerset, NJ. Terms of the 
      transaction were not disclosed.
    


      SPC is a leading manufacturer and marketer of synthetic sorbent 
      materials used in a variety of industrial maintenance and environmental 
      applications for spill clean-up, containment and control. Available in a 
      variety of shapes, sizes and configurations, SPC sorbents and spill kits 
      are used indoors and outdoors in virtually every type of industrial 
      market and environmental sector. The company, founded in 1977, has 
      manufacturing operations in the U.S., Belgium and Hong Kong. With sales 
      of approximately $47 million in 2006, SPC employs 170 people.
    

      The acquisition of SPC allows Brady to broaden its product portfolio for 
      the MRO market, enhance its position as a provider of products that 
      protect premises, and further add value for Brady distributors.
    

“We are excited to add sorbents to our product 
      offering of safety and facility products sold through our distribution 
      partners. These are highly successful and important consumable products 
      that will help to further grow the wide range of other Brady products 
      that identify and protect the premises of our customers,” 
      said Matt Williamson, president, Brady Americas. “SPC 
      is a customer-driven company committed to their distributors and is 
      focused on quality products that will fit well with Brady’s 
      culture of exceptional performance.”


“We’re delighted to 
      join the strong team at Brady. After 30 years as a family business, we 
      can now move to the next level in partnership with a company that has a 
      strong global infrastructure, a diverse customer base and a wide range 
      of MRO products. This is a great opportunity for both our employees and 
      our customers,” said Mike Hobin, president, 
      Sorbent Products.
    

      Brady Corporation is an international manufacturer and marketer of 
      complete solutions that identify and protect premises, products and 
      people. Its products help customers increase safety, security, 
      productivity and performance and include high-performance labels and 
      signs, safety devices, printing systems and software, and precision

      customers in electronics, telecommunications, manufacturing, electrical, 
      construction, education, medical and a variety of other industries. 
      Brady is headquartered in Milwaukee and employs more than 9,000 people 
      at operations in the Americas, Europe and Asia/Pacific. Brady’s 
      fiscal 2006 sales were approximately $1.018 billion.
    

      More information is available on the Internet at www.bradycorp.com, 
      and www.sorbentproducts.com.
    

      Brady believes that certain statements in this news release are “forward-looking 
      statements” within the meaning of the Private 
      Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements related to 
      future, not past, events included in this news release, including, 
      without limitation, statements regarding Brady's future financial 
      position, business strategy, targets, projected sales, costs, earnings, 
      capital expenditures, debt levels and cash flows, and plans and 
      objectives of management for future operations are forward-looking 
      statements. When used in this news release, words such as “may,”
“will,” “expect,”
“intend,” “estimate,”
“anticipate,” “believe,”
“should,” “project” 
      or “plan” or 
      similar terminology are generally intended to identify forward-looking 
      statements. These forward-looking statements by their nature address 
      matters that are, to different degrees, uncertain and are subject to 
      risks, assumptions and other factors, some of which are beyond Brady's 
      control, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those 
      expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. For Brady, 
      uncertainties arise from future financial performance of major markets 
      Brady serves, which include, without limitation, telecommunications, 
      manufacturing, electrical, construction, laboratory, education, 
      governmental, public utility, computer, transportation; difficulties in 
      making and integrating acquisitions; risks associated with newly 
      acquired businesses; Brady's ability to retain significant contracts and 
      customers; future competition; Brady's ability to develop and 
      successfully market new products; changes in the supply of, or price 
      for, parts and components; increased price pressure from suppliers and 
      customers; interruptions to sources of supply; environmental, health and 
      safety compliance costs and liabilities; Brady's ability to realize cost 
      savings from operating initiatives; Brady's ability to attract and 
      retain key talent; difficulties associated with exports; risks 
      associated with international operations; fluctuations in currency rates 
      versus the US dollar; technology changes; potential write-offs of 
      Brady's substantial intangible assets; risks associated with obtaining 
      governmental approvals and maintaining regulatory compliance for new and 
      existing products; business interruptions due to implementing business 
      systems; and numerous other matters of national, regional and global 
      scale, including those of a political, economic, business, competitive 
      and regulatory nature contained from time to time in Brady's U.S. 
      Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including, but not limited 
      to, those factors listed in the "Risk Factors" section located in Item 
      1A of Part II of Brady's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended 
      July 31, 2006. These uncertainties may cause Brady's actual future 
      results to be materially different than those expressed in its 
      forward-looking statements. Brady does not undertake to update its 
      forward-looking statements.

Products[edit]
The company's main product lines are in safety identification, regulatory compliance, brand protection, laboratory identification and specimen tracking, visitor access, voice and data communications and precision die-cut components. They include do-it-yourself printing systems, labeling materials,[4] signs and software, and lockout/tagout, spill control and regulatory compliance devices. Brady sells through distribution channels and e-commerce websites like bradyid.com.
As a specialty business-to-business manufacturer, the company's products are rarely obvious to the general public, being mainly used inside manufacturing facilities, public buildings, computers, airplanes, and mobile phones. Prominent usages include:

Brady markers identified every pipe in the Manhattan Project's weapons plant in the 1940s.
Brady has supplied helmet logos for a number of NFL teams including the Green Bay Packers.
Brady Contract Services used on North Slope during construction of the Alaska gas pipeline.
Brady SPC sorbent products helped clean up the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.[5] More than 500,000 feet of oil booms, thousands of nets, 600 bales of absorbent pads, and more than a million feet of other materials absorbed spilled oil from the water.

History[edit]
Brady's first products were promotional calendars, painted signs and point of purchase displays. The company survived the Great Depression by producing hundreds of millions of push cards: small paperboard cards with rows of perforated circles concealing numbers, which fitted into Brady's established business of printing, die cutting and laminating.
1940s—During World War II, Brady developed the wire marker card - numbered cloth strips on an adhesive card. These strips could be used by electricians and assembly workers by wrapping them around electrical wires, creating a numbering system to identify components.
1950s & 1960s—Brady moved to Milwaukee, in an era of sustained growth. Brady became known as a specialist in identification materials, improving its existing products and developing new ones. In addition to new products, the company developed proprietary machines that could laminate, die cut, print and cut to length in a single operation, boosting production volumes and reducing costs.
1970s—Having sold their products through distribution and mail order since 1947, the company in 1970s established subsidiaries in England, Belgium, Germany, France and Australia. By 1980, international subsidiaries accounted for 20 percent of sales.
1980s—In 1981, Brady acquired Seton, a direct marketing business that sold nearly identical products. Seton's catalog mailings rose from 1 million in 1981 to 8 million in 1988 and in 1985. Subsidiaries were established in England, Canada and Germany by 1988.
1990s—Product lines evolved with developments in technology. The company introduced printing systems enabling customers to print their own safety signs, labels and identification products on-site. Software, along with printers, scanners and bar code labels introduced automatic identification and data collection. New high-performance materials were developed for circuit board manufacturing, and mobile phones opened a new market for the company's die-cut products.
2000s—was a period of growth through acquisition. More than 35 acquisitions led to a tripling in size[6] between 2003 and 2010.
Sustainability[edit]
The Brady Corporation says it takes a comprehensive approach to the sustainability of the company, its customers and the communities in which it operates. In 2012, it issued its first annual sustainability report.
The company says its operations focuses on reducing waste, conserving energy,[7] using natural resources responsibly and promoting employee safety. For example, in 2010 Brady became a Smartway Transport partner in the U.S. while in 2009 it opened a facility in Egelsbach, Germany, that uses a geothermic heating and cooling system. It says it uses Design for Environment principles to design eco-friendly products including halogen-free flame-retardant labels and ribbons.
In its communities, it operates through strategic philanthropy and employee engagement. Charitable giving through the Brady Corporation Foundation and Brady Corporation has increased 10-fold over the past five years and gift-in-kind donations have surpassed $1 million. Recent projects include a third China Hope School[8] in Sichuan Province; "Brady Corporation, Jr.,"[9] an interactive exhibit that teaches preschoolers about manufacturing at the Betty Brinn Children's Museum in Milwaukee; and funding college educations through I Have a Dream[5] for a class of students at Clarke Street Elementary School.
International Expansion[edit]
1947: Brady began selling its products internationally, to South Africa.
1950s: First European sales office in U.K., and operations in Canada.
1960s & 1970s: Expansion throughout Europe with operations in Belgium, Germany, France and Sweden.
1980s: Entered Asia, Australia, Hong Kong, Japan and Singapore.
1990s: Began operating in Mexico and Brazil with further expansion in Asia to China, Malaysia, Philippines, South Korea, and Taiwan.
2000s (decade): Continued expansion in Asia, Thailand and India as well as expansion into Slovakia in Eastern Europe; Turkey in the Middle East and the United Arab Emirates.

As a result of acquisitions Brady products are traded under a variety of names and brands, including IDenticard, Seton, Electromark, PDC, Safetyshop, Emedco, JAM, Welco, Scafftag DAWG, Clement Communications & Peronnel Concepts Compliance, BIG Badges, ID Warehouse, Securimed, Stickolor, Precision Dynamics Corporation, Accidental Health & Safety, SPC, Transposafe.

New high-performance materials were developed for circuit board manufacturing, and mobile phones opened a new market for the company's die-cut products.
2000s—was a period of growth through acquisition. More than 35 acquisitions led to a tripling in size[6] between 2003 and 2010.

The company says its operations focuses on reducing waste, conserving energy,[7] using natural resources responsibly and promoting employee safety. For example, in 2010 Brady became a Smartway Transport partner in the U.S. while in 2009 it opened a facility in Egelsbach, Germany, that uses a geothermic heating and cooling system. It says it uses Design for Environment principles to design eco-friendly products including halogen-free flame-retardant labels and ribbons.
In its communities, it operates through strategic philanthropy and employee engagement. Charitable giving through the Brady Corporation Foundation and Brady Corporation has increased 10-fold over the past five years and gift-in-kind donations have surpassed $1 million. Recent projects include a third China Hope School[8] in Sichuan Province; "Brady Corporation, Jr.,"[9] an interactive exhibit that teaches preschoolers about manufacturing at the Betty Brinn Children's Museum in Milwaukee; and funding college educations through I Have a Dream[5] for a class of students at Clarke Street Elementary School.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
