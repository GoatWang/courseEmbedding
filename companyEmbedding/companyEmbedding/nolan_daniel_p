        Amazing things Nolan's made    

            Payment24        









            Recommendations                    


























Janko Milunovic
 FinTech Advisor at Roland Berger recommended Payment24 where Nolan is Co-Founder


                                    Payment24 is probably the best-performing company from our 2016 batch, an amazing team that started off in Africa and now is looking to expand to the Central & Eastern Europe and South America. 

Their biggest strength lies in their founders, tremendous traction (achieved in a very short period of time), and a unique product technology. 

Therefore, I consider Payment24 as a great investment opportunity that is under the radar for most of the European VCs.
