Our approach

Leaders of small and mid-sized businesses have multiple roles and competing priorities. You want a best-in-class retirement plan but may be unsure about all the complexities and requirements. You may be uncertain about the costs and fees involved. You need a provider focused solely on retirement and aligned with your needs and goals—and fully committed to you, your participants, and the ongoing improvement of retirement investing.

Vanguard is committed to the retirement business and is a leader in the retirement plan industry. Best of all, you can benefit from Vanguard's unique ownership structure: We're owned by our clients and not by outside investors or stockholders. That means you never need to question whose interests come first for us. This approach serves as a foundation for all that we do with Vanguard Retirement Plan Access™, our 401(k) offer for small and mid-sized plans. You can count on our expertise to remove the uncertainties from managing your plan and our leadership to help you offer a strong plan for your participants. 



Key benefits




You can:

Have confidence in your plan.
Understand your costs.
Focus on your business.





Cost-conscious?
As a business owner and plan fiduciary, you want to eliminate ambiguity in retirement plan costs. Research has shown that plan costs for the smaller end of the market tend to be higher, and you need a retirement plan provider that not only provides transparent pricing but has a fair and reasonable cost structure.1
With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access:

You receive an All-in Fee Report that shows the total cost of your plan.
You have access to low-cost Vanguard index funds, plus the opportunity to choose from among more than 12,000 non-Vanguard funds.
Your annual recordkeeping price is based on a per-participant fee—a fee that doesn't jump as your assets grow, as with many small to mid-sized retirement plans.
You have flexibility in how you cover your plan costs—including a recordkeeping credit depending on the share class selected.




Too busy?
 As a business owner, you're pressed for time and focused on many aspects of business. With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access, you can rely on high-quality recordkeeping and administration to ease your administrative burden and help your employees stay on track for retirement.

Advisory services
Many organizations like yours find it challenging to oversee their portfolio while also managing the day-to-day responsibilities of running their endowment, foundation, or charitable organization. But partnering with a provider who understands your needs can help you better balance these competing priorities.
Partnering with your organization
Vanguard Institutional Advisory Services® (VIAS) offers nonprofits the considerable resources of a large investment firm like Vanguard with the customized service of a specialized boutique. When your organization partners with VIAS, you work with a team of investment professionals that has your objectives and fiduciary responsibilities in mind. VIAS strives to:

Understand your organization's mission, spending needs, and unique situation and offer sophisticated, unbiased advice.
Develop a low-cost portfolio customized to your organization's needs.
Relieve your staff of many of the day-to-day burdens of investment program management.

OCIO: One service, many names


One approach nonprofits are increasingly considering is an outsourced chief investment officer (OCIO). An OCIO service—which is a key offering of Vanguard Institutional Advisory Services—acts as an extension of the board and investment staff. The OCIO determines an asset allocation strategy, selects investment advisors to implement it, and manages its operation and execution. Investment providers and clients call this service a variety of names, including discretionary management, advisory services, and investment management.





Investing and advising
Optimizing your portfolio to meet your long-term investment objectives requires time and skill. VIAS helps you develop a tailored portfolio that ensures your investments are diversified, risk-appropriate, and aligned with your overall strategy.
Our comprehensive advisory services include:









Portfolio construction 

Asset allocation analysis that uses a distinct, proprietary model to deliver solutions based on your portfolio needs.
Investment policy consulting designed to meet the unique investment goals of your organization.
Customized product selection that focuses on low-cost index and active investments.











Portfolio management

Performance reporting to help keep your investment committee informed.
Investment reviews that provide insights into your portfolio and the broader market and economic environment.
Steadfast commitment to risk management and process excellence through ongoing portfolio monitoring and rebalancing.








Research & expertise

Investment expertise and commentary on financial issues that provide context for your decision-making.
Investment committee best practices that are designed to increase your group's effectiveness.





Notes:

Advice services offered through Vanguard Institutional Advisory Services are provided by Vanguard Advisers, Inc., a registered investment advisor.
All investments are subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. 
Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss in a declining market.

Advisory services
Many DB plan sponsors find it challenging to oversee plan portfolios while also managing other day-to-day responsibilities for their organizations. But partnering with a provider who understands your needs can help you better balance these competing priorities.
Partnering with your organization
Vanguard Institutional Advisory Services® (VIAS) offers DB plan sponsors the considerable resources of a large investment firm like Vanguard with the customized service of a specialized boutique. When your organization partners with VIAS, you work with a team of investment professionals that has your plan and organization objectives and fiduciary responsibilities in mind.
OCIO: One service, many names


One approach defined benefit plans are increasingly considering is an outsourced chief investment officer (OCIO). An OCIO service—which is a key offering of Vanguard Institutional Advisory Services—acts as an extension of the board and investment staff. The OCIO determines an asset allocation strategy, selects investment advisors to implement it, and manages its operation and execution. Investment providers and clients call this service a variety of names, including discretionary management, advisory services, and investment management.





Optimizing your portfolio to meet your short- and long-term goals
Whether your DB plan is open or frozen, underfunded or approaching full funding, or if plan termination is a possibility, VIAS will help you develop a tailored portfolio that ensures your plan investments are risk-appropriate, designed to achieve and maintain full funding, and aligned with your overall strategy. It does this by: 
Understanding your organization, your plan objectives, and your obligations. 
Developing a dynamic investment policy statement that identifies appropriate asset allocation strategies, including funded status triggers, to change the allocation to preserve gains in DB plan funded status.
Based on a proven investment philosophy, constructing a portfolio glide path to full funding and implementing that strategy.
Selecting the best investment minds to manage your portfolio.
Providing ongoing oversight, consultation, and reporting. 

Our comprehensive advisory services include:









Portfolio construction 

Asset-liability modeling—or ALM—to assess your plan's strategic asset allocation relative to its liability.
Investment policy consulting that sets your plan on a path to full funding.
Product selection that focuses on low-cost investments.











Portfolio management

Performance reporting to help keep your investment committee informed.
Investment reviews that provide insightsinto your DB portfolio and the broader market and economic environment.
Daily funded status monitor that flags funded status changes or when a trigger spelled out in our dynamic investment policy statement has been reached to change the asset allocation according to the plan's glide path.








Research & expertise

Investment expertise and commentary on financial issues that provide context for your decision-making.
Investment committee best practices that are designed to increase your group's effectiveness. 





Notes:

Advice services offered through Vanguard Institutional Advisory Services are provided by Vanguard Advisers, Inc., a registered investment advisor.
All investments are subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest.

Pessimism’s Pitfalls as an Investment Strategy: The Perils of the “Next Subprime”

Investors, CEOs, and regulators learned from the
Great Recession in ways that make the
“next subprime” crisis less likely. Rather
than fall prey to elaborate narratives of ruin,
or the tendency to expect that the next
recession will look like the last one, investors
would be better served to focus on conventional
risks and opportunities.The best investment
strategies will continue to be those that
outperform the market in most years rather
than those that deliver spectacular returns
in one year out of one hundred.

Our Business







Carlyle’s Global Alternative Asset Management Platform
We are one of the world’s largest and most diversified alternative asset management firms. We manage 287 investment vehicles that invest across four segments, 11 core industries and six continents. Our global size, scale and brand enable us to access opportunities in virtually every market around the world.





 
















Carlyle's Business Segments







 

Corporate Private Equity
Corporate Private Equity
Carlyle’s Corporate Private Equity segment, established in 1990 with our first U.S. buyout fund, has Assets Under Management of $53 billion and more than 275 investment professionals. Our 30 Corporate Private Equity funds are organized by geography or industry and are advised by separate teams of professionals who live and work in the markets where they invest. We believe this diversity of funds allows us to deploy more targeted and specialized investment expertise and strategies and offers our fund investors the ability to better tailor their investment choices. Our Corporate Private Equity teams have two primary areas of focus:
Buyout Funds. Our buyout teams advise a diverse group of 20 funds that focus either on a particular geography (Asia, Europe, Japan, Middle East and North Africa (MENA), South America, Sub-Saharan Africa or the United States), or a particular industry (e.g., financial services).
Growth Capital Funds. Our 10 growth capital funds are advised by three regionally-focused teams in Asia, Europe and the United States, with each team focused on middle-market and growth companies consistent with specific regional investment considerations. As of March 31, 2017, our growth capital funds had, in the aggregate, more than $6 billion in AUM.





 

Real Assets
Real Assets
Carlyle’s $36 billion Real Assets segment, established in 1997 with our first U.S. real estate fund, has 139 investment professionals managing 19 carry funds and 8 NGP management fee funds and carry funds focused on real estate, infrastructure, energy and power. Our 10 real estate funds pursue investment opportunities in Asia, Europe and the United States, while our energy and power funds focus on buyouts, growth capital investments and strategic joint ventures in the midstream, upstream, oilfield services and power generation sectors.







 

Global Market Strategies
Global Market Strategies 
Carlyle’s Global Market Strategies segment, established in 1999 with our first high yield fund, has a group of 57 funds that pursue investment opportunities across various types of credit, equities and alternative instruments, and (with regards to certain macroeconomic strategies) currencies, commodities and interest rate products and their derivatives. These funds, with AUM of $29 billion and more than 100 investment professionals, include:
Carry Funds. We have six carry funds in three different strategies: distressed and corporate opportunities (including liquid trading portfolios and control investments); corporate mezzanine (targeting middle market companies); and energy mezzanine opportunities (targeting debt investments in energy and power projects and companies).
Structured Credit Funds. Our 47 structured credit funds invest primarily in performing senior secured bank loans through structured vehicles and other investment products.

Financial advisors use their knowledge of investments, 
tax laws, and insurance to recommend financial options to individuals.
The SEC typically regulates investment advisers that have assets under management in excess of $25,000,000. Investment advisers that do not meet this threshold generally are regulated by the states. The SEC registers IA firms but does not separately register individual representatives of IA firms. The states register IA firms, and many separately register individual investment adviser representatives.

Currently, you can only search for IA firms on this website. In the future, this website also will provide the ability to search for individual investment adviser representatives.

In 1996 Congress amended the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to require that the SEC establish a readily accessible electronic process to respond to public inquiries about investment advisers and their disciplinary information. The SEC created this website to satisfy Congress? mandate.

Our approach

Leaders of small and mid-sized businesses have multiple roles and competing priorities. You want a best-in-class retirement plan but may be unsure about all the complexities and requirements. You may be uncertain about the costs and fees involved. You need a provider focused solely on retirement and aligned with your needs and goals—and fully committed to you, your participants, and the ongoing improvement of retirement investing.

Vanguard is committed to the retirement business and is a leader in the retirement plan industry. Best of all, you can benefit from Vanguard's unique ownership structure: We're owned by our clients and not by outside investors or stockholders. That means you never need to question whose interests come first for us. This approach serves as a foundation for all that we do with Vanguard Retirement Plan Access™, our 401(k) offer for small and mid-sized plans. You can count on our expertise to remove the uncertainties from managing your plan and our leadership to help you offer a strong plan for your participants. 



Key benefits




You can:

Have confidence in your plan.
Understand your costs.
Focus on your business.





Cost-conscious?
As a business owner and plan fiduciary, you want to eliminate ambiguity in retirement plan costs. Research has shown that plan costs for the smaller end of the market tend to be higher, and you need a retirement plan provider that not only provides transparent pricing but has a fair and reasonable cost structure.1
With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access:

You receive an All-in Fee Report that shows the total cost of your plan.
You have access to low-cost Vanguard index funds, plus the opportunity to choose from among more than 12,000 non-Vanguard funds.
Your annual recordkeeping price is based on a per-participant fee—a fee that doesn't jump as your assets grow, as with many small to mid-sized retirement plans.
You have flexibility in how you cover your plan costs—including a recordkeeping credit depending on the share class selected.




Too busy?
 As a business owner, you're pressed for time and focused on many aspects of business. With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access, you can rely on high-quality recordkeeping and administration to ease your administrative burden and help your employees stay on track for retirement.
