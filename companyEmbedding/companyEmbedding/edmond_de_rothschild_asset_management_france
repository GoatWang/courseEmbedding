Outlook & Convictions n°1

This publication presents Edmond de Rothschild’s key convictions for macroeconomics, asset allocation strategy, and the principal asset classes.











A highly charged day for Gitana Team

At 08:30 GMT this Monday, the first oceanic trimaran designed to fly offshore was launched in Vannes, south-west Brittany, under the proud gaze of her owners, Ariane and Benjamin de Rothschild, her designers and builders, and of course the whole of Gitana Team supporting skipper Sébastien Josse. 











Sustainable development lies at the core of the Group’s commitment and the unique nature of its investment product offering

The Edmond de Rothschild Group’s 2016 Sustainable Development Report has just been released. In their introductory message, Ariane and Benjamin de Rothschild focus on the need to leverage the uniqueness of the Group which incorporates sustainable development as a central theme in its commitment, reflecting our ability to anticipate and respond in innovative ways to the changing outside world and our aspiration to make a positive contribution to society’s progress.

Commentary 30/06/2017



                            While the European business climate has reached record levels last seen in 2011, with a marked increase in the most cyclical sectors (building and retail trade), we saw a change of tone at the ECB at the end of June. Interest rates, particularly in the euro zone, were noticeably impacted in Germany and France, following a speech by ECB chief Mario Draghi, who suggested that the ECB should now consider a gradual wind-down to QE. Given this climate, European high yields performed reasonably well. The fund was up +0.3% in June, driven by the single-B compartment (up +0.5%), while the double-BB compartment rose +0.2%. Long bonds with a limited cushion spread suffered most from the hike in European core rates. The primary market momentum continued. There were no less than 12.5 billion new issues in June, the largest monthly issue since April 2017 and September 2016. One of the largest was for Intrum-Justitia, a Scandinavian credit services player, with various tranches totalling 3 billion. However, note that Manutencoop experienced some difficulties in issuing a 5-year bond to refinance existing debt. Several inaugural issuers presented themselves to investors, including the French video production company Banijay, the Italian rail operator Italo, and two US automotive suppliers, Superior Industries and Federal Mogul. The automotive sector was shaken this month in the wake of Schaeffler's profits warning and poor new car sales numbers from the United States. But we must stress that in Europe the M&A theme remained robust with, for example, Europcar's acquisition of Goldcar (well positioned in Spain and Portugal), thus becoming a major player in the low-cost auto-rental segment in Europe.

(1) The rating grades the funds on a scale from 1 to 7. This rating system is based on the average fluctuations of the net asset value over the past five years. It corresponds to the variation range of the portfolio upwards and downwards. If the net asset value is less than 5 years old, the rating is determined by other regulatory calculation methods. Historical data such as those used to calculate the rating may not be a reliable indication of the future risk profile. The current category is neither a guarantee nor an objective. Category 1 does not signify a risk-free investment.
