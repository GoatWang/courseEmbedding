Business Wire




May 28, 2014 9:00 AM EDT













 




























































  Northern Trust Asset Management today announced two leadership appointments to strengthen its focus on strategic priorities and increase alignment of investment sales and servicing activities around key growth channels.   Shundrawn A. Thomas, Northern Trust (Photo: Business Wire)   Shundrawn A. Thomas, who has led the successful launch of the FlexShares exchange-traded fund (ETF) business over the past three years, will expand his responsibilities to oversee all fund activities, including Northern Funds, Northern Institutional Funds and financial intermediary distribution.  Jason J. Tyler, currently Northern Trust’s Head of Corporate Strategy and Market Development, will join the Asset Management business as Head of Client Solutions, with oversight of institutional sales, client relationship management and advisory services, including the Outsourced Chief Investment Officer (OCIO) practice.  “We are pleased to announce these organizational changes, which align our Asset Management activities with strong growth potential under dynamic and strategic leadership,” said Stephen N. Potter, President of Northern Trust Asset Management. “Shundrawn Thomas has taken an entrepreneurial approach to develop one of the fastest-growing ETF families in the world, while Jason Tyler has broad experience in asset management and financial services. With their shared background as strategy leaders at Northern Trust, Shundrawn and Jason bring substantial experience and expertise to these positions.”  Thomas, Executive Vice President and Managing Director of FlexShares, will focus on distribution of ETFs and mutual funds through financial advisors and other intermediary channels. He has 20 years of industry experience and has led FlexShares since 2011, when the ETF business was formed and launched its first funds. FlexShares now manages 15 ETFs, with more than $8 billion in assets under management. Previously, Thomas held senior level positions at Northern Trust including President and Chief Executive of Northern Trust Securities, Inc., and Head of Corporate Strategy. Prior to joining Northern Trust, he worked at Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley in sales, trading and research positions. He received a bachelor’s degree in accounting from Florida A&M University and an MBA with concentrations in finance and accounting from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.

Tint Hints

Throw shade in a fun,
										pretty new way with L'Oréal Colorista Semi-Permanent Hair
										Color. These steps — and the 11 no-commitment colors — make it
										easy to test drive the bold-highlights trend.





Step 1: Tease Please 

Start from the bottom
										layers and work up, coloring diagonal sections. To help new
										color blend gradually with your existing shade near roots,
										lightly backcomb a few inches of each section before applying
										dye.





Step 2: The Brush On

Apply color in a V
										shape, which adds dimension, starting just under the teased
										part. Fill in the bottom half of the V then use the tip of the
										brush to feather the color up into the teased part.





Step 3: Premium Blend

Using your fingers this
										time, backcomb again near roots to further diffuse the line
										between new and existing color. Then use your other hand as a
										base while you brush color through to the ends.





Step 4: Crown Rinse

Repeat on additional
										sections. If hair is dark, don't worry about dye transfer; on
										lighter hair, use a foil barrier or pin up sections you aren't
										coloring. After 30 minutes, rinse with lukewarm water.





Step 5: Style-phile

After rinsing, towel
										dry (use a dark one to avoid stains) and style as usual. No
										need to shampoo or condition; the moisturizing formula leaves
										hair soft and shiny.





Get Keri's Look:



L'Oréal
												Paris Colorista Semi-Permanent  Hair Color for Brown
												Hair in Teal
											

Other available shades:  Burgundy, Red and Tangerine for
											Brown Hair and Peach, Pink, Soft Pink, Purple, Indigo, Blue
											and Aqua for Blonde Hair.

      Hair Care at Walgreens Take great care of your hair from root to end with Walgreens Hair Care Products. No matter what your hair's characteristics, you can find a variety of daily care and styling products to keep it looking and feeling its best. From shampoos and conditioners to scalp treatments and even hair appliances, Walgreens offers a wide selection of products to help keep your hair healthy and looking beautiful. The Essentials of Daily Hair Care All day long, your hair is exposed to sweat from your scalp and impurities in the environment, which build up on the strands and can leave the hair looking and smelling dirty. Shampooing your hair purifies the strands and scalp, lifting away dirt and oil, so that your hair looks and smells better. The hair that you can see outside of your follicles is made up of cells that are no longer alive. As a result, they do not produce materials to keep the strands in good health. Virtually all of the moisture and nutrients necessary to ensure that the hair stays soft and strong must come from your hair care products, and conditioner is the product designed specifically to provide the hair with nutrition necessary to maintain its beauty. Conditioners contain hydrators and other beneficial ingredients that leave the hair more manageable, softer to the touch and more pliable, so it is less likely to break. The key to creating the perfect daily hair care regimen is to select a shampoo and a conditioner for your specific hair type. The Role of Styling Aids Styling aids are not essential for keeping your hair healthy, but they are often necessary to create great looking hairstyles. Products like mousse, gels, serums, pomade and creams make the hair easier to shape and style, while hairsprays and other styling products add hold to keep the tresses in place once they are styled. Mechanical tools like blow dryers, flat irons, curling irons and hot rollers and handheld tools like brushes and combs are also useful for styling the hair and getting looks that you desire. Hair color products are available at Walgreens to temporarily or permanently alter the hue of your locks or to cover gray growth. Specialty Products for Individual Needs Hair care products come in many different types, and some are formulated with the needs of certain individuals in mind. Men's hair care products are made to be simple to use with formulas and scents geared toward the needs and tastes of guys. Children's products are often extra gentle on the skin and eyes to make washing, conditioning and styling kids' tresses simpler for parents and children alike. Ethnic hair care products are made to meet the unique needs of African-American hair, which has a coarser texture and is more prone to dryness and frizz. Natural and organic products use substances found in nature instead of synthetic chemicals for those with sensitive skin and individuals who are striving to lead greener lives.

This is something @TheTylerHayes and I have been thinking about doing for some time now.  

Our "mission" is to make our normal conversations accessible to everyone who can't be there with us.

We both have a lot of passion and enthusiasm for the way to world works, and our conversations feel like a race through wide variety of topics, usually related to the way technology is changing our behavior. 

Notes:
- The editing is low quality. It will improve as we get better equipment and develop more process and best practices.
- We avoid best practices around podcast quality (lot's of 'ummmms' and 'uhhhhs' and some snacking on chips)
