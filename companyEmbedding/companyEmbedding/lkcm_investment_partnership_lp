Philosophy 

Our investment philosophy was founded with the firm in 1979, and we still believe in it today. We focus on investing in high-quality businesses that we believe will produce consistent, repeatable and, ultimately, superior risk-adjusted returns for our clients.
Our investment philosophy is grounded in our fundamental analysis of companies that meet our stringent investment criteria, such as market dominance, high or rising returns on invested capital, strong cash flow characteristics and sound balance sheets. Coupled with long-standing valuation disciplines as a means of seeking to manage overall investment risk, we believe these and other factors have enabled us to achieve successful long-term results for our clients.  Our experienced, proprietary research team plays an integral role in identifying these high-quality companies.
