Lynch, Robert Dale
Owner
















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Virginia:













Does Lynch, Robert Dale carry a valid contracting license?



In Virginia all remodeling and construction work with a cost of $1000 and up, requires a licensed contractor. There are three classes of license for contractors, from A to C. These are based on the size and scope of projects. 
Lynch, Robert Dale currently holds license 0401015349 (Architect License), which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Virginia?



All applicants for A and B contractor licenses are required to complete a pre-license education course that has been approved by the Virginia Department of Professional and Occupational Regulation's Board for Contractors. Additionally contractors must prove at least 2 years of work experience in their specific trade. 











Your liability risk when hiring Lynch, Robert Dale



Licensed contractors in the state of Virginia are not required to carry general liabilty or workers' compensation insurance. It is always a good idea to only hire contractors that have current general liabilty and workers' compensation policies. Request copies of the insurance certifcates for each.











Financial recourse when hiring Lynch, Robert Dale



Virginia does offer support to homeowners for construction projects gone wrong. The Virginia Contractor Transaction Recovery Act provides relief to eligible consumers who have incurred losses through the improper or dishonest conduct of a licensed residential contractor. The Recovery Fund is supported entirely by assessments paid by licensed contractors, not by any tax revenues. Filing a claim does not guarantee payment.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Virginia,be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids.Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal,and help guide you through the estimate process.Be wary of an abnormally low bid,they are not worth the risk.These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner,choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with.BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free).Just click here to get started.

ShareConditions Commonly Seen in PatientsThe following information is provided by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services for the year 2014 and depicts the rates of sixteen chronic conditions found in Dr. Lynch's Medicare patients. It should be noted that the prevalence of conditions listed below may not be characteristic of the provider's entire patient population, and in some cases information has been redacted from the original data source to protect patient information.Most Frequently SeenMoreMost Frequently SeenThroughout 2014, Dr. Lynch saw the greatest relative rate of patients with Type 2 Diabetes (75% of Medicare patients) compared to averages for all physicians in his state, likely indicating he is experienced in managing treatment and complications associated with this condition.Overview of Type 2 Diabetes:seriousnessModerateprevalenceVery Commonmonetary costModerate

There are two types of diabetes: type 1 and type 2. Type 2 diabetes is caused either by the pancreas not producing enough insulin, or the body becoming resistant to the insulin that the pancreas does produce. Both type 1 and type 2 diabetes result in blood sugar levels that are too high, which can lead to serious health complications.

Full Description


Diabetes mellitus is an incurable condition where a person’s blood sugar levels can become too high.  In type 1 diabetes, the pancreas does not produce any insulin, which causes the blood sugar (glucose) levels in the body to rise dangerously high. Nerves, blood vessels, and organs in the body can be damaged when blood glucose levels are too high. By comparison, type 2 diabetes appears later in life. This page focuses on diabetes mellitus type 2.   There are two possible causes of type 2 diabetes:  the pancreas does not create enough insulin; or, the body develops a resistance to insulin   As many as 90% of diabetes cases in adults are type 2 diabetes. It is more common in adults over the age of 40 and in people of African, Afro-Caribbean, Middle Eastern, and South Asian descent.
