Financing organic growth, acquisitions, recapitalizations and working capital. 

                                            TICC Capital Corp. (NasdaqGS: TICC) is a business development company primarily engaged in providing debt capital to a wide-range of U.S.-based companies. 
                                                        Our investment activities are managed by TICC Mangement, LLC, an investment advisr that is registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.
                                        
We generally expect to invest between $5.0 million and $50.0 million in each of our portfolio companies, although this investment size may vary proportionately as the                                         size of our capital base changes and market conditions warrant, and accrue interest at fixed or variable rates.




                                                “We expect that our investment portfolio will be diversified among a large number of investments with few investments, if                                                    any, exceeding 5% of the total portfolio.”
                                                        











TICC Capital Corp. is a closed-end, non-diversified 
				                    management investment company that has elected to be regulated 
				                    as a business development company (“BDC”) under the Investment 
				                    Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”). Our investment 
				                    objective is to maximize our portfolio’s total return. Our 
				                    primary focus is to seek current income by investing primarily 
				                    in corporate debt securities. 
Our capital is generally used by our portfolio companies to 
				                    finance organic growth, acquisitions, recapitalizations and 
				                    working capital. Our investment decisions are based on extensive 
				                    analysis of potential portfolio companies’ business operations 
				                    supported by an in-depth understanding of the quality of their 
				                    recurring revenues and cash flow, variability of costs and the 
				                    inherent value of their assets, including proprietary intangible 
				                    assets and intellectual property. In making our CLO investments, 
				                    we consider the indenture structure for that vehicle, its 
				                    operating characteristics and compliance with its various 
				                    indenture provisions, as well as its corporate loan-based 
				                    collateral pool.
