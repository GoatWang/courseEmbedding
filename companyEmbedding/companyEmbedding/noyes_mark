Auto Accident

I have 30 years experience in personal injury. We are Florida's longest running personal injury lawyer firm with more than 60 years in practice. I'm a multi-million dollar advocate, top 100 trial lawyer, and I hold the highest AV Rating.
Our firm was founded in Clearwater in 1955, Guy Perenich (my father) knew that people needed representation for personal injury cases where they had none. Consequently he and his partner Frank Muscarella, were the only firm in the Tampa Bay area representing only personal injury clients. The firm quickly became known, as Frank and Guy zealously represented clients in the courts.  They championed the rights of those in need, and gave back to community. Then, in 1984 I began my career, I was asked to carry the torch to help those in need. I began handling car accidents, slip and falls, and other general personal injury cases. From there I moved to more complex litigation, products liability and medical malpractice. 
Today, I handle cases from all over the personal injury spectrum. There is no case too big or small for our firm, we are here to fight for you. Please call us today for your free consultation: 727-386-9677
