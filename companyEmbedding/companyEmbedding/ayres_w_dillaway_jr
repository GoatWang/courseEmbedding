These include Finance & Accounting, Endowment Management, Technology Transfer, Development, Human Resources, Public Affairs, Information Technology, Sponsored Programs, Library Services, Food Services, Purchasing and Facilities Management.  In addition, he oversees the administrative affairs of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press and the Meetings & Courses Programs.

Prior to joining Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in 1998, Mr. Ayres had a twenty year business career during which he worked as corporate executive, investment banker and entrepreneur. In 1996, he co-founded a business-to-business, venture capital-backed Internet company.

He was graduated from Princeton University (A.B.) and from the Columbia University Graduate School of Business (M.B.A.). We believe Mr. Ayres is qualified to serve on our Board because of his venture capital, investment banking and private equity experience, as well as his experience as a corporate executive spanning the length of his career. Additionally, his managerial role at a reputable research and educational institution in biological sciences as well as his expertise and credit-related experience for the institutions he has managed, further qualify him for his roles as a Director. His years of managerial experience also qualify him for his role as Chairman of the Compensation Committee.
