Independent Director

WageWorks, Inc.

                    WageWorks Inc

We are a leading on-demand provider of tax-advantaged programs for consumer-directed health, commuter and other employee spending account benefits, or CDBs, in the United States. We administer and operate a broad array of CDBs, including spending account management programs, such as health and dependent care Flexible Spending Accounts, or FSAs, Health Savings Accounts, or HSAs, Health Reimbursement Arrangements, or HRAs, and commuter benefits, such as transit and parking programs.

We deliver our CDB programs through a highly scalable Benefits-as-a-Service, or BaaS, delivery model that employer clients and their employee participants may access through a standard web browser on any internet enabled device, including computers, smart phones and other mobile devices, such as tablet computers. Our on-demand delivery model eliminates the need for our employer clients to install and maintain hardware and software in order to support CDB programs and enables us to rapidly implement product enhancements across our entire user base.

Our CDB programs enable employees and their families to save money by using pre-tax dollars to pay for certain of their healthcare and commuter expenses. Employers financially benefit from our programs through reduced payroll taxes, even after factoring in our fees. Under our FSA, HSA and commuter programs, employee participants contribute funds from their pre-tax income to pay for qualified out-of-pocket healthcare expenses not fully covered by insurance, such as co-pays, deductibles and over-the-counter medical products or for commuting costs.

WageWorks is the provider of choice to many of the nation's largest and most innovative companies including:

    45% of the Fortune 100 Companies
    25% of the Fortune 500 Companies
    38% of Working Mother Magazine's Best Places to Work

Peter E. Kalan





November 20, 2007 08:00 AM Eastern Standard Time



ENGLEWOOD, Colo.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--CSG Systems International, Inc. (NASDAQ: CSGS) announced today that 
      Edward C. Nafus, president and chief executive officer of the company, 
      has announced his plans to retire at the end of the year, following 
      nearly 10 years of service with CSG.
    


      CSG veteran Peter Kalan, executive vice president, corporate & business 
      development, has been named to succeed Nafus as president and chief 
      executive officer.
    

      Kalan, 48, has served in various senior and executive management roles 
      with CSG for 11 years. In his current capacity, he has been responsible 
      for overseeing CSG’s corporate and business 
      development efforts, including CSG’s two 
      recent acquisitions. Prior to this role, he served as the company’s 
      chief financial officer.
    

      Along with selecting Kalan as Nafus’ 
      successor, CSG’s Board of Directors also voted 
      him to serve on the Board, effective immediately. Nafus will continue to 
      serve on CSG’s Board of Directors, with his 
      current Board term running through mid-2010.
    

      Nafus, 67, has served as CSG’s president and 
      CEO since April 2005. Prior to his appointment as CEO, Nafus served in 
      various senior and executive leadership roles, including President and 
      Executive Vice President of CSG’s Broadband 
      Services Division, directing CSG through periods of high growth and 
      rapid change, and building the business to support value-added customer 
      interactions on behalf of some of North America’s 
      leading cable and direct broadcast satellite providers.
    

      "On behalf of the CSG Board of Directors, I am grateful to Ed for his 
      outstanding leadership and focus on operational excellence,” 
      said Bernie Reznicek, Chairman of the CSG’s 
      Board of Directors. “Peter’s 
      appointment by the Board to succeed Ed is a testament to Ed’s 
      commitment to building a solid, experienced and talented leadership 
      team, and an organization centered on serving its customers which has 
      led CSG to some of its most significant achievements.”


      Nafus stated, "I am very proud of the company the entire CSG team has 
      created, and am indebted to our employees, customers, shareholders, 
      Board and vendors who have been part of this exciting journey. CSG 
      enjoys a strong position in our industry, with innovative technology and 
      great relationships with our customers. Our future looks promising, and I’m 
      confident that Peter can carry forward the strategy, passion and 
      leadership necessary for continued successes by CSG.”


“Kalan’s 
      appointment to the leadership post will provide continuity of leadership 
      to CSG while offering a renewed vision for the company’s 
      future,” Reznicek said. Kalan will begin work 
      immediately with Nafus and the CSG Board of Directors on a transition 
      plan, stepping into his new role effective at the end of the year.

Safe-Harbor Statement


      This news release contains forward-looking statements as defined under 
      the Securities Act of 1933, as amended that are based on assumptions 
      about a number of important factors and involve risks and uncertainties 
      that could cause actual results to differ materially from what appears 
      in this news release. These factors include, but are not limited to: 1) 
      CSG's ability to continue to perform satisfactorily and maintain good 
      customer relations with its four largest clients, Comcast Corporation, 
      EchoStar Communications, Time Warner, Inc., and Charter Communications, 
      which combined make up approximately 70% of CSG’s 
      revenues; 2) the continued acceptance of CSG’s 
      Advanced Convergent Platform and its related products and services; 3) 
      CSG's ability to enhance current products and develop new technology 
      that will retain existing clients and capture new market share; 4) 
      significant forays into new markets, which may prove costly and 
      unprofitable; 5) the degree to which CSG's expectations of market 
      penetration and consumer acceptance of advanced IP services prove true 
      -- and even if realized, CSG’s ability to 
      meet the billing and customer care needs of those markets; 6) client 
      consolidation, which has decreased the number of potential buyers for 
      many of CSG's products and services; 7) CSG's ability to renew contracts 
      and sell additional products and services to existing and new clients; 
      8) CSG's ability to successfully deliver on lengthy and/or complex 
      implementation projects, which by their nature, carry much more risk; 
      and 9) CSG’s ability to successfully 
      integrate and manage acquired businesses or assets in order to achieve 
      the expected strategic, operating and financial goals established for 
      such acquisitions. This list is not exhaustive and readers are 
      encouraged to review the additional risks and important factors 
      described in CSG's reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q and other filings made 
      with the SEC.
