Description

                    A classic nephrology reference for over 25years, Seldin and Giebisch's The Kidney, is the acknowledged authority on renal physiology and pathophysiology. In this 5th edition, such new and powerful disciplines as genetics and cell biology have been deployed to deepen and widen further the explanatory framework. Not only have previous chapters been extensively updated, but new chapters have been added to incorporate additional disciplines. Individual chapters, for example, now provide detailed treatment of the significance of cilia; the role of stem cells is now given special consideration. Finally, there has been a significant expansion of the section of pathophysiology, incorporating the newer findings of cell biology and genetics. If you research the development of normal renal function or the mechanisms underlying renal disease, Seldin and Giebisch's The Kidney is your number one source for information.show more

Review quote

                            Praise for the Third Edition:"Since the publication of the previous edition, our understanding of the molecular and structural basis of electrolyte and water metabolism has expanded enormously. This new edition of The Kidney illuminates these basic science principles clearly and thoroughly while also providing comprehensive and clear clinical management. This edition has been thoroughly revised and updated. Tight editing and rigorous revision of the chapters, along with elimination of redundancy, have enabled us to return to a two-volume work. At more than 3,100 pages, with over 1,200 illustrations and hundreds of tables, The Kidney remains highly recommended for anyone active in renal research or clinical nephrology."The Clinical Investigator; Vol. 20, no. 8, 1992show more



About Robert J. Alpern

                            Dr. Alpern has performed research in the area of epithelial physiology, focusing on the mechanisms and regulation of acid transport.  He received his MD degree from the University of Chicago and then trained in Internal Medicine at Columbia Presbyterian.  Following postdoctoral training in the Cardiovascular Research Institute at the University of California, San Francisco, Alpern joined the faculty at UCSF, then moved to the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School as Chief of Nephrology and later Dean of the medical school.  He is now Dean of Yale School of Medicine and Ensign Professor.  Dr. Caplan studies epithelial cell biology and physiology. His work focuses on the trafficking and regulation of renal ion transport proteins. His group also studies the signaling pathways involved in Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease. He received his MD and PhD degrees from Yale University, having pursued his dissertation work in the Department of Cell Biology under the guidance of Drs. James D. Jamieson and George E. Palade.  Following postdoctoral work in the Department of Cellular and Molecular Physiology at Yale, Caplan joined that department as a faculty member. He is currently the C.N.H. Long Professor and Chair of Yale University School of Medicine's Department of Cellular and Molecular Physiology.  Dr. Moe received his medical degree from the University of Toronto where he also did his internal medicine residency and clinical nephrology fellowship. Orson Moe moved to the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center for research training in renal physiology. He is currently Professor of Internal Medicine and Physiology and is a member of the Nephrology Division at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas. He is also the Director of the Charles and Jane Pak Center of Mineral Metabolism and Clinical Research and holds the Charles and Jane Pak Chair in Mineral Metabolism Research and the Donald Seldin Professorship in Clinical Investigation. Orson Moe conducts both basic science and patient-oriented research on renal physiology and metabolism, and epithelial biology.show more

Review Text

                            "This is a useful resource for both clinical and research nephrologists.it.provides an interesting read if a thorough understanding of a physiological or pathophysiological process affecting the kidney is needed. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone in the nephrology community, whether clinical or research oriented." Rating: 3 Stars --Doody.com, April 2014

"Ninety-five chapters are arranged across the two volumes under four broad themes: epithelial and nonepithelial transport and regulation; structural and functional organization of the kidney; fluid and electrolyte regulation and dysregulation; and pathophysiology of renal disease." --Reference and Research Book News, August 2013

Praise for the Previous Edition: "This is an excellent in-depth compilation of all aspects of renal physiology in health and disease, presented in well-balanced in chapters with high-quality figures and ample references.This book clearly represents an excellent, useful, usable, and (in view of recent rapid scientific progress) needed update of the previous edition and will have a prominent place on my bookshelf as well as those of many others in the field." - 4 Stars! --Doody's

Research Summary
Research on the regulation of kidney transport proteins has helped to define the mechanisms by which the kidney transports acid. Subsequently has focused on the mechanisms by which kidney cells sense excess acid and initiate a signaling cascade that alters the expression, cellular location, and function of many proteins in the cell, resulting in enhanced acid transport and urinary excretion.Specialized Terms: Epithelial physiology; Membrane transport; Acid-base homeostasis


Extensive Research Description
Dr. Alpern’s research has focused on the regulation of kidney transport proteins.

Synopsis




					A classic nephrology reference for over 25years, Seldin and Giebisch's The Kidney, is the acknowledged authority on renal physiology and pathophysiology. In this 5th edition, such new and powerful disciplines as genetics and cell biology have been deployed to deepen and widen further the explanatory framework. Not only have previous chapters been extensively updated, but new chapters have been added to incorporate additional disciplines. Individual chapters, for example, now provide detailed treatment of the significance of cilia; the role of stem cells is now given special consideration. Finally, there has been a significant expansion of the section of pathophysiology, incorporating the newer findings of cell biology and genetics. If you research the development of normal renal function or the mechanisms underlying renal disease, Seldin and Giebisch's The Kidney is your number one source for information.
