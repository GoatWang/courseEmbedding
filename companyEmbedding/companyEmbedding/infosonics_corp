InfoSonics Corporation (NASDAQ: IFON) is a publicly traded telecommunications equipment provider based in San Diego, California.[2] It develops, manufactures, and distributes wireless handsets and accessories through its proprietary brand verykool and other private label brands.[3] InfoSonics sells its products through carriers, distributors and OEMs in Latin America, Europe, Africa, Asia Pacific and the United States.[6] It is best known for its line of inexpensive unlocked phones as well as its rugged phones in its verykool line of products.[7][8]
History[edit]
InfoSonics was founded in 1994 by Joseph Ram, the company's president and CEO. It became a public company in June 2004, and was initially listed on the American Stock Exchange under the symbol “IFO.”[9] In August 2006, the company transferred to the NASDAQ under the symbol “IFON.”[10] When the company first went public, it was primarily a distributor of products supplied by Samsung, VK Corporation, LG, Novatel and others. In 2005 it purchased Primasel S.A., a distributor of Samsung products primarily in Argentina.[11][12]




The verykool s400, T742, R800, and s470 from InfoSonics Corporation.


The company followed up with a secondary stock offering in 2006, offering 2.2 million shares.[13] The same year the company reached $240 million in sales.[13] 2006 was also the year it began to develop its own wireless handsets under the verykool brand.[14] InfoSonics ceased its distributing business in March 2012, primarily due to protective import tariffs that had been enacted on certain electronic devices since 2009.[14] After terminating its distributing business, it became solely a manufacturer and distributor of its own products under the verykool brand.[15]
InfoSonics entered into an agreement with Ingram Micro in December 2012 for the distribution of its verykool brand to customers in the United States.[16] It also launched an online store in the U.S. market for consumer purchase of the verykool product line.[17]
InfoSonics Corporation reported a second consecutive quarter of profitability after 2013 4th quarter results were announced.[18] The company had a 48% gross profit in the 4th quarter compared to 2012 with operating expenses declining 26% for the same period.[18] InfoSonics also reported gross revenue of $37.9 million, an increase of $3.6 million from the year prior.[19] It continued to increase sales by year-end 2014, bringing in $48.1 million, a 27% increase from the prior year.[5]

No mention of the software product launch in the 1st quarter earnings announcement of the 10-Q.  No mention of cost being incurred to develop the software, and no capitalization of a capital asset. Shows they may not even be spending money to develop anything.  Only 41 employees now.  Lost almost 10% of its net assets in the first quarter alone.  No chance of profitability without improvement in sales or gross margin, which are very instable.

All we need is the new product launch to still be on schedule, and/or a small net profit for the next reportable quarter, and one dollar is no problem. We could also get there on air, or with current momentum. There have been a few crazy moves from small caps the last few weeks, and this one has an unusual number of followers at a few places.   There is a chance that if we can get back to 70 or 80 cents in the next few days, that there could be a blow off top even higher than that, as a final push is made. And that is if there isn't even news.    The float is low enough that if enough people jump on there will be options for those who bought low. I still say that worst case scenario we get to one dollar or more for ten days before EVER having to do a reverse split. They were basically given another 180 days, because the original deadline was May 1st. It appears that I was correct on how low this could go. I don't believe there is any surprise out there that could create a huge selloff to under 40 cents, so I am expecting between one and two dollars by the end of the summer, as management now knows what it needs to do, and they can time their launch accordingly. In good shape here.   Total games being played with the price. Remember to always buy when there is pain on the message boards, though sometimes you can take a shot after it starts percolating. You had a chance to buy yesterday for a whole 90 minutes at 43 and below, so there is nobody to blame but yourself. I still think that anything under 60 cents makes 100 percent on their money by the end of summer, so it is not too late.   There is a real chance for a manic episode to the upside, where money appears to grow in your account at a ridiculous rate, so keep your cool and wait for it to happen. Far worse companies have had huge runs recently, and IFON is more legit than most. Still selling for under net cash, and the momentum can be on our side for quite a while. Float is tight, with the only pullbacks being from flippers who chase the highs. We should see multiple legs up over the next few weeks, and likely stabilize at close to one dollar (as opposed to the 40-50 cents level while delisting uncertainty was there).
