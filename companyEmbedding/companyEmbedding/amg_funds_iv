It benchmarks the performance of its portfolio against the Russell 2000 Growth Index and Russell 2000 Index. The fund was formerly known as Aston Funds - ASTON Aston/TAMRO Small Cap Fund and Aston Funds - ASTON Small Cap Fund. AMG FUNDS IV - AMG GW&K U.S. Small Cap Growth Fund was formed on November 30, 2000 and is domiciled in the United States.
