5 Types of REITs and How to Invest in Them



 By 
                        Will Ashworth
June 28, 2017 — 1:00 PM EDT






Real estate investment trusts  (REITs) are a key consideration when constructing any equity or fixed-income portfolio. They provide greater diversification, potentially higher total returns and/or lower overall risk. In short, their ability to generate dividend income along with capital appreciation make them an excellent counterbalance to stocks, bonds and cash. REITs generally own and/or manage income-producing commercial real estate, whether it's the properties themselves or the mortgages on those properties. You can invest in the companies individually or through an exchange-traded fund or mutual fund. There are many types of REITs available. Here we look at a few of the main ones and their historical returns. By the end of this article you should have a better idea when and what to buy. 
Historical Returns of REITs 
Real estate investment trusts are historically one of the best-performing asset classes available. The FTSE NAREIT Equity REIT Index is what most investors use to gauge the performance of the U.S. real estate market. Between 1990 and 2010, the index's average annual return was 9.9%, second only to mid-cap stocks, which averaged 10.3% per year over the same period. In comparison, fixed income assets managed 7% annual returns and commodities just 4.5% a year. Real estate was the worst performer of eight asset classes in just two years out of 20. Fixed income, on the other hand, was the worst performer six times in the same 20-year period.
More recently, the three-year average for REITs between March 2013 and March 2016 was in line with the averages in the 20 year period, clocking in at 9.85% over that time. Historically, investors looking for yield have done better investing in real estate than fixed income, the traditional asset class for this purpose. A carefully constructed portfolio should consider both. (Learn more in How To Assess A Real Estate Investment Trust.)
Retail REITs
Approximately 24% of REIT investments are in shopping malls and freestanding retail. This represents the single biggest investment by type in America. Whatever shopping center you frequent, it's likely owned by an REIT. When considering an investment in retail real estate, one first needs to examine the retail industry itself. Is it financially healthy at present and what is the outlook for the future?
It's important to remember that retail REITs make money from the rent they charge tenants. If retailers are experiencing cash flow problems due to poor sales, it's possible they could delay or even default on those monthly payments, eventually being forced into bankruptcy. At that point, a new tenant needs to be found, which is never easy. Therefore, it's crucial that you invest in REITs with the strongest anchor tenants possible. These include grocery and home improvement stores.
Once you've made your industry assessment, your focus should turn to the REITs themselves. Like any investment, it's important that they have good profits, strong balance sheets and as little debt as possible, especially the short-term kind. In a poor economy, retail REITs with significant cash positions will be presented with opportunities to buy good real estate at distressed prices. The best-run companies will take advantage of this.
That said, there are longer term concerns for the retail REIT space in that shopping is increasingly shifting online as opposed to the mall model. Owners of space have continued to innovate to fill their space with offices and other non-retail oriented tenants, but the subsector is under pressure. (For more insight on commercial real estate, check out 7 Steps To A Hot Commercial Real Estate Deal.)
Residential REITs
These are REITs that own and operate multi-family rental apartment buildings as well as manufactured housing. When looking to invest in this type of REIT, one should consider several factors before jumping in. For instance, the best apartment markets tend to be where home affordability is low relative to the rest of the country. In places like New York and Los Angeles, the high cost of single homes forces more people to rent, which drives up the price landlords can charge each month. As a result, the biggest residential REITs tend to focus on large urban centers.
Within each specific market, investors should look for population and job growth. Generally, when there is a net inflow of people to a city, it's because jobs are readily available and the economy is growing. A falling vacancy rate coupled with rising rents is a sign that demand is improving. As long as the apartment supply in a particular market remains low and demand continues to rise, residential REITs should do well. As with all companies, those with the strongest balance sheets and the most available capital normally do the best. 
Healthcare REITs
Healthcare REITs will be an interesting subsector to watch as Americans age and healthcare costs continue to climb. Healthcare REITs invest in the real estate of hospitals, medical centers, nursing facilities and retirement homes. The success of this real estate is directly tied to the healthcare system. A majority of the operators of these facilities rely on occupancy fees, Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements as well as private pay. As long as the funding of healthcare is a question mark, so are healthcare REITs.
Things you should look for in a healthcare REIT include a diversified group of customers as well as investments in a number of different property types. Focus is good to an extent but so is spreading your risk. Generally, an increase in the demand for healthcare services (which should happen with an aging population) is good for healthcare real estate. Therefore, in addition to customer and property-type diversification, look for companies whose healthcare experience is significant, whose balance sheets are strong and whose access to low-cost capital is high. 
Office REITs
Office REITs invest in office buildings. They receive rental income from tenants who have usually signed long-term leases. Four questions come to mind for anyone interested in investing in an office REIT
What is the state of the economy and how high is the unemployment rate?
What are vacancy rates like?
How is the area in which the REIT invests doing economically?
How much capital does it have for acquisitions?
Try to find REITs that invest in economic strongholds. It's better to own a bunch of average buildings in Washington, D.C., than it is to own prime office space in Detroit, for example. (For more on commercial real estate, see Find Fortune In Commerical Real Estate.)
Mortgage REITs
Approximately 10% of REIT investments are in mortgages as opposed to the real estate itself. The best known but not necessarily the greatest investments are Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, government-sponsored enterprises that buy mortgages on the secondary market.
But just because this type of REIT invests in mortgages instead of equity doesn't mean it comes without risks. An increase in interest rates would translate into a decrease in mortgage REIT book values, driving stock prices lower. In addition, mortgage REITs get a considerable amount of their capital through secured and unsecured debt offerings. Should interest rates rise, future financing will be more expensive, reducing the value of a portfolio of loans. In a low-interest rate environment with the prospect of rising rates, most mortgage REITs trade at a discount to net asset value per share. The trick is finding the right one. (Learn more about the effects of interest rates in The Impact Of Interest Rates On Real Estate Investment Trusts.)
The Keys to Assessing Any REIT
I've talked about specific types of REITs as well as what to look for when investing in them. However, there are a few things to keep in mind when assessing any REIT. They include the following:
REITs are true total-return investments. They provide high dividend yields along with moderate long-term capital appreciation. Look for companies that have done a good job historically at providing both.
Unlike traditional real estate, many REITs are traded on stock exchanges. You get the diversification real estate provides without being locked in long term. Liquidity matters.
Depreciation tends to overstate an investment's decline in property value. Thus, instead of using the payout ratio (what dividend investors use) to assess an REIT, look at its funds from operations (FFO) instead. This is defined as net income less the sale of any property in a given year and depreciation. Simply take the dividend per share and divide by the FFO per share. The higher the yield the better.
Strong management makes a difference. Look for companies that have been around for a while or at least possess a management team with loads of experience.
Quality counts. Only invest in REITs with great properties and tenants.
Consider buying a mutual fund or ETF that invests in REITs, and leave the research and buying to the pros.
Bottom Line
The federal government made it possible for investors to buy into large-scale commercial real estate projects as far back as 1960. However, only in the last decade have individual investors embraced REITs. Reasons for this include low interest rates, which forced investors to look beyond bonds for income-producing investments, the advent of exchange-traded and mutual funds focusing on real estate and, until the 2007-08 real estate meltdown, an insatiable appetite on the part of Americans to own real estate and other tangible assets. REITs, like every other investment in 2008, suffered greatly. But despite this, they continue to be an excellent addition to any diversified portfolio.

Special Purpose Vehicle/Entity - SPV/SPE



 By 
                        Investopedia Staff






What is 'Special Purpose Vehicle/Entity - SPV/SPE'A special purpose vehicle/entity (SPV/SPE) is a subsidiary company with an asset/liability structure and legal status that makes its obligations secure even if the parent company goes bankrupt. An SPV/SPE is also a subsidiary corporation designed to serve as a counterparty for swaps and other credit sensitive derivative instruments. Although the SPVs/SPEs are used to isolate financial risk, due to accounting loopholes, these vehicles may become a financially devastating way for CFOs to hide debt, as with the Enron bankruptcy.
BREAKING DOWN 'Special Purpose Vehicle/Entity - SPV/SPE'SPVs/SPEs may be formed through limited partnerships, trusts, corporations, limited liability corporations or other entities. An SPV/SPE may be designed for independent ownership, management and funding of a company; as protection of a project from operational or insolvency issues; or for creating a synthetic lease that is expensed on the company’s income statement rather than recorded as a liability on the balance sheet. They help companies securitize assets, create joint ventures, isolate corporate assets or perform other financial transactions.
Off-Balance-Sheet SPV/SPE
An off-balance-sheet SPV/SPE documents its assets, liabilities and equity on its own balance sheet rather than on the parent company’s balance sheet as equity or debt. The parent company typically prefers this arrangement due to improved management of assets and liabilities, lower risks, higher credit ratings, lower funding costs, greater financial flexibility and lower capital requirements.
SPV's/SPE's mask crucial information from investors who are not aware of a company’s complete financial situation. Investors need to look at the parent company’s balance sheet as well as the SPV’s/SPE’s balance sheet before deciding whether to invest in a business. Enron’s massive financial collapse is a prime example of why this is important.
Enron’s SPVs/SPEs
Enron transferred much of its quickly rising stock to an SPV/SPE and received cash or a note in return. The SPV/SPE used the stock for hedging assets shown on the company’s balance sheet. Enron guaranteed the SPVs/SPE's value as a means of reducing risk. When stock prices began dropping, along with the values of the SPVs/SPEs, the guarantees were forced into play. Enron was unable to pay the large amounts of money it owed creditors and investors, leading to a massive financial collapse.
Although the company disclosed its financial information and conflicts of interest on balance sheets for the company and for the SPVs/SPEs, few investors understood the gravity of the situation and what ended up being a disastrous ending for Enron.
Example of an SPV/SPE
In March 2016, Luxor Capital, a $3.8 billion hedge fund, announced it was placing four illiquid securities totaling 12% of its investments in an SPV/SPE. The securities included exposure in food delivery service Delivery Hero, private equity investments in online food ordering company Foodpanda and drilling company Ascent Resources, as well as preferred stock in Altisource Asset Management. After losing money for months, the fund began returning 88% of exiting investors’ money. The rest will be returned when the illiquid investments are sold.

Approximately $566,424,000 of Structured Securities Affected


New York, July 20, 2016 -- Moody's Investors Service has assigned definitive ratings to six classes 
of CMBS securities, issued by of SG Commercial Mortgage Securities 
Trust 2016-C5, Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates 
Series 2016-C5:




Cl. A-1, Definitive Rating Assigned Aaa (sf)


Cl. A-2, Definitive Rating Assigned Aaa (sf)


Cl. A-3, Definitive Rating Assigned Aaa (sf)


Cl. A-4, Definitive Rating Assigned Aaa (sf)


Cl. A-SB, Definitive Rating Assigned Aaa (sf)


Cl. A-M, Definitive Rating Assigned Aa3 (sf)




RATINGS RATIONALE




The Certificates are collateralized by 47 loans secured by 138 properties. 
The ratings are based on the collateral and the structure of the transaction 
and the assigned Structured Credit Assessment of a1 (sca.pd) to 
the Mall at Rockingham Park Loan, which represents approximately 
5.4% of the pool balance. The loan is secured by 
a regional mall in Salem, NH.




Moody's CMBS ratings methodology combines both commercial real estate 
and structured finance analysis. Based on commercial real estate 
analysis, Moody's determines the credit quality of each mortgage 
loan and calculates an expected loss on a loan specific basis. 
Under structured finance, the credit enhancement for each certificate 
typically depends on the expected frequency, severity, and 
timing of future losses. Moody's also considers a range of qualitative 
issues as well as the transaction's structural and legal aspects.




The credit risk of loans is determined primarily by two factors: 
1) Moody's assessment of the probability of default, which is largely 
driven by each loan's DSCR, and 2) Moody's assessment of the severity 
of loss upon a default, which is largely driven by each loan's LTV 
ratio.




The Moody's Actual DSCR of 1.55x (1.42x excluding credit 
assessed loan) is lower than the 2015 conduit/fusion all-in transaction 
average of 1.62x and other conduit/fusion transactions rated by 
Moody's in 2016 (1.62x). The Moody's Stressed DSCR 
of 0.95x (0.90x excluding credit assessed loan) is in line 
with the 2015 conduit/fusion transaction all-in average of 0.96x 
and other transactions rated in 2016 (0.98x).




The pooled Trust loan balance of $736,811,981 represents 
a Moody's LTV ratio of 123.6% (127.5% excluding 
credit assessed loan),which is worse than the 2015 conduit/fusion 
all-in transaction average of 115.7% and worse than 
the average for pools securitized during 2016 (114.8% all-in). 
There are four loans in the pool structured with additional debt in the 
form of subordinate debt or mezzanine debt. With the additional 
debt, the Moody's total debt LTV ratio rises to 126.5% 
(129.4% excluding the credit assessed loan).




Moody's also considers both loan level diversity and property level diversity 
when selecting a ratings approach. With respect to loan level diversity, 
the pool's loan level Herfindahl score is 32.4, which is 
better than the 2015 conduit-only transaction average of 30.2 
and better than the average of transactions rated in 2016 (25.1). 
With respect to property level diversity, the pool's property level 
Herfindahl score is 37.8.




Moody's also grades properties on a scale of 0 to 5 (best to worst) and 
considers those grades when assessing the likelihood of debt payment. 
The factors considered include property age, quality of construction, 
location, market, and tenancy. The pool's weighted 
average property quality grade is 2.56, which is worse than 
the average score of 2.38 calculated across Moody's-rated 
multi-borrower transactions during the prior four quarters.




Positive features of the pool include the incorporation of one investment 
grade loan, the proportion of loans in the pool benefiting from 
cross-collateralization, and major market share. Notable 
concerns offsetting these strengths include the pool's LTV ratio, 
leverage dispersion and amortization profile, relatively low asset 
quality grade, and exposure to volatile property classes.




The principal methodology used in these ratings was "Approach to Rating 
US and Canadian Conduit/ Fusion CMBS" published in December 2014. 
Please see the Ratings Methodologies page on www.moodys.com 
for a copy of this methodology.




Moody's review used the excel-based CMBS Conduit Model, which 
it uses for both conduit and fusion transactions. Credit enhancement 
levels for conduit loans are driven by property type, Moody's actual 
and stressed DSCR, and Moody's property quality grade (which reflects 
the capitalization rate Moody's uses to estimate Moody's value). 
Moody's fuses the conduit results with the results of its analysis of 
investment-grade structured credit assessed loans and any conduit 
loan that represents 10% or greater of the current pool balance.




Moody's Parameter Sensitivities: If Moody's value of the collateral 
used in determining the initial rating were decreased by 5.0%,14.3%,and 
22.7%, the model-indicated rating for the currently 
rated Aaa (sf) classes would be Aa1(sf), Aa3(sf), and A1 (sf), 
respectively; the model-indicated rating for the currently 
rated Aa3 (sf) classes would be A1(sf), Baa1(sf), and Ba1 
(sf), respectively. Parameter Sensitivities are not intended 
to measure how the rating of the security might migrate over time; 
rather they are designed to provide a quantitative calculation of how 
the initial rating might change if key input parameters used in the initial 
rating process differed. The analysis assumes that the deal has 
not aged. Parameter Sensitivities only reflect the ratings impact 
of each scenario from a quantitative/model-indicated standpoint. 
Qualitative factors are also taken into consideration in the ratings process, 
so the actual ratings that would be assigned in each case could vary from 
the information presented in the Parameter Sensitivity analysis.




These ratings: (a) are based solely on information in the public 
domain and/or information communicated to Moody's by the issuer at the 
date it was prepared and such information has not been independently verified 
by Moody's and (b) must be construed solely as a statement of opinion 
and not a statement of fact or an offer, invitation, inducement 
or recommendation to purchase, sell or hold any securities or otherwise 
act in relation to the issuer or any other entity or in connection with 
any other matter. Moody's does not guarantee or make any representation 
or warranty as to the correctness of any information, rating or 
communication relating to the issuer. Moody's shall not be liable 
in contract, tort, statutory duty or otherwise to the issuer 
or any other third party for any loss, injury or cost caused to 
the issuer or any other third party, in whole or in part, 
including by any negligence (but excluding fraud, dishonesty and/or 
willful misconduct or any other type of liability that by law cannot be 
excluded) on the part of, or any contingency beyond the control 
of Moody's, or any of its employees or agents, including any 
losses arising from or in connection with the procurement, compilation, 
analysis, interpretation, communication, dissemination, 
or delivery of any information or rating relating to the issuer.




Factors that would lead to an upgrade or downgrade of the ratings:




The performance expectations for a given variable indicate Moody's forward-looking 
view of the likely range of performance over the medium term. Performance 
that falls outside the given range may indicate that the collateral's 
credit quality is stronger or weaker than Moody's had previously anticipated. 
Factors that may cause an upgrade of the ratings include significant loan 
paydowns or amortization, an increase in the pool's share of defeasance 
or overall improved pool performance. Factors that may cause a 
downgrade of the ratings include a decline in the overall performance 
of the pool, loan concentration, increased expected losses 
from specially serviced and troubled loans or interest shortfalls.




Moody's ratings address only the credit risks associated with the 
transaction. Other non-credit risks have not been addressed 
and may have a significant effect on yield to investors.




The ratings do not represent any assessment of (i) the likelihood or frequency 
of prepayment on the mortgage loans, (ii) the allocation of net 
aggregate prepayment interest shortfalls, (iii) whether or to what 
extent prepayment premiums might be received, or (iv) in the case 
of any class of interest-only certificates, the likelihood 
that the holders thereof might not fully recover their investment in the 
event of a rapid rate of prepayment of the mortgage loans.




REGULATORY DISCLOSURES




For further specification of Moody's key rating assumptions and sensitivity 
analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and Sensitivity 
to Assumptions of the disclosure form.




Further information on the representations and warranties and enforcement 
mechanisms available to investors are available on http://www.moodys.com/researchdocumentcontentpage.aspx?docid=PBS_1035242. 





The analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and 
performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected 
collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments. As a 
second step, Moody's estimates expected collateral losses or cash 
flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement, 
loss allocation and other structural features, to derive the expected 
loss for each rated instrument.




Moody's quantitative analysis entails an evaluation of scenarios 
that stress factors contributing to sensitivity of ratings and take into 
account the likelihood of severe collateral losses or impaired cash flows. 
Moody's weights the impact on the rated instruments based on its 
assumptions of the likelihood of the events in such scenarios occurring.




For ratings issued on a program, series or category/class of debt, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to each rating of a subsequently issued bond or note of the same series 
or category/class of debt or pursuant to a program for which the ratings 
are derived exclusively from existing ratings in accordance with Moody's 
rating practices. For ratings issued on a support provider, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the credit rating action on the support provider and in relation to 
each particular credit rating action for securities that derive their 
credit ratings from the support provider's credit rating. 
For provisional ratings, this announcement provides certain regulatory 
disclosures in relation to the provisional rating assigned, and 
in relation to a definitive rating that may be assigned subsequent to 
the final issuance of the debt, in each case where the transaction 
structure and terms have not changed prior to the assignment of the definitive 
rating in a manner that would have affected the rating. For further 
information please see the ratings tab on the issuer/entity page for the 
respective issuer on www.moodys.com.




For any affected securities or rated entities receiving direct credit 
support from the primary entity(ies) of this credit rating action, 
and whose ratings may change as a result of this credit rating action, 
the associated regulatory disclosures will be those of the guarantor entity. 
Exceptions to this approach exist for the following disclosures, 
if applicable to jurisdiction: Ancillary Services, Disclosure 
to rated entity, Disclosure from rated entity.




Regulatory disclosures contained in this press release apply to the credit 
rating and, if applicable, the related rating outlook or rating 
review.


Please see www.moodys.com for any updates on changes to 
the lead rating analyst and to the Moody's legal entity that has issued 
the rating.

                      Republican finger-pointing commenced after the Senate's dark-of-night defeat of the GOP's flagship effort to repeal much of the Obama health care law in a startling vote that dealt a blistering blow to President Donald Trump.

"3 Republicans and 48 Democrats let the American people down," Trump tweeted early Friday after GOP leaders failed to patch party divisions and the Senate rejected a last-ditch bill to keep the effort alive. "As I said from the beginning, let ObamaCare implode, then deal. Watch!"

The "skinny repeal" bill — erasing several parts of President Barack Obama's law — was rejected just before 2 a.m. EST on a vote of 51-49. All Democrats were joined by GOP Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and the ailing John McCain. The 80-year-old Arizona senator made a dramatic return to the Capitol Tuesday after being diagnosed with brain cancer to cast a decisive procedural vote that for a time had advanced the legislation.

                      White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus may have little left of his job but his title.

In the swirl of Shakespearean intrigue that surrounds Donald Trump's White House, Priebus' fortunes have long been a source of speculation, given his limited role, colorful band of rivals and the president's public slights. Those questions sharply escalated this week with the arrival of Trump's new communications director, who was hired over Priebus' objections and reports directly to the president.

Priebus' already tense relationship with Anthony Scaramucci took a darker turn over the past 24 hours when the communications chief suggested in a late-night tweet that Priebus was one of the "leakers" that President Donald Trump has railed against. The New Yorker published an profanity-laced interview Thursday in which Scaramucci called Priebus a "paranoid schizophrenic."

                      Russia's Foreign Ministry ordered a reduction in the number of U.S. diplomats in Russia on Friday and said it was closing down a U.S. recreation retreat in response to fresh sanctions against Russia.

The U.S. Senate approved a new package of stiff financial sanctions Friday against Russia, Iran and North Korea and sent it to President Donald Trump to sign.

The legislation bars Trump from easing or waiving the penalties on Russia unless Congress agrees.

                      The GOP took a hard blow early Friday when its Health Care Freedom Act, dubbed the "skinny repeal" of "Obamacare," failed to pass in the Senate in a late-night 49–51 vote.

Republican Senators John McCain, Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins crossed party lines to cast key votes to defeat the measure, with McCain's move drawing cheers from the Democrats on the Senate floor.

As news of the bill's failure spread, social media erupted with reactions from Washington.

            Lawmakers took to the Senate floor overnight Thursday to vote on the latest GOP health care overhaul measure, just hours after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell released the bill's text.

                      Dealing a serious blow to President Donald Trump's agenda, the Senate early Friday rejected a measure to repeal parts of former President Barack Obama's health care law after a night of high suspense in the U.S. Capitol.

Unable to pass even a so-called "skinny repeal," it was unclear if Senate Republicans could advance any health bill despite seven years of promises to repeal "Obamacare."

"This is clearly a disappointing moment," said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. "I regret that our efforts were not enough, this time."

"It's time to move on," he said. The vote was 49-51 with three Republicans joining all Democrats in voting 'no.'

                        A set of newborn twins and their 1-year-old sister were orphaned after a series of tragic events claimed the life of their father and then their mother just days later.

The children’s 26-year-old father, Jevaughn Suckoo, was fatally shot on July 11 at his Florida home in a gated community in West Palm Beach, according to a Palm Beach Post database. Police ruled Suckoo’s death a homicide.

Three days later, Suckoo’s pregnant girlfriend, Stephanie Caceres, gave birth to the couple’s twin boy and girl. According to Caceres’ family, she developed an infection from the C-section and was admitted to the hospital’s intensive care unit. She died 10 days later, the same day Suckoo's family laid him to rest. 

"She always told me that she had a dream of taking care of me because I have diabetes. And she always told me 'mom I'm going to take care of you,' not knowing that I'm going to be taking care of her kids," Stephanie's mother, Irma Meza, said in an interview in Spanish with NBC affiliate WPTV.

The victim, identified by his nephew only as Larry, was walking Monday near his home in Oak Hills, a desert community near Hesperia, when the bees, known colloquially as "killer bees," attacked.

                        President Donald Trump will come down hard on illegal immigration during his visit to Long Island Friday, the White House Administration said Thursday night.

Trump is expected to speak at Suffolk County Community College in Brentwood and ask for more resources to combat illegal immigration as well as push for his campaign promise for a border wall.

Against the backdrop of Suffolk County, Trump is set to talk about taking down the notorious MS-13 gang and push forward his immigration agenda. The gang is blamed for 17 murders in the county over the last year and a half.

The electric car company's newest vehicle is set to go to its first 30 customers Friday evening. Its $35,000 starting price — half the cost of Tesla's previous models — and 215-mile range could bring hundreds of thousands of customers into the automaker's fold, taking it from a niche luxury brand to the mainstream.

Those higher sales could finally make Tesla profitable and accelerate its plans for future products like SUVs and pickup trucks.

Or the Model 3 could dash Tesla's dreams.

                        A 77-year-old man has died after being stung hundreds of times by a swarm of Africanized bees while on a walk in his high desert neighborhood, a relative said Thursday.

The victim, identified by his nephew only as Larry, was walking Monday near his home in Oak Hills, a desert community near Hesperia, when the bees, known colloquially as "killer bees," attacked.

                      A swinging and spinning amusement park ride called the Fire Ball broke apart on the opening day of the Ohio State Fair on Wednesday, hurling people through the air, killing at least one and injuring seven others.

Three of the injured were hospitalized Wednesday night, authorities said at a news conference. Two of them were treated and released, but the other remained hospitalized in critical condition Thursday morning.

Tyler Jarrell, 18, of Columbus, Ohio, was identified by police as the person killed in the accident.

                        President Donald Trump will come down hard on illegal immigration during his visit to Long Island Friday, the White House Administration said Thursday night.

Trump is expected to speak at Suffolk County Community College in Brentwood and ask for more resources to combat illegal immigration as well as push for his campaign promise for a border wall.

Against the backdrop of Suffolk County, Trump is set to talk about taking down the notorious MS-13 gang and push forward his immigration agenda. The gang is blamed for 17 murders in the county over the last year and a half.

                      For Tesla, everything is riding on the Model 3.

The electric car company's newest vehicle is set to go to its first 30 customers Friday evening. Its $35,000 starting price — half the cost of Tesla's previous models — and 215-mile range could bring hundreds of thousands of customers into the automaker's fold, taking it from a niche luxury brand to the mainstream.

Those higher sales could finally make Tesla profitable and accelerate its plans for future products like SUVs and pickup trucks.

Or the Model 3 could dash Tesla's dreams.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Capital LLC, as seller (in such capacity, together with its
successors and permitted assigns hereunder, the “ Mortgage

Commercial Mortgage Securities, LLC, as purchaser (in such
capacity, together with its successors and permitted assigns
hereunder, the “ Purchaser ”).

 
RECITALS
 

The Mortgage Loan Seller desires to

”).

 

The Purchaser intends to create a
trust (the “ Trust ”), the primary assets of
which will be a segregated pool of commercial, multifamily and/or
manufactured housing community mortgage loans, that includes the
Mortgage Loans. Beneficial ownership of the assets of the Trust
(such assets collectively, the “ Trust Fund ”)
will be evidenced by a series of mortgage pass-through certificates
(the “ Certificates ”). Certain classes of the
Certificates will be rated by nationally recognized statistical
rating organizations (the “ Rating Agencies ”).
Certain classes of Certificates (the “ Registered
Certificates ”) will be registered under the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (the “ Securities Act
”), and certain classes of Certificates (the “

LLC, as operating advisor (in such capacity, the “
Operating Advisor ”) and as asset representations
reviewer (in such capacity, the “ Asset Representations
Reviewer ”). Capitalized terms used but not otherwise
defined herein shall have the respective meanings assigned to them
in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement as in full force and effect
on the Closing Date (as defined in Section 1 hereof).
Any reference to a provision of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement
shall be to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement as in full force
and effect on the Closing Date. It is anticipated that the
Purchaser will transfer the Mortgage Loans to the Trustee on behalf
of the Trust contemporaneously with its purchase of the Mortgage
Loans hereunder.

Registered Certificates to SG Americas Securities, LLC (“
SGAS ”), Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. (“
CF&Co. ”), Natixis Securities Americas LLC

SGAS, CF&Co., Natixis, Wells Fargo Securities and CGMI
(collectively in such capacity, the “ Initial

and (b) that certain private placement memorandum, dated
July 1, 2016 (together with all annexes and exhibits
thereto, the “ Private Placement Memorandum ”),
relating to the Non-Registered Certificates, as each may be amended
or supplemented at any time hereafter.

 

The Mortgage Loan Seller will
indemnify the Purchaser, the Underwriters, the Initial Purchasers
and certain related parties with respect to certain disclosure
regarding the Mortgage Loans that is contained in (a) that
certain preliminary prospectus, dated June 22, 2016
relating to the Registered Certificates (together with all annexes
and exhibits thereto, collectively, the “ Preliminary
Prospectus ”), (b) that certain preliminary private

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of
the premises and the mutual agreements set forth herein, the
parties agree as follows:

herein, the Mortgage Loans. The purchase and sale of the Mortgage
Loans shall take place on July 19, 2016 or such other

for any transaction expenses for which the Mortgage Loan Seller is
responsible). The Purchaser shall pay such purchase price to the

immediately available funds or by such other method as shall be
mutually acceptable to the parties hereto.

Seller does hereby sell, assign,
transfer, set over and otherwise convey to the Purchaser, without
recourse, representation or warranty, other than as set forth
herein, all of the right, title and interest of the Mortgage Loan
Seller in, to and under the Mortgage Loans and all documents
included in the related Mortgage Files and Servicing Files. Such
assignment includes all scheduled payments of principal and
interest under and proceeds of the Mortgage Loans received after
their respective Cut-off Dates (other than scheduled payments of
interest and principal due on or before their respective Cut-off
Dates, which shall belong and be promptly remitted to the Mortgage
Loan Seller) together with all documents delivered or caused to be
delivered hereunder with respect to such Mortgage Loans by the
Mortgage Loan Seller (including all documents included in the
related Mortgage Files and Servicing Files and any other documents
required to be delivered by the Mortgage Loan Seller under
Sections 2.01(b) and (c) of the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement). The Purchaser shall be entitled to receive all
scheduled payments of principal and interest due on the Mortgage
Loans after their respective Cut-off Dates, and all other
recoveries of principal and interest collected thereon after their
respective Cut-off Dates (other than scheduled payments of
principal and interest due on the Mortgage Loans on or before their
respective Cut-off Dates and collected after such respective
Cut-off Dates or, in the case of Qualified Substitute Mortgage
Loans (if any), due on or prior to the related date of substitution
and collected after such date, in each case, which shall belong to
the Mortgage Loan Seller).

 

After the Mortgage Loan
Seller’s transfer of the Mortgage Loans to the Purchaser, as
provided herein, the Mortgage Loan Seller shall not take any action
inconsistent with the Purchaser’s ownership of the Mortgage
Loans. Except for actions that are the express responsibility of
another party hereunder or under the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement, and further except for actions that the Mortgage Loan
Seller is expressly permitted to complete subsequent to the Closing
Date, the Mortgage Loan Seller shall, on or before the Closing
Date, take all actions required under applicable law to effectuate
the transfer of the Mortgage Loans by the Mortgage Loan Seller to
the Purchaser.

 

(b)          
The conveyance of the Mortgage Loans
and the related rights and property accomplished hereby is intended
by the parties hereto to constitute a sale by the Mortgage Loan
Seller of all the Mortgage Loan Seller’s right, title and
interest in and to such Mortgage Loans and such other related
rights and property by the Mortgage Loan Seller to the Purchaser.
Furthermore, it is not intended that such conveyance be a pledge of
security for a loan. If such conveyance is determined to be a
pledge of security for a loan, however, then: (i) this
Agreement shall constitute a security agreement under applicable
law; (ii) the Mortgage Loan Seller shall be deemed to have
granted to the Purchaser, and in any event, the Mortgage Loan
Seller hereby grants to the Purchaser, a first priority security
interest in all of the Mortgage Loan Seller’s right, title
and interest, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, in and to
(1) the Mortgage Loans, (2) all documents included in the
related Mortgage Files and Servicing Files, (3) all scheduled
payments of principal and interest due on the Mortgage Loans after
their respective Cut-off Dates, and (4) all other recoveries
of principal and interest collected thereon after their respective
Cut-off Dates (other than scheduled payments of principal and
interest due on the Mortgage Loans on or before their respective
Cut-off Dates and collected after such respective Cut-off Dates or,
in the case of Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loans (if any), due on
or prior to the related date of substitution and collected after
such date); (iii) the assignment by the Purchaser to the
Trustee of its interests in the Mortgage Loans as contemplated by
Section 16 hereof shall be deemed to be an assignment
of any security interest created hereunder;
(iv) the

possession by the Purchaser (or the
Custodian) of the Mortgage Notes with respect to the Mortgage Loans
subject hereto from time to time and such other items of property
as constitute instruments, money, negotiable documents or chattel
paper shall be deemed to be “possession by the secured
party” or possession by a purchaser or person designated by
such secured party for the purpose of perfecting such security
interest under applicable law; and (v) notifications to, and
acknowledgments, receipts or confirmations from, Persons holding
such property, shall be deemed to be notifications to, or
acknowledgments, receipts or confirmations from, securities
intermediaries, bailees or agents (as applicable) of the Purchaser
for the purpose of perfecting such security interest under
applicable law. The Mortgage Loan Seller and the Purchaser shall,
to the extent consistent with this Agreement, take such actions as
may be reasonably necessary to ensure that, if this Agreement were
deemed to create a security interest in the Mortgage Loans, such
security interest would be a perfected security interest of first
priority under applicable law and will be maintained as such
throughout the term of this Agreement and the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement.

 

(c)         
In connection with the Mortgage Loan
Seller’s assignment pursuant to Section 2(a)
above, the Mortgage Loan Seller, at its expense, shall deliver to
and deposit with, or cause to be delivered to and deposited with,
the Custodian, (x) on or before the Closing Date, the Mortgage Note

required to be delivered or deposited by the Mortgage Loan Seller
under Sections 2.01(b) and (c) of the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement (other than amounts from reserve accounts and originals

Servicer) for each Mortgage Loan, and shall take such other actions
and pay such costs with respect to the Mortgage Loans as may be
required under Sections 2.01(b) and (c) of the Pooling and
Servicing Agreement.

 

(d)

respect to letters of credit referred to in clause (xii) of the
definition of “Mortgage File”, the Mortgage Loan Seller
shall deliver the original of such letter of credit to the Master
Servicer (with a copy to the Custodian) or, if such original has
been submitted by the Mortgage Loan Seller to the issuing bank to
effect a reissuance, assignment or amendment of such letter of

care of the Trustee) that may be required in order for the Master
Servicer to draw on such letter of credit on behalf of the Trust in

letter of credit on behalf of the Trust in accordance with the
applicable terms thereof and/or of the related Mortgage Loan
documents, the Mortgage Loan Seller shall deliver the appropriate
assignment or amendment documents (or copies of such assignment or
amendment documents if the Mortgage Loan Seller has submitted the
originals to the related issuer of such letter of credit for
processing) to the Custodian within forty-five (45) days of the
Closing Date. If not otherwise paid by the related Mortgagor, the
Mortgage Loan Seller shall pay any costs of assignment or amendment
of such letter(s) of credit required in order for the Master

letter of credit prior to the date such letter of credit is
assigned or amended in order that it may be drawn by the Master
Servicer on behalf of the Trust.

Section 2(d) by the Master Servicer and (ii) the
Closing Date, the Mortgage Loan Seller shall notify each provider
of a letter of credit for each Mortgage Loan identified as having a
letter of credit on the Mortgage Loan Schedule, that the Master
Servicer (in care of the Trustee) for the benefit of the
Certificateholders and any related Companion Holders shall be the
beneficiary under each such letter of credit.

 

(e)         
In addition, with respect to each of
the Mortgage Loans identified as Loan No. 19, 34 and 38 on the
Mortgage Loan Schedule, which is subject to a franchise agreement
with a related comfort letter in favor of the Mortgage Loan Seller

name of the Trustee for the benefit of the Certificateholders, the
Mortgage Loan Seller shall, within forty-five (45) days of the
Closing Date (or any shorter period if required by the applicable
comfort letter), notify the related franchisor (with a copy to the
Master Servicer) that such Mortgage Loans have been transferred to
the Trust; and if the Mortgage Loan Seller receives notice from the
Master Servicer that any such comfort letter with respect to a
franchise agreement has not been received within the timeframe
provided under Section 2.01(g) of the Pooling and
Servicing Agreement, the Mortgage Loan Seller shall, within a
commercially reasonable time after receipt of such notice, request
a replacement comfort letter in substantially the same form as the
existing comfort letter (or any such new document or
acknowledgement as may be contemplated under the existing comfort
letter) in favor of the Trust.

 

(f)

Seller’s assignment pursuant to Section 2(a)
above, the Mortgage Loan Seller, at its expense, shall deliver to
and deposit with, or cause to be delivered to and deposited with,
the Master Servicer in accordance with Section 2.01(d) of the

for the ongoing administration and/or servicing of the applicable
Mortgage Loan or Serviced Whole Loan in the possession or under the
control of the Mortgage Loan Seller that relate to the Mortgage
Loans or related Serviced Whole Loan(s) and, to the extent that any
original documents or copies, as applicable, of the following
documents are not required to be a part of a Mortgage File for any
Mortgage Loan or Serviced Whole Loan, originals or copies of all
documents, certificates and opinions in the possession or under the
control of the Mortgage Loan Seller that were delivered by or on

Seller shall not be required to deliver any attorney-client
privileged communication, draft documents or any documents or
materials prepared by it or its Affiliates for internal uses,
including without limitation, credit committee briefs or memoranda
and other internal approval documents); and (iii) all
unapplied reserve funds and Escrow Payments in the possession or
under the control of the Mortgage Loan Seller that relate to the
Mortgage Loans (other than any Non-Serviced Whole Loans). In
addition, not later than the Closing Date, the Mortgage Loan Seller

Agreement.

 

(g)          
Under generally accepted accounting
principles (“ GAAP ”) and for federal income tax
purposes, the Mortgage Loan Seller shall report its transfer of the
Mortgage Loans to the Purchaser, as provided herein, as a sale of
the Mortgage Loans to the Purchaser in exchange for the
consideration specified in Section 1 hereof. In
connection with the foregoing, the Mortgage Loan Seller shall cause
all of its records to reflect such transfer as a sale (as opposed
to a secured loan) and to reflect that the Mortgage Loans are no
longer property of the Mortgage Loan Seller. In no event shall the
Mortgage Loan Seller take any action that is inconsistent with the
Trust’s ownership of each Mortgage Loan following the Closing
Date.

 

(h)          
The Mortgage Loan Schedule, as it
may be amended from time to time, shall conform to the requirements
set forth in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement. The Mortgage Loan
Seller shall, within fifteen (15) days of its discovery or
receipt of notice of any error on the Mortgage Loan Schedule, amend
such Mortgage Loan Schedule and deliver to the Purchaser or the
Trustee, as the case may be, an amended Mortgage Loan Schedule;
provided that this sentence shall not be construed to
relieve the Mortgage Loan Seller of any liability for any related
Breach.

Diligence Review . The
Mortgage Loan Seller shall reasonably cooperate with any
examination of the Mortgage Files for, and any other documents and
records relating to, the Mortgage Loans, that may be undertaken by

fact that the Purchaser has conducted or has failed to conduct any
partial or complete examination of any of

 

-6-


 


 

the Mortgage Files for, and/or any
of such other documents and records relating to, the Mortgage
Loans, shall not affect the Purchaser’s right to pursue any
remedy available in equity or at law for a breach of the Mortgage
Loan Seller’s representations and warranties made pursuant to
Section 4 , except as expressly set forth in
Section 5 .

 

Section

or compensation in connection with the sale to the Purchaser of the
Mortgage Loans.

 

(d)

represents and warrants that, with respect to the Mortgage Loans

The Responsible Repurchase Party
hereby agrees that it shall be deemed to make to and for the
benefit of the Purchaser, as of the date of any substitution, with
respect to any replacement Mortgage Loan (a “ Qualified
Substitute Mortgage Loan ”) that is substituted for a
Defective Loan by the Responsible Repurchase Party pursuant to

representations and warranties set forth in Exhibit C
to this Agreement. For purposes of the representations and
warranties set forth in Exhibit C , representations and
warranties made as of the Closing Date or as of the Cut-off Date
shall, in the case of a Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan, be made
as of the date of substitution. From and after the date of
substitution, each Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan, if any,
shall be deemed to constitute a “Mortgage Loan”
hereunder for all purposes. A “ Defective Loan ”
is any Mortgage Loan as to which there is an unremedied Material
Defect.

 

(g)          
Except for the agreed-upon
procedures report obtained from the accounting firm engaged to
perform procedures involving a comparison of information in loan
files for the Mortgage Loans to information on a data tape relating

the Closing Date, will not obtain without the consent of the
Purchaser) any “third party due diligence report” (as
defined in Rule 15Ga-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,

transaction contemplated herein and in the Prospectus and Private
Placement Memorandum and, except for the accountants with respect
to the Accountants’ Due Diligence Report, the Mortgage Loan
Seller has not employed (and, through and including the Closing
Date, will not employ without the consent of the Purchaser) any
third party to engage in any activity that constitutes “due
diligence services” within the meaning of Rule 17g-10 under
the Exchange Act in connection with the transactions contemplated
herein and in the Prospectus and Private Placement Memorandum. The
Underwriters and Initial Purchasers are third-party beneficiaries
of the provisions set forth in this Section 4(g)
.

 

(h)          
It is understood and agreed that the
representations and warranties set forth in or made pursuant to
this Section 4 shall survive delivery of the respective
Mortgage Files to the Purchaser or its designee and shall inure to
the benefit of the Purchaser, notwithstanding any restrictive or
qualified endorsement or assignment.

 

(i)          
Within sixty (60) days after the
Closing Date, the Mortgage Loan Seller shall deliver or cause to be
delivered an electronic copy of the Diligence File for each
Mortgage Loan to the Depositor by uploading such Diligence File
(including, if applicable, any additional documents or information
that the Mortgage Loan Seller believes should be included to enable
the Asset Representations Reviewer to perform an Asset Review on
such Mortgage Loan; provided that such documents or
information are clearly labeled and identified) to the Designated
Site, each such Diligence File being organized and categorized in
accordance with the electronic file structure reasonably agreed to
by the Depositor and the Mortgage Loan Seller.

 

(j)          
Within sixty (60) days after the
Closing Date, the Mortgage Loan Seller shall provide the Depositor

Diligence File for each Mortgage
Loan uploaded to the Designated Site contains all documents and
information required under the definition of “Diligence
File” and such Diligence Files are organized and categorized
in accordance with the electronic file structure reasonably agreed
to by the Depositor and the Mortgage Loan Seller.

 

(k)          
If, as part of an Asset Review of a
Mortgage Loan, the Asset Representations Reviewer determines it is
missing any document that is required to be part of the Review
Materials for such Mortgage Loan and that is necessary in
connection with its completion of the Asset Review, then, upon
written request of the Asset Representations Reviewer, the Mortgage
Loan Seller shall provide to the Asset Representations Reviewer,
within ten (10) Business Days of receipt of such written request,
any such document; provided , however , that the
Mortgage Loan Seller shall be required to deliver such missing
document only to the extent that such document is in the possession
of the Mortgage Loan Seller, but in any event excluding any
documents that contain information that is proprietary to the
related originator or the Mortgage Loan Seller or any draft
documents or privileged or internal communications.

 

(l)

Review with respect to each Mortgage Loan in accordance with the
Pooling and Servicing Agreement and receipt of a written invoice
from the Asset Representations Reviewer, the Mortgage Loan Seller

the Mortgage Loans subject to that Asset Review within sixty (60)
days of such written invoice by the Asset Representations

(m)

a dispute resolution method pursuant to Section 2.03 of the
Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the Mortgage Loan Seller shall
abide by the selected dispute resolution method and otherwise
comply with the terms and provisions set forth in the Pooling and
Servicing Agreement (including the exhibits thereto) related to
such dispute resolution method.

 

(n)          
The Mortgage Loan Seller shall
indemnify and hold harmless the Purchaser against any and all
expenses, losses, claims, damages and other liabilities, including
without limitation the costs of investigation, legal defense and
any amounts paid in settlement of any claim or litigation arising
out of or based upon any failure by the Mortgage Loan Seller to (A)
(i) pay the fees described under Section 4(l)
above as a result of the Mortgage Loan Seller being insolvent or
(ii) pay the fees described under Section 4(l) above
within sixty (60) days of written invoice by the Asset
Representations Reviewer or (B) provide all documents (i) required
to be delivered by it pursuant to this Agreement, and (ii) within
sixty (60) days of the Closing Date, under the definition of
“Diligence File” in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement
(or such later date specified herein or in the Pooling and
Servicing Agreement).

 

(o)          
The Mortgage Loan Seller covenants
with the Purchaser that if, on or prior to the later of (i) the
ninetieth (90th) day following the Closing Date and (ii) the date
upon which all Certificates have been sold to parties unaffiliated
with the Depositor, as a result of the occurrence of any event that
occurred prior to the Closing Date with respect to the Mortgage
Loans or the Mortgage Loan Seller (and the Mortgage Loan Seller
hereby covenants to promptly notify the Depositor, the Underwriters
and the Initial Purchasers of the occurrence of any such event to
the extent it has knowledge thereof), an amendment or supplement to
the Prospectus or

Private Placement Memorandum,
including Annexes A-1, A-2 and A-3 of the Prospectus, with respect
to any information regarding the Mortgage Loans or the Mortgage
Loan Seller, is necessary to be delivered in connection with sales
of the Certificates by the Underwriters, the Initial Purchasers or
a dealer, in order to correct any untrue statement of a material
fact or any omission to state a material fact required to be stated
therein (solely in the case of the Prospectus) or necessary to make
the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances when the
Prospectus or Private Placement Memorandum is delivered to a
purchaser, not misleading, or an amendment or supplement to the
Prospectus or Private Placement Memorandum, including Annexes A-1,
A-2 and A-3 of the Prospectus, with respect to any information
regarding the Mortgage Loans or the Mortgage Loan Seller, is
necessary to comply with applicable law, the Mortgage Loan Seller
shall do all things necessary (or, with respect to information
relating to the Mortgage Loans, provide all information in its
possession) to assist the Depositor to prepare and furnish, at the
expense of the Mortgage Loan Seller (to the extent that such
amendment or supplement relates to the Mortgage Loan Seller, the
Mortgage Loans and/or any information describing the same, as
provided by the Mortgage Loan Seller), to the Underwriters and
Initial Purchasers such amendments or supplements to the Prospectus
or Private Placement Memorandum as may be necessary, so that the
statements in the Prospectus or Private Placement Memorandum as so
amended or supplemented, including Annexes A-1, A-2 and A-3 of the
Prospectus, with respect to any information regarding the Mortgage
Loans or the Mortgage Loan Seller, will not so contain an untrue
statement of material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein (solely in the case of the
Prospectus) or necessary to make the statements therein, in the
light of the circumstances when the Prospectus or Private Placement
Memorandum is delivered to a purchaser, not misleading or so that
the Prospectus or Private Placement Memorandum (as so annexed or
supplemented), including Annexes A-1, A-2 and A-3 of the
Prospectus, with respect to any information regarding the Mortgage
Loans or the Mortgage Loan Seller, will not so fail to comply with
applicable law. All terms used in this Section 4(o) and not
otherwise defined herein shall have the meaning set forth in the
Indemnification Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Mortgage Loan Seller shall have no affirmative obligation to
monitor the performance of the Mortgage Loans or any changes in
condition or circumstance of any Mortgaged Property, Mortgagor,
guarantor or any of their Affiliates after the Closing Date in
connection with its obligations under this Section 4(o). The
Underwriters and Initial Purchasers are third-party beneficiaries
of the provisions set forth in this Section 4(o)
.

 

Section
5.      Notice of Breach; Cure, Repurchase and
Substitution . (a) The
Mortgage Loan Seller shall, not later than ninety (90) days after
(i) except in the case of the succeeding clause (ii) , the
Mortgage Loan Seller’s receipt of notice of or, if earlier,
the Mortgage Loan Seller’s discovery of, a Material Defect or
(ii) in the case of a Material Defect relating to a Mortgage Loan
not being a “qualified mortgage” within the meaning of
Section 860G(a)(3) of the Code, but without regard to the rule
of Treasury Regulations Section 1.860G-2(f)(2) that causes a
defective Mortgage Loan to be treated as a qualified mortgage, the
earlier of (x) the discovery by the Mortgage Loan Seller or any
party to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement of such Material
Defect and (y) receipt of notice of the Material Defect from any
party to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement (such ninety (90) day
period, the “ Initial Cure Period ”), (A) cure
such Material Defect in all material respects, at the Mortgage Loan
Seller’s own expense, including reimbursement of any related
reasonable additional expenses of the Trust reasonably incurred by
any party to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, (B) repurchase
the affected

 

-10-


 


 

Mortgage Loan or REO Loan (excluding
any related Companion Loan, if applicable), at the applicable
Purchase Price and in conformity with this Agreement and Section
2.03 of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement or (C) substitute a
Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan (other than with respect to the
Whole Loans, for which no substitution will be permitted) for such
affected Mortgage Loan or REO Loan ( provided that in no
event shall any such substitution occur on or after the second
anniversary of the Closing Date) and pay the Master Servicer for
deposit into the Collection Account, any Substitution Shortfall
Amount in connection therewith and in conformity with this
Agreement and Section 2.03 of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement;
provided , however , that except with respect to a
Material Defect resulting solely from the failure by the Mortgage
Loan Seller to deliver to the Trustee or Custodian the actual
policy of lender’s title insurance required pursuant to
clause (viii) of the definition of Mortgage File by a date not
later than eighteen (18) months following the Closing Date, if such
Material Defect is capable of being cured but is not cured within
the Initial Cure Period, and the Mortgage Loan Seller has commenced
and is diligently proceeding with the cure of such Material Defect
within the Initial Cure Period, the Mortgage Loan Seller shall have
an additional ninety (90) days commencing immediately upon the
expiration of the Initial Cure Period (such additional ninety (90)
day period, the “ Extended Cure Period ”) to
complete such cure (or, failing such cure, to repurchase the
related Mortgage Loan or REO Loan (excluding any related Companion
Loan, if applicable) or substitute a Qualified Substitute Mortgage
Loan (other than with respect to the Whole Loans, for which no
substitution will be permitted)) and provided ,
further , that with respect to such Extended Cure Period the
Mortgage Loan Seller has delivered an officer’s certificate
to the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the Master Servicer,
the Special Servicer, the Operating Advisor and (with respect to
any Mortgage Loan other than an Excluded Loan, prior to the
occurrence of a Consultation Termination Event) the Directing
Certificateholder, setting forth the reason such Material Defect is
not capable of being cured within the Initial Cure Period and what
actions the Mortgage Loan Seller is pursuing in connection with the
cure thereof and stating that the Mortgage Loan Seller anticipates
that such Material Defect will be cured within the Extended Cure
Period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Defect or Breach that
causes any Mortgage Loan not to be a “qualified
mortgage” (within the meaning of Section 860G(a)(3) of
the Code, but without regard to the rule of Treasury Regulations
Section 1.860G-2(f)(2) that causes a defective Mortgage Loan
to be treated as a qualified mortgage) shall be deemed to
materially and adversely affect the interests of Certificateholders
therein, and (subject to the Mortgage Loan Seller’s right to
cure such Defect or Breach during the Initial Cure Period) such
Mortgage Loan shall be repurchased or substituted for without
regard to the Extended Cure Period described in the preceding
sentence. If the affected Mortgage Loan is to be repurchased, the
funds in the amount of the Purchase Price remitted by the Mortgage
Loan Seller are to be remitted by wire transfer to the Master
Servicer for deposit into the Collection Account. Any such
repurchase or substitution of a Mortgage Loan shall be on a whole
loan, servicing released basis.

 

If the Mortgage Loan Seller, in
connection with a Material Defect (or an allegation of a Material
Defect) pertaining to a Mortgage Loan agrees to a Loss of Value
Payment, pursuant to any agreement or a settlement between the
Mortgage Loan Seller and the Special Servicer on behalf of the
Trust (and, with respect to any Mortgage Loan other than an
Excluded Loan, with the consent of the Directing Certificateholder
if no Control Termination Event has occurred and is continuing)
with respect to such Mortgage Loan, the amount of such Loss of
Value Payment shall be remitted by wire transfer to the Special
Servicer for deposit into the Loss of Value Reserve Fund. The Loss
of Value Payment shall include the portion of any

 

-11-


 


 

Liquidation Fees payable to the
Special Servicer in respect of such Loss of Value Payment and the
portion of fees of the Asset Representations Reviewer payable
pursuant to Section 4(l) above attributable to the Asset
Review of such Mortgage Loan and not previously paid by the
Mortgage Loan Seller. If such Loss of Value Payment is made, the
Loss of Value Payment shall serve as the sole remedy available to
the Certificateholders and the Trustee on their behalf regarding
any such Material Defect in lieu of any obligation of the Mortgage
Loan Seller to otherwise cure such Material Defect or repurchase or
substitute for the affected Mortgage Loan based on such Material
Defect under any circumstances. This paragraph is intended to apply
only to a mutual agreement or settlement between the Mortgage Loan
Seller and the Special Servicer on behalf of the Trust. The
following terms shall apply to any Loss of Value Payment: (i) prior
to any agreement or settlement between the Mortgage Loan Seller and
the Special Servicer nothing in this paragraph shall preclude the
Mortgage Loan Seller or the Master Servicer or the Special
Servicer, as applicable, from exercising any of its rights related
to a Material Defect in the manner and timing set forth in this
Agreement (excluding this paragraph) or the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement (including any right to cure, repurchase or substitute
for such Mortgage Loan), (ii) such Loss of Value Payment shall not
be greater than the Purchase Price of the affected Mortgage Loan;
and (iii) a Material Defect as a result of a Mortgage Loan not
constituting a “qualified mortgage” within the meaning
of Section 860G(a)(3) of the Code (but without regard to the
rule of Treasury Regulations Section 1.860G-2(f)(2) that
causes a defective Mortgage Loan to be treated as a
“qualified mortgage”) may not be cured by a Loss of
Value Payment.

 

The Mortgage Loan Seller’s
obligation to cure any Material Defect, repurchase or substitute
for any affected Mortgage Loan or pay the Loss of Value Payment or
other required payment pursuant to this Section 5 shall
constitute the sole remedy available to the Purchaser in connection
with a Material Defect. It is acknowledged and agreed that the
representations and warranties are being made for risk allocation
purposes; provided , however , that no limitation of
such remedy is implied with respect to the Mortgage Loan
Seller’s breach of its obligation to cure, repurchase or
substitute in accordance with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement.

 

The Mortgage Loan Seller agrees
that, with respect to any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan, any
“Material Defect” (or analogous term) under the related
Non-Serviced PSA shall constitute a Material Defect under this
Agreement to the extent the Mortgage Loan Seller repurchases the
Non-Serviced Companion Loan from the trust created pursuant to such
Non-Serviced PSA; provided , however , that the
foregoing shall not apply to any “Material Defect” (or
analogous term) related solely to the promissory note for any
related Non-Serviced Companion Loan.

 

The remedies provided for in this
subsection with respect to any Material Defect with respect to any
Mortgage Loan shall also apply to the related REO
Property.

 

If any Breach that constitutes a
Material Defect pertains to a representation or warranty that the
related Mortgage Loan documents or any particular Mortgage Loan
document requires the related Mortgagor to bear the costs and
expenses associated with any particular action or matter under such
Mortgage Loan document(s), then the Mortgage Loan Seller shall cure
such Breach within the applicable cure period (as the same may be
extended) by reimbursing the Trust (by wire transfer of immediately
available funds) for (i) the reasonable

 

-12-


 


 

amount of any such costs and
expenses incurred by the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the
Certificate Administrator, the Trustee or the Trust that are
incurred as a result of such Breach and have not been reimbursed by
the related Mortgagor and (ii) the amount of any fees payable
pursuant to Section 4(l) above to the extent not previously
paid by the Mortgage Loan Seller to the Asset Representations
Reviewer attributable to the Asset Review of such Mortgage Loan;
provided , that in the event any such costs and expenses
exceed $10,000, the Mortgage Loan Seller shall have the option to
either repurchase or substitute for the related Mortgage Loan as
provided above or pay such costs and expenses. Except as provided
in the proviso to the immediately preceding sentence, the Mortgage
Loan Seller shall remit the amount of such costs and expenses to
the Special Servicer for disbursement to the applicable Persons and
upon its making such remittance, the Mortgage Loan Seller shall be
deemed to have cured such Breach in all respects. To the extent any
fees or expenses that are the subject of a cure by the Mortgage
Loan Seller are subsequently obtained from the related Mortgagor,
the portion of the cure payment made by the Mortgage Loan Seller
equal to such fees or expenses obtained from the related Mortgagor
shall promptly be returned to the Mortgage Loan Seller.

 

Notwithstanding anything contained
in this Agreement or the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, no delay
in either the discovery of a Material Defect or in providing notice
of such Material Defect shall relieve the Mortgage Loan Seller of
its obligation to repurchase the related Mortgage Loan if it is
otherwise required to do so under this Agreement or the Pooling and
Servicing Agreement unless (i) the Mortgage Loan Seller did not
otherwise discover or have knowledge of such Material Defect, (ii)
such delay is a result of the failure by the Purchaser or by any
other party to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, to provide
prompt notice as required by the terms of this Agreement or the
Pooling and Servicing Agreement, after such party has actual
knowledge of such Material Defect (knowledge shall not be deemed to
exist by reason of the Custodian Exception Report), (iii) such
Material Defect does not relate to the applicable Mortgage Loan not
being a “qualified mortgage” within the meaning of Code
Section 860G(a)(3), but without regard to the rule of Treasury
Regulations Section 1.860G-2(f)(2) that causes a defective
obligation to be treated as a qualified mortgage, and (iv) such
delay precludes the Mortgage Loan Seller from curing such Material
Defect. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement, if a
Mortgage Loan is not secured by a Mortgaged Property that is, in
whole or in part, a hotel, restaurant (operated by a borrower),
healthcare facility, nursing home, assisted living facility,
self-storage facility, theater or fitness center (operated by a
Mortgagor), then the failure to deliver copies of the UCC financing
statements with respect to such Mortgage Loan pursuant to
Section 2 hereof shall not be a Material Defect.

 

If there is a Material Defect with
respect to one or more Mortgaged Properties securing a Mortgage
Loan, the Mortgage Loan Seller shall not be obligated to repurchase
the Mortgage Loan if (i) the affected Mortgaged Property may be
released pursuant to the terms of any partial release provisions in
the related Mortgage Loan documents (and such Mortgaged Property
is, in fact, released), (ii) the remaining Mortgaged Property(ies)
satisfy the requirements, if any, set forth in the Mortgage Loan
documents and the Mortgage Loan Seller provides an Opinion of
Counsel to the effect that such release would not cause an Adverse
REMIC and (iii) each applicable Rating Agency has provided a Rating
Agency Confirmation.

 

(b)          
Whenever one or more Qualified
Substitute Mortgage Loans are substituted for a Defective Loan by
the Responsible Repurchase Party as contemplated by this

 

-13-


 


 

Section 5
, upon direction by the Master
Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, the Responsible
Repurchase Party shall deliver to the Custodian the related
Mortgage File and a certification to the effect that such Qualified
Substitute Mortgage Loan satisfies or such Qualified Substitute
Mortgage Loans satisfy, as the case may be, all of the requirements
of the definition of “Qualified Substitute Mortgage
Loan” in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement. No mortgage
loan may be substituted for a Defective Loan as contemplated by
this Section 5 if the Mortgage Loan to be replaced was
itself a Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan, in which case, absent
a cure of the relevant Material Defect, the affected Mortgage Loan
will be required to be repurchased as contemplated hereby. Periodic
Payments due with respect to each Qualified Substitute Mortgage
Loan (if any) after the related date of substitution, and Periodic
Payments due with respect to each corresponding Deleted Mortgage
Loan (if any) after its respective Cut-off Date and on or prior to
the related date of substitution, shall be part of the Trust Fund.
Periodic Payments due with respect to each Qualified Substitute
Mortgage Loan (if any) on or prior to the related date of
substitution, and Periodic Payments due with respect to each
corresponding Defective Loan that is purchased or repurchased, as
the case may be, or replaced with one or more Qualified Substitute
Mortgage Loans (any such Mortgage Loan, a “ Deleted
Mortgage Loan ”) (if any) after the related date of
substitution, shall not be part of the Trust Fund and are to be
remitted by the Master Servicer to the Responsible Repurchase Party
promptly following receipt.

 

If any Mortgage Loan is to be
repurchased or replaced as contemplated by this
Section 5 , upon direction by the Master Servicer or
the Special Servicer, as applicable, the Mortgage Loan Seller shall
amend the Mortgage Loan Schedule to reflect the removal of any
Deleted Mortgage Loan and, if applicable, the substitution of the
related Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan(s) and deliver or cause
the delivery of such amended Mortgage Loan Schedule to the parties
to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement. Upon any substitution of
one or more Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loans for a Deleted
Mortgage Loan, such Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan(s) shall
become part of the Trust Fund and be subject to the terms of this
Agreement in all respects.

 

If any Mortgage Loan that is part of
a Crossed Mortgage Loan Group is required to be repurchased or
substituted, the provisions of Section 2.03(h),
Section 2.03(i) and Section 2.03(j) of the Pooling and
Servicing Agreement shall apply.

 

(c)          
The Responsible Repurchase Party
shall be entitled, and the Purchaser shall cause the Pooling and
Servicing Agreement to entitle the Responsible Repurchase Party,
upon the date when the full amount of the Purchase Price or
Substitution Shortfall Amount (as the case may be) for any Mortgage
Loan repurchased or replaced as contemplated by this
Section 5 has been deposited in the account designated
therefor by the Trustee as the assignee of the Purchaser (or the
Master Servicer on behalf of the Trustee) and, if applicable,
receipt by the Trustee as the assignee of the Purchaser (or the
Custodian) of the Mortgage File for each Qualified Substitute
Mortgage Loan (if any) to be substituted for a Deleted Mortgage
Loan, together with any certifications and/or opinions required
pursuant to this Section 5 to be delivered by the
Responsible Repurchase Party, to (i) a release of the Mortgage
File and any other items required to be delivered by the Mortgage
Loan Seller under Sections 2.01(b) and (c) of the Pooling and
Servicing Agreement for the Deleted Mortgage Loan to the
Responsible Repurchase Party or its designee, (ii) the
execution and delivery of such instruments of release,

 

-14-


 


 

transfer and/or assignment, in each
case without recourse, as shall be prepared by the Responsible
Repurchase Party and are reasonably necessary to vest in the
Responsible Repurchase Party or its designee the ownership of such
Deleted Mortgage Loan, and (iii) the execution and delivery of
notice to the affected Mortgagor of the retransfer of such Deleted
Mortgage Loan. In connection with any such repurchase or
substitution by the Responsible Repurchase Party, the Purchaser
shall also cause the Pooling and Servicing Agreement to require
each of the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer to deliver to
the Responsible Repurchase Party or its designee, and the
Responsible Repurchase Party or its designee shall be entitled to
delivery from the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer of, any
portion of the related Servicing File, together with any Escrow
Payments, reserve funds and any other items required to be
delivered by the Mortgage Loan Seller under Sections 2.01(b)
and (c) of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, held by or on
behalf of the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as the case
may be, with respect to the Deleted Mortgage Loan, in each case at
the expense of the Responsible Repurchase Party.

(e)          
The Mortgage Loan Seller
acknowledges and agrees that the Purchaser shall have no liability
to the Mortgage Loan Seller or otherwise for any failure of the
Mortgage Loan Seller or any other party to the Pooling and
Servicing Agreement to perform its obligations provided for
thereunder.

 

(f)          
The Mortgage Loan Seller will
provide the Responsible Repurchase Party copies of any 15Ga-1

from a Material Defect or other breach of a representation or
warranty, such recipient a “ Seller Request Recipient
” and such request or demand, a “ Repurchase
Request ”) agrees to provide to the Purchaser:
(i) written notice of any Repurchase Request, which notice
will specify if such Repurchase Request is a 15Ga-1 Notice;
(ii) written notice of (A) the existence of any dispute
regarding such Repurchase Request, whether written or oral, between

Approximately $563 Million of Structured Securities Affected


New York, April 27, 2017 -- Moody's Investors Service has affirmed the ratings on six classes 
in SG Commercial Mortgage Securities Trust 2016-C5, Commercial 
Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates Series 2016-C5 as follows:




Cl. A-1 Certificate, Affirmed Aaa (sf); previously 
on Jul 20, 2016 Definitive Rating Assigned Aaa (sf)


Cl. A-2 Certificate, Affirmed Aaa (sf); previously 
on Jul 20, 2016 Definitive Rating Assigned Aaa (sf)

Cl. A-SB Certificate, Affirmed Aaa (sf); previously 
on Jul 20, 2016 Definitive Rating Assigned Aaa (sf)


Cl. A-M Certificate, Affirmed Aa3 (sf); previously 
on Jul 20, 2016 Definitive Rating Assigned Aa3 (sf)




RATINGS RATIONALE




The ratings on the P&I classes were affirmed because the transaction's 
key metrics, including Moody's loan-to-value (LTV) 
ratio, Moody's stressed debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) and the 
transaction's Herfindahl Index (Herf), are within acceptable 
ranges.




Moody's rating action reflects a base expected loss of 6.2% 
of the current balance. Moody's base expected loss plus realized 
losses is now 6.2% of the original pooled balance. 
Moody's provides a current list of base expected losses for conduit 
and fusion CMBS transactions on moodys.com at http://www.moodys.com/viewresearchdoc.aspx?docid=PBS_SF215255.




FACTORS THAT WOULD LEAD TO A UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS:




The performance expectations for a given variable indicate Moody's forward-looking 
view of the likely range of performance over the medium term. Performance 
that falls outside the given range can indicate that the collateral's 
credit quality is stronger or weaker than Moody's had previously expected.




Factors that could lead to an upgrade of the ratings include a significant 
amount of loan paydowns or amortization, an increase in the pool's 
share of defeasance or an improvement in pool performance.




Factors that could lead to a downgrade of the ratings include a decline 
in the performance of the pool, loan concentration, an increase 
in realized and expected losses from specially serviced and troubled loans 
or interest shortfalls.




METHODOLOGY UNDERLYING THE RATING ACTION




The principal methodology used in these ratings was "Approach to Rating 
US and Canadian Conduit/Fusion CMBS" published in December 2014. 
Please see the Rating Methodologies page on www.moodys.com 
for a copy of this methodology.




DESCRIPTION OF MODELS USED




Moody's review used the excel-based CMBS Conduit Model, 
which it uses for both conduit and fusion transactions. Credit 
enhancement levels for conduit loans are driven by property type, 
Moody's actual and stressed DSCR, and Moody's property 
quality grade (which reflects the capitalization rate Moody's uses 
to estimate Moody's value). Moody's fuses the conduit 
results with the results of its analysis of investment grade structured 
credit assessed loans and any conduit loan that represents 10% 
or greater of the current pool balance. 




Moody's uses a variation of Herf to measure the diversity of loan 
sizes, where a higher number represents greater diversity. 
Loan concentration has an important bearing on potential rating volatility, 
including the risk of multiple notch downgrades under adverse circumstances. 
The credit neutral Herf score is 40. The pool has a Herf of 32,the 
the same as at Moody's last review.




DEAL PERFORMANCE




As of the April 12, 2017 distribution date, the transaction's 
aggregate certificate balance has decreased by less than 1% to 
$733 million from $737 million at securitization. 
The certificates are collateralized by 47 mortgage loans ranging in size 
from less than 1% to 5% of the pool, with the top 
ten loans constituting 44% of the pool. One loan, 
constituting 5% of the pool, has an investment-grade 
structured credit assessment.




One loan, constituting 1% of the pool, is on the master 
servicer's watchlist. The watchlist includes loans that meet 
certain portfolio review guidelines established as part of the CRE Finance 
Council (CREFC) monthly reporting package. As part of Moody's 
ongoing monitoring of a transaction, the agency reviews the watchlist 
to assess which loans have material issues that could affect performance.




Moody's received full or partial year 2016 operating results for 50% 
of the pool (excluding specially serviced and defeased loans). 
Moody's weighted average conduit LTV is 127%, compared 
to 128% at securitization. Moody's conduit component 
excludes loans with structured credit assessments, defeased and 
CTL loans, and specially serviced and troubled loans. Moody's 
net cash flow (NCF) reflects a weighted average haircut of 14% 
to the underwritten net operating income (NOI). Moody's value 
reflects a weighted average capitalization rate of 11%.




Moody's actual and stressed conduit DSCRs are 1.41X and 0.90X, 
respectively, compared to 1.42X and 0.90X at the last 
review. Moody's actual DSCR is based on Moody's NCF 
and the loan's actual debt service. Moody's stressed 
DSCR is based on Moody's NCF and a 9.25% stress rate 
the agency applied to the loan balance.




The loan with a structured credit assessment is the Mall at Rockingham 
Park Loan ($40.0 million -- 5.5% of the 
pool), which represents a portion of a $142.5 million 
senior mortgage. The loan is secured by a 541,000 square 
foot (SF) component of a super-regional mall with 1.03 million 
total net rentable area (NRA) in Salem, New Hampshire. The 
anchor tenants include Macy's, Sears and JC Penney, 
which are not part of the collateral, and Lord & Taylor and 
Dick's Sporting Goods, which are part of the collateral. 
The property was constructed in 1991 and renovated in 2015. As 
of April 2016, the collateral was approximately 97% leased. 
The pari passu pieces are held in WFCM 2016-C35 and BBSG 2016-MRP. 
Moody's structured credit assessment and stressed DSCR are a1 (sca.pd) 
and 1.70X, respectively, the same as at securitization.




The top three conduit loans represent 15.0% of the pool 
balance. The largest conduit loan is the 85 Bluxome Loan ($38.0 
million -- 5.2% of the pool), which is secured 
by a five-story Class A office building located in San Francisco, 
California. The property is 100% leased to tenant Collective 
Health which signed its lease in October 2015. Moody's LTV and 
stressed DSCR are 154% and 0.70X, respectively, 
the same as at securitization.

REGULATORY DISCLOSURES




For further specification of Moody's key rating assumptions and sensitivity 
analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and Sensitivity 
to Assumptions of the disclosure form.




The analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and 
performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected 
collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments. As a 
second step, Moody's estimates expected collateral losses or cash 
flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement, 
loss allocation and other structural features, to derive the expected 
loss for each rated instrument.




Moody's did not use any stress scenario simulations in its analysis.




For ratings issued on a program, series or category/class of debt, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to each rating of a subsequently issued bond or note of the same series 
or category/class of debt or pursuant to a program for which the ratings 
are derived exclusively from existing ratings in accordance with Moody's 
rating practices. For ratings issued on a support provider, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the credit rating action on the support provider and in relation to 
each particular credit rating action for securities that derive their 
credit ratings from the support provider's credit rating. 
For provisional ratings, this announcement provides certain regulatory 
disclosures in relation to the provisional rating assigned, and 
in relation to a definitive rating that may be assigned subsequent to 
the final issuance of the debt, in each case where the transaction 
structure and terms have not changed prior to the assignment of the definitive 
rating in a manner that would have affected the rating. For further 
information please see the ratings tab on the issuer/entity page for the 
respective issuer on www.moodys.com.




For any affected securities or rated entities receiving direct credit 
support from the primary entity(ies) of this credit rating action, 
and whose ratings may change as a result of this credit rating action, 
the associated regulatory disclosures will be those of the guarantor entity. 
Exceptions to this approach exist for the following disclosures, 
if applicable to jurisdiction: Ancillary Services, Disclosure 
to rated entity, Disclosure from rated entity.




Regulatory disclosures contained in this press release apply to the credit 
rating and, if applicable, the related rating outlook or rating 
review.








Please see www.moodys.com for any updates on changes to 
the lead rating analyst and to the Moody's legal entity that has issued 
the rating.

To the extent permitted by law, MOODY’S and its directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, licensors and suppliers disclaim liability for any direct or compensatory losses or damages caused to any person or entity, including but not limited to by any negligence (but excluding fraud, willful misconduct or any other type of liability that, for the avoidance of doubt, by law cannot be excluded) on the part of, or any contingency within or beyond the control of, MOODY’S or any of its directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, licensors or suppliers, arising from or in connection with the information contained herein or the use of or inability to use any such information. NO WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE ACCURACY, TIMELINESS, COMPLETENESS, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE OF ANY SUCH RATING OR OTHER OPINION OR INFORMATION IS GIVEN OR MADE BY MOODY’S IN ANY FORM OR MANNER WHATSOEVER. Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody’s Corporation (“MCO”), hereby discloses that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from $1,500 to approximately $2,500,000. MCO and MIS also maintain policies and procedures to address the independence of MIS’s ratings and rating processes. Information regarding certain affiliations that may exist between directors of MCO and rated entities, and between entities who hold ratings from MIS and have also publicly reported to the SEC an ownership interest in MCO of more than 5%, is posted annually at www.moodys.com under the heading “Investor Relations — Corporate Governance — Director and Shareholder Affiliation Policy.” Additional terms for Australia only: Any publication into Australia of this document is pursuant to the Australian Financial Services License of MOODY’S affiliate, Moody’s Investors Service Pty Limited ABN 61 003 399 657AFSL 336969 and/or Moody’s Analytics Australia Pty Ltd ABN 94 105 136 972 AFSL 383569 (as applicable). This document is intended to be provided only to “wholesale clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. By continuing to access this document from within Australia, you represent to MOODY’S that you are, or are accessing the document as a representative of, a “wholesale client” and that neither you nor the entity you represent will directly or indirectly disseminate this document or its contents to “retail clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. MOODY’S credit rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a debt obligation of the issuer, not on the equity securities of the issuer or any form of security that is available to retail investors. It would be reckless and inappropriate for retail investors to use MOODY’S credit ratings or publications when making an investment decision. If in doubt you should contact your financial or other professional adviser. Additional terms for Japan only: Moody's Japan K.K. (“MJKK”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody's Group Japan G.K., which is wholly-owned by Moody’s Overseas Holdings Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of MCO. Moody’s SF Japan K.K. (“MSFJ”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of MJKK. MSFJ is not a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (“NRSRO”). Therefore, credit ratings assigned by MSFJ are Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings. Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings are assigned by an entity that is not a NRSRO and, consequently, the rated obligation will not qualify for certain types of treatment under U.S. laws. MJKK and MSFJ are credit rating agencies registered with the Japan Financial Services Agency and their registration numbers are FSA Commissioner (Ratings) No. 2 and 3 respectively. MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) hereby disclose that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from JPY200,000 to approximately JPY350,000,000. MJKK and MSFJ also maintain policies and procedures to address Japanese regulatory requirements.
