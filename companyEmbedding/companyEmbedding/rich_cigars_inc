Why is this contact information displayed? [Close]
The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of common stock by the
distributees, or the selling security holders. All of the net proceeds from the
sale of our common stock will go to the selling security holders. We have agreed 
to bear the expenses relating to the registration of the common stock for the 
selling security holders.


We will be in competition with many large, well-financed competitors in the
market for premium cigars. Each of these better known companies enjoys strong
brand names and a history of successful product launches. These companies
compete directly with us for consumer sales, as well for supplies of tobacco and
marketing resources. 

All of these companies have substantially greater capital resources,
manufacturing, sales and marketing experience, and substantially longer and more
extensive relationships with growers and long-standing brand recognition and
market acceptance than we do. We believe, however, that the market for premium 
cigars is growing rapidly enough to support the entry of new brands such as ours 
and that the inability of the entrenched competitors to meet current demand 
supports this position.


Company Description
We were incorporated on July 29, 2013 under the laws of the state of Florida.
Rich Cigars was established to manufacture and distribute cigars under the Rich
Cigars brand name. The Company's founders seek to create a cigar that would
appeal to aficionados of high-quality, hand-rolled, premium


 cigars. Founder
Alfred Rushing has been involved with the cigar industry for more than 20 years.
Through Rich Cigars, he intends to introduce new styles of premium cigars to
build sales of private label cigars. The Company intends to conduct its business
principally in the U.S. through its sales and marketing team.

We intend to contract with a Nicaraguan supplier for the manufacture of hand
rolled cigars and market in the U.S in both units and dollars sales of brand
name premium cigars (imported, hand-made or hand-rolled cigars made with Cuban
seed long leaf filler and all natural tobacco leaf). We intend to produce at
least six premium lines for sales in the U.S.  We believe that higher priced
branded premium cigars constitute the fastest growing Segment of the premium
cigar market. We intend to sell under the name "Rich Cigars".  This brand will
be made from premium imported Nicaraguan, Honduran, Dominican Republic and
Brazilian Cuban seed long leaf filler tobacco such as  (seco, viso and ligero). 
Complimenting each cigar with one of six different wrappers (Connecticut Shade,
Connecticut Broad Leaf Maduro, Sumatra, Oscuro, Habanna 2000 and Criollo).

We believe that increasing demand for cigars will offer us growth opportunities.
In recent years, cigar smoking has experienced a resurgence resulting in an
increase in consumption and retail sales of cigars, especially in the premium
cigar segment. This growth produced overall retail sales in the U.S. cigar
market of approximately $1.0 billion in 2013. The gain comes despite an
increasingly unfriendly environment for smokers as a myriad of states enact
smoking bans.

We believe that this increase in cigar consumption and retail sales is the
result of a number of factors, including: (i) the improving image of cigar
smoking resulting from increased publicity plus social media, including the
success of cigar publications and the visibility of cigar smoking by
celebrities; (ii) the emergence of an expanding base of younger, highly
educated, affluent adults age 25 to 45 and the growing interest of this group in
luxury goods, including premium cigars; (iii) the increase in the number of
adults over the age of 40 (a demographic group believed to smoke more cigars
than any other demographic group); and (iv) the opening of establishments, such
as restaurants and clubs,  and "cigar bars" where cigar smoking is encouraged,
as well as other special events for cigar smokers.

(“RICH”), (RCGR), a manufacturer of high-quality premium cigar products, proudly announced today, that a popular first tier cigar magazine, Cigar Snob, has rated the Company’s Godfather cigar in the May/June 2017 The Bike Issue, giving it rave reviews and a solid rating.“We have worked long and hard, focusing on the quality of the product above all else,” said Al Rushing, Vice President and COO of Rich Cigars, Inc.  “To receive both a solid rating and excellent reviews from one of the industry’s most recognized magazines, says more than all of the marketing and self-touting we could ever muster as a young company. “These are experienced smokers, who are respected critics within this arena, having well evolved pallets.  There is no question that if they put our brand in the same class as the market’s top cigars, then cigar smokers across the globe are going to take our brand seriously.”Cigar Snob is a leading publication in the industry.  Competitively ranking amongst other popular publications such as Cigar Aficionado and Cigar Journal, Cigar Snob has a wide circulation; appealing to both the modern and traditional cigar enthusiast.  The magazine covers an eclectic mix of Cigars, Wine & Spirits and Fashion Models, and leverages multiple media outlets to reach its audience.  With a large consumer retail following, Cigar Snob offers a tremendous amount of support to both new and well-established brands.In the May/June 2017 The Bike Issue, the Godfather ranked strongly against the Ashton Classic Maduro and held its own against the Gispert Intenso.  Strong rankings like these, from a magazine like Cigar Snob, “only adds a tremendous amount of support to the current momentum we already have in the market,” stated Richard Davis, CEO of Rich Cigars, Inc.Mr. Davis concluded, “We anticipate that the exposure we receive from Cigar Snob will significantly increase the brand recognition of our Inspiration Blend – encompassing our first four lines; the Vendetta, Billionaire, Kingpin and the Godfather.  We’re also confident that from the increased brand recognition, our momentum will continue to pick up quickly, resulting in a stronger increase of sales.”ABOUT RICH Cigars, Inc.Rich Cigars, Inc. is the maker and distributer of high-quality, hand rolled, premium cigars and other high-end cigar products, marketed under the ‘RICH’ brand.  The Company, operating out of Tampa, Florida, manufactures and ages its tobacco in Central America;

About Us - Rich Cigars



















































































 
















 





About Us

When you look out into the world, what do you see?
Widely diverse cultures. Fading social and economic divides. Shifting landscapes where the mimesis of art and life accelerates with technology.
With all of the varying influence on our civil and cultural evolutions, there remains one undying commodity, second only to gold. One unifying force of camaraderie and fellowship.  …Tobacco
To get a picture of what RICH Cigars is, let’s start by defining what RICH Cigars is not.

















Hype




RICH Cigars IS NOT about the hype or following the herd. It is not a passing trend. It isn’t an unreachable luxury, prefaced by exclusion or measured by the amount of money you have in the bank. And it is certainly not a cigar that will leave you completely sluggish and nauseated the next day.











Express Yourself




RICH Cigars IS a brand committed to the perfection of the blend, and your smoking experience. We are about you, and your being able to express yourself both confidently and subtlety, without saying a word. 

















Community




RICH Cigars is for everyone…, rich in friends, rich in love, rich in thought, rich in values, rich in quality and rich in self-worth.  Sharing a RICH Cigar strengthens community; creating moments in time accessible to all. Moments of reflection, celebration, ease and appreciation.











Balance




RICH Cigars takes you to a place that is internally rich, encouraging you to feel and embrace the richness of your life. And because our blends are so well balanced, be it Lady or Gentleman… Novice or Aficionado… you will have only the most luxurious memory of the 1, 2 or even 3 RICH Cigars you enjoyed, in an almost orgasmic pleasure the night before. Nothing more.

















Honour




Honoring the essential purity of tradition, is what set RICH Cigars upon a journey to produce the most promising, versatile and elusive cigar: ‘The Premium Stick.’ Rich in flavor. Smooth in consistency. Bold on flavor. Hip to current trends in taste and aromas, without sacrificing class and panache.











Spirit




RICH Cigars embody a young spirit with the wisdom of a grand, old soul. Boldly expressing itself through modern blends, RICH Cigars respects the balance and integrity of tradition.

















Quality




Rich Cigars utilizes only the highest quality of premium tobacco, harvested from the richest soil on earth – and each cigar is hand-crafted to perfection in amazing detail. Most important, RICH Cigars promises to only produce cigars consistent and worthy of the signature RICH.











Smoke




Be it the Vendetta, the King Pin, the Billionaire or the Godfather, you will always find your rich experience. Because a Rich life is not in the gauge, but the essence of the smoke.
