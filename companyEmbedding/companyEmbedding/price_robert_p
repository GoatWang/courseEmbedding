        ---------------------------------------------


Since reading The Case Against the Case for Christ I have become 
          enthralled with your work and read many of your other books. I value 
          the great amount of research you have undertaken to provide your 
          readers with informed viewpoints. Furthermore, I appreciate your 
          respectful approach toward Christians and their beliefs in your 
          writings and when being interviewed.

Wow, this is a beautiful piece of writing of 
            yours I just came across this morning:

"... [O]ne cannot possess the beauty of a landscape. And one soon 
          forgets the self, lost in wonder. Presented from possessing, the ego 
          withers away for the moment, and the beauty shines unobstructed. Self 
          no longer stands in its way, blocking the view" (The Reason-Driven 
          Life, p. 141).

My compliments!

I trust it helps you to know that you have fans. The hundred-thousand 
          year old relationship-management structures of my brain have accepted 
          you as something of a virtual wise uncle after having listened to you 
          hold forth for dozens of hours on fascinating topics and even answer a 
          few direct questions. So, let's continue to sit in the (virtual) den 
          and chat while the rest of the family cleans up the thanksgiving mess 
          and laughs about how young Theo soaks up all that arcane stuff from 
          weird uncle Bob.

Wow! Your talk rocked the house. I have received a multitude of emails 
          expressing uproarious approval with your talk. Your generosity with 
          your time and your personality helped make this event a much greater 
          success than any of us could have imagined. We would love to have you 
          back for Skepticon III if you'd be willing.

I love listening to you mop up the floor with your opponents in 
          debates and I really enjoyed your part on The God Who Wasnt There. I 
          sure wish I had your command of biblical knowledge so I could put 
          people in their place. I also listen to the Bible Geek episodes on the 
          Infidel Guy over and over again. Keep up the good work.

"Hi Bob,

When I started to listen to your Point of Inquiry podcast, I must 
          admit that I was inclined to turn it off. It is not an area that I 
          normally pay much attention to. But I let it run for a minute or two, 
          and alas, I was hooked. You did an amazing job and I could not stop 
          listening. When I got to my parking space, I had to sit for 10 minutes 
          to finish the show. Now I can't wait for the next one. Great job.

[?]




Bob

I love your work on Bible Mythology. I think what you are doing is 
          meaningful; there are few critical scholars of your stature willing to 
          speak their minds in the midst of the Sanhedrin! If it weren't for 
          people like you, many of us would still be squirming as worms before 
          the high priests of piety, being led as zombies to the sacrificial 
          altars of credulity. There are many here among us, and we are 
          coming... with tough questions.

Stephen Wright




Just wanted to thank you for writing Incredible Shrinking Son of Man: 
          How Reliable is the Gospel Tradition?, The Reason-Driven Life: What Am 
          I Here on Earth For? and Inerrant the Wind: The Evangelical Crisis of 
          Biblical Authority. You have played a key role in my search for truth.


Sazib Mahmud Bhuivan





I am an extreme fan and student of your books and philosophy wherein 
          Jesus Christ is concerned. Now I did have a disagreement in a paltalk 
          chatroom with folks who do not know or believe such thing as a 
          "Christian Atheist" can exist. They, as it where, are denying your 
          existence and think such a stance is oxymoronic. I do not, though.

Antoine Mason




commented on Facebook wall post:

I have really appreciated Dr. Price's voice in all of these debates. 
          I'm am an avid student of both Bart Ehrman and the Westar/Jesus 
          Seminar crew, and have truly enjoyed the debates between the various 
          camps, and have always appreciated Dr. Price's willingness to go his 
          own way, where the evidence leads him. He doesn't seem to think he has 
          to always line up behind one "side" or the other.

Rex Burks




I wonder if it will ever be possible to compile all of your writings 
          and radio programs? I haven't been keeping up since the early days 
          when I tried to read whatever new article or book you were working on. 
          You read so widely and have heard so many different interpretations 
          and arguments and discovered so many interesting connections between 
          things, it's like your brain is constantly crunching info, rotating it 
          in 3D, noticing parallels and analogies. I also see that a collection 
          of your fiction has appeared.

Brummbar"





When I first heard about the Bible Geek from friends listening to 
          Reggie Finley's Infidel Guy, I winced inwardly and thought "Oh 
          brother, another smug atheist debunking biblical inerrancy with tired 
          quips about who Cain married and how we know what Jesus said when he 
          was alone..." I could not have been more wrong. Thank you for making 
          biblical study fun again - interesting and alive. Thank you for 
          combining respect for the cultural impact and richness of scripture 
          with unblinking, principled skepticism and integrity.

Thank you for all you have taught me.


George Heingartner




Bob, as a reader, and someone who has had the pleasure of your company 
          at one conference, I know you are a great teacher and a great writer 
          who has done much for the betterment of mankind.

Rodrigo Neely-Recuero




I just wanted to thank you again for your work. Your books have been 
          life changing for me. Thank you!

David Scull




Hearing an interview with Dr. Price back in like 2005 or 2006 was my 
          first step out of the quasi-spiritual/theist life for me.

Pradeep Satyaprakash





I earned my BA in Philosophy from Westminster College in Salt Lake 
          City at the age of 56. Had I but had your book The Reason Driven Life 
          sooner! Your tabula rasa comments made me think that we are, as you 
          said, a product of time, space and genetics. We do stand before the 
          canvas of our lives adding and subtracting from the art of our lives 
          accompanied by the music of the spheres. All of your books are a must 
          for me.

I wanted to let you know how much I admire your line of thinking. I, 
          too, am an atheist who studies religion. I have listened to a few of 
          your debates and I've also seen you in The God Who Wasn't There. Thank 
          you for weighing in on theology and religious studies.

[?]




Do you do private consulting? I am developing a serious case of 
          cognitive dissonance over what I am reading in the Bible as compared 
          to my Christian faith and need to come to some sort of resolution 
          before I go absolutely nuts. I understand you are not a mental health 
          counselor, etc. But you have the kind of mental grace, wisdom, and 
          respect for the religious impulse that I think would help me more than 
          anything merely theological or psychological.

Theophobius




I am 100 pages into Inerrant the Wind and finding it to be one of the 
          best books I've ever read! Certainly the best on the subject!! Highly 
          recommended!!!

[?]




I just heard your Point of Inquiry talk on Pop Mysticism and found it
          interesting. I thought I'd drop a note thanking you for the 
          interesting
          presentation, and particularly for the effort to get skeptics to
          realize there is a positive side to spirituality.

Greg




I would just like to say that I have been enjoying your works this 
          past year, having heard about you through a friend of mine. I have 
          read Jesus is Dead and The Reason-Driven Life, and I am looking 
          forward to owning the rest of your books as well. I just wanted to 
          thank you not only for your scholarly insight, and putting out the 
          fruits of your research, but also for the fact that you admit atheism. 
          I look forward to reading more of your excellent works, and thank you 
          for your efforts. They are greatly appreciated.

Ryan




I truly love your show, having listened to nearly every episode, and 
          intend to continue listening as long as I have the ability to do so. I 
          probably listen to you more than anyone right now.

Marshall Bass




You know I disagree with 99% of the things you say (and the other 1% 
          is just peripheral). But you are my favorite person to disagree with! 
          I love listening to your lectures and debates. Your rhetoric is like 
          poetry! I hope I can be as good a speaker as you some day...minus the 
          whole Atheist thing ;)

Just a short note of appreciation for your website at mindvendor.com. 
          I visit it often and learn much. Your scholarship shows thru.

Peter G. Roode, M.D.




You gave me some pretty decent advice once. It spoke to me, and that's 
          a good thing. From what I could tell, it reflected on you pretty well. 
          Live long and prosper.

Daniel Sandoval




I am so thankful for having been directed to your site. I have spent 
          67 years upon this earth and for the vast majority I have been a 
          prisoner of absurd Catholic dogma and doctrine. The insidious 
          brainwashing was so ingrained in my persona that I felt "guilt" even 
          thinking about turning away from the Church. I want only to thank you 
          for having this site. It truly is an oasis of logic, reason and 
          intellect, traits sorely lacking in any "religions." Hopefully I am 
          not "too far gone" to be redeemed!

[?]




Thank you for giving me the opportunity to tell you in person how much 
          your work has meant to my family. A few years ago I left an oppressive 
          religion (Jehovah's Witnesses) because it no longer made sense to me. 
          I really never looked back, but my wife & daughter who recently 
          followed were often plagued by guilt. After discovering your podcast & 
          doing a little research to confirm that you were speaking from a 
          position of authority & honesty (I was at first delighted & then 
          burned by Zeitgeist), I began to share points with them that helped 
          them to understand that it is simply impossible to build a firm 
          defensible dogma from the Bible. I could go on at this point, gushing 
          about their joy as they began to see the Bible for what it is, 
          allowing the chains to slip from their minds. I could also grovel in 
          gratitude for the sleepless nights you have eliminated and the clarity 
          of vision you have encouraged, and it would all be true. What I will 
          do is say that whatever compensation you receive for your work, it is 
          not enough. So please add to that the fact that you have helped three 
          people in a very real way and for that we thank you.

Curious Thomas




I tried to flirt with Liberal Christianity for a while by reading 
          Marcus Borg and John Spong and briefly attended a Liberal Catholic 
          parish. Nothing seemed to gel with me. It all seemed so hollow, so 
          empty, so meaningless. I eventually started a brief dialogue with 
          Robert M. Price who really helped me with some of my less rational 
          fears about walking away. Bob said something like, "If God really 
          existed then he wouldn't be fooled. If you don't believe then you 
          don't believe. Admit it and get on with your life." So, in 2005, I 
          came to a place where I was finally able to say I did not believe 
          anymore. I was also able to say that I had, in fact, not believed for 
          years and had been kidding myself.

Cliff Thomas




Mr. Price, it is an honor to have the opportunity to write you and let 
          you know how much your podcasts have meant to me, both The Bible Geek 
          and your work on Point of Inquiry. I was brought up Catholic, then was 
          born again and joined a Friends church, followed by Buddhism, and 
          finally I find myself firmly planted in the atheist camp. For many 
          years I was very angry towards what I saw as a false faith built on a 
          false book and practiced by small-minded idiots. But over the past few 
          years I have softened some of my views on this, and at the same time I 
          started finding your name popping up on podcasts I listen to, and then 
          from Point of Inquiry I found your website and podcast. In a nutshell, 
          I would like to thank you for giving me back the Bible as a valuable 
          piece of literature, not just a dogmatic tool for the church. It makes 
          me think of the shirt Guns dont kill people, I kill people. The 
          Bible did not kill my faith, people killed it.

Rick Sirl




I have been a practicing Christian since I was about 19 years old; 
          first within Evangelical Protestantism, which did give me a love for 
          the Bible. Yet the more I read the Bible, the more questions I had. As 
          I read Church history I couldn't find any of the doctrines that I had 
          been taught, like "the sinner's prayer." I began to realize such 
          things were not only not a part of the early Church, but were not even 
          in the Bible! Eventually I went seeking a more historical and 
          liturgical form of Christianity, joining the Eastern Orthodox Church. 
          Yet as the years have gone by I seem to have traded one crisis of 
          faith with another. Over the last couple of years I slowly faded away 
          from the zealous commitment for Church I once had and, as I've become 
          more familiar with Church history, I have come to realize there never 
          was "one true Church." I slipped into agnosticism and began reading 
          all of the New Atheists books and listening to their talks. I began 
          to actually hate the Bible. The murder, the evils, and all the rest 
          people like Dawkins harp on all the time.

It was about this time that I first encountered your work. I thought 
          to myself, "Oh no, not another one of these Jesus myth people!" Yet 
          after listening to you on that show I found that you at least knew the 
          scholarship and history of the Bible and early Christianity, and, more 
          importantly, you weren't making some of the outrageous claims that 
          many of the "atheist apologists" make about the issue. These people 
          seem to me no better than Christian apologists like William Lane 
          Craig.

However, you seemed to have a balanced opinion on the topic, and I 
          have come to learn a great deal from your talks and from the Bible 
          Geek program itself. While I do not adhere to the Christ myth theory 
          myself, your balanced, historical and thought-out approach to the 
          topic of the historical Jesus has shed new light on the subject for 
          me.

It was around that time that I also happened across two of your works 
          that have been illuminating for me, the first was reading a copy of 
          The Reason Driven Life. Nearly every single page made perfect sense to 
          me. It helped me to reflect upon where I was spiritually, and it was 
          the first step in helping me to become comfortable with the reality 
          that none of us "know" anything for certain.

The second piece of your work that had a fundamental change on me was 
          when I listened to a talk you had given titled "Is the Bible Mein 
          Kampf?" I had developed a hatred for the Bible, yet, deep down, I 
          missed the Bible. This talk made me realize that I was totally 
          overreacting.

Your podcast and archived lectures and writings, along the Reason 
          Driven Life have given me "permission" to love the Bible once again. 
          And I do love the Bible. I find it utterly fascinating, enlightening, 
          full of wisdom at times, and you are a big reason that I have once 
          again began reading the Bible, studying it and learning from it. I 
          consider myself a believer, though as I said, an agnostic believer. I 
          respect your courage for saying what you believe even though it has 
          cost you professionally.

Chuck/Agnostic Christian




I have been a long time fan of yours. Coming from a fundamentalist 
          Baptist among Baptists background, I have been wading into the 
          waters of leaving the faith for some time. With that, you cannot know 
          how your insight, wisdom, and experience have truly helped me in 
          probably one of the hardest things I have ever gone through so far in 
          my life. I was saved at 19, came up in a household of 
          semi-charismatic/Methodist background (yes, you read that correctly) 
          so I already had a horrible guilt-complex to carry with my new-found 
          faith. I jumped in whole heartedly and head first, ending up in 
          seminary at Mid America under the tutelage of Dr. Mike Spradlin, 
          someone I still admire greatly but no longer agree with in principal. 
          I worked on staff at Bellevue Baptist Church under Dr. Adrian Rogers, 
          the self-avowed 3-point Calvinist and lived every jot and tittle of 
          the faith. Until my eyes were opened. Working at the church was the 
          best and worst thing that could have happened to me and began my slide 
          down the mountain back to reality. So many unanswered questions that 
          my mind could not comprehend, and my apologist background could not 
          resolve, I began delving into the oh-so demonic comparative religion 
          studies and I have never been the same. I am now 35, and am a 
          mega-fan of The Bible Geek and just finished The Incredible Shrinking 
          Son of Man  an amazing read. Anyway, thank you so much for all you 
          do. You just cannot know how much of a blessing  your knowledge and 
          wisdom are to those of us both fully out and those of us just 
          beginning to get free. Again, you just cant know how much you are 
          helping so many of us find the real truth.

Recently, within the past several months, I've embarked on a still 
          ongoing quest to 'review' my faith. For the longest time, I accepted 
          things virtually unquestioningly, and now I've finally begun to take a 
          rational look at things. I could write for a long while on that 
          subject, but your podcast (as well as the Pre-Nicene NT!) have been 
          incredible sources of knowledge to learn from and broaden my horizons. 
          Kudos!

I just finished listening to your Oct 25th episode of the Bible Geek, 
          in which a listener wanted to know your thoughts about the anger we 
          feel towards those who led us into evangelical fundamentalist 
          thinking. I have to admit, I have those feelings often and share the 
          listener's confusion, and I think you handled the question expertly. 
          Sometimes, the bigotry and ignorance of my former views makes me so 
          frustrated, and when I see my family and former friends still 
          espousing those views, I want to become, as Christopher Hitchens says, 
          an "anti-theist," opposed to all religion in any form. I just wanted 
          to say that your podcast plays a part in helping me overcome that 
          aggression and to look religion with more... shall we say, equanimity? 
          I love reading your thoughts and hearing you speak. I have discovered 
          H.P. Lovecraft because of you and I am forever grateful. My life is 
          enriched because of it.

Chris Kistler




I am a big fan of yours. I am also a christian atheist. I study 
          religion .. argh .. dont know what to say .. but you are cool ..

After much struggle, Im happy to embrace my upbringing and to 
          consider myself an enlightened Catholic thanks to your thoughts and 
          references to great Bible scholars such as yourself.

I wanted to, first off, let you know that I stumbled upon your action 
          figure sermon a few years ago and it's one of the most brilliant 
          things I've ever read about the subject. Not that there is a flood of 
          information out there on figure collecting, but this was extremely 
          insightful. I've been collecting since I was old enough to spend my 
          meager allowance on one figure every week. Yet I have never been able 
          to put into words the "reason" as you have done, so eloquently in this 
          sermon.

Kurt Derheim




Your work and your approachable nature are both fantastic. Thank you 
          for what you do.

I wish I had you as a prof when I did my Religious Studies degree. I 
          am continuously amazed by your knowledge of scripture which reaches, 
          shall we say, biblical proportions.
          I love your Bible Geek show! Brilliant!

Seán Chinery




I'm determined to meet you in person someday. You were a big influence 
          on me and my family as we were leaving Christianity.

Philip Malaby




Absolutely love your show, I love hearing you sing and have fun. You 
          often give me a good laugh with your brilliant humor and jovial style, 
          and it is not uncommon for me to crack a big grin or burst out 
          laughing in public places while listening to you through headphones. I 
          am absolutely loving your Pre-Nicene NT, your essays in The Empty Tomb 
          and your book The Incredible Shrinking Son of Man.

Cameron Spiers




Thanks for your amazing podcast! No other scholar out there takes the 
          time to answer questions and put out such a wealth of alternative 
          ideas to us plebes that can't afford college. You are always giving me 
          new lines of research and interesting books to check out.

Robert Price, I'm a Christian but I still think you're the coolest

Joseph Olivares




I have just finished reading your magnum octopus (or is it magnum 
          opus?) The Reason Driven Life, and let me say that it relegates Homer 
          and the entire canon of western literature to mere toilet paper. I 
          recommend it to all Bible Geeks who are former fundamentalists. It has 
          a nice 'food for thought' approach. It articulates the mind of the 
          fundamentalist in ways that only one who was a fundamentalist can do. 
          I also appreciate that it is not a mere polemic against Rick Warren, 
          but is primarily a book full of encouragement, wisdom and reason.

          I posted a quote from The Reason Driven Life yesterday, and received 
          favorable responses from both atheists and evangelicals alike! You 
          rock, Bob.

Derreck Bennett




I got to know Bob Price around about 1982, I think. I'd heard 
          somewhere about Crypt of Cthulhu -- he was maybe doing issue 6 at the 
          time, as hard as that might be to imagine now -- I asked for a copy, 
          thanked him, he wrote back, I replied. Over the next five years, the 
          stack of letters from that sweet, busy, talented, funny man probably 
          swelled past four inches. No one could possibly have been more 
          engaging or more supportive. All us schmoes who were writing Bob in 
          those days -- I'm certain that each and every one of us felt that Bob 
          would have given us the shirt off his back. I probably would never 
          have written a word on Clark Ashton Smith, if Bob hadn't been so 
          encouraging. Folks, let's face facts: our little subculture suffers 
          from more than its fair share of poseurs, swelled egos, and creeps. 
          Bob Price stood apart from all of that. And the work he was doing 
          stood apart, too. Right from the first, Bob made sure his magazine was 
          a haven for Lovecraftians of all stripes, a warm and welcoming and 
          inclusive playground of ideas and artwork, a rollicking and fun-packed 
          message-board for our oddball little community. No viperous fannish 
          cliques ever ruled his Editorial Board (which consisted of Bob Price, 
          Robert Price, Robert M. Price, and the enigmatic "RMP"), no one was 
          forced to toe a line; a splendid genealogical treatise on Lovecraft's 
          Rochester ancestors would rub elbows with a bad sketch of Godzilla 
          trashing Providence. The real watchwords were quality, creativity, 
          playfulness. And that was enough. Enough to be remembered fondly for 
          quite a long time, I predict. For me, and I know for many others 
          reading this now, Bob Price succeeded in putting a very human -- and 
          very likeable -- face on The UnNameable. Thank you, Bob.

Fantastic job on the H. P. Lovecraft Literary Podcast. Hilariously 
          entertaining and educational; a perfect combination.

Brian Bowman: What a supremely valuable Southern Gentleman: "I have 
          devoted my life to the study of the fantastic creations of the human 
          imagination: religion, philosophy, literary fantasy, and myth. I am a 
          cynic, yet I love people." ~Robert M. Price






"Moved from Mississippi in 1965, and it was only then that I learned 
          that the South had lost the Civil War"... hahaha LOVE THIS PODCAST! 
          You make learning about the Bible truly fun.

Ben Holman




I've long suspected that Dr. Price might be sympathetic to our 
          spiritual outlook. If nothing else, we have some common interests. He 
          is an advocate of Nietzschean philosophy and passionate authority on 
          H.P. Lovecraft (Google "robert price chaosium") as well as Biblical 
          Higher Criticism (which is to say, he knows more about the actual 
          origins and history of the Bible than most entire congregations of 
          fundamentalist Christians combined). He is guided by reason, but holds 
          a deep abiding love for myth, wonder, and the importance of creating 
          one's own meaning amidst the cold inertia of uncaring chaos.

I'm currently reading his book The Reason-Driven Life, a secular 
          response to and rebuttal to pastor Rick Warren's The Purpose-Driven 
          Life. Everything I've read so far only supports my theory; Dr. Price 
          may not be into magic himself, but at the end of the day I think he's 
          one of us, or close enough that it makes little difference.

I was delighted to hear Dr. Price talk to Ipsissimus Webb. Within 
          secularist and humanist circles there remains a lingering hostility - 
          perhaps not unjustified, considering the circumstances - to anything 
          resembling spirituality in contemporary society. But I think the more 
          they are exposed to ideas found in Setian philosophy, the more they 
          will realize that recognizing the unique gift of self-aware human 
          intelligence for what it is need not mean a surrender to wacky 
          faith-based beliefs, arbitrary morality or science denial. This talk 
          will hopefully be a useful step in that direction.

The story you told last Sunday about the faculty that wanted you to 
          refer to God as male and female with equal frequency made me laugh out 
          loud; as did the image of Moses as a 'serial sex changer'. I am far 
          more interested in the Bible from your show than I ever was going to 
          church with my Pentecostal grandparents!

Ricky James Moore II




Im a devoted fan of your podcast and although as a layperson, a 
          majority of your content goes well above my head, I love learning 
          about the Bible and all of its puzzles and mysteries. I have to 
          concede that as a self professed skeptic, I used to have a 
          contemptuous orientation towards the Bible and I took selfish pleasure 
          in decrying the beliefs of fundamentalists and admonishing them with 
          ill-concealed and immoderate derision. I viewed most Christians as 
          credulous and glib and I denounced their unwillingness or inability to 
          critically and objectively analyze the text to manifest truth rather 
          than simply confirm a previously held bias. I also took great pleasure 
          in giving a laundry list of contradictions to Christians and 
          watching them squirm and perspire while they try to explain away the 
          obvious incompatibilities and dichotomies. Then one day I heard you 
          say that you felt that agnostics and atheists may be impoverishing 
          themselves of moral and intellectual enlightenment by constantly 
          scoffing at the religious texts rather than trying to comprehend them. 
          Your aforementioned comments and a perusal of your Reason Driven Life 
          made me realize that one not need be a believer in metaphysics, no 
          matter how illogical I may assert them to be, to procure insight and 
          edification from religious texts. I also realized that by being 
          thoroughly ignorant of the Bible yet ceaselessly condemning of it, 
          that I was part of the same hypocrisy as all of those hapless 
          evangelical rubes that I was so fond of admonishing.

I must say that your scholarship has been a huge inspiration to me and 
          has helped me decide to follow ancient studies, and I may devote my 
          life to it.

Lee Stuart Sianos




I enjoy your originality and humour. You always challenge listeners, 
          whether atheist or theist, to look at both sides of the issue. Many 
          thanks for the wonderful podcasts.

Jonathan Adams




It simply isn't possible to thank you properly with only 300 
          characters, but thank you for bringing the Bible back to this jaded 
          heretic.

Darrin T Griffin




I just finished up reading The Needletoe Letters! It was utterly 
          delightful! I dare say that nobody understands the Fundamentalist 
          mindset better than you, and I look forward to all your books! Thank 
          you for everything you do, Dr. Price! I've been a fan of yours since I 
          first heard the Bible Geek on The Infidel Guy. Keep up the great work!

Darrin Griffin




You have been an immense help to me!! The Reason Driven Life is one of 
          the very best books I have ever read--you have touched on so many 
          things from my former fundy life that needed clarification. Keep up 
          the great work!

Scott Friesen




Your books have freed my mind. THANK YOU for the peace. And the loss 
          of fear.

Hugh Edwards




I would like to thank you sincerely for the immense amount of time 
          youve put into this podcast. I am not aware of any other biblical 
          scholar who spends an hour or more, nearly every day, to educating the 
          general public; and free of charge, no less! Your thoughtfulness and 
          dedication is inspiring.

[ ?]




I cant convey how exciting you make the Bible! If only more teachers 
          could learn it needn't be a dry subject.

Ben Holman




Your regular podcasts help me in a very real way. I know for many 
          geeks your podcast is a great source of intellectual nourishment and 
          entertainment, but for some of us coming out of very unhealthy lives 
          damaged by religion your podcast is more like medicine. I hope that 
          notion doesn't dampen anyone's enjoyment of the Bible Geek, or put 
          undue pressure on you, but it is certainly true for me. Before I found 
          your podcast I was really struggling to get past the profound fear and 
          anger left over from fundamentalism, so thank you.

Great podcast show from Robert M. Price. No one knows The Bible like 
          he does. I listen to it all the time.

Rod Yarbrough




I'd like to give some credit to your Lovecraft/biblical scholarship. I 
          first encountered you in a Lovecraft documentary, Fear of the Unknown 
          (I'm a longtime avid HPL reader). You stood out from the other experts 
          with your insight, especially when you claimed the brain cylinder 
          (from The Whisperer in Darkness) idea was just a "scam." Such a 
          refreshing, humorous take on HPL merited an investigation. Who was 
          this Dr. Price character? I searched your name on Youtube and found 
          some of your commentaries on the Old Testament. Your analysis was so 
          out of the box and contained a degree of historical rigor that I 
          hadn't ever heard someone employ when discussing the Bible. I'll be 
          damned if you haven't made me more fully appreciate the Bible as a 
          valuable historical document. I didn't think it was possible: after 
          years of Sunday masses which bored me to tears you revitalized my 
          interest in early Christianity. Bravo! I've listened to probably all 
          the Bible Geek podcasts and can't get enough of your original 
          interpretations combined with detailed historical analyses. For 
          further distinction, I strongly recommend the brief essay from my 
          personal pastor and expert on the subject: Robert M. Price, Agnostic 
          a Gnostic"

Miguel Picanco




I really appreciate your podcast. I'm no scholar (I play music for a 
          living) but you have gotten me interested enough to finally read the 
          Bible cover-to-cover, something I should have done years ago.

Daniel Gianola-Norris




Your Bible Geek podcasts have been so influential in my life these 
          past few years. Thank you for sharing your knowledge using that

You are one of my favorite writers on biblical studies. I'm a former

I am mesmerized by your ability to pontificate on anything religious 
          and your uncanny ability of total recall.

Pecos Billy




Thank you for all your podcasts. I find them informative and thought 
          provoking. For example, never pondered the concept of moral decency 
          until I heard you talk about it. I also especially liked the podcast 
          where you discussed your ideas of what happens when we die and where 
          life's meaning is derived from (very poignant). I think my father 
          would like to listen to that particular one too. I also love your 
          eclectic range of movie references you draw from when explaining 
          different topics. For example, when you pull a reference from the 
          movie Being There, or from The Sopranos, or when you said "Otisville!" 
          to make a point by pulling a reference from a Superman movie. Great 
          stuff, along with your "A soft answer turns away wrath" style.

Alan from Minnesota




I do appreciate all the work you have done -- I have listened to lots 
          of the podcasts and continue to find them both fascinating and 
          personally very helpful in weeding out a lot of nonsense from my 
          thinking.

David Carter




LOVE your work!! Truly! Your articles and books are amazing, and I 
          have not yet found anything of yours that I did not thoroughly enjoy. 
          I'm reading The Pre-Nicene New Testament, and *loving* it!

Blanche Quizno




Mr Price, I love listening to you on Point of Inquiry, and especially 
          on the H.P. Lovecraft Literary Podcast. Also, great job on the H.P. 
          Lovecraft documentary that's been spreading across the internet. 
          Honestly, I could listen to you talk about pretty much anything all 
          day! Thanks for what you do!

Chris Dunigan




Thanks for all you do Dr. Price! We LOVE your work.

I admire his integrity and courage of conviction, yet willingness to 
          respect well researched and plausible opposing views.

Grandpa "Tiresias"




I have been listening to your show regularly now for about 6 months 
          and have devoured most of the back catalogue as well as several of 
          your books. You have firmly convinced me of the credibility of the 
          Christ Myth Theory. But, more importantly, you have convinced me to 
          crack open my Bible again, something I thought, as an atheist, would 
          never happen again. Heck, I've even been inspired to turn on my 
          critical thinking and go to a few church services, Hallelujah! I've 
          turned it into a warped form on entertainment, wherein I make little 
          notes about each point in the sermon, counting up the instances where 
          the pastor clearly (at least in my view) doesn't understand the 
          historical or literary nature of the text. You probably wouldn't be 
          surprised that sometimes I end up with a rather lengthy list of 
          grievances. Anyhow, I wanted to thank you for awakening an interest 
          that I was sure was dead. As a result, I've really made great progress 
          in feeling less bitter or disdainful towards religion, as a skeptic 
          and nonbeliever. So thanks again!

I love your work. Since my atheism started in Bible College your work 
          has been especially liberating for me.

Bill McElree




I am writing you because of the strange circle which seems to have 
          come around in my life. I had first heard of you by means of your 
          contribution to a Lovecraft compilation and more recently through the 
          wonderful H.P.Podcraft podcast. Your insight and candor regarding dear 
          old H.P. delighted me. Upon hearing you describe yourself as a 
          Christian Atheist, I became intrigued and began investigating your 
          host episodes on Point of Inquiry. Then, after much trepidation, tuned 
          into The Bible Geek... and I was delighted; far more than delighted, 
          actually, I feel like I can open my mind again to topics and interests 
          I have shut out for several years. Thank you.

          Now here's the backstory: I had been an active evangelical for over 
          twenty years in a "progressive" non-denominational church. In that 
          time, I had risen into roles of teaching the bible and pastoral 
          leadership in one of the institution's so-called "home groups". I had 
          given a big chunk of my life to the church and studied quite 
          enthusiastically. Progressing through the church's own curriculum and 
          a few courses sponsored by an established seminary, I felt I had a 
          pretty sophisticated apologetic. However, I believe my perspective 
          remained just a crack wider than my fellow "evangelists" since I had 
          more than a rudimental understanding of eastern religions from my 
          formal degree in East Asian Language and Literature. Things never sat 
          as neat and cleanly as the church leadership seemed to prescribe. And 
          as things played out, through a convergence of personal issues and 
          dissent in the ranks, I left the church. Then over the course of the 
          past few years, so left my belief in a personal, capital "G" god, and 
          eventually, my belief in most things metaphysical. I suppose I stand 
          now as an agnostic with a desire to build meaning out of the tangible 
          things in this world.

I hadn't thought much about all the biblical study I had done all 
          those years...until I listened to the Bible Geek. Perhaps I was 
          ashamed or afraid? I don't know. I DO know, however, that the critical 
          perspectives and scholarship you so kindly dish out are inspiring. Not 
          in a "ha ha, you Christian dupes" sort of way, but in a "there's some 
          very interesting and useful stuff in the Bible to inform us about 
          HUMANITY".

Scott




I was recently introduced to your podcast as I stumbled around iTunes, 
          as I looked around the religion section, trying to find something 
          different from the usual tired apologetics I'd been brought up on. As 
          an avid fan of H.P. Lovecraft, your name sounded familiar to me, and I 
          had heard of you before in that context, mentioned alongside Lin 
          Carter and S.T. Joshi. Needless to say, I was hooked after the first 
          episode and have passed the past week or two wading through the 
          backlog of past episodes; your perspective and style are exactly what 
          I was looking forand you have found in me a most willing and devoted 
          disciple. I cannot begin to tell you how helpful your work has been to 
          me, where I am now, struggling to figure out what to do next. Coming 
          out of a difficult time in my life, your podcast has proved a great 
          comfort to me, coming to terms with life after Faith. Thank you for 
          all that you do.

Although I have read it, I still prefer to listen to the gospel 
          according to Robert M. Price. Sometimes I suggest his podcast to 
          people whom I am "politely debating" with about the Bible. The look on 
          their faces is fear...as it should be. I have been listening to your 
          show for the last month or so (starting from the oldest podcasts) and 
          you have managed to take an already confused Bible reader and opened 
          him up to a completely new way of looking at it all. Before your show 
          I thought the Bible could be harmonized, but after some listening and 
          studying I have come to see that I can't go that route any more. "I 
          once was lost, but now am found, Hallelujah!" Thanks for the work you 
          do. You have stated that it isn't financially the best, but I tell 
          you, you are changing lives and people. THANKS!

Thank you for your Bible Geek podcasts. They are both fascinating and 
          highly entertaining. I rarely make it through a Bible Geek episode 
          without cracking up. Your sense of humor always brightens my day.

Russ O'Shea




First of all let me just say how much I have enjoyed your podcasts 
          since I discovered them a few months back. It is both a delightful and 
          fascinating to listen to them. Anyway, I come from a fundamentalist 
          (Southern Baptist) background. I have been an atheist for about 8 
          years now; however, I still struggle with some of the scars that I 
          received from such a strict upbringing. For instance I have been 
          trying to deal with the anxieties of hellfire and brimstone images 
          that still can pop into my head. Your podcasts have actually been one 
          of the tools I can use to find myself more relaxed, and they make it 
          easier for me to view the Bible for what it is, mythical and 
          allegorical stories, and nothing more.

On the December 11th Geek, one of the blessed disciples of Your 
          Holiness mentioned his conversion to Jesus mythicism. Although I have 
          no conversion story (from one religion to another, or to atheism), I 
          do have a long and complicated conversion to Jesus mythicism, although 
          I will condense the conversion from 50 emails to one. (One Email To 
          Rule Them All)

          I approached Christianity, like its step-sister Islam, from the 
          ultra-conservative viewpoint (since that is where I am coming from in 
          my own emunah/faith). I did this in the interest of fairness - I felt 
          that liberals in our society made a mockery of the New Testament just 
          like they mocked Leviticus. I therefore held hands with the likes of 
          Dr. James White, in not only believing Jesus was historical, but that 
          most of the NT was true, the only false parts being any that 
          contradict the Prophets. I was one of the numerous Jews and Muslims 
          today that did not see the virgin birth, or even the resurrection, as 
          indicative of divinity. I understood the Trinity -- and once again 
          agreed with the likes of Dr. James White that the NT is full of 
          Trinitarian verses. Here's the "ultra" part in conservative: I 
          believed the Gospels were all penned before 60 CE, and the NT as a 
          whole was no later than 70 CE. When I came across scholars bringing up 
          "late dates" (such as 90 CE for Revelation), I was surprised. How 
          could intelligent scholars believe this nonsense? Is it not obvious 
          that the talmidim (students) of Yeshu wrote the Gospels?

Then one day - while reading the Epistle of Barnabas (and previously 
          reading all of Bart Ehrman's works), I had an epiphany. How the She'ol 
          did this not make it into the New Testament? The next day, I tuned 
          into Dr. White's Dividing Line, and he had mentioned abruptly that the 
          majority of scholars do not believe the Pastorals are from Paul. I 
          already knew this, but the way he said it made me reconsider: is it 
          possible that Paul really did not write them? So I began research into 
          textual criticism. I listened to lectures, read books and internet 
          articles. Almost immediately I became an adherent of the 8-Epistle 
          view (the true 7 + Colossians). I rejected 2 Peter as genuine, and 
          began to question whether John Zebedee really wrote the Gospel of 
          John. At this point I was basically a carbon copy of Bart Ehrman.

I began to discuss my views with Christians online, and with some 
          Atheists. An Atheist friend of mine mentioned Your Holiness. When he 
          told me you were one of those DENIALISTS! I quickly ignored you and 
          your works for about three months. Dr. White then mentioned you on the 
          Dividing Line, and I felt it was safe to listen to you and read your 
          works. So I did. After a total period of 2 years, I went from 
          Ultra-Conservative to Bart Ehrman to being a DENIALIST!

So that is my story. Thank you for liberating me.

Thanks Bob - you truly bring the Bible to life. I wanted to let you 
          know that your podcast is extremely informative and enlightening, and 
          your approach to critical thinking is refreshing. It has allowed me to 
          re-examine not only what I think, but how I think. Your prodigious 
          output has had the effect of pushing many of the other podcasts I 
          subscribe to into the "I guess I'll listen to this one because I'm all 
          caught up on the Bible Geek" category. Not that it is a bad 
          thing--quite the contrary! You and your work are a fantastic 
          inspiration to my life.

Christopher Garrett Sanders




Your analysis has helped free me from superstitious fears. Thanks.

James




Thanks for the great podcast! Starting with the first episode I 
          downloaded, something unexpected happened: I became interested in the 
          Bible. I never gave it much consideration before. The whole thing felt 
          so cruel and unfair to me as a child that I avoided it whenever 
          possible, and only read it when commanded to. Now approaching forty; I 
          find it fascinating from a cultural, social, and literary standpoint. 
          I feel like Ive missed out all those years. What a difference it 
          makes when literalism and inerrancy dont take precedent over content.

Chris



I've had the pleasure of getting to know Dr. Price personally, and let 
          me tell you this: He is just as helpful and gracious in a one-to-one 
          conversation as he is with all of us in the mass medium of the podcast. 
          He is a man who has in his 50 some years collected not just two 
          doctorates and a wealth of knowledge beyond the halls of the 
          institutions from which they were obtained, but a sense of wisdom and 
          grace about imparting that knowledge in a way that makes me proud to 
          be one of more than one hundred literary patrons, and one of his many 
          friends. You should be, too.


Ricky James Moore II 




I love Robert M. Price! He is such a character, and so full of ideas 
          and knowledge. He's incredible.


Thaumas




I think that Dr. Bob's upcoming book on Paul is going to be an even 
          bigger explosion than Christ mythicism; Robert M. Price is not man, he 
          is dynamite.

Ricky James Moore II




I've listened to countless hours of Dr. Price on his The Bible Geek 
          podcast. He's honest, diligent, decent, brilliant, and entertaining. 
          If anything, some of his work has made it harder for him to "make 
          money" because of the misleading "mythicist" label.

Andy




Whenever I hear debates like this one I'm struck by how weak and 
          easily debunked the apologist case is. I was also impressed with Bob's 
          debating approach. He was humble , rational and friendly, then swooped 
          in for the kill. Disarming in every respect. The other guy didn't know 
          what hit him.
