Education[edit]
Atkins received a bachelor's degree in Liberal Arts from the University of Massachusetts Amherst (1975), magna cum laude, Phi Beta Kappa.
Business career[edit]
Atkins co-founded Interlan, an ethernet network controller card systems company. The company was acquired by Micom Systems in 1985. In 1988 Atkins became the CEO of Key Computer Labs, selling the company to Amdahl Corporation.
In 1989, she co-founded Ascend Communications and served as a Board member and their Global CRO and EVP Marketing and Services. Ascend was acquired by Lucent in 1999. Atkins joined the Lucent board in 2000.
Atkins became the CEO of NCI, Inc. a neutraceutical functional food company, building the company until it was acquired by Artal Luxembourg in 1993.
Atkins recent focus has been in Corporate Governance where she has served as an Expert Witness on the Adelphia bankruptcy case in 2003 and as Chairman of the Special Litigation Committee at HealthSouth Corporation.

Controversy[edit]
Since March 2013, Atkins has litigated—through her Gables Real Estate LLC—to prevent the public from accessing Cedar Beach in Harpswell, Maine, which is near her summer home.[3] Although local residents accessed the beach for hundreds of years before Atkins purchased her property, Atkins and two other landowners blocked the road to the beach in 2011, insisting that the road was private.[4] On September 15, 2014, the Cumberland County Superior Court held that a public easement had been established on the road following "more than nine generations" of residents accessing the beach via the road.[5] Nevertheless, Atkins has indicated her intention to appeal the decision.[6]
On July 19, 2016, the Maine Law Court vacated the lower courts decision to grant a prescriptive easement across Cedar Beach Road. This means that there is no longer a prescriptive easement across Cedar Beach Road to Cedar Beach and it is wholly private and its use may be determined by the owner, Gables Real Estate, LLC. Betsy Atkins has agreed to allow Harpswell residents to continue to use the road to access the beach, while reserving the right to revoke access at any point.[7]

Education[edit]
Atkins received a bachelor's degree in Liberal Arts from the University of Massachusetts Amherst (1975), magna cum laude, Phi Beta Kappa.
Business career[edit]
Atkins co-founded Interlan, an ethernet network controller card systems company. The company was acquired by Micom Systems in 1985. In 1988 Atkins became the CEO of Key Computer Labs, selling the company to Amdahl Corporation.
In 1989, she co-founded Ascend Communications and served as a Board member and their Global CRO and EVP Marketing and Services. Ascend was acquired by Lucent in 1999. Atkins joined the Lucent board in 2000.
Atkins became the CEO of NCI, Inc. a neutraceutical functional food company, building the company until it was acquired by Artal Luxembourg in 1993.
Atkins recent focus has been in Corporate Governance where she has served as an Expert Witness on the Adelphia bankruptcy case in 2003 and as Chairman of the Special Litigation Committee at HealthSouth Corporation.

Controversy[edit]
Since March 2013, Atkins has litigated—through her Gables Real Estate LLC—to prevent the public from accessing Cedar Beach in Harpswell, Maine, which is near her summer home.[3] Although local residents accessed the beach for hundreds of years before Atkins purchased her property, Atkins and two other landowners blocked the road to the beach in 2011, insisting that the road was private.[4] On September 15, 2014, the Cumberland County Superior Court held that a public easement had been established on the road following "more than nine generations" of residents accessing the beach via the road.[5] Nevertheless, Atkins has indicated her intention to appeal the decision.[6]
On July 19, 2016, the Maine Law Court vacated the lower courts decision to grant a prescriptive easement across Cedar Beach Road. This means that there is no longer a prescriptive easement across Cedar Beach Road to Cedar Beach and it is wholly private and its use may be determined by the owner, Gables Real Estate, LLC. Betsy Atkins has agreed to allow Harpswell residents to continue to use the road to access the beach, while reserving the right to revoke access at any point.[7]

Science







Discover the Science Behind the Magic of the South Beach Diet
A no fads, no gimmicks approach to weight loss developed by world-renowned cardiologist Dr. Arthur Agatston. 







One thing was clear to Dr. Agatston. His patients were frustrated. They were confused by the conflicting information swirling around about quick fix diets that left them tired and hungry.
The South Beach Diet was his solution. Understand: The South Beach Diet incorporates good carbs, healthy fats and plenty of lean protein. Nutrient-dense foods that can turn off the switch for sugar and refined carb cravings.
This healthy way of eating has been around for years, but it's Dr. Agatston and his famous 3-phase approach which has allowed over 11 million people to choose South Beach Diet to meet their goals.
Now it's your turn!
View Plan







“No sane eating program expects you to go through life feeling discomfort and hungry.”
        





Burn Fat Without Hunger


In Phase 1 of the South Beach Diet, you'll stay away from sugar and refined carbohydrates–foods that digest quickly, cause you to be dependent on carbs, and keep you trapped in a constant cycle of cravings and overeating.
During these two weeks, you'll reboot your body, eating foods high in lean protein, plenty of vegetables and healthy fats. Now your body will attack your fat, burning it for fuel since your carb intake is being kept at a low consumption rate. You'll lose weight fast without being hungry.












As your body converts fat to energy, shifting your internal chemistry, your cravings for junk food and sugar recedes, replaced with a growing need for healthy, nutritious foods.
Your body is now reset and you're ready to move on to the next phase of your diet.










Put the science to work and lose weight on South Beach!


View Plan










Advance to Steady Weight Loss
As you transition into Phase 2 carb-heavy foods are no longer your must-have source of fuel. You've trained your body to burn fat for fuel—weight loss will continue at a steady pace. You're ready to reintroduce fruit, whole grains and some starchy vegetables, enjoying them in moderation. Having successfully reset your body, you'll find that your body wants different foods than it did before—foods that fuel! This balanced approach to eating will drive you toward your goal weight.

You enjoy foods that taste good, satisfy your appetite and don't create hunger hours later. It's a heart-healthy way of eating for the rest of your life. After all, the South Beach Diet is a science that works, for life.

Jennifer lost 22 lbs total.
As a mother of four, I want to always be a good example to my kids. When it came to what I ate, I knew I had some work to do, especially since I have a real sweet tooth but one week after going on the South Beach diet, those cravings were gone! Now instead of being tired all the time, I feel energized and can keep up with my busy schedule. Even better, my kids and my husband are eating healthier too. Thank you, South Beach. I'm 36 and in the best shape of my life!
Casting call volunteers complimentary program provided. Avg. weight loss is 12 lbs.

Krista lost 7 lbs in first 2 weeks.
 “I feel great!” Krista offers enthusiastically. Asked what was her favorite part of the South Beach diet, she replies “I love that it worked. It’s easy to follow and the food is delicious (Krista’s fave: Taqueria-Style Beef & Cheese Skillet). With the amount of food I was allowed to eat every day, I didn’t feel hungry and it kept me from craving things. Now I’d rather be doing something physical than sitting on the couch at night, snacking.”
