 To view a video demonstration of the MediGlider, go to www.mediglider.com . 






 Executives with Austin-based MediGlider Corp. say they have a product that addresses the nation's shortage of nurses: an automated gurney that moves patients in and out of bed without any lifting. 

 "We're bringing 21st century technology to an age-old problem," Chief Operating Officer Gary Pankonien said. 

 The battery-operated gurney, which is steered with a joystick, works like this: It slides a firm, padded board under a patient; inflates like an air mattress; then glides the patient on to the gurney. 

 The MediGlider can handle patients up to 500 pounds and can make 90-degree turns, company officials say. 

 Vicki Pascasio, a longtime health care worker and president of Torch Management Services Inc., works with community hospitals. She said a product like the MediGlider is "very much needed" in the health care industry. 

 "We already have a shortage of nurses and staff," Pascasio said. "If they hurt themselves lifting, it will put them out of work." 





 The company, which was started in 2005 with an initial investment of $15 million, has gone through five focus groups and several prototypes. It is now marketing the gurney and is on the verge of increasing production. 

 "We're trying to stay close to home and get the recipe right," company President Ralph Smucker said. "Then we'll go nationwide." 

 Hospitals and nursing homes can buy the gurneys at a cost of up to $50,000 per machine, or MediGlider will own the gurney and a customer will purchase special disposable sheets at an annual cost of $50,000 or so. The company estimates the cost for each patient transfer at $5 or $6 per move. 

 Smucker said MediGlider would cut workers' compensation costs and save on litigation costs arising from dropped patients. He said there also are labor savings because one operator, as opposed to a group of nurses, can transport patients. 

 The company, on Braker Lane in North Austin, has 17 employees and expects to more than double its staff as it adds marketing personnel. It uses 27 vendors for parts and expects to contract with a manufacturer. 

 If MediGlider reaches its goal of 100 units per month, it could create 350 manufacturing jobs, company officials say. 

 Smucker said the company is negotiating with several venture capital firms for an additional investment of $6 million. 

 "We think it will take us to positive cash flow and profits," he said.
