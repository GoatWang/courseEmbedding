Product Description▼▲
Over the course of almost three years Greg Boyd and his father Ed corresponded about Christianity, the Bible and faith, Ed, a skeptic with a lot of questions, engages his son's expertise with love, transparency and candor. Greg, a notorious open theist and at the time Professor of Theology at Bethel University, addresses his father's questions and misconceptions about the issue dividing them in an attempt to reconcile his feelings about his father. Relying on more of a 'Pascal's Wager' type of challenge than a true call to repentance and faith, Greg gives his father the best information about Christianity that he had at the time.

Publisher's Description▼▲
Greg Boyd and his father, Ed, were on opposite sides of a great divide. Greg was a newfound Christian, while his father was a longtime agnostic. So Greg offered his father an invitation: Ed could write with any questions on Christianity, and his son would offer a response. Letters from a Skeptic contains this special correspondence. The letters tackle some of today's toughest challenges facing Christianity, including Do all non-Christians go to hell? How can we believe a man rose from the dead? Why is the world so full of suffering? How do we know the Bible was divinely inspired? Does God know the future? Each response offers insights into the big questions, while delivering intelligent answers that connect with both the heart and mind. Whether you're a skeptic, a believer, or just unsure, these letters can provide a practical, common-sense guide to the Christian faith.

            For over a decade, we have used this book as the basis of an evangelistic group for unbelievers or people who want to believe but have doubts or intellectual barriers to faith.  We have seen many people come to faith through it.  Ed asks honest questions that many intelligent people have about the Christian faith.  Using logic and historical evidence, Greg helps break down Ed's barriers to faith in a loving, gentle and respectful way.  This book is not only a good source of apologetic information, it's also a great model of loving and respectful evangelism.

            Although the letters about God were intellectual and not so much love based. The facts are interesting and it seems to be what the father needed to help him understand.

            I came across this book because it was mentioned in Lee Strobel's "Case For..." series, and I have to admit I am very disappointed. The premise for this book is great, I was very excited to read the correspondence, but I just do not see Boyd's "Open Theology" as being Biblically sound. It's a shame, because this book had such potential, but I simply could not stomach the watered down picture of God that was painted. I will not be recommending this to anyone.

            Letters have long been a means for those who are a part of the Christian Church to communicate truth. Over half the New Testament are letters, the letters of Augustine, Luther, and Wesley are all studied by scholars to help better understand these leaders of the church. Many have been introduced to the formal study of theology and apologetics by reading C. S. Lewis' Screwtape Letters. In 1994, Greg Boyd contributed a set of letters between his father and himself.


Boyd's father had given up on the church and faith years ago - perhaps it was a position that was cemented when his wife died, leaving him to raise his children as a single parent. Over the years, the resentment, the anger, and the confusion had grown - to the point, that as the book begins, he is not certain about what he does believe; though he feel fairly certain about what he does not believe.


It is at that point that Dr. Boyd and his father begin a two years correspondence concerning the major issues the unbeliever has when he or she considers Christ as Lord and Savior. The compiles this correspondence topically and somewhat chronologically. Issues are address one by one - using history, philosophy, and scripture. The answers are accurate and well thought out, though rarely getting heady or unintelligible.


I have two concerns about a book of this caliber that is now entering its 4th edition. The first is the lack of documentation. With very few exceptions, the author does not provide references for scripture (whether quoted directly from an English translation or merely a paraphrase written on the fly by the author). The same is true for statements made from third party sources. I can understand why these were not part of the original correspondence; but as the book enters its 4th edition, it would make sense to add the references - even while clearly noting that they were added to the original letters years after they were written.


The second concern is that a book that is entering it 4th edition provides no path for further study. Again, though not part of the original written correspondence, it would seem important to guide the reader in discovering additional resources that explain the ideas discussed in the book. The addition of a set of discussion question covering each topic does help the reader in processing the ideas - but provides not guidance in better understanding the history, philosophy, or scriptures that support those ideas.


The book would make a great textbook on apologetics with the addition of references and suggestions for further study. In a classroom, these missing elements can be provided by the instructor; but the reader is at a loss if the book is being read without the direction of an experienced teacher.


But even with those flaws, the book still serves as an excellent tool for evangelism. As the author makes clear, by the end of the correspondence, Ed Boyd (Dr. Boyd's father) did come to faith. It has served the same purpose in the lives of others. It will continue to be so in the lives who read it in the future.


This review is based on an electronic copy of the book provided by the publisher.

Great For Kindergarten

            This has been a great science book for homeschooling. It goes right along with what we study in the Bible and my son loves the activities in this book. He's a very "hands-on" learner and this book provides many opportunities to do lots of activities.

            I can't say enough about this book. This book will definately last a year. We only do it 2-3 days a week. It has taught her allot and we do a journal with it. She can't wait to draw and write about what she learned that day. I will be getting their History book "History for Little Pilgrims "for next year.

            This is a colorful, engaging, workbook for grade K.  My 4 year old loves it and asks for science every day.  It covers the six day of creation and science that relates to those days.  The activities are easy to do for my 4 year old and use items from around the home.

            I used this book for homeschooling my 5 year old son in K. He loved the book. I like the simple experiments and the colorful "real" illustrations. I think this is the perfect intro to science book for K.

            I would definitely recommend this book!  I am reading it to my 3 and 5 year old sons and they love it.  It's right at their level, it  keeps thier attention, and they are learning a lot.

CHRISTIAN, EDWARD (d. 1823), Downing professor of laws, was the son of Charles Christian of Mairlandclere in Cumberland, and brother of Fletcher Christian [q. v.] of the mutiny of the Bounty. The family of Christian Curwen of Cumberland was nearly connected with him, and he had been described as a 'far-away cousin' of the first Lord Ellenborough. He graduated at St. John's College, Cambridge, taking his degree of B.A. in 1779 (when he was third wrangler and second chancellor's medallist), and that of M.A. in 1782. These distinctions, combined with the fact that he was member's prizeman in 1780, ampbr justified his election to a fellowship at St. John's College in the latter year, a prize which he held until 1789. He is stated in Hardwicke's 'Preston' (p. 652) to have been the master of Hawkshead free granunar school, but this could only have been for a short time, as he entered himself at Gray's Inn on 5 July 1782, and was called to the bar on 25 Jan. 1786. For some time he went the northern circuit, but he disappointed the high expectations of future distinction which had been formed from his university career, and gradually sank so low as to become the subject of practical jokes. On the nomination of Francis Annesley, then master of Downing College, Cambridge, he obtained the post of professor of common law, and by a grace of that university the title of professor of laws of England was conferred upon him on 1 Nov. 1788. Christian was for many years one of the counsel in the long-contested case between the university and the heirs of Sir Jacob Downing, and in the charter of the new incorporation of Downing College in 1800 he was named the first professor of laws, and received a stipend of 200l. per annum. In October 1790 he put himself forward as a candidate for the position of assessor to the vice-chancellor, but lost the election by 121 votes to 129. He obtained, however, the place of professor of general polity and laws of England in the East India College in Hertforashire, and was for a long time a commissioner of bankrupts. When the place of registrar of the Bediord level became vacant in 1805, Christian was one of the candidates, but after a severe contest, in the course of which the competitors came to blows, he was declared on a scrutiny to have been beaten by one vote. His last preferment was the chief-justiceship of the isle of Ely, a preferment which was abolished in November 1806, and this poet, of the annual value of 155l., was conferred upon him by Dr. Yorke, the then occupant of the see. Christian died at Downing College Cam-  bridge, on 29 March 1823, as was wittily remarked, 'in the fiill vigour of his incapacity.' His connection, Lord Ellenborough, was equally emphatic in condemnation. On one occasion a very doubtful nisi prius decision was cited before that sarcastic judge, and the question 'Who ruled that?' was met with the answer, 'The chief justice of the isle of Ely.' The peer thereupon exclaimed that Christian was 'only fit to rule — a copybook.'
His literary publications were numerous, and some of them showed considerable research into the depths of antiquarian law. The earliest was: (1) 'An Examination of Precedents and Principles . . . that an impeachment is determined by a dissolution of parliament,' 1790. This was followed by: (2) ' A Dissertation showing that the House of Lords in cases of Judicature are bound by precisely the same rules of evidence as are observed by all other courts,' 1792 ; 2nd ed. 1821. His edition, with notes and additions' (3), of Blackstone's 'Commentaries on the Laws of England' appeared in four volumes, 179S-6, and was often reissued down to 1880, the successive editions bringing the editor 'Considerable gain. To the 'Minutes of the Proceedings on the Court-martial held at Portsmouth August 12, 1792,' on the Bounty mutineers, he added (4) an appendix purporting to give a full account of the causes of the mutiny, which evoked a reply from Admiral Bligh. In 1807 he published (5) 'A Vindication of the Right of the Universities of Great Britain to a copy of every new publication,' the second edition appearing in 1814, end the third in 1818. Down to the former date it had been considered to rest with the publisher's discretion whether, under the statutes for the security of copyright, copies of all publications should be sent to other libraries than the British Museum, but, in consequence of Christian's action, the university of Cambridge stepped forward to enforce on its own behalf, and that of ten other public libraries, their right to such works. Christian's other publications were (6) 'A concise Account of the Origin of the two Houses of Parliament,' 1810 ; (7) 'The Origin. Progress, and Present Practice of the bankrupt Law,' 1812-14, 2 vols, and 2nd ed. 1818 ; (8) 'Practical Instructions for suing end prosecuting a Commission of Bankrupt,' 1816, 2nd ed. 1820; (9) 'Plan for a County Provident Bank,' 1810, with which may be coupled (10) 'General Observations on Provident Banks,' with a plan of the unlimited Provident Bank at Cambridge, included in the 'Pamphleteer,' xvii. 276-88, and of which it may be said that the Cambridge bank ultimately involved many persons in a heavy loss ; (11) 'Treatise on the Game Laws,' 1817 ; (12) ' Charges delivered to Grand Juries in the Isle of Ely,' 2nd ed. 1819, 8rd ed. 1821, many of which had previously been issued in a separate form ; (13) 'Full Explanation of the Law respecting Prayers for the Queen and the Royal Family,' which passed through three editions in 1821. Christian was elected a bencher of his inn on 7 June 1809, and discharged the duties of treasurer in 1810-11. If any one wishes to see his system of lecturing as professor at Cambridge, he can consult 'A Syllabus, or the Heads of Lectures publicly delivered in the University of Cambridge by Edward Christian,' 1797.

Item Description...OverviewPresents a profound defense of the Christian faith, filled with intelligent questions often asked by new and non-believers along with insightful and practical answers. Original.Publishers DescriptionGreg Boyd and his father, Ed, were on opposite sides of a great divide. Greg was a newfound Christian, while his father was a longtime agnostic. So Greg offered his father an invitation: Ed could write with any questions on Christianity, and his son would offer a response."Letters from a Skeptic" contains this special correspondence. The letters tackle some of today's toughest challenges facing Christianity, includingDo all non-Christians go to hell? How can we believe a man rose from the dead? Why is the world so full of suffering? How do we know the Bible was divinely inspired? Does God know the future?Each response offers insights into the big questions, while delivering intelligent answers that connect with both the heart and mind. Whether you're a skeptic, a believer, or just unsure, these letters can provide a practical, common-sense guide to the Christian faith.Buy Letters From A Skeptic w/Study Guide by Gregory A.

Con game or what?  Feb 12, 2009
After perusing the Chapter heads, I went to the study guide and worked back sampling the text. Though it may be unjustified, I couldn't help thinking "this could be a real con job!". Doesn't it seem more than likely that the letters were intended for publication from the beginning, so the conclusion was fore-gone! The book would not have been published if the father hadn't been born again! Shallow, at best! An Honest Exchange of Questions and Answers re: Christianity  Jan 25, 2009
This is an incredible book. I have read it and then bought numerous copies to give away to family and friends. The exchange of correspondence between the author and his father pulls no punches. Nothing is sugarcoated. The author gives well thought out and biblically sound answers to an apparently well educated father who has very legitimate questions regarding the Christian faith. This is an excellent book for serious searchers.  Foundations of faith   Dec 16, 2008
This is an excellent book for all those who like the challenge of asking many questions about their basic Christian convictions. The author's father, the skeptic, asked many  important  questions  about the nature of God, the problem of evil, human freedom and sufering, the Bible, heaven and hell, sin, etc.  The son tries to answer  these complex questions, and one might not always agree with his explanations. But they do provide further food for thought. Letters from a Skeptic will make you think and may result in some lively discussions with fellow believers, agnostics, atheists, and members of other faiths! Wonderful Read  Nov 23, 2008
I would recommend this book for everyone.  The content of this book asks questions that every Christian and non-Christian have asked of God.  Down to earth answers are given.  It is not preachy; it does distiguish the difference between religion and christianity. Wonderful and insightful.   Don't waste your time  Sep 13, 2008
A friend gave me this book after I had complained about The Shack, and how I felt the ultimate question in The Shack was never answered.  I deemed the question to be: "why does God allow bad things to happen to good people?"  Well, at least I didn't waste my money purchasing this book.The format utilized is as old as time itself.  Have a dialog with someone where softball questions are posed to the other person and the other person then gives the answer that will change the mind of the original person(in this case the senior Boyd)and  never up with any refuting comments of what his son as just said, but rather, give a milk toast response in the following letter.What would have made this a very intersting response is if some one like Robert M. Price, or Burton Mack, or Earl Doherty had responded to the PhD son.  Now, you have a discussion, and what you wouldn't have had is Dr. Boyd's half-baked ideas on his verson of what God is, or on what the scriptures mean.Others have commented (particularly those that have given one star ratings) that his scholarship on the bible and his interpretation of the bible leaves a lot to be desired.  I agree, but for different reasons.Thank God is was only 190 pages in length.  Don't buy it.  Not worth the time and energy.  Write your own review about Letters From A Skeptic w/Study Guide

          Edward L. Gaylord
        











2011

If Edward K. Gaylord was the key figure in facilitating Central Christian College’s move from Bartlesville to Oklahoma City, Edward L. Gaylord was the key player in seeing that it thrived in its new home.
Son of a pioneering newspaperman, Edward L. Gaylord built his father’s business empire many times its original size. He bought good properties that were in need of capital and parlayed them into profitable enterprises that could later be sold for handsome sums. Oklahoma Christian always was one of his favorite charitable causes and benefited greatly from his favor and generosity.
In 1965, Mr. Gaylord became chairman of Oklahoma Christian’s Board of Governors, a national body of influential business leaders who aided the administration in fundraising and public relations. He served as chairman for 20 years. The college named its student center for him in 1976. At the dedication, he teased, “I didn’t know that I gave my money for a pool hall.” The building was renovated in 1997 and is known today as the Edward L. Gaylord University Center.
Mr. Gaylord and his wife, Thelma, gave one of the key gifts for Enterprise Square USA. Known for his conservative values and interest in family programs, Mr. Gaylord solicited other gifts that were used to build and endow the $15 million project. In 1985, when Oklahoma Christian College launched its successful $50 million “With Wings As Eagles” campaign that enabled the institution to advance its academic programs in many disciplines, Mr. Gaylord served as its general chairman.
In September 1987, a new garden and amphitheater named for Thelma Gaylord was dedicated on the OC campus. In 2000, Mr. Gaylord presented Oklahoma Christian with a gift of $40 million, being distributed in $2 million increments over 20 years.
Through the years, Edward L. Gaylord courted the largest donor prospects in the Oklahoma City corporate campaigns, and he scored big with them. He was instrumental in getting George W. Bush to speak at the convocation and luncheon when the college became a university in 1990. Two years later, he and Mrs. Gaylord hosted Bush’s father, President George H.W. Bush, on campus for one of the most memorable days the university has ever known.
Presidents James O. Baird, J. Terry Johnson and Kevin E. Jacobs all spent time with Mr. Gaylord seeking his counsel. He was always willing to offer advice without forcing it on the administration. Oklahoma Christian University could never have achieved so much so fast without the faithful support of Edward L. and Thelma Gaylord.

                In Heretics G. K. Chesterton unmasks the heresies of contemporary thinking by exposing the faulty thinking of popular notions, especially apparent in the arts. An often overlooked book that contains some of Chesterton's strongest writing, the author takes on the "heresies" of modern thought, such as negativism, relativism, neo-paganism, puritanism, aestheticism, and individualism. The book includes one of his best essays: "On Certain Modern Writers and the Institution of Family."

This 1905 collection of articles focuses on the era's "heretics": those who pride themselves on their superiority to conservative views. Chesterton's companion volume to Orthodoxy asseses such artists and writers as Kipling, Shaw, Wells, and Whistler with the author's characteristic wisdom and good humour.

G K Chesterton
Gilbert Keith Chesterton was born in London, England, in 1874. He went on to study art at the Slade School, and literature at University College in London. Chesterton wrote a great deal of poetry, as well as works of social and literary criticism. Among his most notable books are The Man Who Was Thursday, a metaphysical thriller, and The Everlasting Man, a history of humankind's spiritual progress. After Chesterton converted to Catholicism in 1922, he wrote mainly on religious topics such as Orthodoxy and Heretics. Chesterton is most known for creating the famous priest-detective character Father Brown, who first appeared in The Innocence of Father Brown. Chesterton died in 1936 at the age of 62.

A Practical View of Christianity (Hendrickson Christian Classics Series)

        Heretics is the companion volume to the previously published "Orthodoxy" in Hendrickson's Christian Classics series.
        - Publisher

        With characteristic wit and wisdom, G.K. Chesterton unmasks the heresies of modernism by exposing the flawed thought underlying so many popular fallacies of the 20th Century - particularly as they emerged in the arts and literature. An often overlooked book that contains some of Chesterton's strongest writing, it takes on a host of trendy and toxic notions such as negativism, relativism, neo-paganism, aestheticism, and individualism.

    Methodist minister and Civil War chaplain Edward McKendree Bounds (1835-1913) considered conversation with God as fundamentally vital to the Christian's life as physical breath. He devoted the last 17 years of his life to intense intercession and to penning some of the most perennially popular works about prayer. This attractive volume features the very best of his beloved writings. 

"God shapes the world by prayer. Prayers are deathless. The lips that uttered them may be closed in death, the heart that felt them may have ceased to beat, but the prayers live before God, and God's heart is set on them and prayers outlive the lives of those who uttered them; they outlive a generation, outlive an age, outlive a world." - from E.M. Bounds on Prayer
