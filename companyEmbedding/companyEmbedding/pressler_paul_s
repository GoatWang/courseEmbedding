Biography[edit]
A New York native, Pressler received a bachelor's degree in business economics from the State University of New York in Oneonta, New York. He then worked as vice president of design and marketing for Kenner-Parker Toys; and then for 15 years with The Walt Disney Company, first as president of The Disney Store, president of the Disneyland, and senior vice president of Disney Licensing and then as chairman of the Parks and Resorts division.
Pressler was the president and CEO of Gap, Inc. from September 2002 to 22 January 2007.[3] He also served on the company's Board of Directors.
The Walt Disney Company[edit]
The Disney Store[edit]
Pressler joined the Disney Store as president in 1993.
Disneyland/Disneyland Resort[edit]
In 1996, Pressler oversaw a major expansion, including the opening of the new California Adventure theme park, Disney's Grand Californian Hotel, the remodeling of an existing hotel, a new retail, dining and entertainment complex called Downtown Disney; and a new multi-story parking area.[4] The new park and hotels opened in early 2001, and the entire complex was named the Disneyland Resort.
That same year, Pressler approved a $100 million change to Disneyland's Tomorrowland.[5] This change included several new attractions and an updated 'Jules Verne' theme for the area.
During his tenure as president the theme parks saw record profits, and various changes were made to the theme park's merchandise and operations.[6] California Adventure consistently under-performed corporate and public expectations. Pressler pushed through a period of record profits for the Disney theme park division. However, after the September 11 attacks in 2001 (shortly after California Adventure opened), tourism to the resort had dropped.[7]
Walt Disney Parks and Resorts[edit]
Pressler was promoted to lead Disney's worldwide resorts division Disney Cruise Line, Disneyland Resort, Walt Disney World Resort and Disneyland Resort Paris, and to encourage negotiations with the government of Hong Kong over the Hong Kong Disneyland Resort.[8]
Philanthropy[edit]
A long-time supporter of Big Brothers Big Sisters of America, Pressler served on the organization's Greater Los Angeles board of directors from 1994–2002 and on the national board of directors from 2002-2009.

      ■ Having proved himself a competent and successful leader in
      several positions at the Disney Corporation, Paul S. Pressler made a
      controversial move to take over operations at Gap. Because of his lack of
      fashion experience, some doubted his ability to change the direction of
      the retailer that had experienced 29 straight months of sales losses.
      However, Pressler used his open management style and innovative ideas
      based on market research and the expertise of his employees not only to
      turn the company around but to add new chances for growth into
      Gap's future plans.
    

      FROM TOYS TO THEME PARKS
    

      Born in 1956, Paul Pressler grew up on Long Island. He graduated from the
      State University of New York at Oneonta in 1978 with a bachelor's
      degree in economics. His first foray

          . 
        


      into the business world was as an urban planner for New York City. He
      stayed there for a short time before he moved over into the toy business.
      He worked for both Remco Toys and Mego Toys before he was hired by
      Kenner-Parker Toys as the vice president of marketing and design in 1982.
      At Kenner-Parker he made his mark by guiding the company successfully in
      its marketing of the popular Care Bears line.
    

      Pressler's achievements with the Care Bears marketing campaign were
      noticed by Disney, which offered him a position as the senior vice
      president for product licensing in 1987. Pressler accepted the job,
      starting his 15-year relationship with the company. He held a multitude of
      positions with Disney over the years, including senior vice president for
      all consumer products and executive vice president and general manager of
      Disney Stores. While Pressler held the latter position, the number of
      Disney Stores increased and sales steadily improved,
       largely because of Pressler's idea of making each store a
      mini-Disneyland, giving each customer a fantastical shopping experience.
      In 1994 Pressler was chosen to head the Disneyland parks and hotels in
      Anaheim, California, and in 1998 he was promoted to president of Disney
      theme parks and resorts worldwide. Pressler's success in raising
      profits and making the Disney brand popular to people of all ages made
      many analysts think he might one day take over Michael Eisner's
      position at the top.
    

      A FASHION SENSE
    

      In 2002, however, Pressler made a move that was considered by some to be
      foolish: he took over the presidency of Gap. In fact, Pressler was
      criticized when he took over operations at Gap because he lacked fashion
      experience. Gap Inc. owned The Gap, Banana Republic, and Old Navy chains.
      The company's previous chief executive, Millard Drexler, was known
      for his top-down style of management: he thought up the ideas and the
      company followed his word. Pressler came into the company with a different
      approach, caring much less about his personal tastes and instincts and
      much more about data from market research. He stated openly that he would
      not be doing any of the design work; he hired experts to take care of that
      end of the business for him. He also became known for his willingness to
      experiment, even holding a fashion show in which actors and actresses
      dressed in Gap's newest lines and posed on stage at a nightclub. He
      kept out of the limelight, sharing the credit for the store's
      turnaround with his entire staff, especially the designers, whose work he
      began to showcase.
    

      When Pressler took over Gap, the company was in enormous debt, having
      spent almost two and a half years in sales declines. One of the first
      things Pressler did as president and CEO was to reestablish the
      firm's brands. The three stores, the Gap, Banana Republic, and Old
      Navy, had begun to blur together, losing their distinct personalities.
      Pressler resolved to sharpen eash store's focus. "In Banana
      Republic, it meant some reinvention…. In the case of Gap, it was
      clearly going back to our heart and soul, and in the case of Old Navy, it
      was about driving deeper to take share from our value sector,"
      Pressler was quoted in 
      
        Women's Wear Daily
      
       (April 20, 2004). Pressler hoped that his branding efforts would lower
      the Gap's enormous debt. He began a companywide makeover that would
      take a year before showing results.
    

      In February 2003 Pressler was named one of the people to watch by 
      
        Fortune
      
       magazine. By that time he had managed to reverse Gap's sales
      decline. Things were looking up for company, and Pressler's
      one-time critics were beginning to change their opinions about his ability
      to succeed at Gap. Don Fisher, the chairman of the board of Gap, was
      quoted by 
      
        Women's Wear Daily
      
       as saying, "We've changed a lot in the past year.
      We've hired a new CEO, strengthened our board and dramatically
      improved our performance. Paul Pressler has done a terrific job in his
      first year as CEO, and I'm more confident than ever about our
      company's long-term prospects" (December 10, 2003).
    

      The first test of Pressler's success occurred in 2003 when the
      first line of clothes that his team had come up with hit the stores. The
      fall line centered on colorful corduroys and had a marketing campaign
      centered on celebrities like Madonna and Missy Elliott. Pressler got a big
      break when a picture of Madonna, decked out in Gap clothing, was chosen to
      be the cover of the September issue of 
      
        Harper's Bazaar
      
      . The line was an instant success, and Pressler's fitness for the
      positions of president and CEO of Gap were no longer derided.
    

      WIDENING THE GAP
    

      In 2004 Pressler and his team researched opportunities for acquiring
      stores. They were also interested in more international expansion and
      continued to extend existing brands. In June 2004 Pressler managed to
      secure popular actress Sarah Jessica Parker to lead Gap's 35th
      anniversary campaign. At the Credit Suisse First Boston retail conference
      in New York, Pressler announced that part of Gap's growth plans for
      the future included pursuing stores that focused on markets different from
      those in Gap's range.

Paul Pressler's Fall From The Gap


                    Hailed on his arrival, the former CEO is now viewed as the wrong guy at the wrong time
                




February 26, 2007, 12:00 AM EST









         
      
      
                
                
          
          
          
          
      
      
               When Paul S. Pressler arrived as the chief executive officer of Gap Inc. (GPS
      ) in the fall of 2002, he was exactly what the board wanted--or at least what it thought it wanted. The polished, good-looking Disney veteran was a hard-nosed operations wizard, not a dreamy fashion junkie. He seemed to be just the man to restore discipline to the floundering company. But over the next four years, Gap's performance came apart at the seams. On Jan. 22, Pressler resigned. 
      
       
       
       
      
      
      
      
      
       
            
        
      
      
The immediate post-mortem analysis: He was a numbers guy who didn't appreciate the nuances of the fashion business. That's true, but it's only part of the story. Pressler's problems involved more than just a few bad bets on colors and styles. According to 12 former employees interviewed by BusinessWeek, he also bungled some of the very things that were supposed to be his strengths, including cost-cutting campaigns, human resources initiatives, and supply chain streamlining efforts. One ex-employee characterizes Pressler's tenure as "total system failure."
Pressler's management shortcomings were particularly visible at the company's most important division: its flagship Gap brand. The story of his failed effort to fix this once-proud chain, insiders say, is a classic demonstration of what can happen when a talented man is handed the wrong mission. "He is a skilled leader and he understands how to build a team, but unfortunately he didn't build a team for the particular challenges Gap faced," says a former insider. "Maybe he was the wrong guy at the wrong time."








Gap wouldn't comment for this article. "We've said what we have to say on Paul's departure and are moving on with the business," said company spokesman Greg Rossiter. At the time Pressler left, board Chairman Robert J. Fisher said that the company "improved its operations, strengthened its balance sheet, greatly enhanced its online presence...and improved its standing as a global corporate citizen" under the ex-ceo's leadership. Pressler didn't respond to repeated requests for comment, including a list of written questions.
In the wake of Pressler's departure, Gap is still reeling. Companywide, sales at stores open at least a year fell 7% in the most recent fiscal fourth quarter, which ended Feb. 3. Full-company earnings for 2006 are expected to decline 33%, to $739.8 million. Although shares ran up significantly following Pressler's arrival, increasing from about $10 a share in the fall of 2002 to more than $24 during the summer of 2004, they have traded in the $17-to-$20 range ever since. Now frustrated investors are waiting for a big strategy pronouncement the Gap has promised to deliver on Mar. 1. Some hope the board of directors will put the entire company up for sale.
That's a steep fall for a retailer that, just a decade ago, seemed perfectly attuned to American tastes. When the workplace went casual in the 1990s, Gap was at the ready with big selections of khaki pants. When fleece vests were popular a few years later, Gap had them in a rainbow of colors. Everyone seemed to own a classic Gap pocket T-shirt or two. Yet the brand, always a symbol of affordable style, also appealed to fashionistas. Actress Sharon Stone wore a black Gap mock turtleneck to the 1996 Oscars. Supermodels donned white Gap jeans and shirts on the cover of Vogue magazine in 1991.




Between 1989 and 2001, companywide sales rocketed from $1.6 billion to $13.7 billion. Those stunning results were driven in part by the breathtaking success of the Old Navy chain's inexpensive wares. At the same time the Banana Republic chain--which in 1989 shed its original safari theme in favor of a more sophisticated, urban aesthetic--also sizzled.

ALIENATING LONGTIME CUSTOMERS





But by the end of 2001, the Gap brand and Old Navy were suffering sharp growing pains. Under Millard S. "Mickey" Drexler, the company's ceo at the time, the two chains overexpanded. Long-term debt ballooned from $780 million to $2 billion in 2001. Simultaneously, the usually trend-savvy Drexler oversaw a series of fashion missteps, in particular veering toward super-hip clothes that alienated longtime customers. Earnings sank, and in 2002, Drexler was pushed out.
Along came Pressler. A 15-year Walt Disney Co. (DIS
      ) veteran, he had risen to the chairmanship of the company's amusement parks and resorts unit. By nature a methodical thinker, say people who worked under him at Disney, Pressler embraced market analyses and other research to help him understand consumer spending patterns. He also imposed strict cost controls that irked his creative staff. "At Disney, he never had to deal with the creative, qualitative side of design," observes Steve Roukis, managing director at Matrix Asset Advisors, which holds about 2 million Gap shares.
Gap could not have been happier with its new leader. "Paul knows how to lead creative, customer-focused organizations," said Gap founder Donald G. Fisher in a statement announcing Pressler's hiring. Once at Gap, Pressler, who wore neat jeans, jackets, and a ready smile, came across as a likable and approachable manager. "Anyone who's ever met Paul agrees he's a nice guy," says a former Gap insider.
So the honeymoon began. At the start, Pressler had the benefit of excellent timing: Clothing designed during Drexler's final year on the job was starting to appear in stores and did well. Sales rose at the Gap brand, and companywide, for more than a year. Earnings shot up, too. Pressler went on a hiring spree, bringing in a handful of former Disney colleagues, including Chief Financial Officer Byron H. Pollitt Jr., who paid down debt and restored the company's credit rating to investment-grade status. Pressler also hired another ex-Disney co-worker, Eva Sage-Gavin, to lead human resources.
It was Gap's longstanding corporate culture that caught Pressler's attention early on. At the time, the no-nonsense corporate mantra was "Own it, do it, get it done." But Pressler thought this ethos didn't sufficiently promote collaboration. He set out to promote a new environment built around the slogan "Purpose, Values, and Behaviors." Among the catchphrases were bromides such as: "Explore, Create, and Exceed Together." Pamphlets promoting communication and teamwork landed on employees' desks. Posters and banners trumpeting the bland new slogans went up around headquarters.
In the beginning, "people were very receptive" to the effort, says Alan J. Barocas, the company's former senior vice-president for real estate. "It was embraced." But eye-rolling started as the initiative began consuming a lot of time. Former employees say they had to sit through countless meetings, workshops, and role-playing seminars where Pressler and his hr executives discussed the new culture. Many staffers felt they were wasting their time in get-togethers that didn't address the crucial matter of creating and marketing clothes. "hr was out of control," says a former insider.
Over the next couple of years, employees also felt bogged down in what they thought were unnecessary meetings with cfo Pollitt. With Pressler's blessing, Pollitt demanded highly detailed presentations that explained minutiae managers thought were far too detailed for a cfo, such as the margins on individual products or the costs of decorative trims. Confabs with Pollitt were "the antithesis of being creative and nimble. It was talking about the work vs. doing the work," says a former employee. Gap said that Pollitt declined to comment.
Despite Pressler's expertise and comfort with the operational side of the company, some of his initiatives in that area also backfired. In 2003, he kicked off a plan to remake the retailer's supply chain. One goal was to combine fabric purchases across all three of the company's brands, which had previously used separate suppliers. Pressler wanted to cut costs and speed the flow of merchandise from drawing board to store shelf.
But the effort stumbled. Since all three brands sell jeans made of denim, in late 2003 they began purchasing it together. But the big buying deals yielded denim of a single quality, weave, and weight. That meant all three brands were limited to one kind of fabric even though, with their different audiences, they needed to be able to offer an array of jeans. And with all that denim ordered in advance, there was less incentive for designers to keep their eyes open so they could jump on the next great style. Jeans made with material from the pooled purchases ended up largely falling flat, and the joint purchasing effort was abandoned.

RAISING EYEBROWS

As part of the supply chain revamping, Pressler also tinkered with the way the Gap brand produced clothing samples. These prototypes had long been made at studios in Manhattan's Garment District. But Pressler moved sample-making to Asia, where the company's many suppliers are located. With that change, designers had to create patterns, ship them to Asia, get the samples back, make changes, and ship them back to be remade. While making samples in Asia was cheaper than in New York, it delayed the process and "made you less nimble," says a former insider. Aggravating matters, the company instituted a new cost-cutting rule: No overnight shipping to Asia without high-level approval.
The summer of 2004 brought a pivotal change. Pressler reassigned Gap brand head Gary P. Muto to lead Forth & Towne, the new store aimed at women older than 35. While he searched to fill the hole at the top of the namesake division, Pressler led the Gap brand himself. The move raised eyebrows among employees, who worried about his lack of experience in apparel.
Their fears were confirmed. The Gap brand needed someone to referee when designers disagreed with the merchants, a common occurrence at retailers everywhere. Designers constantly push the limits toward edgier styles; merchants must make sure that whatever lands in their stores sells to the brand's mainstream audience. While Pressler encouraged designers and merchants to work together, "there was no tiebreaker.... He made it clear that he didn't want to be that person," says a former employee.

OFF-THE-MARK MARKET RESEARCH

Even more frustrating were Pressler's contributions during line reviews, where designers present clothing samples for a future season, and "store-set" meetings, where store-design staff show proposed merchandise displays. According to former employees, Pressler's suggestions were frequently phrased as questions. Typical of one: "Do you think it would be better to move the denim to the middle wall?" Afterwards, "meetings would end, and no one had a clue what he'd said," says one former insider. "We all had opinions, and it would be a bicker and a fight. All hell would break loose."
The first clothes produced under Pressler's leadership of the Gap brand started to reach shelves in the spring of 2005. But even supported by an advertising blitz fronted by actress Sarah Jessica Parker, the brand's sales fell 4% that spring and summer.
One sore spot was Pressler's directive to use the findings of the research staff, known as the consumer insights group, that he had created. Some designers and merchants didn't believe that the group's output--which included findings from consumer focus groups, polls, and surveys of customers and store employees--was particularly useful in the fashion business, because consumers aren't good at predicting what they'll buy in the future. "Paul didn't know how to interact with the design team, who didn't react to the science being imposed on them," says an ex-employee.
The constant disagreements delayed determining final designs. Ideas for any given season ping-ponged back and forth. Entire collections were made, and altered, and then reworked, sometimes several times over. With no decision-maker, "we'd go back and forth, and change, and redo, and then we'd be out of time" before orders had to be placed or stores would have empty shelves, says a former insider. In the 11th-hour crunch, staffers would end up falling back on lowest-common-denominator items, bland styles that they hoped would please everyone but risked pleasing no one. Last August, for instance, Gap heavily promoted the good old safe T-shirt, hawking it as "the ultimate vehicle for self-expression." The campaign didn't reverse the brand's ongoing sales decline, which that fall clocked in at 7%.
Meanwhile, the search for a Gap brand head was dragging on. Pressure to fill the job was mounting. A presentation to Wall Street analysts on Apr. 21, 2005, was fast approaching, and a gaping hole in the executive lineup wouldn't go over well. Three days before the meeting, Pressler announced his choice: Cynthia Harriss, a former Disney colleague he hired 14 months earlier to lead the Gap Outlet unit, representing a sliver of the company's total sales.
Harriss had little big-time fashion experience. She'd worked for Disney's retail stores for five years before moving to its resorts business in 1997. While she had worked for 19 years at Paul Harris Stores Inc., a Midwestern apparel chain, its annual sales were well under $1 billion, compared with the Gap brand's  $5 billion. Arun Daniel, senior consumer analyst at ing Investment Management (ING
      ), which holds about 1.3 million Gap shares, considers the promotion of Harriss to be one of Pressler's critical mistakes. "He needed a strong No. 2 in merchandising," says Daniel. "Cynthia Harriss was an operations person."
Under Harriss, the Pressler-style management of the brand continued through the rest of 2005 and beyond, say former employees. "She made no decisions," says one. "She defaulted to Paul, who made no decisions." (Harriss declined requests to comment.)
The clock was ticking. By the end of 2005, speculation was widespread that Pressler, who'd won the nickname "Dead Man Walking" on Wall Street, would soon be on his way out. Chairman Fisher, though, publicly supported Pressler, calling him "the right person to lead this company." Nonetheless, industry watchers predicted that 2006 would be Pressler's last shot at a turnaround. Sales declines at the Gap brand were widening, reaching an 8% drop in the first quarter of fiscal 2006.
The tumult dragged on. Ad campaigns came and went, including last fall's commercials for black pants that used footage of Audrey Hepburn. They failed to reverse the sales declines that Wall Street had come to expect. In November, the company's credit rating dropped back into junk territory, and holiday sales for the Gap brand plummeted 9%.

It came as no great surprise when the company said Pressler and the board "have mutually agreed that Mr. Pressler will step down from his position." And it didn't come as much of a surprise when the company spelled out the qualifications for its next ceo: Gap is now seeking an executive who sounds like the opposite of Pressler, one with "deep retailing and merchandising experience, ideally in apparel," and who "understands the creative process."
The search is still under way.

Under Fire, Gap Chief Steps Down

For the last two weeks, the son of Gap’s  founders and the board’s chairman, Robert J. Fisher, conducted a series of secret conference calls with fellow directors.The topic was whether to fire Gap’s embattled chief executive, Paul S. Pressler.On Friday, Mr. Fisher delivered the board’s decision to Mr. Pressler: he was out. The 50-year-old former Disney executive did not put up much of a fight, according to a person briefed on the matter.Yesterday Mr. Pressler stepped down after Gap’s third dismal holiday shopping season, in what the company described as a “mutual” decision. The move was widely expected on Wall Street, where investors began calling for his ouster more than a year ago. He is eligible for a severance package worth $14.5 million, the company said.With Gap’s board weighing the sale of the troubled company, Mr. Pressler’s departure clears the way for potential buyers to install their own chief executive.

Several private equity groups have approached Millard S. Drexler, the former Gap chief executive who was ousted to make way for Mr. Pressler, about running the company after a sale, according to a person briefed on the matter. Continue reading the main story

But Mr. Drexler, whose runaway success at J. Crew has haunted Gap’s board, has told the investment firms that he has no interest in returning to Gap, this person said.Gap said it was searching for a new chief with “deep” retail experience — an apparent jab at Mr. Pressler, who had little — and speculation immediately fell upon industry heavyweights like Roger N. Farah, the president of Polo Ralph Lauren, and Paul R. Charron, the former head of Liz Claiborne. For now Mr. Fisher will fill the post.Mr. Pressler, who once ran the Walt Disney Company’s theme parks, arrived at Gap in 2002 with bold plans to cut costs and restore the chain’s place in the retail firmament after years of sluggish sales.He slashed Gap’s heavy debt, but it quickly became clear that he could not turn around the ailing retail business. He inherited an ambitious expansion program that left Gap with too many stores and a strategy of appealing to younger shoppers that moved the chain away from its casual clothes.

With his emphasis on testing products, through focus groups and computer models, Mr. Pressler immediately clashed with the chain’s clothing designers, who managed by instinct under Mr. Drexler, whose fashion acumen earned him the nickname “the Merchant Prince.”In one meeting that employees said epitomized his tenure, Mr. Pressler told designers to “put together a focus group on graphic T-shirts,” according to people who attended it, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk publicly.“Designers see the future, they do not respond to focus groups,” one attendee said later.But under Mr. Pressler, these people said, such data motivated a dizzying number of changes to fashions and store layouts, leaving consumers more confused than ever.

There were puffy jackets one season too late and five shades of green hoodies on the same rack. Sales fell every month for the last year and the chain resorted to  discounts like $100 off a fur-lined parka this fall.

During the holiday season, in what was widely regarded as Mr. Pressler’s last chance to save his job, Gap returned to the simple fashions, like T-shirts and hooded sweaters, that fueled the chain’s meteoric rise in the 1990s. But sales at stores open at least a year fell 8 percent.Soon after, according to people briefed on the matter, the board hired the investment bank Goldman Sachs to investigate the potential sale of the company, which would be one of the largest buyouts ever in the retail industry. Gap’s market value is more than $16 billion, and analysts expect that the company would bring more than $18 billion.Several groups have expressed interest in buying Gap, but the board, which is filled with several members of the Fisher family, favors keeping control of the company, according to a person briefed on the matter.Rumors of Mr. Pressler’s impending ouster became so persistent in the last year that Gap’s founder, Donald G. Fisher, issued a statement last year confirming his support for the chief executive.Still, analysts began to refer to him as a “dead man walking” over the last year and openly predicted that he would not last through the end of 2007.They were right.“They finally did it,” said Jennifer Black, a retail analyst who runs a firm by the same name. “Four years was enough.”In a statement, Mr. Pressler said that he “enjoyed the opportunity to lead this iconic company over the past four years,” adding that Gap “is a company with tremendous potential.”
