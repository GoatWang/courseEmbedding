                    2016 - Current                  


TransAtlantic Petroleum Ltd.

                    TransAtlantic Petroleum Corp. was incorporated in 1985 under the laws of British Columbia and changed domicile to Alberta in 1997.

In 1992, The Company acquired a 30% interest in OML 109, a 215,000-acre concession located offshore Nigeria. TransAtlantic successfully drilled a discovery well in 1994 and an appraisal well in 1995 in the Ejulebe field on OML 109, and contracted with a service provider to develop the field. Production began in September 1998, and the Ejulebe field produced approximately 11 million barrels of crude oil as of December 2005. Following its participation in OML 109, TransAtlantic drilled several exploration wells offshore from Benin and onshore in Tunisia. Additionally, TransAtlantic attempted to exploit two onshore Egyptian oil and gas exploration blocks.

During 2005, 2006 and 2007, the Company focused on acquiring high-impact international properties, evaluating and acquiring lower-risk cash flow opportunities in the United States and disposing of its Nigerian property, which was sold in 2005. During 2005 and 2006, TransAtlantic acquired an exploration permit and a reconnaissance license in Morocco, three production blocks in Romania, three exploration licenses in Turkey, and two promote round licenses covering six blocks in the UK North Sea. During this same period, the Company acquired properties in Texas. TransAtlantic also participated as a non-operator in four other properties in Texas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana.

In 2007, the Company determined to exit its U.S. operations and focus on the development of its international properties. To that end, TransAtlantic acquired three additional exploration licenses in Turkey, converted a portion of its Moroccan reconnaissance license into two exploration permits, sold the Texas properties it operated, and offered its remaining non-operated U.S. properties for sale.
