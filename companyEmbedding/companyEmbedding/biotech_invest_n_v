    1.5 Specific dsDNA Quantification UV/VIS-based cDrop™ Method vs Picogreen® Fluorescent Assay

  Precise quantification and normalization of isolated genomic DNA is critical for advanced molecular testing in life science research and molecular diagnostics. UV-Vis based quantification has long been the method of choice, mainly because of its convenience. However, determining the DNA concentration based on the absorbance at 260nm suffers from interference of components such as RNA, proteins and phenols. Alternative methods, such as the PicoGreen® based Quant-iT™ assay, based on fluorescence enhancement upon binding with dsDNA have been developed to address this issue.

    1.3 Micro-volume Protein Quantification using the DropSense96 Droplet Plate Reader

  The measurement of protein concentration in aqueous samples is an important assay in biochemistry research and protein production facilities. Spectrophotometric protein quantification assays are commonly used methods to rapidly determine the concentration of a protein. They utilize the direct UV absorbance of the protein at 280nm in combination with its extinction coefficient or an indirect dye-based methods like BCA, Lowry and Bradford assays.

    1.2 DropSense96 and its DropPlates, a Versatile Tool for Nucleic Acid and Protein Droplet Quantification

  As the demand for molecular tests increases, automated systems for biomolecule isolation and sample analysis are becoming popular. These facilitate integration of the complete molecular test in a full automatic set-up with liquid robots and bar-coded sample tracking resulting in a significant higher throughput while minimizing tedious manual repetitive tasks. The Trinean technology is a unique combination of the DropSense96 droplet plate reader, the 96well DropPlate microfuidic consumables and the DropQuant analytical software enabling direct quantification of small biomolecule samples in these high throughput, automated workflow.

    1.14 Droplet UV/VIS Quantification of Native Proteins in Biopharmaceutical Processing

  Biopharmaceuticals are mainly produced by microbial fermentation or in animal cell cultures. As a consequence, a cascade of procedures including purification and characterization are required throughout the processing chain to obtain the protein at the desired level of purity and potency. Within these processes, quantification of the protein of interest is mandatory at critical steps to maintain confidence in the processing
results and fidelity in the end product.

    Dye-free quantification of Oragene®/saliva DNA extracts using the Trinean DropSense96® Droplet Reader and cDrop™ Spectral Analysis Software

  Saliva samples collected with Oragene® self-collection kits from DNA Genotek offer a non-invasive and proven method for accessing high quality and quantity DNA for genomic testing and analysis. Proper quantification of the extracted DNA is a critical step
for most downstream applications. Trinean has developed a specific quantification protocol for DNA from Oragene/saliva samples using the DropSense96® droplet reader and the cDrop™ spectral decomposition software. A comparative analysis using a PicoGreen® fluorescent quantification assay shows a comparable specificity for dsDNA quantification. Since the read-out
of 96 samples with the DropSense96 is performed in 5 minutes without any prior mixing or incubation, this technology is a viable alternative to fluorescent quantification assays.

    1.7 Quantifying Amplicons in Non-Purified PCR Reactions: Direct Assessment of Product Yield

  The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a fundamental tool in molecular biology and clinical testing. Most genetic tests rely upon the power of PCR to enrich specific target-sequences prior to analysis. Analytical methods like sequencing are relatively expensive and labs want to minimize the resources spent on samples that don't meet the requirements of concentration and quality to deliver a reliable result.

    1.10 cDrop Protocol for TRIzol RNA Extract Quantification and Content QC

  This cDrop protocol is developed for specific RNA quantification of extracts from a variety of sample origins (human, animal, plant) using extraction kits based on the
one-step extraction method using a guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol- chloroform reagent-mix developed by Chomczynski (1). Commercial available variants include the TRIzol® kit (Invitrogen), TRI Reagent® (MRC), RNAzolTM (MRC) and RNA STAT-60TM (Tel-Test).

    All-Purpose Protein Sample QC Using a Novel Micro-Volume Platform with Spectral Content Profiling Software

  Accurate total protein quantitation of purified proteins, cell lysates, affinity-column fractions or other complex protein samples is crucial for robust biochemical testing during biopharmaceutical development as well as production. As the presence of chemicals doesn't allow simple A280 protein quantification, more labor-intensive alternatives for quantification are used. Examples are the colorimetric Bradford or BCA assay, which negate to a large extent the presence of contaminants but require multiple steps and show variation depending on the sample composition and time point of measuring within the ongoing reaction.

    Precise Nucleic Acid Quantification Using Lab-on-a-chip Spectroscopy and the cDrop Quantification Algorithm

  Precise quantification and quality control of isolated genomic DNA is critical for the success of downstream applications such as next-generation sequencing. Traditionally, two quantification methods have been used routinely: (1) UV/Vis spectroscopy and (2) fluorescence-based assays (i.e. PicoGreen) that utilize DNA intercalating agents.

    Sample Processing for the UK Biobank Genotyping Project

  A project was initiated in 2013 to perform SNP genotyping on all UK Biobank participants. The aim of the project (which was to be completed within an 18-24 month timeframe) was to generate high quality genotype data and to make these data available for researchers, via the UK Biobank Showcase system. This poster describes the sample processing workflow, presents a comparison between the two quantification methods used in the project (Trinean DropSense® 96 and PicoGreen) and provides a summary of the genotyping metrics for the (approx.) first 180,000 samples analysed.

                Pharmaceutical Vs. Biotech Investing: Is It Worth The Risk?            


    By Kristina Zucchi, CFA 






Share















































The decision to invest in pharmaceutical (pharma) or biotech stocks is a confusing one unless you have a keen knowledge of the basic operations and products of the company and how its securities trade on the market.
Pharmaceutical companies range from large to small, and they engage in a full array of activities from research and development (R&D) to manufacturing and marketing medicines. The compounds pharmaceutical companies manufacture are small molecules based on chemical or plant synthesis.
Conversely, biotech companies, except for a few, are generally small enterprises that engage solely in R&D of medicines. These companies use biotechnology to recreate the function of cells; they use microorganisms and enzymes to develop large-molecule drugs that are used for a specific purpose. Because biotechs mimic cellular processes, the length of time from research and development is extremely long, averaging 10-15 years.
The R&D process for both involves many clinical testing trials that yield specific data. These trials are “blind” so that neither the companies, nor the investors, have any knowledge of the outcomes.
R&D and Stock Impact
Biotech companies tend to be small with only one to a few compounds in development. Most of these companies operate with losses, because the time to develop is so long and the R&D processes are extremely costly. Because of this dynamic, biotech companies tend to find partners for financial support, usually through venture capital, universities, pharmaceutical companies or the government.
Despite this, when a company’s compound is in clinical trials, if the “endpoints” (expected data) are not met, the stocks can plummet. But if the endpoints are exceeded, the stocks can soar many-fold. As a result, investors in biotech companies need to be willing to tolerate a great deal of volatility.
While pharmaceutical companies also experience the costly and lengthy R&D process, including the ups and downs during clinical trials, they are usually able to withstand the volatility better because these companies tend to have many more product lines producing revenue that covers the R&D costs. Therefore, their stocks are comparatively more stable and considered safer investments.
When a biotech company finally has a marketable drug, it needs to get a marketing and sales arm. This is accomplished by either building one or, in many cases, partnering with a larger biotech or pharma company. Many pharmaceutical companies have alliances with biotech companies, adding revenues through the sale of the biotech’s drug without the costs or time associated with development - a nice boost to their top line.
Competition
Competition is one area that impacts pharma companies to a greater degree than biotech companies, because pharmaceuticals are chemical processes thought to be more easily replicated. Competition generally comes in the form of generic drugs, which can be introduced to the market after the branded drugs' patents expire. The length of each patent varies, but it is usually long enough for pharma companies to recoup R&D costs and produce healthy profits. When a generic drug is introduced to the market, the branded drug pricing is 100% lost. Drug prices for the generic can be up to 90% lower than the branded pricing.




“Me too” drugs, competitive products that work in a different manner for the same disease, can erode market share and pricing as well. Biotech companies had not been faced with any “biosimilar” or generic competition. But since the passage of legislation in 2010, biosimilars can become an increasingly competitive threat to biotech companies. Many issues exist in terms of determining the course of development for biosimilar competitors. So biotech companies, because they face such steep costs and lengthy processes associated with R&D, are hoping that biosimilars will not be a near-term competitive threat.
Investment Theses
There are two basic investment theses based on time horizon and risk tolerance:
Pharmaceutical Investment: If you are less risk tolerant and not willing to wait for long-term drug development, then an investment in a pharmaceutical company makes more sense. The drivers of pharmaceutical stocks include prescription data, new drug pipelines, strategic alliances and M&A activity, competition and reimbursement changes. These stocks tend to be more stable because some of these drivers are predictable. In addition, drug companies tend to have a larger revenue base with multiple product lines so they trade based on profits.  Unforeseen short-term threats include changes to Medicare pricing, which tend to impact the pricing for many consumers. Unforeseen long-term threats include negative medical impacts from taking the drugs (such as death/lawsuits) as well as loss of patents (allowing competitors to come to market sooner).
Biotech Investment: If you are a risk taker and willing to wait for drug development while withstanding the potential volatility generally associated with biotech stocks, then an investment in a biotech company may suit your style. Biotech stocks generally trade based on drug data including clinical trial failures, competition or regulatory obstacles. If the drug data misses its expected endpoint, a biotech's stock can lose most of its value in one day. Conversely, if a drug meets its expected endpoint, a stock can soar by double and triple digits that day. Some companies that have strong partners or are financially stable may be able to withstand setbacks, but many companies may not, and the investment can go bust.
Valuation
Pharmaceutical stocks typically trade at a large discount to biotech stocks. The historical mean forward P/E multiple is 16x from 1976 through March 2013 for pharma as compared to the high 20x to 30x or more for biotechs.
Because many biotechs are small and operating with losses, they are valued using price-to-sales ratio (PSR) or enterprise-value-to-sales (EV/Sales). However, according to one Wall Street analyst, “There is no meaningful relationship [between valuation] and market cap or revenues.” (Source: Merrill Lynch Back to Basics presentation.) As such, valuation is a bit unreliable and meaningless with some of these stocks.
The Bottom Line
Both pharma and biotech stocks face a costly process that, when successful, can produce extremely profitable products. However, the process is extremely unpredictable, which for a small biotech firm can prove all too detrimental and un-recoverable. Pharmaceutical companies, due to their larger size and diversified revenue base, are typically able to withstand setbacks and failures. Competition is more relevant and costly to pharmaceutical companies, creating a need for strong pipelines and non-organic revenues (such as through M&A or alliances). Consideration of these key themes can provide the basis for making a prudent investment.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.

Biotech Stocks 
A list of publicly traded biotech companies can be found by scrolling down or you can access a list of the companies in each group through the industry links on this page.
There are hundreds of publicly traded biotech companies on U.S. exchanges and to help our visitors navigate this large group of companies we have organized our biotech section into two primary categories: market capitalization and specific areas of focus.
Large, Mid, Small, Micro and Nano-Cap Biotech Sections: Each of these sections is comprised of stocks based on market capitalization:
Large-Cap Biotech: These stocks have a market capitalization over ten billion dollars.
Mid-Cap Biotech: These stocks have a market capitalization between two and ten billion dollars.
Small-Cap Biotech: These stocks have a market capitalization between 300 million and two billion dollars.
Micro-Cap Biotech: These stocks have a market capitalization between 50 million and 300 million dollars.
Nano-Cap Biotech: These stocks have a market capitalization under 50 million dollars.
We update this page at the start of every month so it is possible that during the course of a month a stock’s market cap might fall below or go above these capitalization levels.
Healthcare Focus Areas: In these sections you will find medical device, biotech, pharmaceutical or other healthcare companies that provide drugs, equipment, products, services or therapeutics in a number of different categories including:
Specific/Classes of Diseases: Cancer, Diabetes, Infectious Diseases, Multiple Sclerosis, Neurological, and Rare Diseases.
Areas of the Body: Blood, Central Nervous System, Dental, Ears, ENT, Eye Care, Gastrointestinal, Heart, Kidney, Liver, Respiratory Health, Skin Care, Spine, Urology and Vascular.
Specific Demographics: Animal Health, Children and Women’s Health.
You will also find a number of other specialty categories including:
Aesthetics
Pain Management
Sleep
Weight Loss
Wound Care
While there are certainly other healthcare companies in these sections, a large percentage of a number of these categories are comprised of biotech companies.
