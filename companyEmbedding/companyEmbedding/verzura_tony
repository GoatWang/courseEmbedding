				will be public soon to raise money for her child in hopes of 
				providing finical support for the family. We will forever miss

Tony Verzura of United Cannabis


by  R. Scott Rappold  | July 7, 2016Tony Verzura of United Cannabis
Back before there were cannabis dispensaries, as far as most enthusiasts were concerned, there were basically two types: “Schwag” and “kind bud.”
It was the latter that helped a young Tony Verzura get off oxycodone and finally recover from a debilitating car accident. His appetite and sleep returned. The opioid side effects were gone, and eventually, so was the pain.
The experience launched a fascination with cannabis as medicine, which 20 years later, has flowered into one of the nation’s most innovative medical cannabis companies. As Chief Technology Officer for Denver-based United Cannabis, today, Verzura is pushing the boundaries of how cannabis can help patients, while at the same time preparing for a time when medical cannabis will come from a pharmacy, not a dispensary.
Selling out? More like buying in.
“If you want to help a massive amount of people and get it in the mainstream, if you want insurance to cover it, you have to develop products and you have to prepare yourself for that next wave and that’s kind of what we’ve been doing,” said Verzura, 38. “A lot of people misunderstand it and think it’s a sellout of some kind. A sellout would be if I sold out to a big pharmaceutical company, which is not the goal.”
“The goal is to create the technology, to create products and get the products into the hands of patients that need it and God willing we can get insurance to cover it and pay for it.”
Three Grow Lights
It started with a shed and three grow lights.
In 2009, thanks to a loosening of state regulations, Colorado’s medical cannabis industry was booming. Verzura was working as a contractor in post-Katrina New Orleans, when he and some friends decided to head west.
“If you want to help a massive amount of people and get it in the mainstream, if you want insurance to cover it, you have to develop products and you have to prepare yourself for that next wave and that’s kind of what we’ve been doing,”
He’d never stopped using cannabis, micro-dosing during the day for pain and inflammation and smoking at night to relax. Here was a way to put his personal experimentations to work for others. He began compiling data and patient reviews for various medical conditions, from epilepsy to cancer. The cannabinoid sequencing protocols developed at RiverRock Colorado would become the foundation for his work at United Cannabis.
“It was like, how do I take this from a flower into some kind of standardized dosing system?” he said. “The industry was evolving and it was amazing. The more people we could help and the more change we could make, that’s why I got into all this.”
Eventually the dispensary had some 3,000 patients, investors and a 20,000-square-foot greenhouse. But after Colorado approved recreational cannabis in 2012, his partners wanted to expand into that market. So Verzura left and settled in California to start what became United Cannabis.
“It was harder to do in Colorado because they really went into a heavily regulated market and people started growing for profit, rather than the patients, in my opinion,” he said.
Holistic Approach
When a patient walks into Harborside Health Clinic in Oakland, they can get much more than an edible or a jar of medical cannabis.
“The industry was evolving and it was amazing. The more people we could help and the more change we could make, that’s why I got into all this.”
That collective was the first to integrate the A.C.T. Now Program, developed by Verzura and United Cannabis, short for Advanced Cannabinoid Therapy. In this program, patients can get free consultations with a nurse and access to an online portal where they can tailor-make every detail of their treatment. The website is open to anyone anywhere, not just California.
The line of products developed by United Cannabis, Prana Bio Nutrient Medicinals, come in capsule, sublingual and topical forms. There are also five types, several of which won’t get you high—THC:THCa; 3:1 CBD; 1:1 CBD; CBD:CBN; and CBD:CBDa. They’re made organically, with no solvents. Dispensary employees are trained in their use.
It’s a holistic approach to medical cannabis, and Californians are taking note, with some 15,000 enrolled since its inception. Verzura hopes to have the products available in Oregon this summer and in Colorado in the near future, as well as at 10 more California collectives.
For Verzura, it’s an ongoing experiment, as each patient’s experience—once they’ve signed necessary privacy waivers—goes into the ever-growing database of what is working for each condition and what’s not.
The company has filed for a patent for its combination of pharmaceutically active cannabinoids to treat disorders of the immune and nervous systems and cancer. The patent application includes a matrix of cannabis strains rich in CBD and THC, terpene profiles and dosed delivery methods for inactive and active cannabinoids.
Verzura sees this work as moving the industry forward for the benefit of all.
“I hope to make a difference in patients’ lives. I hope to make a difference in our communities and our industry. And I hope to help progress and mature our industry in leading by example in the products and programs we offer.”
Questions Ahead
The year 2016 could be a watershed moment for recreational cannabis, with California and several other states poised to approve adult use.
But that makes Verzura worry about the future of cannabis as medicine. He watched as Colorado’s regulatory system created a tax of 25 percent or more on recreational sales, and worries the concept of medical cannabis could someday be lumped in with recreational, forcing patients to pay high taxes.
He also wonders what a rescheduling of cannabis would mean for patients. It’s currently on Schedule 1, meaning the federal government considers it to have no medical value. If that was changed, would patients be required to get it from a pharmacy like other controlled substances? Would large pharmaceutical companies take over medical cannabis?
For his part, cannabis is and always will be medicine first.
He has since been in two more car accidents and blew his knee out playing softball. He credits quick recoveries to cannabis products. He still maintains a daily regime of treatments, a walking testament to the healing power of this plant.
“I use my capsules and my sublinguals and my topicals every day. I use my CBD topical on my heels, my ankles, my knees, anything that’s swollen. I use my THC roll-on for any kind of nerve pain in my back or neck or for migraines I would get. I use my non active capsules, the 3:1 during the day just to kind of control inflammation and to manage anything else that would come up, kind of preventative.”

News Interview with Tony Verzura: Blue River Terpenes

DOPE: Everyone’s talking about terpenes, and Blue River is the first company offering “terps” purely derived from cannabis. What can you tell us about terpenes?
Tony Verzura: When you look at terpenes themselves, they’re ambiguously found in nature in all things. Hops has a lot of the same terpenes as cannabis. Scientists have noticed that terpenes will either turn on or turn off CB2 receptors in the brain, kind of like how CBD works. The way I explain it is that cannabinoids are the actors and terpenes are the script. Or, it’s the difference between Bob Dylan’s music as a folk singer and Bob Dylan when he cranked up that electric guitar. It’s all music, but the terpenes change the feel, like Spinal Tap turning their amps up to 11. If you think about an old-school equalizer on a stereo, that’s what terpenes are doing, turning up the bass, reducing the treble and so on.
Line of Blue River Pure Cannabis Terpenes
DOPE: The incredible flavor of your terpenes is widely acknowledged, but they certainly aren’t cheap. Which are your favorites, and what do you say to people who complain about the price tag?
Verzura: Jack Frost produces some amazing terpenes that almost turn into a cologne. The Lemon Pie was so screaming loud that it seemed almost artificial to me. Sour Tangie is also that way. People are always saying, “Oh, that can’t be from cannabis.”
The price comes down to two things. The terpene content is based on the trichome, the size of the head, and the genetics. I extract from flowers. So, show me a flower that has more than three percent terpenes and I can offer a better price. I use whole buds, and the price of flower fluctuates. So, if I get a pound of Lemon Tree, I’ll get a really good yield but it’s also really expensive. It might even be $15 or $20 per drop, when we’re trying to keep it around $10 per drop. The best source material we’ve found in terms of balancing cost and quality is really high-quality outdoor cannabis.
DOPE: You’re also behind the Prana line of bio medicinal capsules, sublingual drops, and topicals. What was your inspiration for Prana?
Verzura: The word prana is sanskrit for “universal breath,” and I felt like we needed to create a medicine that was a part of us spiritually. Something that we could work with physically in our bodies to be more rooted in nature. Wellness — and the spiritual connection we all have from using cannabis — needs to be emphasized.
We offer four different Prana formulations that combine varying ratios of THC and CBD — in both activated and non-activated forms — along with CBN. We also use arnica, juniper berry, lavender, eucalyptus, and Roman chamomile. It’s all essential oil-based. The other ingredients I start with are rosin and plant fats, often almond oil.
Through our Advanced Cannabis Therapies program, called ACT Now, Prana offers free nursing support if you have cancer, epilepsy, autism, dependency, or special needs. And that’s built into the price of these products, for free. You can go to a HIPA-compliant electronic health records service with your own nurse, and we’re going to help you out and build a program for you. It makes it easy to track patient data, so if something works we know about it, and if something doesn’t work we have a way to fix it.
Pure Terpenes
DOPE: What can you tell us about some of the other projects you’re working on?
Verzura: Behind all of the work that I do is a question: How do I get the most use out of this plant while creating the medicine? Bubbleman is the one who said to me, “You know what you should do? You should be focusing your energy on terpenes. Figure out how to get the terpenes out of the plant without chemicals.” If you can preserve the terpenes, then take out the full spectrum of cannabinoids and put them back together later, you can create incredibly powerful medicine.
With that in mind, I’m proud to announce that Bubbleman has signed on with United Cannabis to be his U.S. brand ambassador. We’ve already started producing Bubbleman medicine in Colorado and California, and we’re also hopefully going to be in Oregon and Washington. For the Bubbleman brand, anything that’s full melt, rosin, dry sift, terp rosin, combinations of terpenes with hash, solventless sap. I’m supposed to find the best place to start, find the best farmers who want to supply materials for his brand, and put it all together. All of this has already started happening at Harborside.
What I think I’m going to create next is a pairing chart, like they have with food and wine. We’re trying to get the flower, the concentrate, the terpenes — the whole product line made from a single strain. That’s what 2016 is going to be about: showcasing the genetics and the grower. All the rest of the products come out amazing when the flowers are grown right. Quality in, quality out. If you grew great resin, it’s going to make a great extract.
