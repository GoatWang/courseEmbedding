Shawn P. O'Grady
                                
                            
Senior Vice President, Global Revenue Management; Group President, Convenience Stores & Foodservice




Education
Notre Dame, bachelor's degree, chemical engineering Harvard Business School, MBA, 1990


Shawn O'Grady leads our Convenience Stores and Foodservice organization, which focuses on serving the needs of convenience store operators and foodservice providers, including schools, universities and hospitals primarily in the U.S. and Canada. 
In addition, O'Grady oversees our global revenue management group, which is focused on advancing our e-commerce partnerships and increasing our capabilities in strategic revenue management around the world. 
He previously led the function responsible for all U.S. retail sales of General Mills consumer foods products. 


In that role, his organization focused on leading profitable growth by creating differentiated customer solutions for both grocery and channel customers. His team’s responsibilities included in-store execution, trade funding strategy and the development and deployment of industry-leading sales capabilities.
He was named to that position in May 2010. 
O’Grady joined General Mills in the marketing organization in July 1990. 
O'Grady has held positions across the Snacks, Meals and Big G cereal divisions. Most noteworthy was his work on Wheaties, which he led during the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. 
He was promoted to vice president in 1998, and concurrent with the General Mills acquisition of The Pillsbury Company in 2001, took the helm of the Refrigerated Baked Goods business.
Late in 2004, O’Grady joined General Mills’ Consumer Foods Sales division, progressing to his most recent role as president of the Sales division with responsibility for all grocery customers.
