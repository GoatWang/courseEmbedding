July 14, 2016 03:10 PM Eastern Daylight Time



RYE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Gabelli Funds, LLC announces the initial public offering of The Gabelli 
      Go Anywhere Trust (the “Fund”), a newly organized, non-diversified, 
      closed-end management investment company.
    

      A team of portfolio managers at Gabelli Funds led by Mario J. Gabelli 
      will manage The Gabelli Go Anywhere Trust.
    

      The Fund’s primary investment objective is total return, consisting of 
      capital appreciation and current income. Under normal market conditions, 
      the Fund intends to invest in a broad range of equity securities 
      consisting of common stock, preferred stock, convertible or exchangeable 
      securities, common and preferred equity securities issued by other 
      closed-end management investment companies, and, to a lesser extent, in 
      debt securities.
    

      The Fund is offering common and preferred shares. Shareholders will be 
      offered to purchase a “Combination” consisting of 3 common shares and 1 
      Series A Cumulative Puttable and Callable Preferred Share (the “Series A 
      Preferred Shares”). The Combinations will initially trade on the New 
      York Stock Exchange or NYSE MKT for 60 days; thereafter separate trading 
      for the common shares and Series A Preferred Shares will commence and 
      the Combinations will be delisted.
    

      The Fund’s common shares and Series A Preferred Shares are being offered 
      to the public at $100 per Combination (equating to three common shares 
      at $20 per share, and one Series A Preferred Share at $40 per share). 
      G.research, LLC, an affiliate of Gabelli Funds, is underwriting the 
      Fund’s initial public offering on a best efforts basis.
    

      Gabelli Funds, LLC and/or its control affiliates may purchase up to the 
      greater of $20,000,000 in Combinations, or 20% of the total number of 
      Combinations.
    

The information herein is not complete and is subject to change. This 
      notice is not an offer to sell these securities and is not soliciting an 
      offer to buy these securities in any jurisdiction where the offer or 
      sale is not permitted. This notice is not an offering, which can only be 
      made by a prospectus. Investors should carefully consider the Fund’s 
      investment objective, risks, charges and expenses before investing. The 
      prospectus contains this and other information about the Fund and the 
      offering, and should be read carefully before investing. To obtain a 
      prospectus, please call 800-GABELLI or visit www.gabelli.com.


      The Fund must sell at least 500,000 Combinations in order to close its 
      initial public offering; the maximum number of Combinations the Fund may 
      sell is 2,000,000. The Fund’s offering period expires on August 23, 2016 
      and is subject to up to two extensions of up to ten days each. The 
      Fund’s Declaration of Trust provides that not later than 30 days prior 
      to the fifth anniversary of the closing date of its initial public 
      offering, the Fund will commence a cash tender offer for any and all of 
      the common shares at a price per common share not less than 95% of the 
      net asset value per common share.
    

      Closed-end funds involve risk for investors. Closed-end funds are traded 
      on the secondary market through a stock exchange. A closed-end fund’s 
      investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that an 
      investor’s shares may be worth more or less than the original cost. 
      Shares of closed-end funds may trade above (premium) or below (discount) 
      the net asset value (NAV) of the fund’s portfolio. The distribution 
      rate on the Series A Preferred Shares is based on the $40 liquidation 
      preference; therefore the 8% distribution rate for the Series A 
      Preferred Shares during the Fund’s first year of operations represents 
      3.2% of a shareholder’s total Combination investment. Additionally, the 
      Fund might not pay periodic distributions to common shareholders during 
      the Fund’s first year of operations. Payment of distributions is not 
      assured and is made only when declared by the Fund’s Board of Trustees. 
      A portion of any planned distributions may be a return of capital, which 
      may have the effect of increasing the Fund’s leverage ratio. The 
      distributions that include a return of capital should not be considered 
      as dividend yield nor as part of the total return of an investment in 
      the Fund.
    

      The market price for a closed-end fund is based on supply and demand 
      which fluctuates daily based on many factors, such as economic 
      conditions and global events, investor sentiment, and security specific 
      factors. The possibility of a market decline should be considered market 
      risk. There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment 
      objective and you can lose money by investing in a closed-end fund. Past 
      performance does not guarantee future results.


      The use of leverage, which can be described as exposure to changes in 
      price at a ratio greater than the amount of equity invested, through the 
      issuance of preferred shares, magnifies both the favorable and 
      unfavorable effects of price movements in the investments made by the 
      Fund. The Fund’s use of leverage in its investment operations subjects 
      it to substantial risk of loss.

Gabelli Go Anywhere Trust Initial Public Offering






Business Wire




Jul 7, 2015 4:10 PM EDT













 




























































  Gabelli Funds, LLC is pleased to announce the initial public offering of The Gabelli Go Anywhere Trust (the "Fund"), a newly organized, non-diversified, closed-end management investment company.  Mario J. Gabelli, along with a team of portfolio managers at Gabelli Funds will be managing The Gabelli Go Anywhere Trust.  The Fund's primary investment objective is total return, consisting of capital appreciation and current income. Under normal market conditions, the Fund intends to invest primarily in a broad range of equity securities consisting of common stock, preferred stock, convertible or exchangeable securities, and, to a lesser extent, in debt securities.  The Fund may also invest up to 40% of its total assets in common and preferred equity securities issued by other closed-end management investment companies.  The Fund is offering a combination of both common and preferred shares which are anticipated to trade on the New York Stock Exchange or NYSE MKT. Shareholders will be required to purchase a "Combination" of 3 common shares and 1 Series A Cumulative Puttable and Callable Preferred Shares (the "Series A Preferred Shares").  The Combination is being offered at $100 per share (equating to three common shares at $20 per share plus $40 (liquidation preference) for one Series A Preferred Share).  The Fund will trade as a Combination for 60 days; thereafter separate trading for the common shares and Series A Preferred Shares will commence and the Combination will be delisted.  The lead underwriter of the offering is G.research, LLC.  It is anticipated that Gabelli Funds, LLC or its affiliates will participate in the offering.  The information herein is not complete and is subject to change. This document is not an offer to sell these securities and is not soliciting an offer to buy these securities in any jurisdiction where the offer or sale is not permitted. This document is not an offering, which can only be made by a prospectus. Investors should carefully consider the Fund's investment objective, risks, charges and expenses before investing. The prospectus contains this and other information about the offering, and should be read carefully before investing. To obtain a prospectus, please call 800-GABELLI or visit  www.gabelli.com .  Closed-end funds involve risk for investors. Closed-end funds are traded on the secondary market through a stock exchange. The closed-end fund's investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that an investor's shares may be worth more or less than the original cost. Shares of closed-end funds may trade above (a premium) or below (a discount) the net asset value (NAV) of the fund's portfolio. The distribution rate of the preferred shares is based on the $40 liquidation preference. Payment of distributions is not assured and is made only when declared by the Fund's Board of Trustees. A portion of any planned distributions may be a return of capital, which may have the effect of increasing the Fund's existing leverage. The distributions that include a return of capital should not be considered as dividend yield nor as part of the total return of an investment in the Fund.
