Carnage in Closed End Municipal Bond Funds Real Money Pro($)



By Doug Kass


         |  Nov 10, 2016         |  3:08 PM EST      


       
   Blackrock Municipal 2030 Target Term Trust (BTT) 
   
   
   BlackRock Municipal Income Trust II (BLE) 
   
   
   Eaton Vance Municipal Income 2028 Term Trust (ETX) 
   
   
   Invesco California Value Municipal Income Trust (VCV) 
   
   
   Invesco Pennsylvania Value Municipal Income Trust (VPV) 
   
   
   Nuveen Premium Income Municipal Fund (NPI) 
   
  All were down about 1% at last check, while the iShares S&P National AMT-Free Municipal Bond Fund (MUB) is virtually flat. 
  The junk-bond market is also lower, and -- like municipals -- isn't following Treasuries' climb higher. 
  
  
  
   Position: Short TLT
    
   
  
 

 *************************************************************************
 

  
  As I have recently written, when this asset class turns it is violent.
 

  
 

 When we purchased these funds in December 2013 (with little liquidity) the funds sold down on large volume as retail investors took losses against stock gains.
 

  
 

 Now the movie is being repeated -- again near yearend.
 

  
 

 Just take a look at the outsized losses in the following funds:
 

  
 

 As I have suggested, I would known own closed end municipal bond funds. 
 BlackRock Inv. Quality Munic. Trust 
 (BKN)  down 3%, 
 Bitterroot Resources 
 (BTT) down 3.5%, 
 Invesco Pennsylvania Value Mncpl Incm Tr 
 (VPV) down 3% and 
 Nuveen Dividend Advantage Municipal Fund 
 (NAD) down 2.5%.
 

  
 

 Avoid this asset class.
    



My Takeaways and Observations Real Money Pro($)



By Doug Kass


         |  Oct 17, 2016         |  5:21 PM EDT      


       
 The U.S. dollar weakened. 
 
 
 The price of crude oil declined by four bits to $49.86. 
 
 
 Gold flatlined. 
 
 
 Ag commodities rallied: wheat up $0.02, corn up $0.01, soybeans up $0.16 and oats up $0.02. 
 
 
 Lumber fell an outsized $9 and closed at a multi-week low. Peak housing? 
 
 
 Bonds rallied (I covered a large portion of my bond short early in the day). Yields fell by two to three basis points The 10-year U.S. note yield fell below 1.77% -- though Tepper was quite bearish on bonds. 
 
 
 The 2s/10s spread was flat at 95 basis points. 
 
 
 Municipals were actually slightly higher in price, but that didn't keep closed-end municipal bond funds from getting schmeissed. the lack of liquidity in that asset class was a subject I wrote about midday. Look at BlackRock Inv. Quality Munic. Trust (BKN) , Invesco Pennsylvania Value Mncpl Incm Tr (VPV) , Etrion (ETX) , BlackRock Municipal Income Trust II (BLE) (more declines of 1.5% to 3%) after a similar drop on Friday! This is supposed to be a conservative asset class, but these funds have lost nearly their annual dividend yields in two days! 
 
 
 Junk bonds were slightly weaker but, again, Blackstone/GSO Strategic Credit Fund (BGB) had an outsized decline. 
 
 
 Stay far from both closed end municipal bond funds and BGB. 
 
 
 Banks were disappointing for the second day in a row. I have expressed my views here. Short JPMorgan Chase (JPM) , Citigroup (C) and Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLF is my Trade of the Week -- down a dime from my cost on the day). See Jim's good columns on sector below. 
 
 
 Surprising executive departure at Visa causes price weakness. 
 
 
 Insurance was unchanged to lower but brokerages got hit after Friday's strength. 
 
 
 Old tech was uneventful. IBM (IBM) down $1 after a slight beat. 
 
 
 Retail was a conspicuous market blemish across the board weakness. Home Depot (HD) , Lowe's (LOW)  , Macy's (M) and Nordstrom (JWN) featured losers. 
 
 
 Biotech after a very weak Friday. Valeant Pharmaceuticals Intl (VRX) (Ackman) new low, Allergan (AGN)  down $4, but Celgene (CELG)  up $1. 
 
 
 Big pharma down small. 
 
 
 Consumer staples weakened. Core short, Coca-Cola (KO) , a new low. 
 
 
 Autos lower -- Ford at another low. 
 
 
 Ag equipment down modestly. 
 
 
 (T)FANG mixed. Netflix (NFLX) up big on a nice beat (I remain small short the name) Amazon (AMZN) and Tesla (TSLA) lower.

We're Seeing a Generational Low in U.S. and Global Bond Yields   Real Money Pro($)



By Doug Kass


         |  Jul 12, 2016         |  2:41 PM EDT      


       
 Weak Auction: Today's auction features were horrible, the sort of a weak reception one would expect at an interest rate low. 
 Strength in Financial Stocks: The rally in bank stocks, a sector that typically trades inversely with bond prices, has been impressive since last Monday. 
 Municipal Bond Fund Prices Are Collapsing Today: After outperforming since December 2013, closed-end municipal bond funds appear to be finally rolling over. The declines are broad-based, with several funds -- for example, Invesco Pennsylvania Value Municipal Income Trust (VPV) and Eaton Vance Municipal Income 2028 Term Trust (ETX) are down by almost 2% today. 
 A Bullish Sentiment Extreme in Bonds: An unscientific sampling of talking heads in the business media counts 14 bond bulls and zero bond bears in the last four trading days. There is a building and near-unanimous view that rates will not rise for years, which is in marked contrast to months ago when the consensus was for higher rates. In other words, just as the generational low in equities was realized in March 2009 when sentiment was at a bearish extreme, the current investor sentiment in bonds is at a bullish extreme. 
 Current Yields Imply Slower Growth Than Is Likely: As I recently documented when I placed short iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT) on my Best Ideas List,  the 10-year U.S. note yield of 1.35% late last week implied a nominal U.S. GDP growth rate of slightly less than 2%. In light of the fact that the implied inflation rate according to Tips is about 1.5%, this means that annual real GDP was implied/expected by the fixed-income market to average below 0.5% growth going forward. This is an unlikely expectation. 
 Breakevens Are Climbing: According to my buddy/friend/pal The Lindsey Group's Peter Boockvar, the 10-year breakeven is up by 3.5 basis points today to 1.49%. The figure was as low as 1.37% post-Brexit and was under 1.20% in Feburary. The five-year breakeven is up by almost five basis points to 1.47% today. The Brexit low was 1.28% and the February low was 0.95%. 
 Japan Reflation Policy: A large Japanese fiscal stimulus package would be an acknowledgment that the Bank of Japan is running out of existing bonds to buy and if it starts direct monetization of any new fiscal stimulus plan, this has the potential to finally be inflationary for Japan. 
 The Flight to Safety Is At Its Extreme: Concern with the state of the Italian banking system and growth worries in Europe after the Brexit vote has led to another (and possibly final) panic into European bonds. Though Europe's growth prospects are still uncertain, Italy and the eurozone may be close to an agreement. A temporary resolution of the Italian banking crisis could quickly reverse "the flight to safety" and pierce the bubble in European bonds, which have acted as a depressant on U.S. bond yields. 
 
I recently shorted TLT and placed TLT short on my Best Ideas List.     



My Latest Strategy Real Money Pro($)

      Here's a rundown of my latest moves:    



I Still Like Closed-End Muni Funds Real Money Pro($)



By Doug Kass


         |  Jun 30, 2015         |  11:22 AM EDT      


      
Fears of rising interest rates.


Fears of a Puerto Rican default.


Concerns regarding the ability of other state jurisdictions to pay interest on their bonds.
    



I'm Out of BTT Real Money Pro($)



By Doug Kass


         |  Jun 15, 2015         |  4:19 PM EDT      


      BlackRock Municipal Target Term (BTT), a closed-end bond fund, was featured in Barron's over the weekend.    



Selling Some Oaktree Real Money Pro($)



By Doug Kass


         |  Jun 10, 2015         |  2:01 PM EDT      


      I am selling some more Oaktree (OAK) but keeping my large money center and regional bank holdings intact. On the bank group, the yield curve continues to steepen more quickly than I had expected, raising the proximity of an expansion in net interest margins and income for the sector.

Today's Takeaways and Observations Real Money Pro($)



By Doug Kass


         |  Jun 01, 2015         |  3:17 PM EDT      


      
Down, Up, Down, Up...The U.S. stock market is trendless with no memory from day to day. Some on our site (e.g., Rev Shark) and elsewhere believe shorting is an "exercise in futility." I say, respectfully, that this is a wonderful two-way market in which money is to be made on both the long and short side. I further have opined that the market might be in a transition from bull market to something else this year (we will see whether that forecast is correct over the next few months!).
And So Is the Bond Market Trendless -- though we seem to be in a 2.10%-2.30% range on the 10-year U.S. Note yield, for now.
Banks Continue to Be Among the Leaders -- This is my favorite sector on a reward vs. risk basis.
The Spread Between Taxable and Non Taxable Yields Narrowed Today -- I posted on the possibility of a narrowing last week and, again, today. Muni bond funds are flourishing despite a near $2 drop in TLT (and rise in rates; the 10-year yield has increased by 5 basis points to 2.18%).
Takeover Activity Continues -- As I pointed out about the proposed Broadcom (BRCM) merger, the deals no longer make much economic sense at around 20x EBITDA. This sort of valuation in mergers is symptomatic of an aging bull market -- and perhaps an aging economic recovery.

 Risk & Other Considerations
			 


				Fund characteristics are subject to change daily. Provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell the securities mentioned or securities in the sectors shown above. Credit quality and credit allocation are shown as a percentage of total net assets. Sectors are shown as a percentage of long-term investments. Securities are classified by sectors that represent broad groupings of related industries. Credit quality allocations based upon ratings as issued by Standard and Poor's and Moody's, respectively.

This data is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended for trading or selling purposes. Closed end funds, unlike open end funds, are not continuously offered. There is a one time public offering and once issued, shares of closed end funds are sold in the open market.

There is no assurance that a closed end fund will achieve its investment objective. Like any stock, a closed end fund's share price will fluctuate with market conditions and other factors. At the time of sale, your shares may have a market price that is above or below net asset value, and may be worth more or less than your original investment. Accordingly, it is possible to lose money investing in the Trust.

These funds are subject to credit and interest-rate risk. Credit risk refers to the ability of an issuer to make timely payments of interest and principal. Investments in securities rated below investment grade present greater risk of loss to principal and interest than investment in higher-quality securities. Interest-rate risk refers to fluctuations in the value of a fixed-income security resulting from changes in the general level of interest rates. In a declining interest-rate environment, the portfolio may generate less income. In a rising interest-rate environment, bond prices fall. Should the funds employ leverage, the portfolios may experience increased volatility.

 Risk & Other Considerations
			 


				Fund characteristics are subject to change daily. Provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell the securities mentioned or securities in the sectors shown above. Credit quality and credit allocation are shown as a percentage of total net assets. Sectors are shown as a percentage of long-term investments. Securities are classified by sectors that represent broad groupings of related industries. Credit quality allocations based upon ratings as issued by Standard and Poor's and Moody's, respectively.

This data is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended for trading or selling purposes. Closed end funds, unlike open end funds, are not continuously offered. There is a one time public offering and once issued, shares of closed end funds are sold in the open market.

There is no assurance that a closed end fund will achieve its investment objective. Like any stock, a closed end fund's share price will fluctuate with market conditions and other factors. At the time of sale, your shares may have a market price that is above or below net asset value, and may be worth more or less than your original investment. Accordingly, it is possible to lose money investing in the Trust.

These funds are subject to credit and interest-rate risk. Credit risk refers to the ability of an issuer to make timely payments of interest and principal. Investments in securities rated below investment grade present greater risk of loss to principal and interest than investment in higher-quality securities. Interest-rate risk refers to fluctuations in the value of a fixed-income security resulting from changes in the general level of interest rates. In a declining interest-rate environment, the portfolio may generate less income. In a rising interest-rate environment, bond prices fall. Should the funds employ leverage, the portfolios may experience increased volatility.
