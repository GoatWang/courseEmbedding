HSBC Global Asset Management is the marketing name for the asset management businesses of HSBC Holdings Plc. HSBC Global Asset Management (USA) Inc. is an investment adviser registered with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. HSBC Global Asset Management (USA) Inc. serves as the investment adviser to the HSBC Funds. Foreside Distribution Services, L.P., member FINRA, is the distributor of the HSBC Funds and is not affiliated with the adviser. HSBC Securities (USA) Inc., member NYSE, FINRA and SIPC, is a sub-distributor of the HSBC Funds. Affiliates of HSBC Global Asset Management (USA) Inc. may receive fees for providing various services to the funds.

Risk Considerations: 
Past performance is no guarantee of future results. There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective or will work under all market conditions. The value of investments may go down as well as up and you may not get back the amount originally invested. Portfolios may be subject to certain additional risks, which should be considered carefully along with their investment objectives and fees. Equity investments fluctuate in value based on changes to an individual company’s financial condition and overall market conditions. Investments in foreign markets involve risks such as currency rate fluctuations, potential differences in accounting and taxation policies, as well as possible political, economic, and market risks. These risks are heightened for investments in emerging markets which are also subject to greater illiquidity and volatility than developed foreign markets. Frontier markets generally have smaller economies or less developed capital markets than traditional emerging markets, and therefore investing in frontier markets can magnify the risks of investing in emerging markets. Fixed income is subject to credit and interest rate risk. Credit risk refers to the ability of an issuer to make timely payments of interest and principal. Interest rate risk refers to fluctuations in the value of a fixed income security that result from changes in the general level of interest rates. In a declining interest rate environment, a portfolio may generate less income. In a rising interest-rate environment, bond prices fall. Investments in high yield securities (commonly referred to as “junk bonds”) are often considered speculative investments and have significantly higher credit risk than investment grade securities. The prices of high yield securities, which may be less liquid than higher rated securities, may be more volatile and more vulnerable to adverse market, economic or political conditions. Risk is inherent in all investing. You could lose money by investing in the Money Market Fund (‘MM Fund’). Although the MM Fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the MM Fund is not a deposit of HSBC Bank USA, N.A. and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The MM Fund's sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the MM Fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the MM Fund at any time. For complete risk considerations, please refer to the fund's prospectus.

Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses of the investment company carefully before investing. The prospectus contains this and other important information about the investment company and the mutual fund. For clients of HSBC Securities (USA) Inc., please call 1-888-525-5757 for more information. For other investors and prospective investors, please call the Funds directly at 1-800-782-8183. You can download the fund prospectus from this site.  Investors should read the prospectus carefully before investing or sending money.
US persons (both entities and individuals) are subject to US taxation on their worldwide income and may be subject to tax and other filing obligations with respect to their US and non-US accounts. The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) is a US law designed to prevent the use of non-US accounts or non-US entities to avoid US taxation of income and assets. To meet this objective, FATCA imposes on US and non-US entities certain documentation, due diligence, withholding and reporting requirements with respect to accounts and certain payments. Investors should consult their independent tax advisors about investment tax implications.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
