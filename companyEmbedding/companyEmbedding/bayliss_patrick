	Patrick Bayliss Joins Umphrey’s McGee in Portland

 Last night in Portland as Umphrey’s McGee closed out a two-night run at the Crystal Ballroom and got some help on a Pixies cover from Patrick Bayliss, younger brother of Brendan Bayliss. Patrick took over vocals for the group on “Where Is My Mind?” late in the second set. 
Additional highlights included a “Bright Lights Big City” that featured the popular “Cigarette Cables” lyrical Jimmy Stewart along with the rarely played “Mantis Ghetts.” In the encore, the band broke out their mashup of Radiohead’s “National Anthem,” Beck’s “Loser” and Phil Collins “In the Air Tonight” for the first time since it debuted at the group’s Halloween show in Boston last year. Watch the debut performance above. 
Here’s a look at the setlist as it appears in our Box Scores section:
Umphrey’s McGee
Crystal Ballroom Portland, OR
Set I: Gurgle > Cut the Cable, Wappy Sprayberry > Mail Package, Resolution > Final Word, Educated Guess, 40’s Theme
Set II: Bright Lights, Big City*, Mantis Ghetts, Mantis > Comma Later, Hurt Bird Bath, Where Is My Mind?^, Sociable Jimmy > Mantis
Enc: National Loser Anthem, Tonight
Notes: *“Jimmy Stewart” with lyrics ^with Patrick Bayliss on vocals
