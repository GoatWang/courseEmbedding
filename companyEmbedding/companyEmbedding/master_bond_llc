UV Adhesives







High performance one part, no mix UV curable adhesives feature rapid cure speeds, high bond strength and easy application. A wide range of formulations are available to meet specific application requirements.
High, medium, low viscosity formulations contain a UV light source at the proper wavelength/intensity. These adhesives are not oxygen inhibited and require no heat to cure. They are ideal for bonding heat sensitive substrates. Master Bond UV cure adhesives eliminate the need for measuring, mixing, pot life issues, ovens and minimize waste. These highly reliable adhesives can be applied manually/automatically and reduce labor costs, regulatory expenses, energy/electricity while shortening cycle times. They have proven cost effective as an alternative to other joining methods. 
UV adhesives are used extensively for precise positioning/alignment of parts. Compounds can be employed for structural or temporary bonding. Master Bond UV cure adhesives bond well to similar/dissimilar substrates including metals, rubbers, glass, ceramics, plastics such as polycarbonates, acrylics, phenolics. Specific grades offer optical clarity/translucency, dimensional stability, low shrinkage, resistance to chemicals,
 fuels, solvents, moisture. Products provide protection from environmental degradation from outdoor weathering to meet rigorous end user requirements.
New Developments in UV Curable Adhesive Systems
Extensive research and development has resulted in new formulations with enhanced properties. The most noteworthy are:

USP Class VI approved compounds
NASA low outgassing grades
Nanosilica filled systems

Master Bond ultraviolet curable systems are presently employed in the automotive, electronic, medical, optical, electro-optical, appliance, fiber-optic and general assembly applications.

Product Description
Master Bond EP21LV is a two component, low viscosity epoxy resin system for high performance bonding, sealing, coating,  encapsulation and casting. It is formulated to cure readily at room temperature or more quickly at elevated temperatures. It has a very forgiving one to one mix ratio by weight or volume. In fact, EP21LV has the unusual characteristic of being able to adjust the properties of the cured system by altering the mix ratio. Adding more of Part A (e.g. a two to one mix ratio) gives a more rigid cure, for enhanced machinability. While adding more of Part B (e.g. a one to two mix ratio) gives a more forgiving cure, for greater impact resistance. EP21LV produces high strength, durable bonds which hold up well to thermal cycling and resists many chemicals including water, oils, fuels, acids, bases and salts. It is serviceable over the wide temperature range of -65°F to +250°F. It bonds well to a variety of substrates including metals, glass, ceramics, wood, rubbers and many plastics. Once cured, EP21LV is an outstanding electrical insulator. This, coupled with its low viscosity, makes it an excellent encapsulating and potting epoxy. It meets FDA requirements for indirect food contact. EP21LV contains no solvents or diluents. While the standard color of the cured material is amber-clear, a wide variety of additional color choices are also available. 
Product Citation
EP21LV, along with EP30Med and EP42HT-2 were cited in a report titled "Implementation of Biomaterials for the Encapsulation of Sensors" by Dabbs, Holmes, Kesler and Schaefer at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. For more information click here.
