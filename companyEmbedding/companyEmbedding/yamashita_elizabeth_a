Peer Review Committees

	Experts and advocates in the field of cancer research, product development and cancer prevention are provisionally appointed to the peer review committees by CPRIT’s Chief Executive Officer and approved by the Oversight Committee. To minimize the potential for conflicts of interest in the review process, all research and prevention peer reviewers live and work outside of the state. Peer review members are assigned to panels in their area of expertise. At least one advocate reviewer is assigned to each panel.

	The review of all research, product development and prevention proposals are led by the Scientific Review Council, the Product Development Review Council and the Prevention Review Council.

	Reviewers are divided into three groups: product development reviewers, prevention reviewers and research reviewers.
