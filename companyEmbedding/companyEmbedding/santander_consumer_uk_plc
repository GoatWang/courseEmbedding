Santander UK plc is a British bank, wholly owned by the Spanish Santander Group. Santander UK plc manages its affairs autonomously, with its own local management team, responsible solely for its performance. Santander UK is one of the UK's leading personal financial services companies and one of the largest providers of mortgages and savings in the UK. The bank has circa 20,000 employees, 14 million active customers, with almost 1,010 branches and 50 corporate business centres.
The bank, with its head office in the London Borough of Camden,[2][3] was established on 11 January 2010 when Abbey National plc was combined with the savings business and branches of Bradford & Bingley plc, and renamed Santander UK plc. Alliance & Leicester plc merged into the renamed business in May 2010.
Between 2007 and 2010, Santander was ranked as worst bank for customer service in the J. D. Power UK Retail Banking Satisfaction Study. However, its '123' product range was ranked third best in the UK in 2013 and in a moneysavingexpert.com poll in 2014 customers ranked their satisfaction higher than with any of other main high street banks.[4][5][6]
In October 2011, Moody's downgraded the credit rating of 12 UK financial firms including Santander UK, blaming financial weakness.[7] In June 2012, Moody rated Santander UK as being in a more financially healthy position than its parent company, Banco Santander. Less than 1% of Santander UK's business is held abroad.[8]

History[edit]
Establishment[edit]




Santander UK head office, Triton Square, London


The bank has its origins in three constituent companies—Abbey National, Alliance & Leicester and Bradford & Bingley—all former mutual building societies. Abbey National, trading as Abbey, had been bought by the Santander Group in 2004 for £9 billion. Santander purchased Alliance & Leicester in mid-September 2008,[9] followed by the branches and savings business of Bradford & Bingley which had been nationalised by HM Government during the 2008 banking crisis.[10]
Abbey National and the savings business and branches of Bradford & Bingley were rebranded as Santander on 11 January 2010, and Abbey National plc was renamed Santander UK plc. Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton unveiled the first rebranded Santander branch that day in central London. A further 300 Abbey and Bradford & Bingley branches in London and south east England were rebranded that day, with branches in the rest of the UK following by the end of the month, by which time there were 1,045 Santander branches.[11] Alliance & Leicester plc merged into the bank on 28 May 2010,[12] and was rebranded by the end of the year.[13]
The bank retained the London headquarters of Abbey National and renamed other regional buildings under its own name.[14] The Abbey name was retained initially for Abbey International (now Santander Private Banking), and Abbey for Intermediaries (now Santander for Intermediaries), the division of the bank offering Abbey branded mortgages provided by Santander UK plc.[15] The charitable divisions of Abbey, Bradford & Bingley and Alliance & Leicester were brought together to form the Santander Foundation.[16]




A rebranded branch of Santander in Peterborough


Due to the three-way merger, Santander was in the unusual position of having more than one branch in many British high streets. In Northumerland Street, Newcastle upon Tyne, for example, there were three branches, which were formerly Abbey, Alliance & Leicester and Bradford & Bingley respectively. Plymouth city centre had four branches within 300 metres, two of which were adjacent to each other. In 2012, the bank began to reduce the number of duplicate branches, identifying 56 that would close. Staff in the branches selected for closure were moved to other nearby branches.[17]
Alliance & Leicester Commercial Bank merged into Santander's business banking division, Santander Corporate Banking, in 2009.[18]
Recent years[edit]
On 9 March 2010, Santander sold the investment and asset management business James Hay to IFG Group for £35 million.[19] Later in the year, it was confirmed on 4 August that Santander would purchase the branches of The Royal Bank of Scotland in England and Wales, and the branches of NatWest in Scotland as part of a divestment of the business by The Royal Bank of Scotland Group.[20] The deal collapsed on 12 October 2012.[21]
Santander has frequently been rated the worst bank in the UK for customer service,[22] although by July 2011 had sought to improve, notably by returning call centre operations to the UK from India.[23] During 2011 the bank put aside £538m to cover claims from customers for the misselling of payment protection insurance (PPI), as did many other UK banks.[24]
In December 2012, Santander reached an agreement to sell its store card business, which includes branded cards issued for retailers including Topshop, House of Fraser and Debenhams, to SAV Credit.[25] The sale was completed on 13 May 2013, though Santander continued to service accounts on behalf of SAV Credit until 1 April 2014.[26]
During 2014, the bank considered an initial public offering (IPO), expected to be completed within two years.[27] In November 2014, the chief executive of the Santander Group admitted that an IPO would not be forthcoming until market conditions improved.[28] This view was repeated in July 2015.[29]
Services[edit]




A branch of Santander on Briggate, Leeds


The bank provides a full range of personal, business and corporate accounts, including current accounts, mortgages, credit products and savings and investments. Santander operate online banking services, including mobile apps, and operate an internet-only banking division branded Cahoot. Mortgages are also provided through Santander for Intermediaries, a division of the bank used by brokers.
Santander's Corporate and Commercial Banking division operates from a number of regional business banking centres across the UK. In May 2013, Ana Botin announced plans to double the number of centres to 70 within three years.[30]
Santander UK is authorised by the Prudential Regulation Authority and regulated by both the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority.[31] It is a member of the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, UK Payments Administration, Bankers' Automated Clearing Services (BACS), the Faster Payments Service, the Clearing House Automated Payment System (CHAPS), the Cheque and Credit Clearing Company, the British Bankers' Association[32] and subscribes to the Lending Code.[33]
The bank operates a branch on the Isle of Man, which is licensed by the Financial Supervision Commission.[31] Santander's offshore private banking subsidiary Santander Private Banking operates in Jersey.
Six-digit account sort codes are used in the range between 09-00-xx to 09-19-xx. Sort codes for accounts formerly held by Alliance & Leicester use the range 09-01-31 to 09-01-36.
In 2009 Santander launched the UK's first current account without fees (including unauthorised overdrafts) for its current and future mortgage customers.[34] Customers are not charged fees for using Santander's automated teller machines in Spain, which traditionally would incur fees for transactions in a foreign currency.[35]
Sponsorships[edit]




Santander-branded bicycles in London


Santander has sponsored the McLaren Formula One team since 2007,[36] and is also the title sponsor of the British Grand Prix. Santander said its sponsorship of McLaren had raised its brand awareness in the UK from 20 to 82 percent.[37] The bank announced a second team sponsorship, with Scuderia Ferrari, in 2009.[38]
Golfer Rory McIlroy signed a sponsorship agreement with the bank in September 2011,[39] and in 2013 it was announced that British athlete Jessica Ennis-Hill would become a brand ambassador.
In February 2015, Santander was announced as the new sponsor of Transport for London's bicycle hire scheme, branded as Santander Cycles. Santander replaced Barclays as title sponsor.[40]

Santander UK plc is a British bank, wholly owned by the Spanish Santander Group. Santander UK plc manages its affairs autonomously, with its own local management team, responsible solely for its performance. Santander UK is one of the UK's leading personal financial services companies and one of the largest providers of mortgages and savings in the UK. The bank has circa 20,000 employees, 14 million active customers, with almost 1,010 branches and 50 corporate business centres.
The bank, with its head office in the London Borough of Camden,[2][3] was established on 11 January 2010 when Abbey National plc was combined with the savings business and branches of Bradford & Bingley plc, and renamed Santander UK plc. Alliance & Leicester plc merged into the renamed business in May 2010.
Between 2007 and 2010, Santander was ranked as worst bank for customer service in the J. D. Power UK Retail Banking Satisfaction Study. However, its '123' product range was ranked third best in the UK in 2013 and in a moneysavingexpert.com poll in 2014 customers ranked their satisfaction higher than with any of other main high street banks.[4][5][6]
In October 2011, Moody's downgraded the credit rating of 12 UK financial firms including Santander UK, blaming financial weakness.[7] In June 2012, Moody rated Santander UK as being in a more financially healthy position than its parent company, Banco Santander. Less than 1% of Santander UK's business is held abroad.[8]

History[edit]
Establishment[edit]




Santander UK head office, Triton Square, London


The bank has its origins in three constituent companies—Abbey National, Alliance & Leicester and Bradford & Bingley—all former mutual building societies. Abbey National, trading as Abbey, had been bought by the Santander Group in 2004 for £9 billion. Santander purchased Alliance & Leicester in mid-September 2008,[9] followed by the branches and savings business of Bradford & Bingley which had been nationalised by HM Government during the 2008 banking crisis.[10]
Abbey National and the savings business and branches of Bradford & Bingley were rebranded as Santander on 11 January 2010, and Abbey National plc was renamed Santander UK plc. Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton unveiled the first rebranded Santander branch that day in central London. A further 300 Abbey and Bradford & Bingley branches in London and south east England were rebranded that day, with branches in the rest of the UK following by the end of the month, by which time there were 1,045 Santander branches.[11] Alliance & Leicester plc merged into the bank on 28 May 2010,[12] and was rebranded by the end of the year.[13]
The bank retained the London headquarters of Abbey National and renamed other regional buildings under its own name.[14] The Abbey name was retained initially for Abbey International (now Santander Private Banking), and Abbey for Intermediaries (now Santander for Intermediaries), the division of the bank offering Abbey branded mortgages provided by Santander UK plc.[15] The charitable divisions of Abbey, Bradford & Bingley and Alliance & Leicester were brought together to form the Santander Foundation.[16]




A rebranded branch of Santander in Peterborough


Due to the three-way merger, Santander was in the unusual position of having more than one branch in many British high streets. In Northumerland Street, Newcastle upon Tyne, for example, there were three branches, which were formerly Abbey, Alliance & Leicester and Bradford & Bingley respectively. Plymouth city centre had four branches within 300 metres, two of which were adjacent to each other. In 2012, the bank began to reduce the number of duplicate branches, identifying 56 that would close. Staff in the branches selected for closure were moved to other nearby branches.[17]
Alliance & Leicester Commercial Bank merged into Santander's business banking division, Santander Corporate Banking, in 2009.[18]
Recent years[edit]
On 9 March 2010, Santander sold the investment and asset management business James Hay to IFG Group for £35 million.[19] Later in the year, it was confirmed on 4 August that Santander would purchase the branches of The Royal Bank of Scotland in England and Wales, and the branches of NatWest in Scotland as part of a divestment of the business by The Royal Bank of Scotland Group.[20] The deal collapsed on 12 October 2012.[21]
Santander has frequently been rated the worst bank in the UK for customer service,[22] although by July 2011 had sought to improve, notably by returning call centre operations to the UK from India.[23] During 2011 the bank put aside £538m to cover claims from customers for the misselling of payment protection insurance (PPI), as did many other UK banks.[24]
In December 2012, Santander reached an agreement to sell its store card business, which includes branded cards issued for retailers including Topshop, House of Fraser and Debenhams, to SAV Credit.[25] The sale was completed on 13 May 2013, though Santander continued to service accounts on behalf of SAV Credit until 1 April 2014.[26]
During 2014, the bank considered an initial public offering (IPO), expected to be completed within two years.[27] In November 2014, the chief executive of the Santander Group admitted that an IPO would not be forthcoming until market conditions improved.[28] This view was repeated in July 2015.[29]
Services[edit]




A branch of Santander on Briggate, Leeds


The bank provides a full range of personal, business and corporate accounts, including current accounts, mortgages, credit products and savings and investments. Santander operate online banking services, including mobile apps, and operate an internet-only banking division branded Cahoot. Mortgages are also provided through Santander for Intermediaries, a division of the bank used by brokers.
Santander's Corporate and Commercial Banking division operates from a number of regional business banking centres across the UK. In May 2013, Ana Botin announced plans to double the number of centres to 70 within three years.[30]
Santander UK is authorised by the Prudential Regulation Authority and regulated by both the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority.[31] It is a member of the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, UK Payments Administration, Bankers' Automated Clearing Services (BACS), the Faster Payments Service, the Clearing House Automated Payment System (CHAPS), the Cheque and Credit Clearing Company, the British Bankers' Association[32] and subscribes to the Lending Code.[33]
The bank operates a branch on the Isle of Man, which is licensed by the Financial Supervision Commission.[31] Santander's offshore private banking subsidiary Santander Private Banking operates in Jersey.
Six-digit account sort codes are used in the range between 09-00-xx to 09-19-xx. Sort codes for accounts formerly held by Alliance & Leicester use the range 09-01-31 to 09-01-36.
In 2009 Santander launched the UK's first current account without fees (including unauthorised overdrafts) for its current and future mortgage customers.[34] Customers are not charged fees for using Santander's automated teller machines in Spain, which traditionally would incur fees for transactions in a foreign currency.[35]
Sponsorships[edit]




Santander-branded bicycles in London


Santander has sponsored the McLaren Formula One team since 2007,[36] and is also the title sponsor of the British Grand Prix. Santander said its sponsorship of McLaren had raised its brand awareness in the UK from 20 to 82 percent.[37] The bank announced a second team sponsorship, with Scuderia Ferrari, in 2009.[38]
Golfer Rory McIlroy signed a sponsorship agreement with the bank in September 2011,[39] and in 2013 it was announced that British athlete Jessica Ennis-Hill would become a brand ambassador.
In February 2015, Santander was announced as the new sponsor of Transport for London's bicycle hire scheme, branded as Santander Cycles. Santander replaced Barclays as title sponsor.[40]

Your guide to our complaints procedure

Complaints about Payment Protection Insurance (PPI)
If your complaint is regarding your Motor Finance Payment Protection, you can find more information on our Payment Protection Insurance complaints page.


Here are the answers to the most frequently asked questions regarding complaints
What should I do if I have a problem with my vehicle?You should firstly contact your supplying dealer to discuss the problem. If you are unhappy with the outcome and require further assistance you can submit a ‘Satisfactory Quality Complaint‘ to Santander Consumer Finance.How do I make a complaint?We value our customers highly and aim to provide a positive experience right from the proposal through to the final payment and beyond. The fair treatment of our customers is very important to us. If you are less than satisfied we want to know so that we can put things right. For more details please click here to read our complaints procedure, alternatively you can contact our Complaints Team on 0800 085 2050.What happens once I have raised my complaint?If we are unable to resolve your complaint before the end of the day after you make your complaint we will send you an acknowledgment within 5 days. If by 4 weeks after your complaint is received we are unable to provide a final response, we will write and inform you and indicate when we expect to be in a position to send our final response. The majority of complaints will be quickly and satisfactorily resolved by this stage, however, if the matter is more complex and involves a third party, it may take longer to resolve. The Finance & Leasing Association (FLA) offers a conciliation service to customers of its members (Santander Consumer Finance is a member of the FLA). They may be able to assist in bringing the matter to a conclusion. In our final response letter we will set out our final view on the issues raised in your complaint and tell you whether we:

accept your complaint and – where appropriate – are offering redress
are offering redress without accepting your complaint or reject your complaint.

If we reject your complaint, our final response letter will explain why we have reached this decision. If by 8 weeks after your complaint is received we are still unable to provide a final response we will write and tell you how much longer we believe it will take before a final response can be sent. At this point, if your agreement is regulated by the Consumer Credit Act or your complaint relates to an insurance product linked to your account, you will be entitled to refer your complaint to The Financial Ombudsman’s Service (FOS) who provide a dispute resolution service.What happens if I have made a complaint but not received your response?We will provide a full response as soon as possible but no later than 8 weeks from the receipt of your complaint. If we don’t resolve your complaint within 8 weeks we will write to you with an update and let you know how to take your complaint to the Financial Ombudsman should you wish to do so. If you have any questions about your complaint, you can contact our Complaints team on 0800 085 2050.What happens if I am not satisfied with your final response?Our final response letter will tell you that if you remain dissatisfied with our response you may refer the complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service within six months of the date of our final response.Can I use a solicitor, claims management company or third party to manage my complaint?Yes, you can. If you employ a solicitor, claims management company or third party – e.g. a financial advisor – to handle your complaint, we’ll investigate your complaint in the same way as we would if we were dealing with you directly. Please be aware that:

we don’t charge to investigate your complaint
we’re not liable for any fees you need to pay for a third party’s services
if we agree with your complaint and we make a redress payment, we’ll generally only make this payment directly to you.
Can I refer my complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service?If you’re not happy with our final decision about your complaint, you may be able to refer your complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS). The FOS acts as an independent and impartial organisation which helps settle disputes between consumers and financial services businesses. For the FOS to look into your complaint you must have tried to resolve it with us first or it must have been over 8 weeks since you first raised your complaint.
How to contact the Financial Ombudsman Service

Phone: 0800 023 4 567 - Calls to this number are normally free for people ringing from a fixed line phone but charges may apply if you call from a mobile phoneor0300 123 9 123 - Calls to this number are charged at the same rate as 01 or 02 numbers on mobile phone tariffs.
Email: complaint.info@financial-ombudsman.org.uk
