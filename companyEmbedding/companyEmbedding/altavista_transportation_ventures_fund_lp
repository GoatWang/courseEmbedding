SOUTHFIELD, Mich., Oct. 9, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Alta Vista Technology (AVT), a leading technology consulting firm focused on providing business management solutions, announced today a partnership with Intacct, the leading provider of cloud financial management and accounting software. As an Intacct business partner, AVT will sell, implement, support, and develop enhancements for Intacct's award-winning cloud financial applications. AVT, a top Microsoft Dynamics partner in Michigan, is aligning with Intacct in response to increased demand for cloud computing-based applications from its prospects and clients.

Intacct is a forward-thinking organization and fits perfectly in AVT's line of product offerings.  After carefully reviewing all other cloud financial systems on the market, AVT selected Intacct for its best-of-breed cloud financial platform, deep project accounting capabilities, and robust reporting and analytics capabilities.  
"Intacct is the first cloud financial system in our product offerings. AVT believes in creating long-term, sustainable value through the solutions we provide, and it is very clear that businesses are becoming more interested in using a cloud-based financial system," said John Silvani, President & CEO at Alta Vista Technology. "After looking at the cloud options on the market, we thought Intacct was the best fit for our portfolio. Our clients will benefit with Intacct's built-in features and customizable online reporting capabilities that can scale based on their business needs."
Intacct's project accounting capabilities will help Alta Vista Technology's project and services-based clients optimize operations and gain real-time visibility throughout the entire project life cycle. With Intacct, these companies can more easily monitor the financial progress of their projects, maximize utilization, better manage their cash flow, provide better customer service, and avoid the leakage of billable project time and expenses. 
AVT is also excited about the web-based dashboards, reporting, and business intelligence capabilities built into the Intacct system. Intacct provides a powerful set of analytics and reporting tools that empower users with real-time, accurate and consistent visibility into financial and operational data. The ability to run financial reports by dimensions, such as by customer, by vendor, by project, or by fund will be particularly useful for AVT's clients. 
AVT has put together a seminar for SMBs to help them become aware of the necessary tools, processes, and latest technology that are available to them.  This complimentary lunch and learn seminar is to help SMBs grow their businesses.  During the event, AVT will also showcase Intacct's online financial capabilities, as well as provide an overview on EOS™ (Entrepreneur Operating System) and Office 365 cloud solutions.

"Intacct's cloud based solution has unmatched depth and breadth when it comes to the core financial applications," added Silvani.

Intacct allows businesses to have a collaborative environment for their remote workers or offices to allow them to make the changes as needed quickly and without costly IT support. We see the benefits of cloud computing and are excited to provide our clients the right business management solutions to help them succeed."
"Intacct is focused on building a world-class network of partners and AVT is the latest in a string of top firms to join the Intacct Business Partner Program," said Taylor Macdonald, vice president of Channels for Intacct.  "Our offerings are well suited for the project-based companies that are Alta Vista Technology's bread and butter.  John Silvani and his team have extensive background in ERP and financial software, which will be a huge benefit to our mutual clients.  We look forward to working closely with Alta Vista Technology for many years to come."

                        National Spine & Pain Centers provides administrative services to interventional pain management clinics focused on relieving chronic back and neck pain. Interventional pain management is a rapidly growing medical specialty whose objective is to relieve pain through advanced, minimally invasive procedures while preventing costly, invasive surgery. Such treatment provides both immediate and long-lasting pain relief and enables patients and payors to avoid more costly and invasive surgical procedures from which recovery time can be lengthy. National Spine & Pain Centers provides management services to physicians who are dedicated to providing high quality patient care in outpatient ambulatory surgical center settings. Affiliated physicians are fellowship-trained and board-certified/board-eligible pain specialists and many are nationally recognized leaders in pain management.
