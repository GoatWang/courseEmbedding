Carlyle is dropping a $3.5 billion emerging markets hedge fund

    Council in Washington, November 16, 2010.

    The partners of Emerging Sovereign Group LLC (ESG) have agreed
    to buy back the majority stake in the emerging markets-focused
    hedge fund manager that was acquired by Carlyle
    Group LP in 2011, Carlyle said on Wednesday.
  

    The move comes as Carlyle has chosen to focus more
    on credit-oriented investment strategies, such as direct
    lending, distressed debt and collateralized loan obligations,
    while ESG has remained an equities-focused hedge fund firm.
  

    ESG was founded in 2002 by former Morgan Stanley colleagues
    Kevin Kenny, Mete Tuncel and Jason Kirschner with seed capital
    from Tiger Management founder Julian Robertson. It has $3.5
    billion is assets, up from $1.25 billion when
    Carlyle acquired a controlling stake in it in
    2011.
  

    "ESG is a strong organization, has been a terrific partner to
    Carlyle and will thrive as an independent
    business... We wish Kevin Kenny and his team continued success
    in the future," Carlyle co-founder and
    co-chief executive William Conway said in a statement.

    EXPLAINS




    Many hedge funds targeting emerging markets have struggled to
    produce stellar returns in recent years, as bets on economic
    growth in some countries such as Brazil and Russia have gone
    sour.
  

    The split with ESG will further reduce Carlyle's
    hedge fund offerings, after it shut down its hedge
    fund-of-funds manager, Diversified Global Asset Management Corp
    (DGAM), earlier this year, citing a challenging market
    environment that made it difficult to gain scale.
  

    Its remaining hedge fund units, Claren Road Asset Management
    and Vermillion, have continued to generate losses amid poor
    financial performance and investor redemptions, even as
    Carlyle has continued to invest in new
    products and strategies, Carlyle Chief Financial
    Officer Curt Buser said on the firm's latest quarterly earnings
    call last month.
  
Carlyle also said last month that it anticipated
    greater operating losses from some of the hedge funds and
    associated commodities products than it previously expected.
  

    Hedge funds, as well as distressed debt, mezzanine credit and
    direct lending offerings, are part
    of Carlyle's Global Market Strategies (GMS)
    business, which had $34.7 billion in assets under management as
    of the end of June, down 5 percent year-on-year.
  

    Buser said last month Carlyle had expected GMS to
    be a larger contributor to distributable earnings and
    fee-related earnings at this point than it actually is.
  
Carlyle had total assets under management of
    $175.6 billion at the end of June, of which $57.6 billion were
    in private equity, $37.5 billion were in real estate, and $45.7
    billion were in so-called investment solutions, such as
    fund-of-funds.

                Puerto Rico hedge fund targets general-obligation bonds
            



                Millennium Management fund gained 2.5% this year through April
            



A hedge fund at Emerging Sovereign Group that has bet against the Chinese economy sunk about 62 percent this year through April.The Nexus fund dropped 8.2 percent last month, according to an email to investors seen by Bloomberg News. The April results mark at least the third consecutive month of negative returns for the fund.China bears have suffered as economic growth accelerated in the first quarter and officials have been guiding the yuan higher against the dollar in a move that’s caught market watchers by surprise. The Nexus fund gained 35 percent in 2015, profiting from moves by China’s central bank to devalue the yuan by the most since 1994. But the fund has underpeformed since 2016 when it dropped 15.5 percent, Bloomberg has reported.




ESG is run by co-founders Kevin Kenny, Mete Tuncel and Jason Kirschner, who bought out Carlyle Group LP’s 55 percent stake and took full control of the firm in October. Most of the assets at ESG, which managed $3.5 billion as of December, are in two of its other funds.A spokesman for New York-based ESG, which started in 2002 with seed capital from Julian Robertson’s Tiger Management, declined to comment. Puerto Rico Winner

Candlewood Investment Group’s Puerto Rico SP fund gained 5.7 percent in the first two weeks of May, bringing year-to-date returns to 9.4 percent, according to an investor update seen by Bloomberg. The $105 million fund targets securities including general-obligation bonds, or GOs, and other opportunistic areas within the Puerto Rico municipal bond market. Puerto Rico declared a form of bankruptcy in May."There have been several recent events which we believe confirm our investment positioning and thesis," the $1.2 billion firm said in a separate letter for April. "The most notable was the Commonwealth’s restructuring proposal which clearly prioritized GO and GO guaranteed debt above other bondholders."Michael Ardisson, partner and director of business development at Candlewood, declined to comment.Millennium Underwhelms




Millennium Management’s main fund has been posting middling results this year along with its multistrategy peers. The Millennium International fund returned 0.3 percent in April to bring returns for the first four months of the year to an estimated 2.5 percent, according to an investor update seen by Bloomberg.Hedge Fund Research Inc.’s multistrategy index rose about 2 percent in that time, as did hedge funds on average.The largest driver of the Millennium fund’s performance last month was the relative value fundamental equity strategy, which gained 0.2 percent on the strength of the technology, financials and health-care sectors, the update shows. A spokeswoman for the $35 billion firm run by Izzy Englander declined to comment.Watch Next: Why Moody's Downgraded China to A1

Important Disclosure

Unless otherwise stated, portfolio facts and statistics are shown for Class A shares; other classes may have different characteristics.

†NAV: Unless you are eligible for a waiver, the public offering price you pay when you buy Class A shares of the Fund is the Net Asset Value (NAV) of the shares plus an initial sales charge. The initial sales charge varies depending upon the size of your purchase.  No sales charge is imposed where Class A or Class C shares are issued to you pursuant to the automatic investment of income dividends or capital gains distributions. It is the responsibility of the financial intermediary to ensure that the investor obtains the proper “breakpoint” discount. Class C, Class I and Class Y do not have an initial sales charge; however, Class C does charge a contingent deferred redemption charge.  See the 
        
    prospectus and summary prospectus for more information.
1Van Eck Associates Corporation (the “Adviser”) has agreed to waive fees and/or pay Fund expenses to the extent necessary to prevent the operating expenses of the Fund (excluding acquired fund fees and expenses, interest expense, trading expenses, dividends and interest payments on securities sold short, taxes and extraordinary expenses) from exceeding 1.60% for Class A, 2.50% for Class C, 1.00% for Class I, and 1.10% for Class Y of the Fund’s average daily net assets per year until May 1, 2018. During such time, the
        expense limitation is expected to continue until the Board of Trustees acts to discontinue all or a portion of such expense limitation.

The views and opinions expressed are those of VanEck. Fund manager commentaries are general in nature and should not be construed as investment advice. Opinions are subject to change with market conditions. Any discussion of specific securities mentioned in the commentaries is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation to buy these securities. Fund holdings will vary.
You can lose money by investing in the Fund. Any investment in the Fund should be part of an overall investment program, not a complete program. The Fund is subject to the risks associated with its investments in emerging markets securities, which tend to be more volatile and less liquid than securities traded in developed countries. The Fund’s investments in foreign securities involve risks related to adverse political and economic developments unique to a country or a region, currency fluctuations or controls, and the possibility of arbitrary action by foreign governments, including the takeover of property without adequate compensation or imposition of prohibitive taxation. The Fund is subject to risks associated with investments in debt securities, derivatives, commodity-linked instruments, illiquid securities, asset-backed securities, CMOs and small or mid-cap companies. The Fund is also subject to inflation risk, short-sales risk, market risk, non-diversification risk and leverage risk. Please see the 
        
    prospectus and summary prospectus for information on these and other risk considerations.
Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal. An investor should consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the investment company carefully before investing. The prospectus and summary prospectus contain this and other information.  Please read them carefully before investing.
