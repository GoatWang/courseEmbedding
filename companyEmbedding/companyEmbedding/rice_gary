Shipping & Returns Policy
  View complete shipping
  and returns policy & FAQs.

        


White Glove Shipping
Appropriate for large or fragile items.

      Costs range from $100 for smaller items delivered locally to $1,000+ for extra large
      items transported across the Continental United States. Final cost depends on the size of the items and the
      buyer's location.
    

      Local deliveries typically take about 2 weeks and longer
      distance deliveries typically take about 3-6 weeks.
    
Flat Rate Shipping

      Shipment through recognized carriers such as UPS, FedEx, and USPS. Appropriate for smaller items, most
      accessories and some small furniture.
    

      Costs range from $9 to $299 and up, depending on the size and weight of the item.
    
Delivery is typically 7-10 days
Local Pickup

      Local pickup allows a buyer to avoid shipping costs by picking up an item in person. The buyer must contact the
      seller within five business days of their purchase to coordinate a pickup date and time. Delays may result in
      additional charges.
    
Local Delivery

      As a lower cost alternative, some of our sellers offer local curbside delivery within a limited geography around
      their location. The buyer must contact the seller within five business days of their purchase to coordinate a
      delivery date and time. Delays may result in additional charges.
    

      If additional labor is required to move the item inside or upstairs, buyers should make sure to plan accordingly.
    




Returns & Cancellations

        Except for Local Pickup and Local Delivery, buyers have 48 hours after delivery to inspect
        their item(s) and contact support@chairish.com if they wish
        to return an item. There are no restocking fees, but we deduct outbound and return shipping charges from the
        buyer's original purchase price (+ taxes when applicable). Buyers may not be reimbursed for returns that are not
        received in original condition.

QUOTE -- UNQUOTE


"Music is in the air. It's my job to pull it out."
--Jaco Pastorius

"I try to make sure my part is notable -- that it's not only right for the song, but also represents the bass in the highest light."
--Nathan East

"The art of music is governed by the laws of harmony, theory and rhythm. These laws and theories must be studied in order to attain and maintain precious, unforseen rewards."
--Chuck Rainey
"Even when playing the simplest song with just whole notes, make sure that they're very good whole notes!"
--Larry Paxton


"It's the bass that makes them dance." 
--Darcy Wright  
"Guitar is for the head, drums are for the chest, but bass gets you in the groin." 
--Suzi Quatro

            Budgeting is Like Dieting
          






Budgeting is like dieting, you know you need to, it will make you healthier (and wealthier), but the process is not always fun when starting out. If the diet is too strict it will fail, if it allows cheat days it will fail and if you are not committed to the end results it will fail.

The pinnacle of interior design is the carefully curated “vignette”. A hodgepodge of seemingly random objects placed on a table, console or mantel does the yeoman's share of taking a room from dull and drab to chic and sophisticated. Add a vintage book, a tiny obelisk (now’s not the time to be a minimalist), and whatever suits your fancy!
