This material may not be reproduced, distributed or transmitted to any person or incorporated into another document without the prior written consent of Spears Abacus Advisors LLC.











Straightforward investments, sophisticated analysis
We are a highly motivated team of investment professionals conducting proprietary fundamental analysis of individual securities. When selecting investments, we seek to own dynamic businesses with leading and defensible market positions. Our intensive research process seeks securities with positively skewed, asymmetric expected return profiles. Simply put, the absolute expected upside in a more likely “base case” is greater than the absolute expected downside in a less likely “reasonable worst case.”
When constructing portfolios we are not compelled to mirror index style or sector guidelines and our investment universe is not limited by restrictions on market capitalization, geographic domicile or qualifiers like value or growth. Unconstrained portfolios retain the flexibility to adjust to a changing investment landscape.





Absolute clarity about how and where your money is invested
We believe it is our responsibility to make you comfortable with how your investments are handled.
As a Spears Abacus client, you work directly with the people who manage your portfolio. We give you a clear understanding of how and why we make decisions. Because your money is held by an outside custodian in highly liquid assets, you may access it at any time, for any reason, without prior notification to us. There are no holding periods, gates or restrictions.





Experience with, and over, generations
Our principals have served individuals and families with substantial wealth for generations. Through experience, we understand how market sentiment and economic conditions shift over time, influencing each client’s timeframe, generational planning goals, and tax profile. Understanding these interactions is an integral part of our process, allowing us to build portfolios that retain the flexibility to adapt to change.





Focus on select relationships
Good, long-term relationships are earned, and we work hard to earn them. At Spears Abacus, you interact directly with our operating principals—the people who own and run the firm.

We believe that superior returns are achieved by…
…investing in dynamic businesses with leading and defensible market positions
…making investment decisions based on proprietary fundamental analysis
…focusing on opportunities that we believe will offer favorable asymmetric return profiles over a three year time period and which possess catalysts to unlock value
…separating investment analysis from current market consensus
…constructing a focused portfolio of 25 – 30 holdings that represent a spectrum of risk
…remaining in cash when better opportunities do not exist
…maintaining discipline









We believe that…
…the best way for individuals to invest in fixed income is through separately managed accounts, not bond funds
…fixed income risk is the sum of all risk—not simply credit or interest rate risk
…shifting between fixed income strategies when the market provides opportunities is a better approach than a static allocation 


TOTAL RETURN
~ Invest opportunistically in fixed income and hybrid securities
~ Focus on investments that we believe offer potential for equity type returns
MUNICIPAL
~ Invest in state specific tax-exempt bonds of high quality municipalities to enhance income and dampen volatility
HIGH GRADE
~ Invest in the senior debt of large, high credit rated corporate issuers
TREASURY
~ Invest in U.S. Government securities of various maturities
~ Offers maximum liquidity








A Balanced Approach
By allocating funds to a combination of the strategies that we offer, an investor is able to take a balanced approach in order to meet their risk tolerance and financial needs.
We work with all clients by discussing investment objectives and risks in order to come up with an allocation best suited to them.









In our experience, a tolerance for volatility and a long term orientation maximize investment returns. However, short term spending needs and risk parameters often conflict with long term aspirations.
Total return portfolios balance the long term dynamic return patterns of equity ownership with the low volatility income properties of static yield investments such as bonds. Hybrid securities such as high yield bonds, convertible securities, preferred stocks, MLPs and REITs are also used to capture exposure to both growth and yield.
We tailor the allocation of assets between dynamic and static return investments for each client.  Asset mix is based on the individual client’s needs for income and liquidity, tolerances for risk and volatility, and specific tax situation.

Choate Rosemary Hall

                    From its shared roots over a century ago as The Choate School and Rosemary Hall, through the merger in 1974, to the Choate Rosemary Hall of today, the name represents the best in American secondary education.

The more than 17,000 graduates can attest to the quality of Choate's academic program, but that is only one aspect of the education a student receives. Through interactions with members of the entire Choate community, students mature into young adults who not only have stretched their minds, but have grown personally, artistically, and athletically.

A Tradition of Excellence

William Gardner Choate, who established The Choate School, his wife Mary Atwater Choate and Caroline Ruutz-Rees, founders of Rosemary Hall, had a shared vision: offering students opportunities to advance themselves. Just as a strong foundation at Choate prepares students for college, so too did the convictions of the founders establish the pursuit of excellence that remains a hallmark of Choate today.

How is excellence manifested? The Class of 2011 had 8 National Merit Finalists; 10 Semifinalists and 47 Commended Scholars. Choate offers more Advanced Placement (AP) courses than any of our peer schools, with 94 percent earning 3 or better, which traditionally results in college credit; more than 78 percent of those students earned 4 or 5. Choate has an economics teams that competes nationally with outstanding results, and championship mathematics, computer science, and debate teams that compete at the local, state, and/or New England regional level. At Choate, the arts are unparalleled, and our athletics program is recognized nationwide for its high quality.
