Ex-Dividend Reminder: Select Income REIT, Hospitality Properties Trust and Government Properties Income Trust


July 18, 2017, 10:01:31 AM EDT
By DividendChannel.com, BNK Invest

Looking at the universe of stocks we cover at Dividend Channel  , on 7/20/17, Select Income REIT (Symbol: SIR), Hospitality Properties Trust (Symbol: HPT), and Government Properties Income Trust (Symbol: GOV) will all trade ex-dividend for their respective upcoming dividends. Select Income REIT will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.51 on 8/17/17, Hospitality Properties Trust will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.52 on 8/17/17, and Government Properties Income Trust will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.43 on 8/21/17. As a percentage of SIR's recent stock price of $24.02, this dividend works out to approximately 2.12%, so look for shares of Select Income REIT to trade 2.12% lower - all else being equal - when SIR shares open for trading on 7/20/17. Similarly, investors should look for HPT to open 1.75% lower in price and for GOV to open 2.36% lower, all else being equal.    Below are dividend history charts for SIR, HPT, and GOV, showing historical dividends prior to the most recent ones declared.   Select Income REIT (Symbol: SIR)  :       Hospitality Properties Trust (Symbol: HPT)  :         Government Properties Income Trust (Symbol: GOV)  :          In general, dividends are not always predictable, following the ups and downs of company profits over time. Therefore, a good first due diligence step in forming an expectation of annual yield going forward, is looking at the history above, for a sense of stability over time. This can help in judging whether the most recent dividends from these companies are likely to continue. If they do continue, the current estimated yields on annualized basis would be 8.49% for Select Income REIT, 7.02% for Hospitality Properties Trust, and 9.43% for Government Properties Income Trust.    In Tuesday trading, Select Income REIT shares are currently down about 0.2%, Hospitality Properties Trust shares are down about 0.3%, and Government Properties Income Trust shares are off about 0.1% on the day.

First Week of August 18th Options Trading For Select Income REIT (SIR)
Investors in Select Income REIT saw new options begin trading this week, for the August 18th expiration. One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 116 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration.

Select Income REIT Announces Second Quarter 2017 Results




Second Quarter Net Income of $0.30 Per Share


Second Quarter Normalized FFO of $0.70 Per Share






July 25, 2017 07:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



NEWTON, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Select Income REIT (Nasdaq: SIR) today announced financial results for 
      the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2017.
    

      David Blackman, President and Chief Operating Officer of SIR, made the 
      following statement:
    

      "During the second quarter of 2017, Select Income REIT entered into new 
      and renewal leases for approximately 202,000 square feet and executed 
      one rent reset in Hawaii on a 79,000 square foot lease. We also issued 
      $350 million of seven year senior unsecured notes, which we used to pay 
      down our revolving credit facility and for general business purposes."
    

Results for the Quarter Ended June 30, 2017:


      Net income attributed to SIR was $26.7 million, or $0.30 per diluted 
      share, for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, compared to $30.8 million, 
      or $0.34 per diluted share, for the same quarter last year.
    

      Normalized funds from operations, or Normalized FFO, attributed to SIR 
      for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 were $62.1 million, or $0.70 per 
      diluted share, compared to $64.2 million, or $0.72 per diluted share, 
      for the same quarter last year.
    

      Reconciliations of net income attributed to SIR determined in accordance 
      with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, to funds 
      from operations, or FFO, attributed to SIR and to Normalized FFO 
      attributed to SIR for the quarters ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 appear 
      later in this press release.
    

Results for the Six Months Ended June 30, 2017:


      Net income attributed to SIR was $33.4 million, or $0.37 per diluted 
      share, for the six months ended June 30, 2017, compared to $63.5 
      million, or $0.71 per diluted share, for the same period last year. Net 
      income attributed to SIR per diluted share for the six months ended 
      June 30, 2017 includes a write-off of straight line rents receivable of 
      $12.5 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, and a loss on asset 
      impairment of $4.0 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, both of which 
      resulted from a tenant bankruptcy, as well as estimated business 
      management incentive fees of $8.8 million, or $0.10 per diluted share. 
      The bankrupt tenant formerly leased two properties from SIR, one of 
      which is substantially vacant and the second of which is occupied by a 
      subtenant with whom SIR is negotiating for a direct lease.
    

      Normalized FFO attributed to SIR for the six months ended June 30, 2017 
      were $114.5 million, or $1.28 per diluted share, compared to $130.4 
      million, or $1.46 per diluted share, for the same period last year. 
      Normalized FFO for the six months ended June 30, 2017 include a 
      write-off of straight line rents receivable of $12.5 million, or $0.14 
      per diluted share, related to leases associated with the tenant 
      bankruptcy discussed above.
    

      Reconciliations of net income attributed to SIR determined in accordance 
      with GAAP to FFO attributed to SIR and to Normalized FFO attributed to 
      SIR for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 appear later in this 
      press release.
    

Leasing, Occupancy and Same Property Results:


      SIR entered into lease renewals for approximately 161,000 square feet 
      and new leases for approximately 41,000 square feet during the quarter 
      ended June 30, 2017, which resulted in combined weighted average (by 
      square feet) rental rates that were approximately 2.6% lower than prior 
      rents for the same space. The weighted average (by square feet) lease 
      term for these leases was 31.1 years. Commitments for tenant 
      improvements, leasing costs and concessions for these leases totaled 
      approximately $2.5 million, or approximately $0.40 per square foot per 
      weighted average lease year. During the quarter ended June 30, 2017, SIR 
      also completed one rent reset for a Hawaii lease of approximately 79,000 
      square feet of land at a rental rate that was approximately 48.9% higher 
      than the prior rental rate.
    

      As of June 30, 2017, 95.9% of SIR’s total rentable square feet was 
      leased, compared to 95.9% as of March 31, 2017 and 96.8% as of June 30, 
      2016. Occupancy for properties owned continuously since April 1, 2016 
      also decreased to 95.9% at June 30, 2017 from 96.8% at June 30, 2016. 
      Same property cash basis net operating income, or Cash Basis NOI, 
      decreased 0.5% for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 compared to the 
      quarter ended June 30, 2016, primarily as a result of the decline in 
      occupancy during 2017, partially offset by contractual rent increases 
      for certain properties since April 1, 2016.
    

      Reconciliations of net income determined in accordance with GAAP to net 
      operating income, or NOI, and Cash Basis NOI for the quarters and six 
      months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 appear later in this press release.

      term as of the acquisition date of approximately 10.0 years.

      (1) General and administrative expenses include estimated business 
      management incentive fee expense of $920 for the three months ended 
      June 30, 2017 and $8,766 for the six months ended June 30, 2017.
    

      (2) In March 2017, one of SIR's tenants filed for bankruptcy and 
      rejected two leases with SIR; one for a property located in Huntsville, 
      AL with approximately 1,400 rentable square feet and an original lease 
      term until August 2032; and one for a property in Hanover, PA with 
      approximately 502 rentable square feet and an original lease term until 
      September 2028. The Huntsville, AL property is occupied by a subtenant 
      that continues to pay rent to SIR in an amount equal to the rent under 
      the rejected lease. The sublease term runs concurrently with the former 
      tenant’s original lease term, subject to certain termination rights by 
      the subtenant. SIR expects that the lost rents plus carrying costs, such 
      as real estate taxes, insurance, security and other operating costs, 
      from a fully vacant Hanover, PA property may total approximately $3,800 
      per year. SIR is holding a security deposit of $3,739 from the tenant 
      with respect to the Hanover, PA property, which SIR expects to retain 
      and, therefore, has offset the amount of the security deposit against 
      its lease rejection damages. During the three months ended March 31, 
      2017, SIR recorded a non-cash charge of $12,517 to write off straight 
      line rents receivable (net of the $3,739 security deposit) related to 
      leases with the former tenant at both properties plus an impairment 
      charge of $4,047 related to the write off of lease intangibles related 
      to the property located in Hanover, PA.

      (1) SIR calculates FFO attributed to SIR and Normalized FFO attributed 
      to SIR as shown above. FFO attributed to SIR is calculated on the basis 
      defined by The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or 
      NAREIT, which is net income, calculated in accordance with GAAP, plus 
      real estate depreciation and amortization, loss on impairment of real 
      estate assets and the difference between net income and FFO allocated to 
      noncontrolling interest, as well as certain other adjustments currently 
      not applicable to SIR. SIR’s calculation of Normalized FFO attributed to 
      SIR differs from NAREIT’s definition of FFO because SIR includes 
      business management incentive fees, if any, only in the fourth quarter 
      versus the quarter when they are recognized as expense in accordance 
      with GAAP due to their quarterly volatility not necessarily being 
      indicative of SIR’s core operating performance and the uncertainty as to 
      whether any such business management incentive fees will be payable when 
      all contingencies for determining such fees are known at the end of the 
      calendar year and SIR excludes acquisition related costs expensed under 
      GAAP, loss on asset impairment and Normalized FFO from noncontrolling 
      interest, net of FFO, if any. SIR considers FFO attributed to SIR and 
      Normalized FFO attributed to SIR to be appropriate supplemental measures 
      of operating performance for a REIT, along with net income, net income 
      attributed to a REIT and operating income. SIR believes that FFO 
      attributed to SIR and Normalized FFO attributed to SIR provide useful 
      information to investors because by excluding the effects of certain 
      historical amounts, such as depreciation expense, FFO attributed to SIR 
      and Normalized FFO attributed to SIR may facilitate a comparison of its 
      operating performance between periods and with other REITs. FFO 
      attributed to SIR and Normalized FFO attributed to SIR are among the 
      factors considered by SIR’s Board of Trustees when determining the 
      amount of distributions to SIR’s shareholders. Other factors include, 
      but are not limited to, requirements to maintain SIR’s qualification for 
      taxation as a REIT, limitations in SIR’s credit agreement and public 
      debt covenants, the availability to SIR of debt and equity capital, 
      SIR’s expectation of its future capital requirements and operating 
      performance and SIR’s expected needs and availability of cash to pay its 
      obligations. FFO attributed to SIR and Normalized FFO attributed to SIR 
      do not represent cash generated by operating activities in accordance 
      with GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to net income, 
      net income attributed to SIR or operating income as an indicator of 
      SIR’s operating performance or as a measure of SIR’s liquidity. These 
      measures should be considered in conjunction with net income, net income 
      attributed to SIR and operating income as presented in SIR’s condensed 
      consolidated statements of income. Other real estate companies and REITs 
      may calculate FFO and Normalized FFO differently than SIR does.
    

      (2) Incentive fees under SIR’s business management agreement with The 
      RMR Group LLC are payable after the end of each calendar year, are 
      calculated based on common share total return, as defined, and are 
      included in general and administrative expenses in SIR’s condensed 
      consolidated statements of income. In calculating net income in 
      accordance with GAAP, SIR recognizes estimated business management 
      incentive fee expense, if any, in the first, second and third quarters. 
      Although SIR recognizes this expense, if any, in the first, second and 
      third quarters for purposes of calculating net income, SIR does not 
      include such expense in the calculation of Normalized FFO attributed to 
      SIR until the fourth quarter, when the amount of the business management 
      incentive fee expense for the calendar year, if any, is determined. 
      Normalized FFO attributed to SIR excludes estimated business management 
      incentive fee expense of $920 for the three months ended June 30, 2017 
      and $8,766 for the six months ended June 30, 2017.
    

      (3) During the three months ended March 31, 2017, SIR recorded a $4,047 
      loss on asset impairment for unamortized lease intangibles related to a 
      lease associated with a tenant bankruptcy at a property located in 
      Hanover, PA.

      (1) The calculations of NOI and Cash Basis NOI exclude certain 
      components of net income in order to provide results that are more 
      closely related to SIR’s property level results of operations. SIR 
      calculates NOI and Cash Basis NOI as shown above. SIR defines NOI as 
      income from its rental of real estate less its property operating 
      expenses. NOI excludes amortization of capitalized tenant improvement 
      costs and leasing commissions because SIR records those amounts as 
      depreciation and amortization. SIR defines Cash Basis NOI as NOI 
      excluding non-cash straight line rent adjustments, lease value 
      amortization, lease termination fees, if any, and non-cash amortization 
      included in other operating expenses. SIR considers NOI and Cash Basis 
      NOI to be appropriate supplemental measures to net income because they 
      may help both investors and management to understand the operations of 
      SIR’s properties. SIR uses NOI and Cash Basis NOI to evaluate individual 
      and company wide property level performance, and SIR believes that NOI 
      and Cash Basis NOI provide useful information to investors regarding its 
      results of operations because they reflect only those income and expense 
      items that are generated and incurred at the property level and may 
      facilitate comparisons of SIR’s operating performance between periods 
      and with other REITs. NOI and Cash Basis NOI do not represent cash 
      generated by operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not 
      be considered as an alternative to net income, net income attributed to 
      SIR or operating income as an indicator of SIR’s operating performance 
      or as a measure of SIR’s liquidity. These measures should be considered 
      in conjunction with net income, net income attributed to SIR and 
      operating income as presented in SIR’s condensed consolidated statements 
      of income. Other real estate companies and REITs may calculate NOI and 
      Cash Basis NOI differently than SIR does.
    

      (2) SIR reports rental income on a straight line basis over the terms of 
      the respective leases; accordingly, rental income includes non-cash 
      straight line rent adjustments. Rental income also includes non-cash 
      amortization of intangible lease assets and liabilities and lease 
      termination fees, if any.
    

      (3) SIR recorded a liability for the amount by which the estimated fair 
      value for accounting purposes exceeded the price SIR paid for its 
      investment in RMR common stock in June 2015. A portion of this liability 
      is being amortized on a straight line basis through December 31, 2035 as 
      a reduction to property management fees, which are included in other 
      operating expenses.
    

      (4) During the three months ended March 31, 2017, SIR recorded a $12,517 
      non-cash write-off of straight line rents receivable related to leases 
      associated with a tenant bankruptcy at two properties located in 
      Huntsville, AL and Hanover, PA and a $4,047 loss on asset impairment for 
      unamortized lease intangibles related to a lease associated with this 
      tenant bankruptcy at the property located in Hanover, PA.

Select Income REIT Announces Second Quarter 2017 Results




Second Quarter Net Income of $0.30 Per Share


Second Quarter Normalized FFO of $0.70 Per Share






July 25, 2017 07:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



NEWTON, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Select Income REIT (Nasdaq: SIR) today announced financial results for 
      the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2017.
    

      David Blackman, President and Chief Operating Officer of SIR, made the 
      following statement:
    

      "During the second quarter of 2017, Select Income REIT entered into new 
      and renewal leases for approximately 202,000 square feet and executed 
      one rent reset in Hawaii on a 79,000 square foot lease. We also issued 
      $350 million of seven year senior unsecured notes, which we used to pay 
      down our revolving credit facility and for general business purposes."
    

Results for the Quarter Ended June 30, 2017:


      Net income attributed to SIR was $26.7 million, or $0.30 per diluted 
      share, for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, compared to $30.8 million, 
      or $0.34 per diluted share, for the same quarter last year.
    

      Normalized funds from operations, or Normalized FFO, attributed to SIR 
      for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 were $62.1 million, or $0.70 per 
      diluted share, compared to $64.2 million, or $0.72 per diluted share, 
      for the same quarter last year.
    

      Reconciliations of net income attributed to SIR determined in accordance 
      with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, to funds 
      from operations, or FFO, attributed to SIR and to Normalized FFO 
      attributed to SIR for the quarters ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 appear 
      later in this press release.
    

Results for the Six Months Ended June 30, 2017:


      Net income attributed to SIR was $33.4 million, or $0.37 per diluted 
      share, for the six months ended June 30, 2017, compared to $63.5 
      million, or $0.71 per diluted share, for the same period last year. Net 
      income attributed to SIR per diluted share for the six months ended 
      June 30, 2017 includes a write-off of straight line rents receivable of 
      $12.5 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, and a loss on asset 
      impairment of $4.0 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, both of which 
      resulted from a tenant bankruptcy, as well as estimated business 
      management incentive fees of $8.8 million, or $0.10 per diluted share. 
      The bankrupt tenant formerly leased two properties from SIR, one of 
      which is substantially vacant and the second of which is occupied by a 
      subtenant with whom SIR is negotiating for a direct lease.
    

      Normalized FFO attributed to SIR for the six months ended June 30, 2017 
      were $114.5 million, or $1.28 per diluted share, compared to $130.4 
      million, or $1.46 per diluted share, for the same period last year. 
      Normalized FFO for the six months ended June 30, 2017 include a 
      write-off of straight line rents receivable of $12.5 million, or $0.14 
      per diluted share, related to leases associated with the tenant 
      bankruptcy discussed above.
    

      Reconciliations of net income attributed to SIR determined in accordance 
      with GAAP to FFO attributed to SIR and to Normalized FFO attributed to 
      SIR for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 appear later in this 
      press release.
    

Leasing, Occupancy and Same Property Results:


      SIR entered into lease renewals for approximately 161,000 square feet 
      and new leases for approximately 41,000 square feet during the quarter 
      ended June 30, 2017, which resulted in combined weighted average (by 
      square feet) rental rates that were approximately 2.6% lower than prior 
      rents for the same space. The weighted average (by square feet) lease 
      term for these leases was 31.1 years. Commitments for tenant 
      improvements, leasing costs and concessions for these leases totaled 
      approximately $2.5 million, or approximately $0.40 per square foot per 
      weighted average lease year. During the quarter ended June 30, 2017, SIR 
      also completed one rent reset for a Hawaii lease of approximately 79,000 
      square feet of land at a rental rate that was approximately 48.9% higher 
      than the prior rental rate.
    

      As of June 30, 2017, 95.9% of SIR’s total rentable square feet was 
      leased, compared to 95.9% as of March 31, 2017 and 96.8% as of June 30, 
      2016. Occupancy for properties owned continuously since April 1, 2016 
      also decreased to 95.9% at June 30, 2017 from 96.8% at June 30, 2016. 
      Same property cash basis net operating income, or Cash Basis NOI, 
      decreased 0.5% for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 compared to the 
      quarter ended June 30, 2016, primarily as a result of the decline in 
      occupancy during 2017, partially offset by contractual rent increases 
      for certain properties since April 1, 2016.
    

      Reconciliations of net income determined in accordance with GAAP to net 
      operating income, or NOI, and Cash Basis NOI for the quarters and six 
      months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 appear later in this press release.

      (1) General and administrative expenses include estimated business 
      management incentive fee expense of $920 for the three months ended 
      June 30, 2017 and $8,766 for the six months ended June 30, 2017.
    

      (2) In March 2017, one of SIR's tenants filed for bankruptcy and 
      rejected two leases with SIR; one for a property located in Huntsville, 
      AL with approximately 1,400 rentable square feet and an original lease 
      term until August 2032; and one for a property in Hanover, PA with 
      approximately 502 rentable square feet and an original lease term until 
      September 2028. The Huntsville, AL property is occupied by a subtenant 
      that continues to pay rent to SIR in an amount equal to the rent under 
      the rejected lease. The sublease term runs concurrently with the former 
      tenant’s original lease term, subject to certain termination rights by 
      the subtenant. SIR expects that the lost rents plus carrying costs, such 
      as real estate taxes, insurance, security and other operating costs, 
      from a fully vacant Hanover, PA property may total approximately $3,800 
      per year. SIR is holding a security deposit of $3,739 from the tenant 
      with respect to the Hanover, PA property, which SIR expects to retain 
      and, therefore, has offset the amount of the security deposit against 
      its lease rejection damages. During the three months ended March 31, 
      2017, SIR recorded a non-cash charge of $12,517 to write off straight 
      line rents receivable (net of the $3,739 security deposit) related to 
      leases with the former tenant at both properties plus an impairment 
      charge of $4,047 related to the write off of lease intangibles related 
      to the property located in Hanover, PA.

      (1) SIR calculates FFO attributed to SIR and Normalized FFO attributed 
      to SIR as shown above. FFO attributed to SIR is calculated on the basis 
      defined by The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or 
      NAREIT, which is net income, calculated in accordance with GAAP, plus 
      real estate depreciation and amortization, loss on impairment of real 
      estate assets and the difference between net income and FFO allocated to 
      noncontrolling interest, as well as certain other adjustments currently 
      not applicable to SIR. SIR’s calculation of Normalized FFO attributed to 
      SIR differs from NAREIT’s definition of FFO because SIR includes 
      business management incentive fees, if any, only in the fourth quarter 
      versus the quarter when they are recognized as expense in accordance 
      with GAAP due to their quarterly volatility not necessarily being 
      indicative of SIR’s core operating performance and the uncertainty as to 
      whether any such business management incentive fees will be payable when 
      all contingencies for determining such fees are known at the end of the 
      calendar year and SIR excludes acquisition related costs expensed under 
      GAAP, loss on asset impairment and Normalized FFO from noncontrolling 
      interest, net of FFO, if any. SIR considers FFO attributed to SIR and 
      Normalized FFO attributed to SIR to be appropriate supplemental measures 
      of operating performance for a REIT, along with net income, net income 
      attributed to a REIT and operating income. SIR believes that FFO 
      attributed to SIR and Normalized FFO attributed to SIR provide useful 
      information to investors because by excluding the effects of certain 
      historical amounts, such as depreciation expense, FFO attributed to SIR 
      and Normalized FFO attributed to SIR may facilitate a comparison of its 
      operating performance between periods and with other REITs. FFO 
      attributed to SIR and Normalized FFO attributed to SIR are among the 
      factors considered by SIR’s Board of Trustees when determining the 
      amount of distributions to SIR’s shareholders. Other factors include, 
      but are not limited to, requirements to maintain SIR’s qualification for 
      taxation as a REIT, limitations in SIR’s credit agreement and public 
      debt covenants, the availability to SIR of debt and equity capital, 
      SIR’s expectation of its future capital requirements and operating 
      performance and SIR’s expected needs and availability of cash to pay its 
      obligations. FFO attributed to SIR and Normalized FFO attributed to SIR 
      do not represent cash generated by operating activities in accordance 
      with GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to net income, 
      net income attributed to SIR or operating income as an indicator of 
      SIR’s operating performance or as a measure of SIR’s liquidity. These 
      measures should be considered in conjunction with net income, net income 
      attributed to SIR and operating income as presented in SIR’s condensed 
      consolidated statements of income. Other real estate companies and REITs 
      may calculate FFO and Normalized FFO differently than SIR does.
    

      (2) Incentive fees under SIR’s business management agreement with The 
      RMR Group LLC are payable after the end of each calendar year, are 
      calculated based on common share total return, as defined, and are 
      included in general and administrative expenses in SIR’s condensed 
      consolidated statements of income. In calculating net income in 
      accordance with GAAP, SIR recognizes estimated business management 
      incentive fee expense, if any, in the first, second and third quarters. 
      Although SIR recognizes this expense, if any, in the first, second and 
      third quarters for purposes of calculating net income, SIR does not 
      include such expense in the calculation of Normalized FFO attributed to 
      SIR until the fourth quarter, when the amount of the business management 
      incentive fee expense for the calendar year, if any, is determined. 
      Normalized FFO attributed to SIR excludes estimated business management 
      incentive fee expense of $920 for the three months ended June 30, 2017 
      and $8,766 for the six months ended June 30, 2017.
    

      (3) During the three months ended March 31, 2017, SIR recorded a $4,047 
      loss on asset impairment for unamortized lease intangibles related to a 
      lease associated with a tenant bankruptcy at a property located in 
      Hanover, PA.

      (1) The calculations of NOI and Cash Basis NOI exclude certain 
      components of net income in order to provide results that are more 
      closely related to SIR’s property level results of operations. SIR 
      calculates NOI and Cash Basis NOI as shown above. SIR defines NOI as 
      income from its rental of real estate less its property operating 
      expenses. NOI excludes amortization of capitalized tenant improvement 
      costs and leasing commissions because SIR records those amounts as 
      depreciation and amortization. SIR defines Cash Basis NOI as NOI 
      excluding non-cash straight line rent adjustments, lease value 
      amortization, lease termination fees, if any, and non-cash amortization 
      included in other operating expenses. SIR considers NOI and Cash Basis 
      NOI to be appropriate supplemental measures to net income because they 
      may help both investors and management to understand the operations of 
      SIR’s properties. SIR uses NOI and Cash Basis NOI to evaluate individual 
      and company wide property level performance, and SIR believes that NOI 
      and Cash Basis NOI provide useful information to investors regarding its 
      results of operations because they reflect only those income and expense 
      items that are generated and incurred at the property level and may 
      facilitate comparisons of SIR’s operating performance between periods 
      and with other REITs. NOI and Cash Basis NOI do not represent cash 
      generated by operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not 
      be considered as an alternative to net income, net income attributed to 
      SIR or operating income as an indicator of SIR’s operating performance 
      or as a measure of SIR’s liquidity. These measures should be considered 
      in conjunction with net income, net income attributed to SIR and 
      operating income as presented in SIR’s condensed consolidated statements 
      of income. Other real estate companies and REITs may calculate NOI and 
      Cash Basis NOI differently than SIR does.
    

      (2) SIR reports rental income on a straight line basis over the terms of 
      the respective leases; accordingly, rental income includes non-cash 
      straight line rent adjustments. Rental income also includes non-cash 
      amortization of intangible lease assets and liabilities and lease 
      termination fees, if any.
    

      (3) SIR recorded a liability for the amount by which the estimated fair 
      value for accounting purposes exceeded the price SIR paid for its 
      investment in RMR common stock in June 2015. A portion of this liability 
      is being amortized on a straight line basis through December 31, 2035 as 
      a reduction to property management fees, which are included in other 
      operating expenses.
    

      (4) During the three months ended March 31, 2017, SIR recorded a $12,517 
      non-cash write-off of straight line rents receivable related to leases 
      associated with a tenant bankruptcy at two properties located in 
      Huntsville, AL and Hanover, PA and a $4,047 loss on asset impairment for 
      unamortized lease intangibles related to a lease associated with this 
      tenant bankruptcy at the property located in Hanover, PA.

      (1) See footnote (1) on page 7 of this press release for the definitions 
      of NOI and Cash Basis NOI, a description of why SIR believes they are 
      appropriate supplemental measures and a description of how SIR uses 
      these measures.
    

      (2) For the three months ended June 30, 2017, same property NOI and same 
      property Cash Basis NOI are based on properties SIR owned as of June 30, 
      2017, and which it owned continuously since April 1, 2016.
    

      (3) For the six months ended June 30, 2017, same property NOI and same 
      property Cash Basis NOI are based on properties SIR owned as of June 30, 
      2017, and which it owned continuously since January 1, 2016.
    

      (4) SIR reports rental income on a straight line basis over the terms of 
      the respective leases; accordingly, rental income includes non-cash 
      straight line rent adjustments. Rental income also includes non-cash 
      amortization of intangible lease assets and liabilities and lease 
      termination fees, if any.
    

      (5) SIR recorded a liability for the amount by which the estimated fair 
      value for accounting purposes exceeded the price SIR paid for its 
      investment in RMR common stock in June 2015. A portion of this liability 
      is being amortized on a straight line basis through December 31, 2035 as 
      a reduction to property management fees, which are included in other 
      operating expenses.
