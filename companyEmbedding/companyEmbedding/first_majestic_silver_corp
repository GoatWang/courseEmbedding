Market Update It´s been a couple of tough days when silver experienced a flash crash and gold moved below its 200MA at 1,235 USD. But the incredible pessimism among basically all precious metals investors and analysts was a great contrarian signal. Now gold and silver already do look better and I believe we might be right at the beginning of a multi-month bull run that could take gold towards 1,500 USD and silver towards 26,00 USD. While the precious metals sector gets me excited these days the cryptocurrencies are to be handled with great care and skepticism. Obviously the wash out over the last couple of weeks is not over yet although some interesting opportunities do appear already. This recent bull run has been so massive that we have to expect a long and frustrating consolidation for the rest of 2017. But the crypto bull market is not over - it´s just taking a breather and some rest. 2. The Midas Touch Gold Model neutral since 24th of April 2017 

The Midas Touch Gold Model™ remains in neutral mode since 24th of April 2017. There have been a couple of days in July when it was very close to issue a bearish conclusion but it never happened. Now we have new buy signals on the daily chart for gold in US-Dollar, in Indian Rupee and in Chinese Yuan. As well the goldminers (GDX) flashed a buy signal five days ago. The only real concern comes from the CoT-Report for the US-Dollar. Here the commercials have once again reduced their short position which brings this signal close to a sell signal for gold.
 Overall the model still calls for patience although it certainly has improved over the last couple of days. Be aware that it currently takes a move above 1,288 USD to flip the weekly gold chart to a buy signal! 3. Gold - The summer lows are very likely in 

Rarely we can experience such a high level of pessimism like last week. Basically everybody was bearish - even the analysts that I like to follow. Everybody was calling for gold to move below 1,200 USD and even to crash towards 1,100 USD and lower. Although this extrem sentiment has not been reflected by the daily optix data from www.sentimentrader.com it was very obvious if you skipped through most of the precious metals sites and forums. I think this is really great news as it is exactly what I was waiting for in this summer. Yes, I thought gold could hold around 1,235 USD and the lows came in at 1,205 USD but now we have this very oversold set up on the daily and weekly chart in combination with a bullish CoT-Report and a strong seasonal cycle. On top Gold is sitting just 30 USD below its six year downtrend line at around 1,265 USD. It did not loose eye contact and could now finally clear this level in just one or two trading sessions... Especially the weekly oversoldness gives a lot of room for a multi-month rally. Once gold can break out above the 1,260/1,265 USD resistance it should quickly run towards the next resistance around 1,295/1,300 USD. After that the next target is 1,375 USD. And as I have been writing for many months if gold breaks through this depressing six year downtrend line a multi-month bullish liberation rally towards around 1,500 USD until next spring is very likely. Of course I am just cooking with water like everyone else and of course I can not see into the future. Therefore we have to prepare a worst case scenario as well. I think if gold now moves below 1,205 USD it is clear that the correction is not yet over and I´d advise to use 1,200 USD as the ultimate stop loss for any speculative trading positions.
 Physical investor should relax and not worry too much about any possible downside action. Gold will always make a comeback and is currently pretty cheap - especially in Euro! So this is a clear buy recommendation for physical gold and silver at current levels! 4. Silver - Flash crash, capitulation and a huge opportunity 

Silver has been correcting since last July! Yes, that´s 12 months in total... It did not confirm the recent higher highs in gold but remained weak. Yet on Friday 7th of July the tight silver-market experienced a flash crash seeing the September contract dropping 11% within a couple of seconds from 16.14 USD down to 14.34 USD. Certainly another case of high frequency trading, technical glitches, blind algorithmic robots and a very questionable form of manipulation. Fortunately prices quickly recovered and are now back above 16.00 USD. But as worrisome as it may have seem on this Friday I think the silver-market now is cleared from all the weak hands and any stops below the technical important levels around and below 15.80 USD. You would need extremely deep pockets to sit through such a drawdown. So I guess any speculative money has been shaken out...!! And that´s very positive! Of course technically the chart is currently broken but I believe the 12 months correction has ended with a final capitulation that now opens up the door for a new multi-months rally. We are just at the beginning! With the recent flash crash experience in mind it is very clear again that trading silver doesn't make too much sense at all. Instead you should focus on the physical metal and on the silver mining stocks! If gold can indeed move towards 1,500 USD by next spring silver should run towards 26,00 USD. Some of the top silver mining stocks can easily triple or even quintuple during such a move. Therefore I will come up with two new buy recommendations ....
 5. Buy First Majestic Silver up to 8.20 USD (NYSE: AG) 

It´s been the right thing to wait with any recommendation in the mining sector. But now I feel the time is right. As explained I believe silver has a great potential over the next 8-12 months. The most promising way to play a multi-month rally in silver are some of the best but currently beaten down silver mining stocks. First Majestic Silver without a doubt is one of the best companies in this sector. Focused on silver production in Mexico the company is run by mining legend Keith Neumeyer. Here is a very interesting interview with him. Although First Majestic has been consolidating sideways since October last year I think the stock is at a very interesting juncture.  We might be a bit early to the party but the risk/reward is just phenomenal! With a stop loss at 6.50 USD and a 1st profit target at 19.00 USD the idea has an initial 1:7 risk/reward-ratio. But First Majestic could easily take out 19.00 USD and we might scale in a couple more times once the stock has cleared the downtrend-line at 8.20 USD. Buy First Majestic Silver up to 8.20 USD (NYSE: AG) Place a stopp loss at 6.50 USD First profit target 19.00 USD Timeframe 6-12 months Risk/Reward 1:7.4 6. Buy Endeavour Silver Corp. up to 3.20 USD (NYSE: EXK) 

 Another silver stock that I really like and that I have already recommended in the past is Endeavour Silver Corp.. Although Endeavour had some issues in the last couple of months I continue to believe in Bradford Cooke and his team. Endeavour was one of the best performing silver stocks in the first half 2016 and should offer massive leverage in a new silver bull market.
 Technically the stock as corrected back to the 61.8%-retracement around 2.80 USD and is running into a bullish wedge. With a stop loss at 2.60 USD and a 1st profit target at 5.90 USD this idea has an initial risk/reward ratio of 1:7. Buy Endeavour Silver Corp. up to 3.20 USD (NSYE: EXK) Place a stop loss at 2.60 USD First profit target 5.90 USD Timeframe 6-12 months Risk/Reward 1:7.7 8. Cryptocurrencies have entered a multi-month correction 

 The Cryptocurrencies had a spectacular run in the last couple of months. But since mid of June they all moved into a rather nasty correction. Bitcoin went below 2,000 USD already while Ethereum lost more than 65% in six weeks. Yet they are oversold and getting interesting again.  I have been buying IOTA over the last couple of days. It´s up 52% today :-) ! As well I continue to like DASH and STEEM and I have been buying into recent weakness. However it is rather difficult to come up with a decent risk/reward-ratio at the moment. There is no need to rush. Overall the cryptocurrencies have very likely moved into a multi-month correction. So you will need to have a lot of patience and must be very careful with your buying orders. I don't think that the bubble has burst instead this is just another healthy and necessary correction within this great crypto bull market. But it will take time. Most of the weekly charts are not yet oversold. So there is more downside or at least sideways action to expect. Buy BITCOIN below 1.800 USD, Stop loss 950 USD Buy DASH below 120.00 USD, no stop Buy STEEM below 1.00 USD, no stop Timeframe 6-12 months Don´t put more than a maximum of 5% of your networth into cryptocurrencies and only use money you can afford to loose.

Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in AG, EXK over the next 72 hours.

First Majestic Silver: Not Good News - First Majestic Silver Corp. (NYSE:AG) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»First Majestic Silver: Not Good NewsJul.12.17 | About: First Majestic (AG) Gold Mining Bull Long only, gold & precious metals, oil & gas, contrarianMarketplaceThe Gold Bull PortfolioSummaryFirst Majestic Silver announced its Q2 production results.The company produced 3.9 million silver equivalent ounces from its six operating mines in Mexico.Production was impacted by major stoppages at several of its mines.I discuss its production results and where the stock could be headed next.First Majestic: Weak Production Results First Majestic Silver (AG) was previously listed as my top overall silver stock to own in 2017 after taking the No. 4 spot the previous year, and it was given the selection after hours of research and consideration to other companies. I predicted the stock would outperform the silver miners index (SIL) as well as peers such as Endeavor Silver (EXK). I argued that there were numerous catalysts ahead for the growth-focused silver miner, with its 3-5 year goal to produce more than 20 million silver equivalent ounces. Well, First Majestic's growth plans hit a small speed bump this past quarter. The company has released its production results for Q2, and it says total production from its six operating silver mines was 3.9 million SEOs. That consists of 2.3 million ounces of silver, 15,186 ounces of gold, 7.6 million pounds of lead and 0.9 million pounds of zinc. 

 (Credit: First Majestic Silver website) Unfortunately, silver production in Q2 was impacted by "unusual efforts by unionized workers to illegally disrupt mining activities which caused minor stoppages at La Parrilla, Santa Elena and a more serious stoppage at our La Encantada operation," according to the company's CEO. The illegal blockage lasted a total of four days at La Parrilla, two days at Santa Elena and 42 days at La Encantada. He also added that worker dissatisfaction levels among union mining employees in Mexico is "at the highest levels witnessed in the company’s fifteen year history.” This is worrisome as First Majestic only operates in Mexico.
 Its silver production fell by 16% quarter-over-quarter. Gold production rose by 1%, while lead production rose by 2%. Overall, SEO production fell by 9% in Q2. Thankfully, the company's actions to clear the three blockades and resume mining activities were successful, and it now expects production to get back on track in Q3, while its construction of the new roaster at La Encantada was unaffected by the work stoppage, with completion still scheduled for early 2018. Still, I do think this news leaves some question marks and uncertainty around the company's operations. After all, the company has no country diversification, as First Majestic only operates in Mexico and has no plans to diversify. The issues at Santa Elena and La Parilla were quickly resolved, but the issues La Encantada took 42 days to resolve, which is too long. This mine will account for up to 2.9 million SEOs of production in 2017, or approximately 15.6% of its forecasted production. Shares are up Wednesday due to higher gold/silver prices and not due to the production results. I’m still bullish on the company and the stock, and think prices under $8 a share are attractive, but I think the risks have increased with this latest news and I’m a little more cautious with recommending shares here. There are a few other silver miners I'd prefer buying here over First Majestic. Earnings will be released on Thursday, August 3, and I will be analyzing the results and providing early release access to my subscribers. As long-time readers and subscribers of the Gold Bull Portfolio may know, my main focus has mainly been on gold mining stocks, juniors and explorers, with little exposure to silver. This has been a smart move since silver has greatly underperformed gold. While I’m still bullish on silver long term, I think gold is the better bet now.

Derrick Rose will be 6th Man of the Year






23 July 2017, 02:51 | Andy Ferguson


Derrick Rose and the Cleveland Cavaliers are discussing the possibility of a one-year deal according to ESPN. | Matt Marton  Associated Press
 


Earlier this month, Cleveland signed another former Knicks point guard, Jose Calderon, who was sent to Chicago past year in the Rose trade. Also, playing alongside LeBron James and Kyrie Irving in the Eastern Conference would increase Rose's chances of winning his first National Basketball Association title.The Cleveland Cavaliers are in a desperate need of another great player that could help them win the National Basketball Association title next season. Rose was set to take a second meeting with the Bucks, according to an ESPN report a week ago. While Rose has battled injuries and off-court issues in the past, he is still an explosive player with an MVP under his belt and could bring an added dimension to the best team in the East.Header Image: Derrick Rose is in talks with the Cavs on a one-year contract. He played an average of 32.5 minutes last season and shot 47% from the field.

					Britain's Chris Froome , wearing the overall leader's yellow jersey, crosses the finish line in Marseille. Froome has long excelled in it, winning Olympic bronzes in 2012 and 2016.
					Rose's downfall from the league dominant point guard he once was can be pinpointed during a three-year span.The thought in Cleveland is that Rose would play off-the ball, or be the primary back-up point guard for Kyrie Irving. (The NBA covers the difference on one-year minimum deals for veterans.) Regardless of whether they sign Rose, they still have to fill out their roster with at least minimum players. He averaged 10.8 points, 7.8 rebounds and 3.0 blocks in Vegas. Haslem was already the longest-tenured player in Heat history, with all of his National Basketball Association seasons coming for his hometown team. And his 10.1 points in the paint per game tied with Russell Westbrook, behind only DeMar DeRozan's 10.3 per game among guards.

First Majestic was founded in 2002 by president and CEO Keith Neumeyer. In June 2006 First Majestic acquired First Silver Reserve Inc (initially just a controlling stake and within three months it purchased all remaining interest), owner of the San Martin silver property in central Mexico. Then in September 2006 it took control of Desmin, the owner/operator of La Encantada (Coahuila, Mexico) in a US$4.75 million deal (ownership of the mine was purchased through Desmin from Industrias Penoles for US$3.25 million). At the time La Encantada produced 800,000 ounces per year operating at 40% of capacity; the mine was First Majestic's third.[2]
According to the stock chart on its website and the company's profile on the TSX Venture Exchange website, it is listed since 2002 (but the oldest part of the company goes back as far as 1984 (Brandy Resources Inc).
On March 5, 2009 it graduated to the Toronto Stock Exchange with an initial offering of Cdn$25 million.[3] About a year and a half later it joined the New York Stock Exchange (Dec.23, 2010).
In 2009 First Majestic added a fourth silver project when it acquired Normabec Mining Resources Ltd (completed in September). Initially the deal was thought to have included both Mexico's Real de Catorce mine and Quebec's Pitt Gold Property however non Mexican assets (including Pitt Gold) were spun off into a new company called Bionor Resources Inc.[4]
Projects[edit]
There are five in total:

La Encantada has been in the Company's portfolio of assets since 2006 and includes a 4,000 tpd cyanidation mill. It is located in northern Mexico within a couple hundred km of the Mexico-Texas border. The site employs 782 full-time workers (most from the immediate area which is an isolated region). The mill there opened in the summer of 2008 and reached commercial production in April 2010.
La Parrilla consists of mining rights covering 69,460 hectares of land, making it First Majestic's largest land package. The property recently underwent an expansion project that saw the mill capacity increase to 2,000 tpd. Since 1983 the mine (operating continuously) has produced over 25 million ounces of silver (as of 2010).
Del Toro, Chalchihuites, Zacatecas - Del Toro consists of two mine sites; San Juan and Perseverancia. The first phase of the project was inaugurated in January 2013, and the mill began processing at a rate of 1,000 tpd. Further expansions are planned for this project, and it will ultimately reach 4,000 tpd.
San Martin, Jalisco State, Mexico - San Martin produces approximately 1 million ounces of silver annually. It is primarily a silver doré producer.
La Guitarra, Mexico State, Mexico - La Guitarra became First Majestic's fourth producing mine when it was acquired from Vancouver-based Silvermex Resources in July 2012.[5]

Environmental Impacts on Wirikuta[edit]
Wirikuta one of the sacred mountains of the Huichol people, important in their ceremonial migration, Peyote hunt, and deer dance is being purchased for silver mining by First Majestic Silver Corp.[6] On October 27, 2000 United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) claimed this site as a protected area for its importance as a cultural route and endemic flora and fauna species. Before a gathering of 60,000 people at Wirikuta Fest on May 26, 2012, First Majestic silver announced it had returned some of their mining concessions to the national mining reserve to protect Wirikuta, but the Wixarika Regional Council expose this as a farce.[7] Later on June 9, 2001 it was declared as a National Sacred Site under the State of San Luis Potosí's Natural Protection act. Canada's First Majestic Silver Corp still decided to purchase mineral rights on November 13, 2009 with 80% of their interest within the protected land.
The company's current methods includes open pit mining and lixiviation through cyanide, using two kilograms of NaCN per tonne of ore. While open pit mining itself removes entire habitats and landscapes, the addition of sodium cyanide, NaCN, is a lethal method requiring only 0.2 grams to kill a person.[6] In April, 2010 the company also opened a new cyanidation plant in Coahuila, Mexico where it has started producing 3500 tons of cyanide a day to help them expand their mining efforts.[8] Currently the Huicholes are trying to find outside groups to help them in the conservation of their land and culture by protecting this mountain, as well as appealing to the President to honor his agreement to protect their holy sites.[9]

History[edit]
First Majestic was founded in 2002 by president and CEO Keith Neumeyer. In June 2006 First Majestic acquired First Silver Reserve Inc (initially just a controlling stake and within three months it purchased all remaining interest), owner of the San Martin silver property in central Mexico. Then in September 2006 it took control of Desmin, the owner/operator of La Encantada (Coahuila, Mexico) in a US$4.75 million deal (ownership of the mine was purchased through Desmin from Industrias Penoles for US$3.25 million). At the time La Encantada produced 800,000 ounces per year operating at 40% of capacity; the mine was First Majestic's third.[2]
According to the stock chart on its website and the company's profile on the TSX Venture Exchange website, it is listed since 2002 (but the oldest part of the company goes back as far as 1984 (Brandy Resources Inc).
On March 5, 2009 it graduated to the Toronto Stock Exchange with an initial offering of Cdn$25 million.[3] About a year and a half later it joined the New York Stock Exchange (Dec.23, 2010).
In 2009 First Majestic added a fourth silver project when it acquired Normabec Mining Resources Ltd (completed in September). Initially the deal was thought to have included both Mexico's Real de Catorce mine and Quebec's Pitt Gold Property however non Mexican assets (including Pitt Gold) were spun off into a new company called Bionor Resources Inc.[4]
Projects[edit]
There are five in total:

La Encantada has been in the Company's portfolio of assets since 2006 and includes a 4,000 tpd cyanidation mill. It is located in northern Mexico within a couple hundred km of the Mexico-Texas border. The site employs 782 full-time workers (most from the immediate area which is an isolated region). The mill there opened in the summer of 2008 and reached commercial production in April 2010.
La Parrilla consists of mining rights covering 69,460 hectares of land, making it First Majestic's largest land package. The property recently underwent an expansion project that saw the mill capacity increase to 2,000 tpd. Since 1983 the mine (operating continuously) has produced over 25 million ounces of silver (as of 2010).
Del Toro, Chalchihuites, Zacatecas - Del Toro consists of two mine sites; San Juan and Perseverancia. The first phase of the project was inaugurated in January 2013, and the mill began processing at a rate of 1,000 tpd. Further expansions are planned for this project, and it will ultimately reach 4,000 tpd.
San Martin, Jalisco State, Mexico - San Martin produces approximately 1 million ounces of silver annually. It is primarily a silver doré producer.
La Guitarra, Mexico State, Mexico - La Guitarra became First Majestic's fourth producing mine when it was acquired from Vancouver-based Silvermex Resources in July 2012.[5]

Environmental Impacts on Wirikuta[edit]
Wirikuta one of the sacred mountains of the Huichol people, important in their ceremonial migration, Peyote hunt, and deer dance is being purchased for silver mining by First Majestic Silver Corp.[6] On October 27, 2000 United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) claimed this site as a protected area for its importance as a cultural route and endemic flora and fauna species. Before a gathering of 60,000 people at Wirikuta Fest on May 26, 2012, First Majestic silver announced it had returned some of their mining concessions to the national mining reserve to protect Wirikuta, but the Wixarika Regional Council expose this as a farce.[7] Later on June 9, 2001 it was declared as a National Sacred Site under the State of San Luis Potosí's Natural Protection act. Canada's First Majestic Silver Corp still decided to purchase mineral rights on November 13, 2009 with 80% of their interest within the protected land.
The company's current methods includes open pit mining and lixiviation through cyanide, using two kilograms of NaCN per tonne of ore. While open pit mining itself removes entire habitats and landscapes, the addition of sodium cyanide, NaCN, is a lethal method requiring only 0.2 grams to kill a person.[6] In April, 2010 the company also opened a new cyanidation plant in Coahuila, Mexico where it has started producing 3500 tons of cyanide a day to help them expand their mining efforts.[8] Currently the Huicholes are trying to find outside groups to help them in the conservation of their land and culture by protecting this mountain, as well as appealing to the President to honor his agreement to protect their holy sites.[9]

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

History[edit]
First Majestic was founded in 2002 by president and CEO Keith Neumeyer. In June 2006 First Majestic acquired First Silver Reserve Inc (initially just a controlling stake and within three months it purchased all remaining interest), owner of the San Martin silver property in central Mexico. Then in September 2006 it took control of Desmin, the owner/operator of La Encantada (Coahuila, Mexico) in a US$4.75 million deal (ownership of the mine was purchased through Desmin from Industrias Penoles for US$3.25 million). At the time La Encantada produced 800,000 ounces per year operating at 40% of capacity; the mine was First Majestic's third.[2]
According to the stock chart on its website and the company's profile on the TSX Venture Exchange website, it is listed since 2002 (but the oldest part of the company goes back as far as 1984 (Brandy Resources Inc).
On March 5, 2009 it graduated to the Toronto Stock Exchange with an initial offering of Cdn$25 million.[3] About a year and a half later it joined the New York Stock Exchange (Dec.23, 2010).
In 2009 First Majestic added a fourth silver project when it acquired Normabec Mining Resources Ltd (completed in September). Initially the deal was thought to have included both Mexico's Real de Catorce mine and Quebec's Pitt Gold Property however non Mexican assets (including Pitt Gold) were spun off into a new company called Bionor Resources Inc.[4]
Projects[edit]
There are five in total:

La Encantada has been in the Company's portfolio of assets since 2006 and includes a 4,000 tpd cyanidation mill. It is located in northern Mexico within a couple hundred km of the Mexico-Texas border. The site employs 782 full-time workers (most from the immediate area which is an isolated region). The mill there opened in the summer of 2008 and reached commercial production in April 2010.
La Parrilla consists of mining rights covering 69,460 hectares of land, making it First Majestic's largest land package. The property recently underwent an expansion project that saw the mill capacity increase to 2,000 tpd. Since 1983 the mine (operating continuously) has produced over 25 million ounces of silver (as of 2010).
Del Toro, Chalchihuites, Zacatecas - Del Toro consists of two mine sites; San Juan and Perseverancia. The first phase of the project was inaugurated in January 2013, and the mill began processing at a rate of 1,000 tpd. Further expansions are planned for this project, and it will ultimately reach 4,000 tpd.
San Martin, Jalisco State, Mexico - San Martin produces approximately 1 million ounces of silver annually. It is primarily a silver doré producer.
La Guitarra, Mexico State, Mexico - La Guitarra became First Majestic's fourth producing mine when it was acquired from Vancouver-based Silvermex Resources in July 2012.[5]

Environmental Impacts on Wirikuta[edit]
Wirikuta one of the sacred mountains of the Huichol people, important in their ceremonial migration, Peyote hunt, and deer dance is being purchased for silver mining by First Majestic Silver Corp.[6] On October 27, 2000 United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) claimed this site as a protected area for its importance as a cultural route and endemic flora and fauna species. Before a gathering of 60,000 people at Wirikuta Fest on May 26, 2012, First Majestic silver announced it had returned some of their mining concessions to the national mining reserve to protect Wirikuta, but the Wixarika Regional Council expose this as a farce.[7] Later on June 9, 2001 it was declared as a National Sacred Site under the State of San Luis Potosí's Natural Protection act. Canada's First Majestic Silver Corp still decided to purchase mineral rights on November 13, 2009 with 80% of their interest within the protected land.
The company's current methods includes open pit mining and lixiviation through cyanide, using two kilograms of NaCN per tonne of ore. While open pit mining itself removes entire habitats and landscapes, the addition of sodium cyanide, NaCN, is a lethal method requiring only 0.2 grams to kill a person.[6] In April, 2010 the company also opened a new cyanidation plant in Coahuila, Mexico where it has started producing 3500 tons of cyanide a day to help them expand their mining efforts.[8] Currently the Huicholes are trying to find outside groups to help them in the conservation of their land and culture by protecting this mountain, as well as appealing to the President to honor his agreement to protect their holy sites.[9]

While open pit mining itself removes entire habitats and landscapes, the addition of sodium cyanide, NaCN, is a lethal method requiring only 0.2 grams to kill a person.[6] In April, 2010 the company also opened a new cyanidation plant in Coahuila, Mexico where it has started producing 3500 tons of cyanide a day to help them expand their mining efforts.[8] Currently the Huicholes are trying to find outside groups to help them in the conservation of their land and culture by protecting this mountain, as well as appealing to the President to honor his agreement to protect their holy sites.[9]
