Investment Approach

We seek long term capital appreciation by investing in emerging market countries where economies are developing strongly and markets are becoming more sophisticated. We believe that future economic growth matters a great deal for stock returns and that identifying those countries where growth will beat expectations over three to five years is critical to amplifying the portfolio's potential returns. We seek to translate our original macro-thematic research and fundamental bottom-up analysis into a growth-oriented portfolio.

Where the net expense ratio is lower than the gross expense ratio, certain fees have been waived and/or expenses reimbursed. These waivers and/or reimbursements will continue for at least one year from the date of the applicable fund’s current prospectus (unless otherwise noted in the applicable prospectus) or until such time as the fund's Board of Directors /Trustees acts to discontinue all or a portion of such waivers and/or reimbursements. Absent such waivers and/or reimbursements, returns would have been lower. Expenses are based on the fund's current annual report.
Growth of Investment illustration is based on an initial investment of $10,000 made since fund inception, assumes reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, but does not include sales charges and fees. Performance would have been lower if sales charges and fees had been included. Results are hypothetical.
Please keep in mind that high double-digit returns are highly unusual and cannot be sustained. Investors should also be aware that these returns were primarily achieved during favorable market conditions. 
The Net Asset Value (NAV) per share is determined by dividing the value of the fund's portfolio securities, cash and other assets, less all liabilities, by the total number of common shares outstanding. The common share market price is the price the market is willing to pay for shares of the fund at a given time. Total return assumes an investment at the beginning of the period, reinvestment of all distributions for the period in accordance with the fund's dividend reinvestment plan, and sale of all shares at the end of the period.
Subject to change daily. Fund information and Portfolio Composition are provided for informational purposes only, and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell any security or securities in the sectors and countries presented. Monthly Holdings are updated 15 calendar days after month-end.
The repurchase information only represents shares repurchased as part of a share repurchase program and does not account for any shares repurchased through a tender offer.
RISK CONSIDERATIONS
There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the portfolio will decline and that the value of portfolio shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this portfolio. Please be aware that this portfolio may be subject to certain additional risks. Share prices also tend to be volatile and there is a significant possibility of loss. Concentration in a single region may make the portfolio more volatile than one that invests globally. In general, equities securities’ values also fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency, political, economic, market and liquidity risks. The risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than the risks generally associated with investments in foreign developed countries. Derivative instruments may disproportionately increase losses and have a significant impact on performance. They also may be subject to counterparty, liquidity, valuation, correlation and market risks. Illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than public traded securities (liquidity risk).

MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MSCI EM) – is a free float-adjusted market capitalization weighted index that is designed to measure equity market performance of emerging markets. The index does not include any expenses, fees or sales charges, which would have lower performance. The index is unmanaged and should not be considered an investment. It is not possible to invest directly in an index.
Closed end funds, unlike open end funds, are not continuously offered. There is a one-time public offering and once issued, shares of closed end funds are sold in the open market through a stock exchange. NAV per share is determined by dividing the value of the trust's portfolio securities, cash and other assets, less all liabilities and preferred shares, by the total number of common shares outstanding. The common share market price is the price the market is willing to pay for shares of the trust at a given time.

Morgan Stanley Investment Management (MSIM) is the asset management division of Morgan Stanley.


 






 

  WAM is the weighted average maturity of the portfolio. The WAM calculation utilizes the interest-rate reset date, rather than a security's stated final maturity, for variable- and floating- rate securities. By looking to a portfolio's interest rate reset schedule in lieu of final maturity dates, the WAM measure effectively captures a fund's exposure to interest rate movements and the potential price impact resulting from interest rate movements.
 


  WAL is the weighted average life of the portfolio. The WAL calculation utilizes a security's stated final maturity date or, when relevant, the date of the next demand feature when the fund may receive payment of principal and interest (such as a put feature). Accordingly, WAL reflects how a portfolio would react to deteriorating credit (widening spreads) or tightening liquidity conditions.
 


  Tracking error and information ratio are calculated using the Portfolio's Blended Index (added October 2, 2013), as this is a better representation of the Portfolio's global multi-asset strategy. The investment team manages the Portfolio relative to this Blended Index.
 


  Excess return versus Custom Benchmark is calculated using the Portfolio's Blended Index based on the period since it was added as a benchmark on October 2, 2013.

Important Disclosure

Unless otherwise stated, portfolio facts and statistics are shown for Class A shares; other classes may have different characteristics.

†NAV: Unless you are eligible for a waiver, the public offering price you pay when you buy Class A shares of the Fund is the Net Asset Value (NAV) of the shares plus an initial sales charge. The initial sales charge varies depending upon the size of your purchase.  No sales charge is imposed where Class A or Class C shares are issued to you pursuant to the automatic investment of income dividends or capital gains distributions. It is the responsibility of the financial intermediary to ensure that the investor obtains the proper “breakpoint” discount. Class C, Class I and Class Y do not have an initial sales charge; however, Class C does charge a contingent deferred redemption charge.  See the 
        
    prospectus and summary prospectus for more information.
1Van Eck Associates Corporation (the “Adviser”) has agreed to waive fees and/or pay Fund expenses to the extent necessary to prevent the operating expenses of the Fund (excluding acquired fund fees and expenses, interest expense, trading expenses, dividends and interest payments on securities sold short, taxes and extraordinary expenses) from exceeding 1.60% for Class A, 2.50% for Class C, 1.00% for Class I, and 1.10% for Class Y of the Fund’s average daily net assets per year until May 1, 2018. During such time, the
        expense limitation is expected to continue until the Board of Trustees acts to discontinue all or a portion of such expense limitation.

2The Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) Emerging Markets Index is a free float-adjusted market capitalization index that is designed to measure equity market performance of emerging markets. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index consists of the following 23 emerging market country indices: Brazil, Chile, China, Colombia, Czech Republic, Egypt, Greece, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Qatar, Russia, South Africa, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey and United Arab Emirates.
        The MSCI Emerging Markets Investment Market Index (MSCI EM IMI) is a free float adjusted market capitalization index that is designed to capture large-, mid- and small-cap representation across 23 emerging markets countries. Emerging Markets countries include: Brazil, Chile, China, Colombia, Czech Republic, Egypt, Greece, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Russia, Qatar, South Africa, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey and United Arab Emirates.
The views and opinions expressed are those of VanEck. Fund manager commentaries are general in nature and should not be construed as investment advice. Opinions are subject to change with market conditions. Any discussion of specific securities mentioned in the commentaries is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation to buy these securities. Fund holdings will vary.
You can lose money by investing in the Fund. Any investment in the Fund should be part of an overall investment program, not a complete program. The Fund is subject to the risks associated with its investments in emerging markets securities, which tend to be more volatile and less liquid than securities traded in developed countries. The Fund’s investments in foreign securities involve risks related to adverse political and economic developments unique to a country or a region, currency fluctuations or controls, and the possibility of arbitrary action by foreign governments, including the takeover of property without adequate compensation or imposition of prohibitive taxation. The Fund is subject to risks associated with investments in debt securities, derivatives, commodity-linked instruments, illiquid securities, asset-backed securities, CMOs and small or mid-cap companies. The Fund is also subject to inflation risk, short-sales risk, market risk, non-diversification risk and leverage risk. Please see the 
        
    prospectus and summary prospectus for information on these and other risk considerations.
Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal. An investor should consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the investment company carefully before investing. The prospectus and summary prospectus contain this and other information.  Please read them carefully before investing.

Important Disclosure

Unless otherwise stated, portfolio facts and statistics are shown for Class A shares; other classes may have different characteristics.

†NAV: Unless you are eligible for a waiver, the public offering price you pay when you buy Class A shares of the Fund is the Net Asset Value (NAV) of the shares plus an initial sales charge. The initial sales charge varies depending upon the size of your purchase.  No sales charge is imposed where Class A or Class C shares are issued to you pursuant to the automatic investment of income dividends or capital gains distributions. It is the responsibility of the financial intermediary to ensure that the investor obtains the proper “breakpoint” discount. Class C, Class I and Class Y do not have an initial sales charge; however, Class C does charge a contingent deferred redemption charge.  See the 
        
    prospectus and summary prospectus for more information.
1Van Eck Associates Corporation (the “Adviser”) has agreed to waive fees and/or pay Fund expenses to the extent necessary to prevent the operating expenses of the Fund (excluding acquired fund fees and expenses, interest expense, trading expenses, dividends and interest payments on securities sold short, taxes and extraordinary expenses) from exceeding 1.60% for Class A, 2.50% for Class C, 1.00% for Class I, and 1.10% for Class Y of the Fund’s average daily net assets per year until May 1, 2018. During such time, the
        expense limitation is expected to continue until the Board of Trustees acts to discontinue all or a portion of such expense limitation.

2The Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) Emerging Markets Index is a free float-adjusted market capitalization index that is designed to measure equity market performance of emerging markets. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index consists of the following 23 emerging market country indices: Brazil, Chile, China, Colombia, Czech Republic, Egypt, Greece, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Qatar, Russia, South Africa, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey and United Arab Emirates.
        The MSCI Emerging Markets Investment Market Index (MSCI EM IMI) is a free float adjusted market capitalization index that is designed to capture large-, mid- and small-cap representation across 23 emerging markets countries. Emerging Markets countries include: Brazil, Chile, China, Colombia, Czech Republic, Egypt, Greece, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Russia, Qatar, South Africa, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey and United Arab Emirates.
The views and opinions expressed are those of VanEck. Fund manager commentaries are general in nature and should not be construed as investment advice. Opinions are subject to change with market conditions. Any discussion of specific securities mentioned in the commentaries is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation to buy these securities. Fund holdings will vary.
You can lose money by investing in the Fund. Any investment in the Fund should be part of an overall investment program, not a complete program. The Fund is subject to the risks associated with its investments in emerging markets securities, which tend to be more volatile and less liquid than securities traded in developed countries. The Fund’s investments in foreign securities involve risks related to adverse political and economic developments unique to a country or a region, currency fluctuations or controls, and the possibility of arbitrary action by foreign governments, including the takeover of property without adequate compensation or imposition of prohibitive taxation. The Fund is subject to risks associated with investments in debt securities, derivatives, commodity-linked instruments, illiquid securities, asset-backed securities, CMOs and small or mid-cap companies. The Fund is also subject to inflation risk, short-sales risk, market risk, non-diversification risk and leverage risk. Please see the 
        
    prospectus and summary prospectus for information on these and other risk considerations.
Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal. An investor should consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the investment company carefully before investing. The prospectus and summary prospectus contain this and other information.  Please read them carefully before investing.

Important Morningstar Information


The Morningstar Rating™
		 for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The Morningstar Rating does not include any adjustment for sales loads. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. Ratings may vary by share class.	

		Ratings and/or rankings may be based, in part, on the performance of a predecessor fund or share class and are calculated by Morningstar using a methodology that differs from that used by Janus Henderson. Methodology differences may have a material effect on the return and therefore the rating/ranking.	

		When an expense waiver is in effect, it may have a material effect on the total return or yield, and therefore the ranking and/or rating for the period.	

The Morningstar Equity Style Box™
		 reveals a fund's investment strategy. For equity funds the vertical axis shows the market capitalization of the stocks owned and the horizontal axis shows investment style (value, blend or growth).	

The Morningstar Fixed-Income Style Box™
		 reveals a fund's investment style as of the date noted. For fixed-income funds, the vertical axis shows the credit quality of the bonds owned and the horizontal axis shows interest rate sensitivity as measured by a bond's effective duration.	

		Morningstar seeks credit rating information from fund companies on a periodic basis (e.g., quarterly). In compiling credit rating information Morningstar accepts credit ratings reported by fund companies that have been issued by all Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations (NRSROs). For a list of all NRSROs, please visit https://www.sec.gov/ocr/ratingagency.html. Additionally, Morningstar accepts foreign credit ratings from widely recognized or registered rating agencies. If two rating organizations/agencies have rated a security, fund companies are to report the lower rating; if three or more organizations/agencies have rated a security, fund companies are to report the median rating, and in cases where there are more than two organization/agency ratings and a median rating does not exist, fund companies are to use the lower of the two middle ratings. PLEASE NOTE: Morningstar, Inc. is not itself a NRSRO nor does it issue a credit rating on the fund. A NRSRO or rating agency ratings can change from time-to-time.	

		For credit quality, Morningstar combines the credit rating information provided by the fund companies with an average default rate calculation to come up with a weighted-average credit quality. The weighted-average credit quality is currently a letter that roughly corresponds to the scale used by a leading NRSRO. Bond funds are assigned a style box placement of "low", "medium", or "high" based on their average credit quality. Funds with a low credit quality are those whose weighted-average credit quality is determined to be less than "BBB-"; medium are those less than "AA-", but greater or equal to "BBB-"; and high are those with a weighted-average credit quality of "AA-" or higher. When classifying a bond portfolio, Morningstar first maps the NRSRO credit ratings of the underlying holdings to their respective default rates (as determined by Morningstar's analysis of actual historical default rates). Morningstar then averages these default rates to determine the average default rate for the entire bond fund. Finally, Morningstar maps this average default rate to its corresponding credit rating along a convex curve.	

		For interest-rate sensitivity, Morningstar obtains from fund companies the average effective duration. Generally, Morningstar classifies a fixed-income fund's interest-rate sensitivity based on the effective duration of the Morningstar Core Bond Index (MCBI), which is currently three years. The classification of Limited will be assigned to those funds whose average effective duration is between 25% to 75% of MCBI's average effective duration; funds whose average effective duration is between 75% to 125% of the MCBI will be classified as Moderate; and those that are at 125% or greater of the average effective duration of the MCBI will be classified as Extensive.	

The Morningstar Analyst Rating
		 is not a credit or risk rating.  It is a subjective evaluation performed by the mutual fund analysts of Morningstar, Inc.  Morningstar evaluates funds based on five key unequally weighted pillars, which are process, performance, people, parent and price.  Morningstar’s analysts use this five pillar evaluation to identify funds they believe are more likely to outperform over the long term on a risk-adjusted basis.  Analysts consider quantitative and qualitative factors in their research, but the assessment of each pillar and how they are combined is driven by the analyst’s overall assessment and overseen by Morningstar’s Analyst Rating Committee.  The approach serves not as a formula but as a framework to ensure consistency across Morningstar’s global coverage universe.	

		The Analyst Rating scale ranges from Gold to Negative, with Gold being the highest rating and Negative being the lowest rating.  A fund with a “Gold” rating distinguishes itself across the five pillars and has garnered the analysts’ highest level of conviction.  A fund with a ‘Silver’ rating has notable advantages across several, but perhaps not all, of the five pillars-strengths that give the analysts a high level of conviction.  A “Bronze” rated fund has advantages that outweigh the disadvantages across the five pillars, with sufficient level of analyst conviction to warrant a positive rating.  A fund with a “Neutral” rating isn't seriously flawed across the five pillars, nor does it distinguish itself very positively.  A “Negative” rated fund is flawed in at least one, if not more pillars and is considered an inferior offering to its peers.  Analyst Ratings are reevaluated every 14 months. For more detailed information about Morningstar’s Analyst Rating, including its methodology, please go to http://corporate.morningstar.com/us/documents/MethodologyDocuments/AnalystRatingforFundsMethodology.pdf.	

The Morningstar Analyst Rating should not be used as the sole basis in evaluating a mutual fund.  Morningstar Analyst Ratings are based on Morningstar’s current expectations about future events; therefore, in no way does Morningstar represent ratings as a guarantee nor should they be viewed by an investor as such.  Morningstar Analyst Ratings involve unknown risks and uncertainties which may cause Morningstar’s expectations not to occur or to differ significantly from what we expected.

							Overview						


Client Commitment
A Fund that aims to achieve a long-term return in excess of the return that is typically achieved from emerging equity markets. The investment team is comprised of bottom-up investors seeking to create high-conviction portfolios of reasonably valued, high-quality companies.
Why Invest in the Fund

Broad Opportunity Set
The investment team researches companies with significant emerging market economic exposure regardless of listing domicile, rather than just companies listed in emerging market indices.
Long Term, Quality Focus
The investment team considers companies on the basis that the stocks would be bought and held for five years – allowing the team to select companies in the absence of short-term market noise. The team prefers to focus on quality companies with proven track records, strong franchises and management teams with a history of integrity.
High Conviction
The Fund typically holds 40-80 stocks. The top 10 holdings generally make up 30-50% of the portfolio.

It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The Morningstar Rating does not include any adjustment for sales loads. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. Ratings may vary by share class.	

		Ratings and/or rankings may be based, in part, on the performance of a predecessor fund or share class and are calculated by Morningstar using a methodology that differs from that used by Janus Henderson. Methodology differences may have a material effect on the return and therefore the rating/ranking.	

		When an expense waiver is in effect, it may have a material effect on the total return or yield, and therefore the ranking and/or rating for the period.	

The Morningstar Equity Style Box™
		 reveals a fund's investment strategy. For equity funds the vertical axis shows the market capitalization of the stocks owned and the horizontal axis shows investment style (value, blend or growth).	

The Morningstar Fixed-Income Style Box™
		 reveals a fund's investment style as of the date noted. For fixed-income funds, the vertical axis shows the credit quality of the bonds owned and the horizontal axis shows interest rate sensitivity as measured by a bond's effective duration.	

		Morningstar seeks credit rating information from fund companies on a periodic basis (e.g., quarterly). In compiling credit rating information Morningstar accepts credit ratings reported by fund companies that have been issued by all Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations (NRSROs). For a list of all NRSROs, please visit https://www.sec.gov/ocr/ratingagency.html. Additionally, Morningstar accepts foreign credit ratings from widely recognized or registered rating agencies. If two rating organizations/agencies have rated a security, fund companies are to report the lower rating; if three or more organizations/agencies have rated a security, fund companies are to report the median rating, and in cases where there are more than two organization/agency ratings and a median rating does not exist, fund companies are to use the lower of the two middle ratings. PLEASE NOTE: Morningstar, Inc. is not itself a NRSRO nor does it issue a credit rating on the fund. A NRSRO or rating agency ratings can change from time-to-time.	

		For credit quality, Morningstar combines the credit rating information provided by the fund companies with an average default rate calculation to come up with a weighted-average credit quality. The weighted-average credit quality is currently a letter that roughly corresponds to the scale used by a leading NRSRO. Bond funds are assigned a style box placement of "low", "medium", or "high" based on their average credit quality. Funds with a low credit quality are those whose weighted-average credit quality is determined to be less than "BBB-"; medium are those less than "AA-", but greater or equal to "BBB-"; and high are those with a weighted-average credit quality of "AA-" or higher. When classifying a bond portfolio, Morningstar first maps the NRSRO credit ratings of the underlying holdings to their respective default rates (as determined by Morningstar's analysis of actual historical default rates). Morningstar then averages these default rates to determine the average default rate for the entire bond fund. Finally, Morningstar maps this average default rate to its corresponding credit rating along a convex curve.	

		For interest-rate sensitivity, Morningstar obtains from fund companies the average effective duration. Generally, Morningstar classifies a fixed-income fund's interest-rate sensitivity based on the effective duration of the Morningstar Core Bond Index (MCBI), which is currently three years. The classification of Limited will be assigned to those funds whose average effective duration is between 25% to 75% of MCBI's average effective duration; funds whose average effective duration is between 75% to 125% of the MCBI will be classified as Moderate; and those that are at 125% or greater of the average effective duration of the MCBI will be classified as Extensive.	

The Morningstar Analyst Rating
		 is not a credit or risk rating.  It is a subjective evaluation performed by the mutual fund analysts of Morningstar, Inc.  Morningstar evaluates funds based on five key unequally weighted pillars, which are process, performance, people, parent and price.  Morningstar’s analysts use this five pillar evaluation to identify funds they believe are more likely to outperform over the long term on a risk-adjusted basis.  Analysts consider quantitative and qualitative factors in their research, but the assessment of each pillar and how they are combined is driven by the analyst’s overall assessment and overseen by Morningstar’s Analyst Rating Committee.  The approach serves not as a formula but as a framework to ensure consistency across Morningstar’s global coverage universe.	

		The Analyst Rating scale ranges from Gold to Negative, with Gold being the highest rating and Negative being the lowest rating.  A fund with a “Gold” rating distinguishes itself across the five pillars and has garnered the analysts’ highest level of conviction.  A fund with a ‘Silver’ rating has notable advantages across several, but perhaps not all, of the five pillars-strengths that give the analysts a high level of conviction.  A “Bronze” rated fund has advantages that outweigh the disadvantages across the five pillars, with sufficient level of analyst conviction to warrant a positive rating.  A fund with a “Neutral” rating isn't seriously flawed across the five pillars, nor does it distinguish itself very positively.  A “Negative” rated fund is flawed in at least one, if not more pillars and is considered an inferior offering to its peers.  Analyst Ratings are reevaluated every 14 months. For more detailed information about Morningstar’s Analyst Rating, including its methodology, please go to http://corporate.morningstar.com/us/documents/MethodologyDocuments/AnalystRatingforFundsMethodology.pdf.	

The Morningstar Analyst Rating should not be used as the sole basis in evaluating a mutual fund.  Morningstar Analyst Ratings are based on Morningstar’s current expectations about future events; therefore, in no way does Morningstar represent ratings as a guarantee nor should they be viewed by an investor as such.  Morningstar Analyst Ratings involve unknown risks and uncertainties which may cause Morningstar’s expectations not to occur or to differ significantly from what we expected.

Who Should Consider this Fund?
Investors looking for long-term exposure to emerging market companies. 
Risk Tolerance Spectrum


very aggressive
Janus Henderson funds are classified as very aggressive if their share prices are expected to fluctuate significantly over time. This can include funds that have concentrated exposure to small number of stocks, industry sectors, or geographic regions. May be appropriate for a portfolio with a longer-term investment horizon with a primary emphasis on growth or a very aggressive portion in an overall portfolio.



Funds are placed on the risk tolerance spectrum to demonstrate the wide spectrum of risk levels among asset classes in which they are expected to typically invest. The spectrum is for informational purposes only, is not intended to be forward looking and is subject to change.






							Overview						


Client Commitment
A Fund that aims to achieve a long-term return in excess of the return that is typically achieved from emerging equity markets. The investment team is comprised of bottom-up investors seeking to create high-conviction portfolios of reasonably valued, high-quality companies.
Why Invest in the Fund

Broad Opportunity Set
The investment team researches companies with significant emerging market economic exposure regardless of listing domicile, rather than just companies listed in emerging market indices.
Long Term, Quality Focus
The investment team considers companies on the basis that the stocks would be bought and held for five years – allowing the team to select companies in the absence of short-term market noise. The team prefers to focus on quality companies with proven track records, strong franchises and management teams with a history of integrity.
High Conviction
The Fund typically holds 40-80 stocks. The top 10 holdings generally make up 30-50% of the portfolio.

			As of 06/30/2017 the Fund had an overall rating of 2 stars out of 634 funds and was rated 3 stars out of 634 funds, 2 stars out of 436 funds and N/A stars out of 178 funds for the 3-, 5- and 10- year periods, respectively.
		

Morningstar details

Source: Morningstar Inc. Ratings are based on a risk-adjusted return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. Open-end mutual funds and exchange-traded funds are considered a single population for comparison purposes. Ratings are calculated for funds with at least a three year history. The overall rating is derived from a weighted average of three-, five- and 10-year rating metrics, as applicable, excluding sales charges and including fees and expenses. ©2017 Morningstar Inc. All rights reserved. The information contained herein is proprietary to Morningstar and/or its content providers. It may not be copied or distributed and is not warranted to be accurate, complete or timely. Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The top 10% of funds in a category receive five stars, the next 22.5% four stars, the next 35% three stars, the next 22.5% two stars and the bottom 10% one star. Ratings are subject to change monthly. Had fees not been waived and/or expenses reimbursed currently or in the past, the Morningstar rating would have been lower. Ratings for other share classes may differ due to different performance characteristics.

		Performance quoted is past performance and cannot guarantee comparable future results; current performance may be lower or higher. Investment return and principal value will vary so that you may have a gain or a loss when you sell shares. 


		
		Performance figures reflect reinvested distributions and changes in net asset value (NAV) and the effect of the maximum sales charge unless otherwise stated.


		
		No contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC) will be imposed on redemptions of Class C shares following one year from the date shares were purchased. Performance shown at NAV does not include sales charges, which would have reduced the performance.


Had fees not been waived and/or expenses reimbursed currently or in the past, returns would have been lower.

 About risk
			 


Depositary Receipts Risk. Investing in depositary receipts involves the same risks as direct investments in foreign securities. In addition, the underlying issuers of certain depositary receipts are under no obligation to distribute shareholder communications or pass through any voting rights with respect to the deposited securities to the holders of such receipts. The Fund may therefore receive less timely information or have less control than if it invested directly in the foreign issuer.
Emerging Markets Securities Risk. Emerging markets (also referred to as developing markets) are generally subject to greater market volatility, political, social and economic instability, uncertain trading markets and more governmental limitations on foreign investment than more developed markets. In addition, emerging markets may be subject to lower trading volume and greater price fluctuations than companies in more developed markets. Securities law and the enforcement of systems of taxation in many emerging market countries may change quickly and unpredictably. In addition, investments in emerging markets securities may also be subject to additional transaction costs, delays in settlement procedures, and lack of timely information.
Foreign Securities Risk. The Fund's foreign investments may be adversely affected by political and social instability, changes in economic or taxation policies, difficulty in enforcing obligations, decreased liquidity or increased volatility. Foreign investments also involve the risk of the possible seizure, nationalization or expropriation of the issuer or foreign deposits (in which the Fund could lose its entire investments in a certain market) and the possible adoption of foreign governmental restrictions such as exchange controls. Unless the Fund has hedged its foreign securities risk, foreign securities risk also involves the risk of negative foreign currency rate fluctuations, which may cause the value of securities denominated in such foreign currency (or other instruments through which the Fund has exposure to foreign currencies) to decline in value. Currency exchange rates may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time. Currency hedging strategies, if used, are not always successful.
Geographic Focus Risk. The Fund may from time to time invest a substantial amount of its assets in securities of issuers located in a single country or a limited number of countries. Adverse economic, political or social conditions in those countries may therefore have a significant negative impact on the Fund's investment performance.
Management Risk. The Fund is actively managed and depends heavily on the Adviser's judgment about markets, interest rates or the attractiveness, relative values, liquidity, or potential appreciation of particular investments made for the Fund's portfolio. The Fund could experience losses if these judgments prove to be incorrect. Additionally, legislative, regulatory, or tax developments may adversely affect management of the Fund and, therefore, the ability of the Fund to achieve its investment objective.
Market Risk. The market values of the Fund's investments, and therefore the value of the Fund's shares, will go up and down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. Market risk may affect a single issuer, industry or section of the economy, or it may affect the market as a whole. Individual stock prices tend to go up and down more dramatically than those of certain other types of investments, such as bonds. During a general downturn in the financial markets, multiple asset classes may decline in value. When markets perform well, there can be no assurance that specific investments held by the Fund will rise in value.
Preferred Securities Risk. Preferred securities are subject to issuer-specific and market risks applicable generally to equity securities. Preferred securities also may be subordinated to bonds or other debt instruments, subjecting them to a greater risk of non-payment, may be less liquid than many other securities, such as common stocks, and generally offer no voting rights with respect to the issuer.
Sector Focus Risk. The Fund may from time to time invest a significant amount of its assets (i.e. over 25%) in one market sector or group of related industries. In this event, the Fund's performance will depend to a greater extent on the overall condition of the sector or group of industries and there is increased risk that the Fund will lose significant value if conditions adversely affect that sector or group of industries.
Small- and Mid-Capitalization Companies Risks. Small- and mid-capitalization companies tend to be more vulnerable to changing market conditions, may have little or no operating history or track record of success, and may have more limited product lines and markets, less experienced management and fewer financial resources than larger companies. These companies' securities may be more volatile and less liquid than those of more established companies, and their returns may vary, sometimes significantly, from the overall securities market.
Value Investing Style Risk. A value investing style subjects the Fund to the risk that the valuations never improve or that the returns on value equity securities are less than returns on other styles of investing or the overall stock market.

P/E Ratio
The price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is a fundamental measure used to determine if an investment is valued appropriately. Each holding&#39;s P/E is the latest closing price divided by the latest fiscal year&#39;s earnings per share. Negative P/E ratios are excluded from this calculation.

as of 27-Jul-2017



15.19




P/B Ratio
The price-to-book value (P/B) ratio is a fundamental measure used to determine if an investment is valued appropriately. The book value of a company is a measure of how much a company&#39;s assets are worth assuming the company&#39;s debts are paid off. Each holding&#39;s P/B is the latest closing price divided by the latest fiscal year&#39;s book value per share. Negative book values are excluded from this calculation.

as of 27-Jul-2017



1.71




Equity Beta
Beta is a measure of the tendency of securities to move with the market as a whole. A beta of 1 indicates that the security&#39;s price will move with the market. A beta less than 1 indicates the security tends to be less volatile than the market, while a beta greater than 1 indicates the security is more volatile than the market.<br/><br/>Calculated vs. S&amp;P 500

as of 30-Jun-2017

Standard Deviation (3y)
Standard deviation measures how dispersed returns are around the average. A higher standard deviation indicates that returns are spread out over a larger range of values and thus, more volatile.

as of 30-Jun-2017



16.07%




Distribution Yield
The annual yield an investor would receive if the most recent fund distribution and current fund price stayed the same going forward. It’s calculated by annualizing the most recent distribution and dividing by the fund’s net asset value (NAV) from the as-of date.

as of 30-Jun-2017



1.02%




12m Trailing Yield
The yield an investor would have received if they had held the fund over the last twelve months assuming the most recent NAV. The 12-Month yield is calculated by assuming any income distributions over the past twelve months and dividing by the sum of the most recent NAV and any capital gain distributions made over the past twelve months.

as of 30-Jun-2017



1.42%




30 Day SEC Yield
A standard calculation of yield introduced by the SEC in order to provide fairer comparison among funds. This yield reflects the interest earned after deducting the fund&#39;s expenses during the most recent 30-day period by the average investor in the fund. Negative 30-Day SEC Yield results when accrued expenses of the past 30 days exceed the income collected during the past 30 days.

Important Information

 

Carefully consider the Funds' investment objectives, risk factors, and charges and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the Funds' prospectuses or, if available, the summary prospectuses which may be obtained by visiting the iShares Fund and BlackRock Fund prospectus pages. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.


Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal.


International investing involves risks, including risks related to foreign currency, limited liquidity, less government regulation and the possibility of substantial volatility due to adverse political, economic or other developments. These risks often are heightened for investments in emerging/developing markets or in concentrations of single countries.


Performance shown reflects fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements by the investment advisor to the fund for some or all of the periods shown. Performance would have been lower without such waivers.


Shares of ETFs are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 p.m. Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined for most ETFs), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times.


Index returns are for illustrative purposes only. Index performance returns do not reflect any management fees, transaction costs or expenses. Indexes are unmanaged and one cannot invest directly in an index. Past performance does not guarantee future results.


After-tax returns are calculated using the historical highest individual federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on the investor's tax situation and may differ from those shown. The after-tax returns shown are not relevant to investors who hold their fund shares through tax-deferred arrangements such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts.


Certain sectors and markets perform exceptionally well based on current market conditions and iShares Funds can benefit from that performance. Achieving such exceptional returns involves the risk of volatility and investors should not expect that such results will be repeated.


Options involve risk and are not suitable for all investors. Prior to buying or selling an option, a person must receive a copy of "Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options." Copies of this document may be obtained from your broker, from any exchange on which options are traded or by contacting The Options Clearing Corporation, One North Wacker Dr., Suite 500, Chicago, IL 60606 (1-888-678-4667). The document contains information on options issued by The Options Clearing Corporation. The document discusses exchange traded options issued by The Options Clearing Corporation and is intended for educational purposes. No statement in the document should be construed as a recommendation to buy or sell a security or to provide investment advice. If you need further information, please feel free to call the Options Industry Council Helpline. They will be able to provide you with balanced options education and tools to assist you with your iShares options questions and trading. The Options Industry Council Helpline phone number is 1-888-Options (1-888-678-4667) and its website is www.888options.com.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Commentary

As of June 30, 2017 

	Quarter in review


		The JPMorgan Emerging Markets Equity Fund (I Class Shares) outperformed the benchmark, the MSCI Emerging Markets Index (net of foreign withholding taxes), for the quarter ended June 30, 2017.

		Stock selection was strongest in China where exposure to the financial services sector was a leading contributor. Pan-Asian insurance provider AIA Group Ltd. (3.8% portfolio weighting) posted strong first-quarter results in April, including a 55% year-on-year jump in first-quarter new business—a record for a business that has continually outperformed consensus.

		Exposure to Saudi Arabia aided performance in the quarter and the portfolio’s position in Almarai (0.9% portfolio weighting), the largest dairy company in the Middle East, was a leading contributor to performance. Stocks in the market responded favorably to the announcement in June that Mohammed bin Salman, the architect of the kingdom's economic reforms, was appointed crown prince.

		An underweight exposure to Korea, the result of individual stock selection rather than country allocation, was a headwind to performance in the second quarter. Korea saw its strongest performance in the past five years following the election of President Moon in May. Consumer sentiment improved to levels not seen in the past three years, boosted by post-election optimism.

		In addition, underweight exposure to Taiwanese hardware manufacturers negatively affected performance. These companies have outperformed in anticipation of strong demand for memory chips and other components in the second half of the year, reducing concerns about oversupply and margin pressure in the industry.


	Looking ahead


		The strong performance of emerging markets stocks this year is testament to the long-awaited improvement in fundamentals currently under way. Strong global markets and a weakening dollar have also helped. We believe these trends are likely to last for some time, suggesting the recovery in emerging markets equities still has room to go.

		Flows are reflecting this improved outlook, and the opportunity seems to be taking the lead over potential risks, including a China slowdown, weak commodity prices, and U.S. protectionism.

		MSCI’s decision to start including China A shares in its indices next year shines a light on a conclusion our investors made some time ago: that many of the most interesting ways to access China’s growth are consumer, health-care and services companies found only in the domestic market.

Disclaimer1Please refer to the prospectus for additional information about cut-off times. Total return assumes reinvestment of income. The Fund's adviser and/or its affiliates have contractually agreed to waive fees and/or reimburse expenses to the extent Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses (excluding acquired fund fees and expenses, dividend and interest expenses related to short sales, interest, taxes, expenses related to litigation and potential litigation and extraordinary expenses) exceed 1.35% for A Shares, 1.85% for C Shares, 1.10% for I Shares, 0.95% for L Shares, 0.95% for R5 Shares and 0.85% for R6 Shares of the average daily net assets. The Fund may invest in one or more money market funds advised by the adviser or its affiliates (affiliated money market funds). The Fund's adviser has contractually agreed to waive fees and/or reimburse expenses in an amount sufficient to offset the fees and expenses of the affiliated money market funds incurred by the Fund because of the Fund's investment in such money market funds. This waiver is in effect through 2/28/2018 for A Shares, 2/28/2018 for C Shares, 2/28/2018 for I Shares, 2/28/2018 for L Shares, 2/28/2018 for R5 Shares and 2/28/2018 for R6 Shares, at which time the adviser and/or its affiliates will determine whether to renew or revise it. The difference between net and gross fees includes all applicable fee waivers and expense reimbursements. The quoted performance of the Fund includes performance of a predecessor fund/share class prior to the Fund's commencement of operations. Please refer to the current prospectus for further information.  Mutual funds have fees that reduce their performance: indexes do not. You cannot invest directly in an index. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index (net of foreign withholding taxes) is a free float-adjusted market capitalization weighted index measuring emerging market equity performance. The performance of the Lipper Emerging Markets Funds Index includes expenses associated with a mutual fund, such as investment management fees. These expenses are not identical to the expenses charged by the Fund. An individual cannot invest directly in an index. Total return figures (for the fund and any index quoted) assume payment of fees and reinvestment of dividends (after the highest applicable foreign withholding tax) and distributions. Without fee waivers, fund returns would have been lower. Due to rounding, some values may not total 100%. Â©2017, American Bankers Association, CUSIP Database provided by the Standard & Poor's CUSIP Service Bureau, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. All rights reserved.The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10- year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.Rankings do not take sales loads into account.The following risks could cause the fund to lose money or perform more poorly than other investments. For more complete risk information, see the prospectus. International investing bears greater risk due to social, economic, regulatory and political instability in countries in "emerging markets." This makes emerging market securities more volatile and less liquid developed market securities. Changes in exchange rates and differences in accounting and taxation policies outside the U.S. can also affect returns. Investments in foreign currencies and foreign issuers are subject to additional risks, including political and economic risks, greater volatility, civil conflicts and war, currency fluctuations, higher transaction costs, delayed settlement, possible foreign controls on investment, expropriation and nationalization risks, and less stringent investor protection and disclosure standards of foreign markets. These risks are magnified in countries in "emerging markets."Total return assumes reinvestment of income. The top 10 holdings listed reflect only the Fund's long-term investments. Short-term investments are excluded. Holdings are subject to change. The holdings listed should not be considered recommendations to purchase or sell a particular security. Each individual security is calculated as a percentage of the aggregate market value of the securities held in the Fund and does not include the use of derivative positions, where applicable. P/E ratio: the number by which earnings per share is multiplied to estimate a stock's value.  P/B ratio: the relationship between a stock's price and the book value of that stock. Sharpe ratio measures the fund's excess return compared to a risk-free investment. The higher the Sharpe ratio, the better the returns relative to the risk taken. Tracking Error: The active risk of the portfolio, which determines the annualized standard deviation of the excess returns between the portfolio and the benchmark. Alpha: The relationship between the performance of the Fund and its beta over a three-year period of time. Standard deviation/Volatility: A statistical measure of the degree to which the Fund's returns have varied from its historical average. The higher the standard deviation, the wider the range of returns from its average and the greater the historical volatility. The standard deviation is calculated over a 36-month period based on Fund's monthly returns. The standard deviation shown is based on the Fund's Class A Shares or the oldest share class, where Class A Shares are not available. R2: The percentage of a Fund's movements that result from movements in the index ranging from 0 to 100. A Fund with an R2 of 100 means that 100 percent of the Fund's movement can completely be explained by movements in the Fund's external index benchmark. EPS: Total earnings divided by the number of shares outstanding. Risk measures are calculated based upon the Funds' broad-based index as stated in the prospectus.
