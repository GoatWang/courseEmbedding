Corporate Overview

Great Plains Energy Incorporated (NYSE: GXP) is the holding company of Kansas City Power & Light 
				Company and KCP&L Greater Missouri Operations Company (GMO).  The utilities operate under the brand name KCP&L.
Our vertically integrated electric utilities serve just over 851,200 customers in 47 counties in Missouri and Kansas with a combined diverse generation platform of more than 6,400 MW of capacity.
				
Management is focused on  providing long-term earnings growth for shareholders and low cost, reliable energy for customers. In addition, Great Plains Energy has an attractive annualized dividend of $0.98 per share.   Great Plains Energy's dividend, combined with earnings growth potential, provide investors with a strong total return investment alternative.
			  
Corporate Values

Strategic Intent: Great Plains Energy is focused on providing reliable long-term value to shareholders and customers through its utilities by supplying and delivering electricity and energy solutions to meet customers' current and future needs and enhance their quality of life. To achieve these objectives, we believe there are four key values upon which the Company must focus:
Top-Tier Operating Performance: Across the organization we strive for industry-leading financial and operational performance.
Long-Range Perspective: We manage the Company for long-term performance, not short-sighted gains.  Our Comprehensive Energy Plan (CEP) is a key example.  It was a five-year strategy, which commenced in 2005, to increase the Company's power generation capabilities, and to improve regional air quality through environmental upgrades to existing facilities, and to invest in demand side management, distributed generation, customer efficiency and affordability programs, and transmission and distribution improvements.  
				Winning Culture: The Company is focused on building a culture dedicated to achieving Great Plains Energy's goals. Recruiting and developing top workforce talent is the key to sustaining excellent performance across the Company and creating long-term shareholder and customer value.
Collaborative Relationships: Over the years we have built numerous collaborative relationships that help us accomplish our business objectives and be good corporate citizens. We support the economic and social well-being of our customer communities through targeted financial programs focused on at-risk youth, the environment and economic and civic efforts. These are the foundations that build strong, long-term relationships with customers, community leaders, legislators and regulators that will ultimately drive shareholder value.

Forward-Looking Statement



				Statements made in this Web site and the documents within it that are not based on historical facts are forward-looking, may involve risks and uncertainties, and are intended to be as of the date when made. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the outcome of regulatory proceedings, cost estimates of capital projects and other matters affecting future operations.  In connection with the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Great Plains Energy and KCP&L are providing a number of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the provided forward-looking information.  These important factors include: future economic conditions in regional, national and international markets and their effects on sales, prices and costs, including but not limited to possible further deterioration in economic conditions and the timing and extent of any economic recovery; prices and availability of electricity in regional and national wholesale markets; market perception of the energy industry, Great Plains Energy and KCP&L; changes in business strategy, operations or development plans; effects of current or proposed state and federal legislative and regulatory actions or developments, including, but not limited to, deregulation, re-regulation and restructuring of the electric utility industry; decisions of regulators regarding rates the Companies can charge for electricity; adverse changes in applicable laws, regulations, rules, principles or practices governing tax, accounting and environmental matters including, but not limited to, air and water quality; financial market conditions and performance including, but not limited to, changes in interest rates and credit spreads and in availability and cost of capital and the effects on nuclear decommissioning trust and pension plan assets and costs; impairments of long-lived assets or goodwill; credit ratings; inflation rates; effectiveness of risk management policies and procedures and the ability of counterparties to satisfy their contractual commitments; impact of terrorist acts; ability to carry out marketing and sales plans; weather conditions including, but not limited to, weather-related damage and their effects on sales, prices and costs; cost, availability, quality and deliverability of fuel; the inherent uncertainties in estimating the effects of weather, economic conditions and other factors on customer consumption and financial results; ability to achieve generation goals and the occurrence and duration of planned and unplanned generation outages; delays in the anticipated in-service dates and cost increases of generation, transmission, distribution or other projects; the inherent risks associated with the ownership and operation of a nuclear facility including, but not limited to, environmental, health, safety, regulatory and financial risks; workforce risks, including, but not limited to, increased costs of retirement, health care and other benefits; and other risks and uncertainties.

This list of factors is not all-inclusive because it is not possible to predict all factors. Other risk factors are detailed from time to time in Great Plains Energy’s and KCP&L’s quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and annual report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of the particular statement.  Great Plains Energy and KCP&L undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

Great Plains Energy upgraded to overweight from neutral at J.P. Morgan
Great Plains Energy upgraded to overweight from neutral at J.P. Morgan

Great Plains revises deal to buy Westar into a merger of equals
Great Plains Energy Inc.  said Monday that the deal to buy Westar Energy Inc.  has been revised to be a merger of equals with no premium paid to either company, creating a company with a combined equity value of about $14 billion. The electric utility companies said there will be no exchange of debt or cash, and will be just a stock-for-stock merger of equals. Under terms of the deal, Westar shareholders will receive one share in the new holding company for each Westar share they own, while Great Plains shareholders will receive 0.5981 shares of the new company for each Great Plains share they own. After the completion of the merger, current Westar Chief Executive Mark Ruelle will be non-executive chairman and Great Plains CEO Terry Bassham will be the CEO of the new company. Under the original acquisition deal, which was announced in May 2016, Great Plains planned to buy Westar in a deal valued at $12.2 billion. Great Plains and Westar stock were still inactive in premarket trade. Year to date, Great Plains's stock has gained 7.0% and Westar shares have lost 5.7%, while the SPDR Utilities Select Sector ETF  has tacked on 6.0% and the S&P 500  has advanced 8.3%.

Great Plains Energy upgraded to overweight from neutral at J.P. Morgan
Great Plains Energy upgraded to overweight from neutral at J.P. Morgan

Great Plains revises deal to buy Westar into a merger of equals
Great Plains Energy Inc.  said Monday that the deal to buy Westar Energy Inc.  has been revised to be a merger of equals with no premium paid to either company, creating a company with a combined equity value of about $14 billion. The electric utility companies said there will be no exchange of debt or cash, and will be just a stock-for-stock merger of equals. Under terms of the deal, Westar shareholders will receive one share in the new holding company for each Westar share they own, while Great Plains shareholders will receive 0.5981 shares of the new company for each Great Plains share they own. After the completion of the merger, current Westar Chief Executive Mark Ruelle will be non-executive chairman and Great Plains CEO Terry Bassham will be the CEO of the new company. Under the original acquisition deal, which was announced in May 2016, Great Plains planned to buy Westar in a deal valued at $12.2 billion. Great Plains and Westar stock were still inactive in premarket trade. Year to date, Great Plains's stock has gained 7.0% and Westar shares have lost 5.7%, while the SPDR Utilities Select Sector ETF  has tacked on 6.0% and the S&P 500  has advanced 8.3%.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
