Vontobel Asset Management launches institutional mutual funds






Jul 16, 2015, 12:01pm EDT














NEW YORK, July 16, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Vontobel Asset Management, Inc. has expanded its product offering to institutional U.S. clients with the launch of two SEC-registered institutional mutual funds: Vontobel International Equity Institutional Fund (VTIIX) and Vontobel Global Equity Institutional Fund (VTEIX). These funds join the firm's mutual fund roster alongside the Vontobel Global Emerging Markets Equity Institutional Fund (VTGIX), which commenced operations in May 2013 and has more than $1 billion in assets as of June 30, 2015.

"Launching these institutional mutual funds is a significant initiative for Vontobel. We are delighted to broaden investor access to our investment strategies through these vehicles by providing quality portfolio management at a reasonable fee," said Dr. Philipp Hensler, Co-Chief Executive Officer of New York-based Vontobel Asset Management, Inc. 
The launch of these funds reflects Vontobel's commitment to U.S. institutional markets by making some of its strategies accessible to institutional investors who prefer a pooled vehicle, with a minimum investment size of $1 million. The funds replicate the investment strategy of Vontobel's long-only equity strategies, which have a 20+ year track record and seek above average risk-adjusted returns. These mutual funds complement Vontobel's existing investment vehicles, including separately managed accounts and collective investment trusts, allowing investors to access the team's consistent investment style by selecting the product solution appropriate to their investment needs.
"Our strategy is built on identifying high-quality companies: those with solid business economics, stable operating margins, high returns on invested capital, consistent returns, and strong franchises," said Vontobel's Chief Investment Officer and Co-Chief Executive Officer Rajiv Jain. "We take a long-term view, and our portfolios aspire to enjoy consistent compounded earnings growth."
About VontobelEstablished in 1984, Vontobel Asset Management, Inc. is a global investment firm, based in New York, with $50.7 billion in assets under management (as of June 30, 2015). Vontobel is dedicated exclusively to managing global and regional long-only equity portfolios. The firm's clients comprise both intermediaries and institutions, including some of the world's leading corporations, and public and private pension funds. Vontobel is committed to providing excellence in portfolio management and dedicated, timely client service.

Liability of Vontobel for damage of any kind (including consequential damage) directly or indirectly resulting from access to AM Web shall be excluded except where there is intent or gross negligence.


7. Risk considerations
Past performance is not a reliable indicator of current or future performance. Performance data does not take commissions and costs charged when units are issued and redeemed, as well as any custodian fees or withholding tax that could potentially reduce the value, into account.


Moreover, investments denominated in foreign currencies are directly and indirectly subject to exchange-rate fluctuations. Distributions made in connection with funds and other investment instruments may also vary. Investors thus face the risk of not recouping their original investment in full. Even a total loss of investment cannot be ruled out. Please carefully analyse the risks inherent in an investment instrument, in particular the risk considerations contained in the current sales prospectus of the respective fund as well as the brochure Special Risks in Securities Trading from SwissBanking. Investors should also be aware, that the liquidity of fund shares and other investment instruments may be limited.


8. Intellectual property
All elements contained on AM Web are protected by intangible property rights and are owned by Vontobel or third parties.

The downloading or printing of elements from AM Web does not involve the transfer of any rights whatsoever, particularly not rights relating to software, trademarks or elements of AM Web. Notices relating to copyrights and brands must neither be changed nor removed.
