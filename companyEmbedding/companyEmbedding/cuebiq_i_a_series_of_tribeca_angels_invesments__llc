PRESS RELEASE
NEW YORK and CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Aug. 5, 2013 /PRNewswire/ — Maxwell Health (maxwellhealth.com), a human resources platform that manages benefits and promotes employee health, today announced a $2 million Series A funding round led by Tribeca Venture Partners, with participation from Lerer Ventures, Vaizra Investments, BoxGroup, and additional New York and Boston-based investors, including TiE Angels.
Maxwell Health, available nationwide, is a no cost, user-friendly SaaS platform and concierge service for businesses to help them set up and manage their employee health plans, benefits and payroll. The company has an innovative two-pronged approach to lowering health care costs by empowering organizations and employees to have greater selection of and control over their health plans, and by introducing creative incentives to foster employee health. In addition, with the Affordable Care Act creating more choice – as well as more regulations – Maxwell Health can assist employers and employees in navigating the changing health care landscape.
“Maxwell Health is a big-picture solution for companies wanting to eliminate the enormous burden of HR administration, reduce health care costs and increase employee wellbeing,” said Veer Gidwaney, co-founder and CEO of Maxwell Health. “We fuse the best of technology and human expertise to manage the full range of employee benefits. Our platform is centered around engaging tools that promote employee health and make peoples’ lives easier, including a concierge service to answer even the thorniest of questions employers and employees may have about their health plans and benefits.”
Maxwell Health works with businesses to set up, optimize and manage private health care exchanges, empowering employees to choose the benefits that are best for them. The service has an easy-to-use portal that lets companies and employees manage their full range of benefits, including medical, dental, vision, life, disability, COBRA administration, HRA/HSA, FSA and 401(k). Maxwell Health simplifies the process of managing new and departing employees, and its real-time dashboard enables benefits administrators to easily track employee engagement and company spending. The service also enables companies with existing health and benefits plans to seamlessly sync them onto Maxwell Health’s platform without making any adjustments to their insurance setup.
Maxwell Health’s innovative concierge serves as an informed, unbiased advisor available to recommend physicians, fix billing errors, schedule appointments, compare prescription prices and more. A mobile app makes it convenient for employees to access the concierge service and manage all their benefits.
Employee wellness is central to Maxwell Health’s mission. The service enables companies to use incentives, challenges and fitness devices to engage employees and to help them stay healthy. Employers can easily fund rewards for hitting health targets that employees can redeem at a number of high-profile retailers.
“Maxwell Health seeks to disrupt our archaic health system by advancing the ‘Triple Aim’ of better health, superior health care and lower costs,” said Amitabh Chandra, economist and Professor of Public Policy at Harvard University and advisor to Maxwell Health. “Everyone wants more health care options, but it’s critically important to be able to make sense of them all, which is why Maxwell Health can play a key role in enabling people to make better choices. More people making better choices will bend the cost curve. And by encouraging employees to be healthier and happier, Maxwell Health can also have a huge impact on a company’s bottom line.”
Maxwell Health is able to provide its service to businesses at no cost by receiving commissions from insurance companies. Brokers seeking to implement a technology solution to manage benefits on behalf of their clients can also use Maxwell Health’s platform.
Said Chip Meakem, managing partner at Tribeca Venture Partners: “Maxwell Health is aimed at the core of what’s ailing the American health care system: we spend far too much and get far too little, and prevention is too often just an afterthought. Maxwell not only alleviates the day-to-day HR headaches that company founders, CFOs, and HR personnel have to deal with, but it also plays an important role in getting us closer to a healthier society with a more cost-effective health care system.”
About Maxwell Health:
Based in New York, NY, and Cambridge, MA, Maxwell Health (maxwellhealth.com) is an innovative human resources platform that manages benefits and promotes employee health. The company combines a SaaS platform and a concierge service to simplify benefits, reduce insurance costs and improve employee health

PRESS RELEASE
NEW YORK – February 28, 2017– PebblePost®, the inventor of Programmatic Direct Mail®, today announced it has secured a $15 Million Series B round, led by RRE Ventures, with existing investors Greycroft and Tribeca Venture Partners, and additional seed funds and strategic angels also contributing to the round. The investment will be used to support strong demand for PebblePost’s Programmatic Direct Mail® solutions and the company’s infrastructure growth and market expansion. In addition, Jim Robinson, Managing Partner at RRE Ventures will be joining PebblePost’s Board of Directors.
At founding, PebblePost created Programmatic Direct Mail® as the first new marketing channel since search and social. In the past two years, hundreds of brands on the platform have proven the value and effectiveness of the channel. PebblePost’s always-on platform solves the many challenges that digital marketers face, specifically, viewability, fraud, disruption of the user experience and ad blocking.
“PebblePost’s sales, client satisfaction, innovation, strength of management and expansion lead the market and we are excited to further accelerate even more rapid growth and success,” said Jim Robinson, Managing Partner at RRE Ventures. “I have tremendous respect for Lewis, the other board members, and what the team at PebblePost is doing. I’m looking forward to working with them.” 





“We are thrilled by the reception to Programmatic Direct Mail®,” said PebblePost CEO, Lewis Gersh. “Our solution combines the best of both worlds — digital’s real-time interest and intent data and direct mail’s physical media into home. The raise will accelerate our infrastructure buildout to better serve our customers, and enhance our product offerings as we help digital marketers turn their data assets into real results. We are also delighted to welcome Jim to our board of directors and are proud to be included in RRE Venture’s impressive portfolio of category-defining companies. RRE Ventures has championed innovative companies in their growth toward market disruption and dominance for more than 20 years.”
PebblePost’s clients are equally optimistic, touting unprecedented returns on advertising spend. The company has seen on average 7-10% of all mail sent results in a purchase across campaigns to existing customers, email subscribers and website prospects.
PebblePost plans to use the round to expand the reach and presence of its new marketing channel beyond retail, into other consumer sectors and B2B where marketers struggle to address and convert audiences. The company will also continue to innovate its 1:1 personalized Programmatic Catalog™ product announced last Fall and employed by brands like Boxed, Saatchi Art, ModCloth and more, in addition to launching more channel partnerships with email service providers, e-commerce engines, and CRM platforms. These moves will deepen the value it provides clients and investors. 





PebblePost’s funding follows a year of record growth and widespread adoption across enterprise, mid-market and SMBs in the retail and ecommerce categories. The company has also expanded its footprint in the US by adding a San Francisco office and growing its team, including the recent hire of Marita Scarfi (formerly of 72andSunny) as CFO and Head of West Coast Operations.
Fenwick & West LLP provided legal counsel on the round.
PebblePost will be onsite during eTail West, where they’ll be hosting a wine tasting on Wednesday, March 1, at the J.W. Marriott.

Term Sheet — Thursday, February 9 | Fortune.comFinanceSearchSearchFordU.S. Expands Probe Into Ford Explorers Over Carbon Monoxide ConcernsWMPWThe World’s Most Powerful Women: July 28COMPARECARDSSPONSOREDUberUber’s CEO Searchlight Reportedly Hits Former GE Head Jeff ImmeltTerm SheetTerm Sheet — Thursday, February 9Erin GriffithFeb 09, 2017WRITEDOWNS, CLAP BACKS, LEAPS OF FAITH, BEYONCEHello from snowy New York, where this morning’s layer of fresh white snow will soon turn into black, bottomless slush puddles of death.Clapping back: Term Sheet readers had lots of thoughts on Michael Moritz’s op-ed on Stephen Schwarzman, carried interest, President Trump, and private equity ethics (here). I’ll share them in a feedback column later, but one repeated theme was that the companies backed by Moritz’s firm, Sequoia Capital, and other VC firms, contribute to just as much indirect job loss via displacement as buyouts do directly via layoffs.The American Investment Council’s official response accuses Moritz of misunderstanding the private equity model (“long term investments,” “alignment of interests”), noting that pension funds benefit from private equity’s high returns, and that many startups raise debt as well.On carried interest, the Council, alongside the National Taxpayers Union and Americans for Tax Reform, argues that “changing the tax treatment of carried interest would hurt the pension funds, charities, and college endowments that form partnerships with fund managers and depend on the superior returns these managers deliver.”Impaired: Last Fall Term Sheet mentioned Simple, the innovative digital bank that BBVA acquired in 2014 for $117 million, as an example of a traditional bank using a startup within it to disrupt itself. It’s the same model being used at Almond Bank, the secretive “bank within a bank” that Andreessen Horowitz, Battery Ventures, and Ribbit Capital were incubating in Cross River Bank, a joint investment.At the time, I noted that Simple had experienced outage issues over the years. I also mentioned that Almond would pick up where Simple left off. But Simple representatives were quick to let me know at the time that the company is still very much alive. Simple has even begun on-boarding Simple customers to the BBVA balance sheet, a source close to the company says.But this month BBVA Compass, the North American subsidiary that owns Simple, took a $59.9 million impairment charge on the company, according to an SEC filing. Josh Reich, Simple’s Founder and CEO told Term Sheet that BBVA continues to invest in Simple. The team now has 350 employees and “added customers at the rate of a bank that has over 1,000 branches,” he says.BBVA Compass representative Christina Anderson provided more detail via email:Accounting rules for investments like these and valuations for fintech companies are very volatile and often result in impairments.  We are also interested in the intangibles that our innovation investments bring, including their knowledge and culture, as those elements help BBVA Compass become more dynamic, customer-centric and could potentially change the way banking is done. As with most investments, return is delivered in the medium to long term, and BBVA Compass remains committed to Simple and its continued success and ongoing growth.  Further Impaired: Publicis Groupe, a major acquirer of digital advertising businesses and agencies, has taken a massive writedown on its onetime “crown jewel” Sapient. The company disclosed a  $1.49 billion impairment charge on the company, which it acquired in 2014 for $3.7 billion. CEO Maurice Lévy told WSJ his plan for Sapient, part of a wider strategy to turn the ad holding company into more of a consulting business, was “probably too ambitious.”Leap of Faith: I read this Business Insider article on Magic Leap with great interest. In recent months the highly funded ($1.4 billion), highly valuable ($4.5 billion), highly secretive company has been accused of overhyping its not-yet-launched technology. Now, according to the article, the company is “scrambling” to get a demo ready ahead of a big board meeting. To be clear: All startups scramble. But Magic Leap is under more pressure than most startups, thanks to its valuation and funding.The story shows that Magic Leap is making progress (its demo is in “decent” shape), but it also shows the danger of too much hype before launching anything. (Its CEO has promised the product will be like “really cool dream. Of flying squirrels and sea monkeys and rainbow powered unicorns. Of most anything you can imagine.” That’s a lot to live up to!) Also: Beyoncé was apparently unimpressed by a personalized demo.Broadly speaking, one side effect of the Theranos mess is that companies are terrified of being called “the next Theranos.” They’re simultaneously scared of the media, and want more than ever to participate in and shape coverage. This could lead to more transparency, but so far I think it’s only led to more paranoia.Elsewhere in VR/AR news, Oculus VR is reportedly closing 200 of its 500 demo stations at Best Buys due to poor performance.THE LATEST FROM FORTUNE...•  Cruise Automation testing an app for hailing self-driving cars.•  The 50 best workplaces for giving back.•  Intel’s delicate dance.•  Snapchat’s other mega-cloud purchase (It’s not from Google).•  Twitter’s earnings miss.•  Under Armour wants to have it both ways.•  A counter-argument to H1-B visa supporters.•  German automakers come to Silicon Valley.…AND ELSEWHEREAmerica’s ‘jobs for the boys’ only tells half the story.
