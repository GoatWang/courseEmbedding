Renewable Energy





The Energy Policy Act of 1992 created a tax credit for the production of renewable energy sources, including wind, biomass, geothermal, solar, irrigation and solid waste. Codified as Section 45 of the Internal Revenue Code, the tax credit can be claimed by a taxpayer who owns and operates an eligible facility and who sells the generated power to an unrelated party. The qualified facility will receive a tax credit for the first 10 years of the facility's operation. Additionally, the owner of the facility receives benefits in the form of tax losses (depreciation, interest & operating expenses) and cash flows following the payoff of the initial debt. For more information about renewable energy tax credit investment opportunities, please contact us.

Affordable housing





The Section 42, Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) is a tax credit created under the Tax Reform Act of 1986 that provides incentives for the utilization of private equity in the development of affordable housing aimed at low-income Americans.
The program was designed to give the private sector an incentive to invest in public housing. In order to attract the private sector, an investor receives a tax credit, which is determined by the qualified basis of the project, and losses from property operations and depreciation.
The program is administered by state housing agencies that award the credits to projects within their jurisdiction. LIHTC investments are made through an upper-tier partnership that invests in numerous lower-tier (property) partnerships. The purpose of the structure is to protect the investor through both diversification and the isolation of property level problems.
For detailed information about low income housing tax-credit projects, please visit the HUD report of projects placed in service through 2005.
If you are interested in learning more about available affordable housing tax credit investment opportunities, please contact us.

Like-Kind Exchanges





Under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code, sellers of commercial real estate assets may defer the recognition of capital gains due upon sale by acquiring a replacement property of equal or greater value within 180 days. There are no tax credits available in these transactions. Rather, the benefit to the taxpayer is the time value of money associated with the deferral of taxes. If the taxpayer were to pass away prior to the sale of the last property in a series of 1031 exchanges, the taxpayer's heirs get the benefit of a step up in basis to fair market value. This stepped up basis can significantly reduce, or even eliminate any capital gains taxes that would otherwise be payable.
