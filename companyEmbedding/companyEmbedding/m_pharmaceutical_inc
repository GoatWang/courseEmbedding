M Pharmaceutical Inc. Provides Update on FDA Cleared OTC Product, ToConceive


CINCINNATI, OH / ACCESSWIRE / July 11, 2017 / M Pharmaceutical Inc. (CSE: MQ, OTCQB: MPHMF, FRA: T3F2) (the "Company" or "M Pharma"), a clinical-stage company developing innovative technologies for weight management and female health and wellness, announced today that it has taken important steps to release the innovative, FDA-cleared OTC product, ToConceive, to the North American marketplace. The Company acquired the global marketing rights to ToConceive in November of 2016 and immediately contracted with Anstice Communications (Anstice), based in Calgary. Anstice, one of Canada's leading integrated communications agencies, has developed new branding, packaging, and website for ToConceive and is assisting in driving information and awareness about ToConceive to the public in advance of its launch to market, now anticipated for September 2017.
"As someone who endured a long and costly fertility journey (emotional, physical and financial), I'm optimistic about any non-invasive option that can help address fertility related issues and do so much earlier in the journey," said Kim Whittemore, a recognized women's sexual health advocate, and M Pharmaceutical Board Member. "The science behind ToConceive is sound and will help many couples avoid more expensive and invasive treatments."
"Anstice is proud to partner with M Pharmaceuticals as it introduces ToConceive to the market," said Sheenah Rogers, Founder, and CEO of Anstice Communications. "We will be working closely with M Pharma to implement an effective brand strategy and build a strong awareness of this innovative new product among consumers."
About Infertility
Over 9 million North American couples are struggling to create the family of their dreams (significantly more worldwide). For many of these couples, the search for success through Artificial Reproductive Therapy (ART) can be financially burdensome and emotionally taxing. The "necessity" of these procedures is a source of much debate, but to date, alternative therapies have been limited.
About ToConceive
The science behind ToConceive is based on the 2010 Nobel Prize in Medicine for In-Vitro Fertilization and Sperm Capacitation. The formulation was originally developed in Cincinnati, Ohio by an award-winning surgeon, OB-GYN, and fertility expert. Unlike other over-the-counter lubrications, some of which contain spermicide, ToConceive is a vaginal gel, lubricant, and moisturizer, clinically shown to help increase a woman's own natural conception lubrication, called transudate, which helps aid in conception.
About M Pharmaceutical
Formed in early 2015, M Pharmaceutical Inc. is a clinical-stage company developing innovative technologies for obesity, weight management, and Female Health & Wellness. In addition to its recent acquisitions of C-103, a reformulation of Orlistat and assets from 40J's LLC, the Company is scheduled to launch their FDA cleared fertility product branded as ToConceive in September of 2017. 
M Pharmaceutical Inc. trades on the Canadian Securities Exchange (CSE) under the ticker symbol "MQ," as well as on the OTCQB as "MPHMF," and FRA (Frankfurt Stock Exchange) as "T3F2."

Although the Company believes that the expectations and assumptions on which the forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, undue reliance should not be placed on the forward-looking statements because the Company can give no assurance that they will prove to be correct. This news release includes forward-looking statements with respect to the regulatory approval, commercialization of the rights to the Company's biomedical & drug technologies, and acquisition of new products.

Such risk factors may cause the inability of the Company to successfully commercialize any of its biomedical technologies.
Notice regarding investigational devices:
C-103 and Extrinsa are investigational drugs or devices and are not currently available outside of approved clinical trials. Claims regarding the safety and efficacy of these devices have not been evaluated by Health Canada, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or any other international regulatory body.

M Pharmaceutical Inc. Provides Strategic Report to Shareholders Highlighting Acquisitions and Product Development


CINCINNATI, OH / ACCESSWIRE / July 13, 2017 / M Pharmaceutical Inc. (CSE: MQ, OTCQB: MPHMF, FWB: T3F2) (the ''Company'' or ''M Pharma'') President and CEO of M Pharmaceutical USA Inc., Mr. Gary Thompson, has issued a comprehensive update letter to shareholders.
Dear Shareholders of M Pharmaceutical Inc.,
Welcome to the summer of 2017 and the one-year anniversary of launching a new and exciting direction for M Pharmaceutical Inc. I am pleased to announce that in these past 12 months, M Pharma has executed on several significant growth initiatives as they relate to the Company's market prospects and enhancement of value to our shareholders. As previously announced, the Company has added to its portfolio C-103, the re-formulated Orlistat project, the global marketing rights to ToConceive, and acquired the assets of Cincinnati based 40J's LLC. These new assets include current distribution revenues of roughly $170K+ quarterly, eight patented and patent pending pipeline technologies, one of which is the new drug Extrinsa for female sexual dysfunction.
Update on specific company projects:
Current Distribution Efforts

As part of the 40J's acquisition, M Pharma acquired an active contract for its female intimacy gel private labeled and distributed in Asia, expanding to other markets worldwide. We are pleased to announce that this long-term relationship has recently reached a new level of partnership by immediately increasing production levels by 50% and including a commitment to expanding the distribution portfolio with up to 4 additional M Pharma products with an anticipated release date sometime before the end of 2017.
Additionally, M Pharma is in active discussions with new distribution partners for these commercialized and pipeline products in the Middle East, EU, Pacific Rim, Brazil, and North America. We expect multiple additional partners under contract before the end of the year.

C-103 re-formulated Orlistat 

We are pleased to announce that we have received a positive response from our Pre-IND filing with the FDA and now have a very clear 505(b)(2) pathway defined.
We are currently working with Camargo Pharmaceutical Services to launch Phase II Activated Charcoal Dose Finding studies, solidify the chemistry, manufacturing, and controls portion of the development and plan the nonclinical testing required by the FDA.
With our FDA response and Camargo's gap analysis report in hand, we now have an asset with a significantly increased value and attractiveness. Business plan development is currently underway to outline potential JV opportunities to drive pivotal clinical trials for this promising new weight loss drug formulation.
Without the adverse events associated with Orlistat, once a $800 million / year drug, we have targeted $500 million in the US market alone as first year revenues, once approved by the FDA.

ToConceive

As announced, we suspended sales of ToConceive in December and contracted with Anstice Communications out of Calgary to develop and execute on a ''re-brand / re-launch'' strategy.
M Pharma purchased the website domain www.toconceive.com.
Due to FDA regulatory requirements, our targeted launch date has been pushed back to September 2017.
The new ToConceive website is 90% complete and with hard work from the Anstice team, we now have a very professional sales platform and product brand to market.
A two-month advance marketing strategy has been developed and begins this month.
Targeted net revenues for ToConceive are $160K per month.
We are evaluating complimentary add-on products for development/acquisition to include in this family of products in the infertility/trying-to-conceive market.

Extrinsa 

Extrinsa received USPTO trademark protection in May.
Camargo Pharmaceutical Services has been contracted to advance Extrinsa through the FDA approval process via the 505(b) (2) pathway, similar to our C-103 project.
Camargo's gap analysis document has been developed and the initial Pre-IND request letter has been delivered to the FDA for review.
With similar expectations for an approved FDA pathway forward we have also started JV business plan development process.
The Extrinsa opportunity remains an estimated $1 billion annually.

Menthol & L-arginine Patented Technology 

The delivery platform developed for a majority of our M Pharma products is based on the patent protected and FDA cleared topical gel combining Menthol & L-arginine. This innovative formulation has the potential to be paired with many different ingredients to address a multitude of indications.
Other business development opportunities (transfer pricing, private labeling & out licensing) for many of these products have been identified worldwide and offer significant revenue opportunities for M Pharma in the near future.

Addition of Orphan Drug to R&D Pipeline

Joint Venture with third party investors established through LLC
Patent pending status with USPTO
Potential for ''Priority Review'' & additional ''Priority Review Voucher''

Corporate Branding
M Pharma today is a much different company from M Pharma just one year ago. We believe that this new company with a new product portfolio and revived vitality deserved a refreshed public identity. A public identity that reflected our mission to offer our customer's realistic solutions based on the principles of reduced invasiveness and enhanced effectiveness. Plans are in place to announce our new corporate name, logo, and website in the very near future.
We have now advanced our mandate over this past year by expanding and diversifying our treatment portfolio within our focus areas, adding significant revenue to the bottom line and attaining FDA pathway approval for our C-103 project. Our team continues to grow with the restructuring of our Board of Directors in December, the addition of a COO in February, an experienced CFO in June, and most recently adding a Director of Brand Management to assist with the launch and long-term success of ToConceive.
It has been a challenging and fruitful 12 months of effort but the rewards are a very exciting future. Thank you for the opportunity to update you on the Company's growth initiatives.
Sincerely,
Mr. Gary A. ThompsonPresident & Chief Executive OfficerM Pharmaceutical Inc.

About  Pharmaceutical Inc.
M Pharmaceutical is committed to developing and commercializing innovative drug treatments and biomedical technologies that improve the lives of people struggling with obesity, infertility and intimacy. The Company has the exclusive rights to the obesity drug C-103, a reformulation of Orlistat, in both prescription strength and over the counter formulations. Our company has also secured the exclusive rights for a women’s health product to treat infertility called ToConceive. In addition, M Pharmaceutical holds the rights to Trimeo Weight Loss Capsules, an obesity management technology deploying temporary controllable pseudobezoars, an innovative method for non-invasive dynamic gastric volume reduction for weight loss that has been recently tested in blind, placebo-controlled human studies. Commercial development of drug treatments and biomedical technologies will require successful coordination and execution of a wide variety of technology disciplines.

 


 























Our Mission
M Pharmaceutical is focused on providing drug treatments and biomedical technologies that improve the health and outcomes for people facing the medical issues of obesity & infertility, and intimacy issues.



Our Objective
M Pharmaceutical is committed to developing and commercializing its innovative drug treatments and biomedical technologies which offer the end user realistic solutions based on the principles of reduced invasiveness and enhanced effectiveness.














Drug Treatment Portfolio



Obesity, Weight Management Treatment

C-103 is a novel reformulation of orlistat, patented until 2030 in the U.S.  Orlistat is FDA-approved for weight management and sold by Roche as Xenical® (prescription) and by GlaxoSmithKline as alli® (over-the-counter).  Proven safe and effective in over 100 clinical trials, orlistat is the best-selling weight loss medication of all time with peak sales over $900 million in 2007.  The C-103 reformulation addresses adverse events reported by over 90% of orlistat users. These adverse events have led to the decline in Orlistat sales to approximately $200 million in recent years. 
C-103 is intended to maintain the efficacy of orlistat while minimizing its socially unacceptable adverse events. Unlike other weight loss drugs:

Orlistat is not an amphetamine
Orlistat does not affect the central nervous system
Orlistat is not systemically absorbed
Orlistat is the only FDA-approved OTC weight loss drug because of its safety
Orlistat is the only FDA-approved weight loss drug for adolescent patients (age 12-18)

Infertility Treatment

ToConceive is an innovative new infertility treatment that offers hope and assistance to the millions of couples worldwide struggling to start a family. Our product is an easy to use topical gel that helps to balance the pH of the vagina and is clinically proven to increases a women’s natural production of transudate (sexual lubrication). This increase in natural transudate is required for successful “Sperm Capacitation” to occur. Without the process of Sperm Capacitation, the sperm would not have the ability to travel the required distance to the ovum or have the appropriate chemical makeup for successful conception to occur.
ToConceive is a women’s health treatment supported by a FDA 510K clearance and is protected by four USPTO patents. ToConceive’s proven ability to increase a woman’s natural production of transudate results in significantly higher success rates for couples trying to conceive, without the added expense, or stress, associated with assisted reproduction treatments.


















Biomedical Technology Portfolio



M Pharmaceutical has exclusive rights to Trimeo Weight Loss Capsules, a biomedical technology to manage obesity and diabetes. 
Obesity Management Treatment
Trimeo Weight Loss Capsules are drug free, individually controllable expandable implements that result in a dynamic gastric volume reduction, inducing a feeling of early satiety and reducing food intake. This third generation technology has 3 US and Canadian patents, 3 issued in the EU and 4 pending patents.

M Pharmaceutical Inc. Provides Strategic Report to Shareholders Highlighting Acquisitions and Product Development

M Pharmaceutical Inc. Provides Strategic Report to Shareholders Highlighting Acquisitions and Product Development


CINCINNATI, OH (FSCwire) – M Pharmaceutical Inc. (CSE: MQ, OTCQB: MPHMF, FWB: T3F2), (the “Company” or “M Pharma”) Mr. Gary Thompson, President and CEO of M Pharmaceutical USA Inc., has issued a comprehensive update letter to shareholders.
Dear Shareholders of M Pharmaceutical Inc.,
Welcome to the summer of 2017 and the one-year anniversary of launching a new and exciting direction for M Pharmaceutical Inc. I am pleased to announce that in these past 12 months M Pharma has executed on several significant growth initiatives as they relate to the Company’s market prospects and enhancement of value to our shareholders. As previously announced, the Company has added to its portfolio C-103, the re-formulated Orlistat project, the global marketing rights to ToConceive, and acquired the assets of Cincinnati based 40J’s LLC.  These new assets include current distribution revenues of roughly $170K+ quarterly, eight patented and patent pending pipeline technologies, one of which is the new drug Extrinsa for female sexual dysfunction.
Update on specific company projects:
Current Distribution Efforts

As part of the 40J’s acquisition, M Pharma acquired an active contract for its female intimacy gel private labeled and distributed in Asia, expanding to other markets worldwide. We are pleased to announce that this long-term relationship has recently reached a new level of partnership by immediately increasing production levels by 50% and including a commitment to expanding the distribution portfolio with up to 4 additional M Pharma products with an anticipated release date sometime before the end of 2017.


Additionally, M Pharma is in active discussions with new distribution partners for these commercialized and pipeline products in the Middle East, EU, Pacific Rim, Brazil and North America. We expect multiple additional partners under contract before the end of the year.

C-103 re-formulated Orlistat

We are pleased to announce that we have received a positive response from our Pre-IND filing with the FDA and now have a very clear 505(b)(2) pathway defined.


We are currently working with Camargo Pharmaceutical Services to launch Phase II Activated Charcoal Dose Finding studies, solidify the chemistry, manufacturing and controls portion of the development and plan the nonclinical testing required by the FDA.


With our FDA response and Camargo’s gap analysis report in hand, we now have an asset with a significantly increased value and attractiveness. Business plan development is currently underway to outline potential JV opportunities to drive pivotal clinical trials for this promising new weight loss drug formulation.


Without the adverse events associated with Orlistat, once a $800 million / year drug, we have targeted $500 million in the US market alone as first year revenues, once approved by the FDA.

ToConceive

As announced, we suspended sales of ToConceive in December and contracted with Anstice Communications out of Calgary to develop and execute on a “re-brand / re-launch” strategy.


M Pharma purchased the website domain www.toconceive.com.


Due to FDA regulatory requirements our targeted launch date has been pushed back to September 2017.


The new ToConceive website is 90% complete and with hard work from the Anstice team we now have a very professional sales platform and product brand to market.


A two-month advance marketing strategy has been developed and begins this month.


Targeted net revenues for ToConceive are $160K per month.


We are evaluating complimentary add-on products for development/acquisition to include in this family of products in the infertility/trying –to-conceive market.

Extrinsa

Extrinsa received USPTO trademark protection in May.


Camargo Pharmaceutical Services has been contracted to advance Extrinsa through the FDA approval process via the 505(b) (2) pathway, similar to our C-103 project.


Camargo’s gap analysis document has been developed and the initial Pre-IND request letter has been delivered to the FDA for review.


With similar expectations for an approved FDA pathway forward we have also started JV business plan development process.


The Extrinsa opportunity remains an estimated $1 billion annually.

Menthol & L-arginine Patented Technology

The delivery platform developed for a majority of our M Pharma products is based on the patent protected and FDA cleared topical gel combining Menthol & L-arginine.  This innovative formulation has the potential to be paired with many different ingredients to address a multitude of indications.


Other business development opportunities (transfer pricing, private labeling & out licensing) for many of these products have been identified worldwide and offer significant revenue opportunities for M Pharma in the near future.

Addition of Orphan Drug to R&D Pipeline

Joint Venture with third party investors established through LLC


Patent pending status with USPTO


Potential for “Priority Review” & additional “Priority Review Voucher”

Corporate Branding
M Pharma today is a much different company from M Pharma just one year ago. We believe that this new company with a new product portfolio and revived vitality deserved a refreshed public identity.  A public identity that reflected our mission to offer our customer’s realistic solutions based on the principles of reduced invasiveness and enhanced effectiveness. Plans are in place to announce our new corporate name, logo and website in the very near future.
We have now advanced our mandate over this past year by expanding and diversifying our treatment portfolio within our focus areas, adding significant revenue to the bottom line and attaining FDA pathway approval for our C-103 project. Our team continues to grow with the restructuring of our Board of Directors in December, the addition of a COO in February, an experienced CFO in June, and most recently adding a Director of Brand Management to assist with the launch and long-term success of ToConceive.
It has been a challenging and fruitful 12 months of effort but the rewards are a very exciting future. Thank you for the opportunity to update you on the Company’s growth initiatives.
Sincerely,
Mr. Gary A. Thompson
President & Chief Executive Officer
M Pharmaceutical Inc.

M Pharmaceutical Inc. Provides Update on FDA Cleared OTC Product, ToConceive


CINCINNATI, OH (FSCwire) – M Pharmaceutical Inc. (CSE: MQ, OTCQB: MPHMF, FWB: T3F2), (the “Company” or “M Pharma”), a clinical-stage company developing innovative technologies for weight management and female health and wellness announced today that it has taken important steps to release the innovative, FDA-cleared OTC product, ToConceive, to the North American marketplace. The Company acquired the global marketing rights to ToConceive in November of 2016 and immediately contracted with Anstice Communications (Anstice) based in Calgary. Anstice, one of Canada’s leading integrated communications agencies, has developed new branding, packaging and website for ToConceive and is assisting in driving information and awareness about ToConceive to the public in advance of its launch to market now anticipated for September 2017.
“As someone who endured a long and costly fertility journey (emotional, physical and financial), I’m optimistic about any non-invasive option that can help address fertility related issues and do so much earlier in the journey,” said Kim Whittemore, a recognized women’s sexual health advocate and M Pharmaceutical Board Member. “The science behind ToConceive is sound and will help many couples avoid more expensive and invasive treatments.”
“Anstice is proud to partner with M Pharmaceuticals as it introduces ToConceive to the market,” said Sheenah Rogers, Founder and CEO of Antsice Communications. “We will be working closely with M Pharma to implement an effective brand strategy and build strong awareness of this innovative new product among consumers.”
About Infertility
Over 9 million North American couples are struggling to create the family of their dreams (significantly more worldwide). For many of these couples, the search for success through Artificial Reproductive Therapy (ART) can be financially burdensome and emotionally taxing. The “necessity” of these procedures is a source of much debate, but to date, alternative therapies have been limited.
About ToConceive
The science behind ToConceive is based on the 2010 Nobel Prize in Medicine for In-Vitro Fertilization and Sperm Capacitation. The formulation was originally developed in Cincinnati, Ohio by an award-winning surgeon, OB-GYN and fertility expert. Unlike other over-the-counter lubrications, some of which contain spermicide, ToConceive is a vaginal gel, lubricant and moisturizer, clinically shown to help increase a woman’s own natural conception lubrication, called transudate, which helps aid in conception.
About M Pharmaceutical
Formed in early 2015, M Pharmaceutical Inc. is a clinical-stage company developing innovative technologies for obesity, weight management and Female Health & Wellness.  In addition to its recent acquisitions of C-103, a reformulation of Orlistat and assets from 40J’s LLC, the Company is scheduled to launch their FDA cleared fertility product branded as ToConceive in September of 2017.
M Pharmaceutical Inc. trades on the Canadian Securities Exchange (CSE) under the ticker symbol “MQ” as well as on the OTCQB as “MPHMF” and FWB (Frankfurt Stock Exchange) as “T3F2.”

M Pharmaceutical Inc. Announces Plans to Develop a Drug Product for Treatment of Female Sexual Dysfunction
 
 Vancouver, BC (FSCwire) - M Pharmaceutical Inc. (CSE: MQ, OTCQB: MPHMF, FWB: T3F2), (the "Company" or “M Pharma”), announced today as part of its planned acquisition of 40 J’s, it will continue to advance the development of a patented (additional patents pending) topical drug product for the treatment of female sexual dysfunction (FSD).
 
 “Unlike the other two drugs approved by the US FDA to treat FSD, our topical drug product would focus on women with orgasm and arousal difficulties.  Valeant’s Addyi, recently acquired from Sprout Pharmaceuticals, is indicated only for HSDD (desire disorder) with a number of FDA imposed prescription and marketing restrictions. Intrarosa, by Endoceutics, is indicated for dyspareunia (pain with intercourse) with certain prescribing restrictions.  Our proposed treatment is topical, local and non-systemic, with daily and on demand use, while being non-hormonal and not a central nervous system drug.  Based on these core attributes, the safety profiles of the API and excipients in the drug product, the dosage and delivery form, we anticipate the product to be extremely well tolerated and highly effective for a large number of women suffering from FSD and has a great likelihood of approval by the FDA,” said Mr. Thompson, CEO of M Pharmaceutical USA.
 
Formed in early 2015, M Pharmaceutical Inc. is a clinical-stage company developing innovative technologies for obesity and weight management.  In addition to its recent acquisition of C-103, a reformulation of orlistat from Chelatexx, LLC, the Company will focus on the development of its Trimeo capsules, temporary controllable pseudobezoars for non-invasive gastric volume reduction for the treatment of obesity, for which it has exclusive rights.  The Company has also recently acquired an FDA cleared fertility product branded as ToConceive that represents its first offering in the women's health field.
 
M Pharma trades on the Canadian Securities Exchange (CSE) under the ticker symbol “MQ” as well as on the OTCQB as “MPHMF” and FWB (Frankfurt Stock Exchange) as “T3F2.”

9 Ways We Assure the High Quality of Our Nutraceuticals & Nutritional Supplements9 Ways We Assure the High Quality of Our Nutraceuticals & Nutritional Supplements














9 Ways We Assure the High Quality of  Our Nutraceuticals & Nutritional Supplements
I'm sure you've heard of vitamins, herbs, and other nutritional products that flunked lab tests. Here at Advanced Bionutritionals, we strive to make sure that does not happen.
In fact, our manufacturing process assures purity, potency and quality 9 different ways:

"You Get An A+"
"Thank you. I did receive the credit back on my credit card. You often promote your "money back guarantee" with your literature. Well, you certainly deliver on your promise!!!.
I judge a company on Quality, Price and Service (you pass on all three) but the ultimate test comes when you have a "problem". Your company scored an "A+"!!!!!! You have earned my business forever. Thank you for your outstanding service and problem resolution!"
Patrick M., Colorado



We use suppliers and growers that we've known for years. 


We use ingredients that are shown to be effective in scientific studies.


We use no artificial colors, artificial binders, artificial fillers, or artificial preservatives, and non-GMO sources whenever available. 


Every supplier is qualified by testing multiple lots of material. The material is assayed for purity and screened for pathogens like mold, yeast, staph, and salmonella.


The batches of our ingredients are tested using FTIR spectrometers and compared to a purity index.


Our products are manufactured in a facility that is GMP (Good Manufacturing Practices) certified.


Batches of our product undergo rigorous disintegration tests in conformance with USP guidelines to ensure proper breakdown in the stomach and absorption in the intestines.


Our manufacturing process has multiple checks in place, and our batches are signed off by a quality control officer to ensure accuracy, purity, and potency.


Our bottles are safety sealed for lasting freshness and potency. And each bottle is marked with a manufactured date and/or an expiration date.





For you, that means the best quality possible. In fact, we promise it. If you are ever dissatisfied with one of our products for any reason whatsoever, simply return the unused portion within 90 days of purchase. We will refund every penny you paid, including shipping and handling. You only pay return shipping.

Frank Shallenberger, MD
Dr. Shallenberger has practiced medicine for more than 41 years, after earning his M.D. degree from the University of Maryland, School of Medicine, and receiving post-graduate training at Mt. Zion Hospital in San Francisco. Dr. Shallenberger is
also certified by the American Board of Anti-Aging Medicine (A.B.A.A.M.) as an anti-aging physician and has also been trained and certified in other areas of alternative medicine.

A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER 

















A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER

It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer. But what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality.
Rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy, immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread. Research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients, including kidney and lung cancer. In fact, research from the American Association for Cancer Research shows that for advanced-melanoma patients, survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options.
"It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer." Tweet
Biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types.
With 836 medicines and vaccines in development for cancer, 80 percent of which have the potential to be first-in-class treatments, millions of Americans living with cancer have hope for a brighter future.
Welcome to the new era of medicine.
For all of us.

HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

















HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

Diabetes is a serious condition that effects more than 30 million Americans. While complications of the disease can be dire, there is hope. Biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments.
Diabetes: the patient perspective
Diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose (sugar) in the blood. Normally, the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy. With diabetes, the body either does not make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or does not use it properly (type 2 diabetes), leading to high blood glucose levels. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications, such as heart attack, lower-limb amputation, vision impairment and blindness.
Endocrinologist Dr. William "Bill" Chin has experience treating endocrine disorders, including diabetes. As chief medical officer at PhRMA, he works to ensure that patient voices are heard, drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes. When Dr. Chin's son, Danny, was 15, he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst. Dr. Chin diagnosed his son himself with type 1 diabetes.
He says, "I don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease, particularly one that will be chronic. In many ways it’s forever, but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed."
The changing landscape of diabetes treatment
The medications that Danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years. A decade ago, a number of insulin options were available to patients, as well as oral and injected medications. Successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels. To control their glucose, patients needed multiple daily injections and/or multiple oral medicines.
In recent years, researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients, from fewer pills to less frequent injections. Careful monitoring and treatment are still needed, but current medicines in development offer a promising future.
There are 171 medicines currently in development for type 1 and type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related conditions. A new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels. Other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetes-related complications that affect the kidneys, blood vessels and eyes. All of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the FDA.
While these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type 1 diabetes, ongoing research remains critical. In fact, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2013.
Dr. Chin says, "Collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes ... we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease. This can only be achieved by having academic scientists and physician scientists working closely with scientists in the biopharmaceutical industry."

We cannot take progress for granted

















We cannot take progress for granted

We are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases. But we must not take this progress for granted.  To ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop life-saving treatments and cures.
In order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients, our country must:
1)    Make medicines more affordable by rewarding value
 Today, America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines. Prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment, or agreements may lower co-pays if patients achieve better health outcomes. While these partnerships will vary, they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system.
Yet, outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements.  Government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines. Rather, we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for Americans.
2)    Ensure patients get the best deal on medicines
America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). Those rebates are growing every year and now exceed $100 billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers.
But we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings, and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price, even when their insurers get a rebate. In fact, patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine.  That’s wrong. Health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive. This could lower out-of-pocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year.
3)    Make new breakthroughs accessible, and promote competition
We need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines. It simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over 10 years and over one billion dollars, on average.  Outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more. To get medicines approved faster, while ensuring safety, we need to modernize the FDA with new technologies and expertise to keep up with 21st century science. Modernizing the FDA will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines, which will bring medicines to patients faster, and enhance competition in the market.
We also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  This will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection. 
At the same time, we must avoid policies that deter risk-taking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients. Learn more about our plan to build a sustainable, science-based health care system that harnesses today’s hopes to discover tomorrow’s cures here.
