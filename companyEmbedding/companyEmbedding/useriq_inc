DefaultShowing 7 UserIQ reviewsDianna L.Review SourceDianna L.Validated ReviewVerified Current UserReview SourceLove the in-App notifications and Tool Tips!Updated On June  9, 2017Validated ReviewVerified Current UserWhat do you like best?My favorite think about UserIQ is that I don't need to get a developer or graphic designer involved to send out our release notes, webinar notifications, and tool tips. We've setup our Themes and apply them to the notifications and tool tips we need. I can easily add links, graphics, and videos.What do you dislike?When designing the notifications, the preview (on the UserIQ design screen) does not accurately reflect the end result. This is not really a big deal as they've made it super easy to preview on our Production environment.What business problems are you solving with the product?  What benefits have you realized?Release NotesWe're improving communication with our Users as email blasts were not being read and Users were not aware of new features and fixes.  Webinar RegistrationOur weekly complimentary webinar attendance has gone up dramatically since we started using monthly in-App notification. Real-Time SupportThe Tool Tips allow us to provide quick access to specific support documents and videos from the screen where the User has questions. This eliminates the need for them to go to "support" and search for a solution.Read MoreShare on0 of 0 found this helpful.Helpful?YesNo0 CommentsAdd a CommentAdd a CommentRespond as UserIQReport a ConcernDorte E.Review SourceDorte E.Validated ReviewReview SourceGuided tours for on-boardingUpdated On May 25, 2017Validated ReviewWhat do you like best?Super easy way to implement guided tours to point out the most important features. It's quick to implement tours and even customise the look-and-feel. What do you dislike?If buttons or links are very close to the edge of a page, it's difficult to get the arrows to point to the right place. Minor detail, but would like this to be more exact.What business problems are you solving with the product?  What benefits have you realized?When our clients sign up for a trial of our software, they now see a guided tour as the first thing. This way they know exactly where to start and where to find additional help. It makes it easy for clients to explore on their own.Read MoreShare on0 of 0 found this helpful.Helpful?YesNo0 CommentsAdd a CommentAdd a CommentRespond as UserIQReport a ConcernAre you a current user of UserIQ?YesNoWhat Customer Success solution do you use?GainsightEvergageAcceloWoopraClientSuccessLiferay Digital Experience PlatformCXQuestChurnZeroNateroMindTouchFullStoryWhatfixI don't use Customer Success softwareThanks for letting us know!Tad K.Review SourceTad K.Validated ReviewVerified Current UserReview SourceGreat tool for monitoring changes in accountsUpdated On June  7, 2017Validated ReviewVerified Current UserWhat do you like best?We use this tool to keep an eye on our less active accounts.  It helps us to be proactive with our clients, and saves us countless hours of manual monitoring.What do you dislike?The software is still very early in its journey.  The roadmap is full of great ideas that will increase its value exponentially.Recommendations to others considering the productThey are great partners.  They listen to your needs, and help find a solution to your specific needs.What business problems are you solving with the product?

It's perfect for any size marketing team, whether small or large. We saw great success with many campaigns and increased conversion rates on several key pages of our website.

What benefits have you realized?Depending upon the goal, we saw improvements in several key areas. We used the Guided Tour feature when launching a new process for our members, we used In-App Messaging to increase conversions, and we used the Survey tool to gather NPS data in order to help with our product timeline.

The UserIQ Story In 2013, the CIO of a B2B travel technology company wanted to complete a simple task: Alert users of their new mobile app launch. This undertaking proved anything but simple.

In 2014, that CIO, our very own Aaron Aycock, founded UserIQ.But UserIQ is more than just messaging and alerts. It is the first and only Customer Growth Platform™, empowering SaaS companies to foster growth beyond the funnel. From onboarding and retention to expansion and advocacy, UserIQ combines user intelligence, targeted engagements, and customer health to deliver what each customer needs to be successful, wherever they are in their journey. And successful customers mean reduced churn, increased lifetime value, and fewer customer support calls.Today, UserIQ is a Startup Atlanta-awarded ‘Best B2B Startup’ (2017) and a graduate of the Signature program at the Advanced Technology Development Center (ATDC) at Georgia Tech, a startup technology business incubator for early-stage startups. As a SaaS company, UserIQ understands the goals, challenges, and victories of other SaaS companies, which is why we’ve built the Customer Growth Platform to help your customers stay longer, spend more, advocate on your behalf, and bring new leads into your funnel.Watch Aaron’s interview with the ATDC Aaron AycockChief Product Officer, FounderMeet the teamAt UserIQ we’re extremely proud of the team we’ve built and the work we do.
