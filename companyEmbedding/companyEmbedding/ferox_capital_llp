Convertible Bond Specialist (Robert Coe) and Convertible Bond Analyst (Faisal Ishaq) scan the convertible universe for potential opportunities and, along with Joshua Mace-Jones execute trades. Robert Coe is also Portfolio Manager for our systematic offering - Ferox Investments ICAV –Chinook Global Convertible Bond Fund.  The Firm has developed a robust infrastructure over the last seventeen years which is managed by industry specialists and currently employs 25 people.

Welcome to Ferox Capital LLP
Ferox Capital LLP is a discretionary investment  manager specialising in generating returns from diversified global convertible  bond strategies. The Firm was founded in 2000 by Jeremy Herrmann, Alex Warren  and Rupert Mathews.  The Firm runs a number of convertible bond strategies  (including long-only and leveraged, UCITS and Cayman, active and systematic)  that focus on all parts of the convertible spectrum.  The investment  process continues to be managed by Jeremy and Rupert who personally invest  heavily in the funds that they manage. Alex remains involved with the  investment manager on a non-executive basis. 
 We believe our exclusive focus on the convertible  market by our experienced research team dedicated solely to extracting alpha  from the opportunities which arise in the asset class is key to our competitive  advantage.  The Firm currently manages assets of around $1.7 billion.

Disclosure of commitment to the 
Financial Reporting Council's Stewardship Code (The Code) under FCA COBS 
2.2.3R.
Ferox Capital LLP (The Firm) is an 
investment manager based in the United Kingdom and authorised and regulated by 
the Financial Conduct Authority. We endeavour to apply our approach on 
stewardship to all companies that we invest in on behalf of our clients. Our 
approach is consistent with the Firms overall aims, which are to provide good 
long-term performance to our clients, and keeping clients interests paramount. 

The Firm monitors all investee companies 
as part of its general investment policy and approach. The Firm takes action in 
line with its investment objectives where its research of publically available 
information warrants such action. However, given the nature of our chosen 
investment strategy, this approach does not include active engagement with UK 
listed investee companies, nor do we consider that our clients would expect such 
engagement.   If our investment strategy changes in such a manner 
that the provisions of the Code become relevant, the Firm will amend this 
disclosure accordingly.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50
100




Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year




How many days after the end-of-quarter date before doing the backtest? (0 - 60) 

DAYS





      Or use day whenever the filing was submitted to the SEC
      (or the last filing when using a group of funds):
Starting Quarter

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).
      You can optionally adjust when the backtest actually starts.
