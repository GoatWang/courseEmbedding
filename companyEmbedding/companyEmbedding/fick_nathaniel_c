Early life and education[edit]
Fick was born in Baltimore, Maryland in 1977, and attended Loyola Blakefield high school in Towson, Maryland. Fick went on to attend Dartmouth College. He later graduated with degrees in classics and government in 1999. While at Dartmouth, Fick captained the cycling team to a U.S. National Championship and wrote a senior thesis on Thucydides' History of the Peloponnesian War and its implications for American foreign policy.[2]
Career[edit]
In 1998, after his junior year at Dartmouth, Fick attended the United States Marine Corps Officer Candidates School and was commissioned a second lieutenant upon his college graduation the following year.[1]
Fick was trained as an infantry officer and was eventually assigned as a platoon commander to 1st Battalion 1st Marines. He was an officer in the Amphibious Ready Group of the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit based in Darwin, Northern Territory training with the Australian Army for humanitarian operations deployment to East Timor until the September 11 attacks. He then led his platoon into Afghanistan for Operation Enduring Freedom to support the War on Terror. Upon his return to the United States in March 2002, he was recommended for Marine reconnaissance training. He also completed Army Airborne School.[3] He subsequently led Second Platoon of Bravo Company of the 1st Reconnaissance Battalion during the invasion of Iraq in 2003.
Fick left the U.S. Marine Corps as a captain in December 2003,[4] and Captain Brent Morel took his place as platoon commander. Morel was killed in a firefight in Fallujah in April, 2004.
Fick wrote a book, One Bullet Away: The Making of a Marine Officer, detailing his experiences in the Marine Corps. The New York Times wrote about his book: "Fick doesn't slop through the muck of Marines culture, as Anthony Swofford ably did in "Jarhead," his book about the first gulf war. Instead, he offers fast-paced tactical deconstruction, leavened with introspection. Fick thrived on military training and combat even as he faced the gut-wrenching inversion of values he held dear."[5] He received the Colby Award for One Bullet Away in 2006.[6]
He also occasionally writes articles about military matters,[1] such as his criticism of Anthony Swofford's book Jarhead.[7]
Fick became the Chief Operating Officer (COO) at the Center for a New American Security and later was appointed CEO in June 2009.[8]
Fick has spoken before the Senate Democratic Policy Committee on Iraq[9] and spoke at the 2008 Democratic National Convention on August 28, 2008.
Fick was elected to Dartmouth College's Board of Trustees in April 2012.[10] He also serves on the Military & Veterans Advisory Council at JPMorgan Chase & Co.
It was announced by CNAS that Fick would step down as CEO at the end of November 2012 in order to "become the Chief Executive Officer of Endgame, Inc., a leading venture-backed provider of advanced cyber security solutions."[11]
Personal life[edit]
He resides in Washington, D.C. with his family.[10]
In popular culture[edit]
Fick and his platoon were the subject of a series of articles in Rolling Stone and the book Generation Kill by embedded journalist Evan Wright. Generation Kill was adapted into a miniseries of the same name by HBO, in which Fick was portrayed by Stark Sands.

Fick's Book is Good!
Fick's book is a good read. I did prefer Evan Wright's Generation Kill a little bit more because it covered a wider scope of personalities and soldiers. Fick's book is very comprehensive and goes into great detail of what a leader of men in battle must deal with on a daily basis. If you liked the Generation Kill Book/TV Series you will probably like Fick's book as well, I did. Fick's book is more strategic and written from  a command/leadership point of view compared to Wright's book which is just written by a regular guy but a guy who writes for a living so it is probably a little more entertaining than Fick's book for  the average/nonmilitary reader like myself.

Great read....No questions!!
I first heard of Fick in Generation Kill. When I found that Fick had a book out himself I bought it without reading any reviews and have not been disappointed!! I have yet to put the book down and am appreciative of an author that writes with such truth and honesty. It is simply put.... a great read!

Good reading about the invasion of Iraq from 1st POV
I bought this book after watching the mini series Generation Kill.  The mini series was really entertaining the book is more straight forward of what actually happened to the 1st battalion recon team during the invasion of Iraq.  Some very interesting things were noted.  A good read.

4.0 out of 5 starsA great officer account of modern warfare!ByJoe Creasonon August 24, 2014I listened to the 16.5 hour long unabridged edition of this book narrated by Andy Paris. The last paragraph of this review focuses on that production specifically.4 stars: A straight-forward account of Marine combat in Afghanistan and Iraq from the POV of a Jr Officer.Nate Fick was a main character portrayed in HBO’s 2008 miniseries GENERATION KILL (based on Evan Wright’s 2004 memoir of the same name). This memoir was written before the miniseries but after Wright's account, in 2005. It covers his introduction into the Marine Corps, deployment to Afghanistan, subsequent training as a Recon Marine and then his role as an Lt in the 2003 invasion of Iraq.Fick is a capable writer and his story doesn’t simply cover the same ground covered in GK. You learn that he scored expert on the rifle range, was a weapons platoon commander, underwent varying rigorous courses of special forces-esque training and you also get a lot more information on lesser known members of the Recon Platoon he leads into Iraq. For example, Gunny Wynn is a much more significant character in the last half of Fick’s account due to his role in the unit organization.Fick is able to portray the demand and stress associated with small unit leadership and his boot camp and advanced training segments are more interesting than other accounts I’ve read, but this account is a more straight-forward, almost sterile one. It isn’t devoid of opinions or personal reflection, but that’s not the focus of his account. This is not necessarily a drawback, but it makes for a less riveting combat account when Fick finds himself in the thick of the fighting.Instead of a blow-by-blow combat account, we’re given one about leading competent men into modern warfare which, despite the subpar decision making skills of some of his superiors, sees him and his men through two different stints in combat without any KIAs.However this does make the book less compelling ultimately, and I also felt that his training portion of the memoir, though better than others was still a bit bloated and could have been a bit shorter.But these cons are drastically outweighed by the pros of Fick’s account, making it stand on it’s own as a story of the Wars on Terror, apart from Wright’s and later the miniseries. I also feel it is one of the best officer accounts published about this conflict, hence my scoring it 4/5 stars.In terms of recommendations I'd say check out Wright’s book, though it is from the perspective of an embedded journalist. Also check out the miniseries because it is brilliantly made, acted and produced by the people behind THE WIRE, too.Concerning modern combat memoir recommendations: the best one so far is still HOUSE TO HOUSE by David Bellavia and the best officer account is LIONS OF KANDAHAR. There are many accounts out there and I have a listmania ranking them if you’re interested.As for the audiobook: I got a copy of the unabridged audiobook on tape read by Andy Paris. Paris reads the book well, if a bit dry but he changes up his voice acting for different characters though he sticks to the same tempo throughout all the different settings. The abridged version is read by Fick himself but I haven’t listened to it and read somewhere that Fick himself wasn’t happy with how the abridged book was edited.

2.0 out of 5 starsBland and safeByS. L. Jacobson September 22, 2014I am surprised at the number of overwhelmingly positive reviews for this book. I read this because the author was portrayed so admirably in Generation Kill (which I recommend) by Evan Wright. This is not a terrible book. This trouble is that the author keeps it safe and bland.  I get the impression that he does not want to offend anyone. Another reviewer referred to this book as a politician’s memoir.  I think this hits the nail on the head. If you are going to read a military memoir there are probably dozens (perhaps hundreds) of better choices.

I was a platoon commander in Vietnam. Interestingly, while the equipment has changed, and while the training and physical shape is better, the issues are the same. Seemingly the author doesn't understand what is at stake.He apparently went into the Marines to prove something to or about himself. He ended up in a shooting war. That's what Marines do. One needs to grasp that from the beginning. The psychological strain of combat is significant, but to this day it seems poorly understood. Fick is only one in a long line of men who have had this issue. The fact combat runs faster today only makes the strain quicker to attach itself to a person.Today PTSD is the preferred term for what Fick went through. But it really isn't PTSD. It's moral injury. Most of us have an internal compass that tells us right from wrong. (Those biblically inclined will note Genesis 2). When up against killing another human being, we tend to balk. Fink balked. Lt. Col Grossman wrote a number of books about this subject, but mostly they are observations of fact, not really an understanding of what happens.Fink was not decompressed properly. Neither were any of us from Vietnam. The last proper decompression was WWII when the troops had time to just talk amongst themselves and then be greeted by a grateful nation on returning.I hope he has managed to find his peace somewhere.0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuseCommentInsert product linkPaste the product's web address below:Product not found.

This book was suggested to me by my son who has completed college, Officer Candidate School, The Basic School and is currently in MOS tank school for United States Marines. His statement to me was "this is remarkably accurate ". I found the book interesting, scary, and enhancing my already high regard for the marines and especially those that choose to lead as officers. This book also serves to help us focus on a difficult part of our country history, specifically Iraq and Afghanistan invasions. And the reintroduction of our soldiers into society. I recommend this book and say to captain Fick, Semper Fidelis.0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuseCommentInsert product linkPaste the product's web address below:Product not found.

Please try again later.5.0 out of 5 starsFascinating insight into both the achievements and limits of military training.ByWiltDurkeyon July 6, 2014Format: Kindle Edition|Verified PurchaseOne thing that has always intrigued me is the US/British/Western(?) hierarchy between grunts, noncoms and officers.  This has been the key to successful small unit tactics and flexibility.  Many, many, armies have never quite gotten the hang of it and operate with essentially troopers and officers.  The Soviet-derived model is officer heavy with not much importance attached to noncoms.  Yet, in practice, a truly flexible and adaptable military, capable of tactical innovation, needs all 3.Noncoms (sergeants and up, pardon me if I mess this up) are extremely key to making things work.  But their "making", to echo the books' title is pretty clear.  They come up from the ranks and although they command the regular soldiers they come from the same background, only they have years of experience and they are the cream of the crop.  Their role is key, but this book does not cover it much.Every army also needs officers, but the difference is that lieutenants are expected to make life and death decisions for troopers who are barely any younger than they are and who often have more combat experience.  Often, their primary qualification is being more educated, which is not necessarily relevant on the battlefield.  As they get older and more experienced, they, hopefully (but not always as this book also shows) become more qualified to lead troops.Mr. Fick's book is an extremely interesting look at how the USMC trains these junior officers.  In his case, due to his dedication and humility he comes out ready to take on this important responsibility.  If you read through the lines, some of his fellow officers are not as good, even if the majority of officers perform admirably.  Incompetent and glory seeking leaders have been the bane of the military for millennia, especially when wars are preceded by long periods of peace.  Still, the overall impression I got was that the USMC is trying (no, I did not say "doing its best") to weed out the useless.  Perhaps more in training than once they have graduated, which is similar to what we see in other professions, like doctors.He mentions in passing a reason why his First Recon unit in Iraq had _some_ less than stellar leaders.  Recon marines were expected to operate at the noncom/trooper level in the field.  As a result, most of the officers were desk bound and might have found themselves out of their depth in the front lines.If you are interested by the military give it a read.  It is most definitely nuanced and does not "rah rah" the problems raised by the use of deadly force.  Despite a deep respect for the military way of life.One caveat:  those solely interested in Iraq/Afghanistan coverage will find that it is not the main subject here.  Lt. Fick only covers two fairly short deployments.  On the other hand, it dovetails nicely and covers the same unit and mission as Generation Kill, albeit in a less critical fashion.0Comment|

I'd watched Gen Kill years ago when it ...ByLisa Levyon August 9, 2016Format: Kindle Edition|Verified PurchaseI was really impressed from the very first word. The book is paced well, it's interesting, it's engaging. It's very, very good. I'd watched Gen Kill years ago when it came out and just recently watched it again. I hadn't realized until recently that Nate had written a book as well and I was incredibly interested to see his take on what Evan had written and how closely it mirrored the HBO series.0Comment|

Please try again later.5.0 out of 5 starsExcellent.ByKindle Customeron May 12, 2014Format: Kindle Edition|Verified PurchaseThis is obviously a non-fiction book.  That can be seen clearly by the thoughts, actions and emotions from start to finish. Truly, a well written book, by an intelligent and caring human being. I believe the author is of the few excellent authors that can describe life at it's best, worst and emotional stages of doing what needs to be done, thinking with mind and heart and succeeding without destroying one's inner being.  Once a Marine, ALWAYS a Marine. I am grateful that we have such intelligent men and women doing the country's most objectionable work following their own heart and soul, when able to.  THANK YOU.0Comment|

Please try again later.5.0 out of 5 starsMore Than A Combat MemoirByNightRangeron July 21, 2014Format: Kindle Edition|Verified PurchaseThis story of one Marine officer’s transition from Ivy League college kid to thoroughly squared away combat leader is worth the read on many levels. Fick’s sense of duty leads him to join the Corps’ PLC training between his junior and senior year. He seeks a challenge and quickly finds it especially after 911 when the training ceases and it becomes a real war.Fick’s account of combat, its after effects and his riflemen’s reaction to it are well-written and put the reader there. He is unafraid to criticize the bad leadership he saw as well as salute the bravery of the kids ordered to fight in this misguided attempt at nation building. His description of combat deaths is sympathetic without being maudlin.This book is worth the read for the grunts among us. Fick’s attitude about measuring up and seeking a challenge will surely resonate with those of us who had the same questions in the middle 1960’s.0Comment|

Please try again later.5.0 out of 5 starsA very well-written book about marine life in the 2003 Iraq warByAmazon Customeron May 14, 2014Format: Kindle Edition|Verified PurchaseI liked this book a lot. It told an interesting story (2/3 at least about being in the 2003-2011 Iraq war), and was very well written. No dead spots in the story, no big grammar, typo, or formatting issues. Interesting information throughout, educational, well-presented and balanced in points of view, and told many very real stories of what it is like to be fighting in the fog of war as part of a large military organization.The author did a really nice job on this book, I think. I'm amazed at the detail and accuracy throughout the book, because it's hard to imagine him taking detailed notes throughout his campaign. (On the other hand, he tells many stories of all the paperwork that is involved in planning missions, so he definitely was familiar with working with paper, as well as his recon troops!)I would easily recommend this book to anyone who is interested in these kinds of topics.Another good book that I liked on a similar topic (although with far fewer combat stories) is Life in the French Foreign Legion: How to Join and What to Expect When You Get There.0Comment|

Jacobson September 22, 2014Format: Kindle Edition|Verified PurchaseI am surprised at the number of overwhelmingly positive reviews for this book. I read this because the author was portrayed so admirably in Generation Kill (which I recommend) by Evan Wright. This is not a terrible book. This trouble is that the author keeps it safe and bland.  I get the impression that he does not want to offend anyone. Another reviewer referred to this book as a politician’s memoir.  I think this hits the nail on the head. If you are going to read a military memoir there are probably dozens (perhaps hundreds) of better choices.0Comment|

There was a problem loading comments right now. Please try again later.5.0 out of 5 starsAn unusual military adventureByChuck Ashfordon May 17, 2014Format: Kindle Edition|Verified PurchaseIntrospective may be the best description of this military adventure book.  Throughout the plot, there is an strong undercurrent of exactly why the military does things the way they do.  How they build strong soldiers, how the civilian world really has no concept of this process, and why the civilian world does not really want to know.The "one bullet" analogy is introduced early and it sticks in the readers mind as the adventure unfolds.  The conclusion of the book avoids triteness.  Things are not wrapped up in a neat bundle.  Rather just the opposite, very similar to the situation many of our military heroes must experience upon returning home from combat.An unusual read, well worth your time.0Comment|

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

 From Publishers Weekly The global war on terrorism has spawned some excellent combat narratives-mostly by journalists. Warriors, like Marine Corps officer Fick, bring a different and essential perspective to the story. A classics major at Dartmouth, Fick joined the Marines in 1998 because he "wanted to go on a great adventure... to do something so hard that no one could ever talk shit to me." Thus begins his odyssey through the grueling regimen of Marine training and wartime deployments-an odyssey that he recounts in vivid detail in this candid and fast-paced memoir. Fick was first deployed to Afghanistan, where he saw little combat, but his Operation [Iraqi] Freedom unit, the elite 1st Reconnaissance Battalion, helped spearhead the invasion of Iraq and "battled through every town on Highway 7" from Nasiriyah to al Kut. (Rolling Stone writer Evan Wright's provocative Generation Kill is based on his travels with Fick's unit.) Like the best combat memoirs, Fick's focuses on the men doing the fighting and avoids hyperbole and sensationalism. He does not shrink from the truth-however personal or unpleasant. "I was aware enough," he admits after a firefight, "to be concerned that I was starting to enjoy it." Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

                    Editorial Reviews
                    
                 




From Publishers Weekly The global war on terrorism has spawned some excellent combat narratives-mostly by journalists. Warriors, like Marine Corps officer Fick, bring a different and essential perspective to the story. A classics major at Dartmouth, Fick joined the Marines in 1998 because he "wanted to go on a great adventure... to do something so hard that no one could ever talk shit to me." Thus begins his odyssey through the grueling regimen of Marine training and wartime deployments-an odyssey that he recounts in vivid detail in this candid and fast-paced memoir. Fick was first deployed to Afghanistan, where he saw little combat, but his Operation [Iraqi] Freedom unit, the elite 1st Reconnaissance Battalion, helped spearhead the invasion of Iraq and "battled through every town on Highway 7" from Nasiriyah to al Kut. (Rolling Stone writer Evan Wright's provocative Generation Kill is based on his travels with Fick's unit.) Like the best combat memoirs, Fick's focuses on the men doing the fighting and avoids hyperbole and sensationalism. He does not shrink from the truth-however personal or unpleasant. "I was aware enough," he admits after a firefight, "to be concerned that I was starting to enjoy it." Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Top customer reviews4.0 out of 5 starsA great officer account of modern warfare!ByJoe Creasonon August 24, 2014Format: Audio Cassette|Verified PurchaseI listened to the 16.5 hour long unabridged edition of this book narrated by Andy Paris. The last paragraph of this review focuses on that production specifically.4 stars: A straight-forward account of Marine combat in Afghanistan and Iraq from the POV of a Jr Officer.Nate Fick was a main character portrayed in HBO’s 2008 miniseries GENERATION KILL (based on Evan Wright’s 2004 memoir of the same name). This memoir was written before the miniseries but after Wright's account, in 2005. It covers his introduction into the Marine Corps, deployment to Afghanistan, subsequent training as a Recon Marine and then his role as an Lt in the 2003 invasion of Iraq.Fick is a capable writer and his story doesn’t simply cover the same ground covered in GK. You learn that he scored expert on the rifle range, was a weapons platoon commander, underwent varying rigorous courses of special forces-esque training and you also get a lot more information on lesser known members of the Recon Platoon he leads into Iraq. For example, Gunny Wynn is a much more significant character in the last half of Fick’s account due to his role in the unit organization.Fick is able to portray the demand and stress associated with small unit leadership and his boot camp and advanced training segments are more interesting than other accounts I’ve read, but this account is a more straight-forward, almost sterile one. It isn’t devoid of opinions or personal reflection, but that’s not the focus of his account. This is not necessarily a drawback, but it makes for a less riveting combat account when Fick finds himself in the thick of the fighting.Instead of a blow-by-blow combat account, we’re given one about leading competent men into modern warfare which, despite the subpar decision making skills of some of his superiors, sees him and his men through two different stints in combat without any KIAs.However this does make the book less compelling ultimately, and I also felt that his training portion of the memoir, though better than others was still a bit bloated and could have been a bit shorter.But these cons are drastically outweighed by the pros of Fick’s account, making it stand on it’s own as a story of the Wars on Terror, apart from Wright’s and later the miniseries. I also feel it is one of the best officer accounts published about this conflict, hence my scoring it 4/5 stars.In terms of recommendations I'd say check out Wright’s book, though it is from the perspective of an embedded journalist. Also check out the miniseries because it is brilliantly made, acted and produced by the people behind THE WIRE, too.Concerning modern combat memoir recommendations: the best one so far is still HOUSE TO HOUSE by David Bellavia and the best officer account is LIONS OF KANDAHAR. There are many accounts out there and I have a listmania ranking them if you’re interested.As for the audiobook: I got a copy of the unabridged audiobook on tape read by Andy Paris. Paris reads the book well, if a bit dry but he changes up his voice acting for different characters though he sticks to the same tempo throughout all the different settings. The abridged version is read by Fick himself but I haven’t listened to it and read somewhere that Fick himself wasn’t happy with how the abridged book was edited.Read more0Comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse4.0 out of 5 starsHelmet for my Pillow - the hard life of a MarineByDevereauxon July 20, 2017Format: Hardcover|Verified PurchaseInteresting perspective of a combat Marine. I was a platoon commander in Vietnam. Interestingly, while the equipment has changed, and while the training and physical shape is better, the issues are the same. Seemingly the author doesn't understand what is at stake.He apparently went into the Marines to prove something to or about himself. He ended up in a shooting war. That's what Marines do. One needs to grasp that from the beginning. The psychological strain of combat is significant, but to this day it seems poorly understood. Fick is only one in a long line of men who have had this issue. The fact combat runs faster today only makes the strain quicker to attach itself to a person.Today PTSD is the preferred term for what Fick went through. But it really isn't PTSD. It's moral injury. Most of us have an internal compass that tells us right from wrong. (Those biblically inclined will note Genesis 2). When up against killing another human being, we tend to balk. Fink balked. Lt. Col Grossman wrote a number of books about this subject, but mostly they are observations of fact, not really an understanding of what happens.Fink was not decompressed properly. Neither were any of us from Vietnam. The last proper decompression was WWII when the troops had time to just talk amongst themselves and then be greeted by a grateful nation on returning.I hope he has managed to find his peace somewhere.Read more0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsOne Bullet AwayByfiremnmikeon June 3, 2017Format: Kindle Edition|Verified PurchaseThis is an amazing book highlighting the difficult road of going from ordinary college graduate to the super ordinary life of a marine officer, and then to war. This book was suggested to me by my son who has completed college, Officer Candidate School, The Basic School and is currently in MOS tank school for United States Marines. His statement to me was "this is remarkably accurate ". I found the book interesting, scary, and enhancing my already high regard for the marines and especially those that choose to lead as officers. This book also serves to help us focus on a difficult part of our country history, specifically Iraq and Afghanistan invasions. And the reintroduction of our soldiers into society. I recommend this book and say to captain Fick, Semper Fidelis.Read more0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuseSee all verified purchase reviews (newest first)Write a customer review

A book is the nearest thing we have to telepathy, sending thoughts from the author's mind directly to the readers even over a gap of two thousand years. Even with all our technology, there is no better way to make a brain to brain connection than by simply reading a book. Go Way Back to the BeginningAntique books and manuscripts offer an amazing look into history, you can see the thoughts of the past as they saw them themselves. Antiquarian and collectible books don't just look good on the shelf, they also grow in value. There is nothing like picking up an old book to really feel the past. Explore the Human ConditionThe beauty of fiction and literature is that it lets you explore the human condition in a way that mere recitations of fact can never duplicate. Rather than focusing on the mundane, these books bring out the emotional truth of human experience. They show you who you really are by exposing you to other experiences you could never have discovered yourself. These books are the underpinnings of human culture. See how someone else sees the world. Discover the World Around YouNon fiction books offer the widest range of human experience, joined only by their commitment to the truth. From self-help to space travel, they run the gamut of human thought. Learn how to deal with your family, how to save money for that trip, or how the Egyptians built the pyramids. Follow famous lives, or study esoteric philosophies. It's all there for you to find. Non fiction gives us the foundations of human civilization, the story of how everything works. Keep Learning for LifeEducation is the gateway to success, and textbooks are your key to that door. From elementary readers to calculus texts, these books are the doors to our full potential. Textbooks not only give us facts, they give us the tools to interpret and make use of those facts. They are the key to organizing our thoughts and making our brains work for us.

JP Morgan Chase. Target. Sony. Each has been part of the growing number of cyber-attacks against private companies around the world in recent years. In the latter two cases, CEOs were forced to resign in the wake of the breach. Attacks are growing more sophisticated and more damaging, targeting what companies value the most: their customer data, their intellectual property, and their reputations.
What these attacks – together with breaches to defense, law-enforcement, and military-contractor networks – reveal is that our cyber-security efforts over the last two decades have largely failed, and fixing this will require the attention not only of security officers and IT teams, but also of boards and CEOs.
Companies need to take a new approach. They can do so by looking at themselves through the eyes of their attackers. In the military this is called turning the map around. The point is to get inside the mind of the enemy, and to see the situation as they do, in order to anticipate and prepare for what’s to come.
Unfortunately, this mindset is still too rare. Despite spending billions of dollars every year on the latest security products and hiring the best security engineers and analysts, companies are more vulnerable than they’ve ever been. Two trends account for this: the rapid convergence of enterprise IT architectures, and the proliferation of increasingly sophisticated adversaries.
Changes in enterprise IT over the past decade mean that every company is now a technology company. By the end of the decade, there will be 50 billion devices connected to the Internet, complicating networks and generating petabytes of data. To add to that, the cloud revolution has finally dissolved perimeters – companies enjoying the benefits of infrastructure as a service must depend upon the security of networks and systems beyond their direct control.
As mobility, the Internet of Things, and the cloud change enterprises, adversaries are also becoming more sophisticated. States and state-sponsored entities spy on and attack private companies, often using military-grade tactics and capabilities. They do this within a system where offense enjoys a structural advantage over defense because attribution is difficult, deterrence is uncertain, and attackers need to succeed only once, but defenders must succeed always.
Most companies try to deal with this chaos by parsing signal from noise. They build walled castles around their most precious assets, but perimeters don’t matter when even the average college student owns seven IP-enabled devices. They rely on automated alerts to tell them when something malicious on their networks matches some previous bad event, but this approach overwhelms them with red flags while remaining blind to new and previously unknown threats.
There’s just too much noise to contend with. Security analysts, for example, may see a thousand incidents in a given day, but only have the time and resources to investigate a fraction of them. This is why hackers were able to exfiltrate over 40 million credit-card numbers from Target, despite the fact that a peripheral network device had detected the malware. It’s also the reason why Neiman Marcus was hacked after its system generated over 60-days’ worth of malware alerts. And this is why Sony was hacked after its IT team knew the company had been under attack for two years.
By turning the map around, executive teams can learn a great deal about their own companies, and better prepare for the inevitable attacks. This is how most companies look from an attacker’s perspective:

Their security is overwhelmingly focused on generic malware detection and protection against automated threats that aren’t being guided with precision.
They don’t have a full picture of what is on their networks, the cloud services they’re using, the applications running on those services, and the security postures of their supply chains and partners. Their IT and security teams are peripheral concerns, costs to be managed rather than centers of excellence that support the core business.
Overall, they are reactive, rather than proactive, in their approach to security.

Each bullet-point above is a weakness that attackers can exploit. This is why companies should learn from attackers in deciding how to defend themselves. Here’s how.
1. Understand your major risks and how adversaries aim to exploit them. If security could be calculated, then adversaries would be the numerator. Companies must understand their unique threatscapes to the greatest possible extent, and generic data are insufficient. Effective security must integrate indicators of compromise (have we been attacked?), tactics, techniques and procedures (how are we being targeted?), identity intelligence (who would target us, and why?), vulnerability intelligence (what is being exploited in the wild?), and attack attribution (is this commodity or targeted?). Only with focused threat intelligence can analysts spend their precious and valuable time investigating the most important incidents, prioritizing those associated with your most formidable adversaries and your greatest business risks. You can go crazy (and broke) trying to play Whack-A-Mole in defense against them all. Instead, identify your most essential assets and focus scarce resources only on those threats that actually pose a risk to your company.







2. Take inventory of your assets and monitor them continuously. If security could be calculated, then inventory would be the denominator. At the simplest level, companies must identify and monitor all of their interconnected assets: is a developer spinning up a thousand virtual machines without your knowledge? What applications are running on the database servers holding your most valuable information? Did an employee connect a new device to your corporate network? Does one of your distant subsidiaries have a new partner? Does your HVAC system connect somehow with your Point of Sale? Periodic assessments, reports that take weeks to prepare, and conclusions that require complex interpretation contribute to gaps in security. Companies must maintain a dynamic, real-time inventory of assets, monitor those assets continuously, and render them visually in way that is simple and intuitive for security and operations teams.
3. Make security a part of your mission. The prevailing approach to security is compliance-focused, cost-constrained, peripheral to the core business, and delegatable by C-suite leaders. Working on a team like that isn’t fun inside any enterprise, and it loses against 21st-century adversaries who know that it’s more fun to be a pirate than to join the Navy. Any defense is only as good as the people doing the defending. The new model of security needs to be about mission and leadership, ensuring that we have the best defenders up against the best attackers. Security is no longer delegable, and the mission of security teams must be synonymous with the mission of the company.
4. Be active, not passive, in hunting adversaries on your network and removing them. The term “active defense” has been tarred as a euphemism for “hacking back,” and companies are ill-advised to go on the offensive: first, it’s illegal to access others’ networks without permission, even if you’re acting in supposed self-defense; and second, it’s just not smart to escalate unless you can dominate, and even the biggest companies will ultimately lose against state or state-sponsored adversaries. So while you cannot go attack the other team on their own turf, you can and increasingly must be active against adversaries inside your own networks. This means assuming not merely that you are under attack, but that your attacker is in, and so you must hunt for a stealthy, persistent human adversary in order to contain and remediate the risk before they can cause damage – dramatically cutting the time between breach and detection from its current average of more than 200 days.
It is easy during these days of frequent and devastating attacks to cry out that the sky is falling, and that the very future of the Internet as a trusted domain of commerce and communication is at stake. But it would be wrong to extrapolate the data points of recent years into a line leading to ruin. Too many of us have too much at stake here, and the combined forces of executives, entrepreneurs, software developers, security teams, and investors all turning the map around can equip us to defend against this next generation of adversaries.

He is also an Operating Partner at Bessemer Venture Partners. He came to public notice for his writing on military life and the conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq.[1] Fick is the author of One Bullet Away: The Making of a Marine Officer, a memoir of his military experience published in 2005 that was a New York Times bestseller, one of the Washington Post's "Best Books of the Year," and one of the Military Times' "Best Military Books of the Decade."

Early life and education[edit]
Fick was born in Baltimore, Maryland in 1977, and attended Loyola Blakefield high school in Towson, Maryland. Fick went on to attend Dartmouth College. He later graduated with degrees in classics and government in 1999. While at Dartmouth, Fick captained the cycling team to a U.S. National Championship and wrote a senior thesis on Thucydides' History of the Peloponnesian War and its implications for American foreign policy.[2]
Career[edit]
In 1998, after his junior year at Dartmouth, Fick attended the United States Marine Corps Officer Candidates School and was commissioned a second lieutenant upon his college graduation the following year.[1]
Fick was trained as an infantry officer and was eventually assigned as a platoon commander to 1st Battalion 1st Marines. He was an officer in the Amphibious Ready Group of the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit based in Darwin, Northern Territory training with the Australian Army for humanitarian operations deployment to East Timor until the September 11 attacks. He then led his platoon into Afghanistan for Operation Enduring Freedom to support the War on Terror. Upon his return to the United States in March 2002, he was recommended for Marine reconnaissance training. He also completed Army Airborne School.[3] He subsequently led Second Platoon of Bravo Company of the 1st Reconnaissance Battalion during the invasion of Iraq in 2003.
Fick left the U.S. Marine Corps as a captain in December 2003,[4] and Captain Brent Morel took his place as platoon commander. Morel was killed in a firefight in Fallujah in April, 2004.
Fick wrote a book, One Bullet Away: The Making of a Marine Officer, detailing his experiences in the Marine Corps. The New York Times wrote about his book: "Fick doesn't slop through the muck of Marines culture, as Anthony Swofford ably did in "Jarhead," his book about the first gulf war. Instead, he offers fast-paced tactical deconstruction, leavened with introspection. Fick thrived on military training and combat even as he faced the gut-wrenching inversion of values he held dear."[5] He received the Colby Award for One Bullet Away in 2006.[6]
He also occasionally writes articles about military matters,[1] such as his criticism of Anthony Swofford's book Jarhead.[7]
Fick became the Chief Operating Officer (COO) at the Center for a New American Security and later was appointed CEO in June 2009.[8]
Fick has spoken before the Senate Democratic Policy Committee on Iraq[9] and spoke at the 2008 Democratic National Convention on August 28, 2008.
Fick was elected to Dartmouth College's Board of Trustees in April 2012.[10] He also serves on the Military & Veterans Advisory Council at JPMorgan Chase & Co.
It was announced by CNAS that Fick would step down as CEO at the end of November 2012 in order to "become the Chief Executive Officer of Endgame, Inc., a leading venture-backed provider of advanced cyber security solutions."[11]
Personal life[edit]
He resides in Washington, D.C. with his family.[10]
In popular culture[edit]
Fick and his platoon were the subject of a series of articles in Rolling Stone and the book Generation Kill by embedded journalist Evan Wright. Generation Kill was adapted into a miniseries of the same name by HBO, in which Fick was portrayed by Stark Sands.

Helmet for my Pillow - the hard life of a Marine, July 20, 2017


By Devereaux


Verified Purchase(What's this?)


This review is from: One Bullet Away: The Making of a Marine Officer by Nathaniel C. Fick (2005-10-03) (Hardcover)

Interesting perspective of a combat Marine. I was a platoon commander in Vietnam. Interestingly, while the equipment has changed, and while the training and physical shape is better, the issues are the same. Seemingly the author doesn't understand what is at stake.He apparently went into the Marines to prove something to or about himself. He ended up in a shooting war. That's what Marines do. One needs to grasp that from the beginning. The psychological strain of combat is significant, but to this day it seems poorly understood. Fick is only one in a long line of men who have had this issue. The fact combat runs faster today only makes the strain quicker to attach itself to a person.Today PTSD is the preferred term for what Fick went through. But it really isn't PTSD. It's moral injury. Most of us have an internal compass that tells us right from wrong. (Those biblically inclined will note Genesis 2). When up against killing another human being, we tend to balk. Fink balked. Lt. Col Grossman wrote a number of books about this subject, but mostly they are observations of fact, not really an understanding of what happens.Fink was not decompressed properly. Neither were any of us from Vietnam. The last proper decompression was WWII when the troops had time to just talk amongst themselves and then be greeted by a grateful nation on returning.I hope he has managed to find his peace somewhere.

"One Bullet Away" provides a well-written and thoughtful counterpoint to "Generation Kill" (which, let's face it, is the reason 90% of readers picked up this book).Fick is an excellent writer, and conveys a side of war not often seen, including an interesting insight into some of the confusion and tension immediately following the September 11 attacks.On top of that, he's only mildly self-aggrandizing, a rare enough trait in any autobiography, let alone a military one.

4.0 out of 5 starsA great officer account of modern warfare!ByJoe Creasonon August 24, 2014I listened to the 16.5 hour long unabridged edition of this book narrated by Andy Paris. The last paragraph of this review focuses on that production specifically.4 stars: A straight-forward account of Marine combat in Afghanistan and Iraq from the POV of a Jr Officer.Nate Fick was a main character portrayed in HBO’s 2008 miniseries GENERATION KILL (based on Evan Wright’s 2004 memoir of the same name). This memoir was written before the miniseries but after Wright's account, in 2005. It covers his introduction into the Marine Corps, deployment to Afghanistan, subsequent training as a Recon Marine and then his role as an Lt in the 2003 invasion of Iraq.Fick is a capable writer and his story doesn’t simply cover the same ground covered in GK. You learn that he scored expert on the rifle range, was a weapons platoon commander, underwent varying rigorous courses of special forces-esque training and you also get a lot more information on lesser known members of the Recon Platoon he leads into Iraq. For example, Gunny Wynn is a much more significant character in the last half of Fick’s account due to his role in the unit organization.Fick is able to portray the demand and stress associated with small unit leadership and his boot camp and advanced training segments are more interesting than other accounts I’ve read, but this account is a more straight-forward, almost sterile one. It isn’t devoid of opinions or personal reflection, but that’s not the focus of his account. This is not necessarily a drawback, but it makes for a less riveting combat account when Fick finds himself in the thick of the fighting.Instead of a blow-by-blow combat account, we’re given one about leading competent men into modern warfare which, despite the subpar decision making skills of some of his superiors, sees him and his men through two different stints in combat without any KIAs.However this does make the book less compelling ultimately, and I also felt that his training portion of the memoir, though better than others was still a bit bloated and could have been a bit shorter.But these cons are drastically outweighed by the pros of Fick’s account, making it stand on it’s own as a story of the Wars on Terror, apart from Wright’s and later the miniseries. I also feel it is one of the best officer accounts published about this conflict, hence my scoring it 4/5 stars.In terms of recommendations I'd say check out Wright’s book, though it is from the perspective of an embedded journalist. Also check out the miniseries because it is brilliantly made, acted and produced by the people behind THE WIRE, too.Concerning modern combat memoir recommendations: the best one so far is still HOUSE TO HOUSE by David Bellavia and the best officer account is LIONS OF KANDAHAR. There are many accounts out there and I have a listmania ranking them if you’re interested.As for the audiobook: I got a copy of the unabridged audiobook on tape read by Andy Paris. Paris reads the book well, if a bit dry but he changes up his voice acting for different characters though he sticks to the same tempo throughout all the different settings. The abridged version is read by Fick himself but I haven’t listened to it and read somewhere that Fick himself wasn’t happy with how the abridged book was edited.

2.0 out of 5 starsBland and safeByS. L. Jacobson September 22, 2014I am surprised at the number of overwhelmingly positive reviews for this book. I read this because the author was portrayed so admirably in Generation Kill (which I recommend) by Evan Wright. This is not a terrible book. This trouble is that the author keeps it safe and bland.  I get the impression that he does not want to offend anyone. Another reviewer referred to this book as a politician’s memoir.  I think this hits the nail on the head. If you are going to read a military memoir there are probably dozens (perhaps hundreds) of better choices.

I was a platoon commander in Vietnam. Interestingly, while the equipment has changed, and while the training and physical shape is better, the issues are the same. Seemingly the author doesn't understand what is at stake.He apparently went into the Marines to prove something to or about himself. He ended up in a shooting war. That's what Marines do. One needs to grasp that from the beginning. The psychological strain of combat is significant, but to this day it seems poorly understood. Fick is only one in a long line of men who have had this issue. The fact combat runs faster today only makes the strain quicker to attach itself to a person.Today PTSD is the preferred term for what Fick went through. But it really isn't PTSD. It's moral injury. Most of us have an internal compass that tells us right from wrong. (Those biblically inclined will note Genesis 2). When up against killing another human being, we tend to balk. Fink balked. Lt. Col Grossman wrote a number of books about this subject, but mostly they are observations of fact, not really an understanding of what happens.Fink was not decompressed properly. Neither were any of us from Vietnam. The last proper decompression was WWII when the troops had time to just talk amongst themselves and then be greeted by a grateful nation on returning.I hope he has managed to find his peace somewhere.0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuseCommentInsert product linkPaste the product's web address below:Product not found.

Please try again later.5.0 out of 5 starsOne Bullet AwayByfiremnmikeon June 3, 2017Format: Kindle Edition|Verified PurchaseThis is an amazing book highlighting the difficult road of going from ordinary college graduate to the super ordinary life of a marine officer, and then to war. This book was suggested to me by my son who has completed college, Officer Candidate School, The Basic School and is currently in MOS tank school for United States Marines. His statement to me was "this is remarkably accurate ". I found the book interesting, scary, and enhancing my already high regard for the marines and especially those that choose to lead as officers. This book also serves to help us focus on a difficult part of our country history, specifically Iraq and Afghanistan invasions. And the reintroduction of our soldiers into society. I recommend this book and say to captain Fick, Semper Fidelis.0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuseCommentInsert product linkPaste the product's web address below:Product not found.

There was a problem loading comments right now. Please try again later.5.0 out of 5 starsFascinating insight into both the achievements and limits of military training.ByWiltDurkeyon July 6, 2014Format: Kindle Edition|Verified PurchaseOne thing that has always intrigued me is the US/British/Western(?) hierarchy between grunts, noncoms and officers.  This has been the key to successful small unit tactics and flexibility.  Many, many, armies have never quite gotten the hang of it and operate with essentially troopers and officers.  The Soviet-derived model is officer heavy with not much importance attached to noncoms.  Yet, in practice, a truly flexible and adaptable military, capable of tactical innovation, needs all 3.Noncoms (sergeants and up, pardon me if I mess this up) are extremely key to making things work.  But their "making", to echo the books' title is pretty clear.  They come up from the ranks and although they command the regular soldiers they come from the same background, only they have years of experience and they are the cream of the crop.  Their role is key, but this book does not cover it much.Every army also needs officers, but the difference is that lieutenants are expected to make life and death decisions for troopers who are barely any younger than they are and who often have more combat experience.  Often, their primary qualification is being more educated, which is not necessarily relevant on the battlefield.  As they get older and more experienced, they, hopefully (but not always as this book also shows) become more qualified to lead troops.Mr. Fick's book is an extremely interesting look at how the USMC trains these junior officers.  In his case, due to his dedication and humility he comes out ready to take on this important responsibility.  If you read through the lines, some of his fellow officers are not as good, even if the majority of officers perform admirably.  Incompetent and glory seeking leaders have been the bane of the military for millennia, especially when wars are preceded by long periods of peace.  Still, the overall impression I got was that the USMC is trying (no, I did not say "doing its best") to weed out the useless.  Perhaps more in training than once they have graduated, which is similar to what we see in other professions, like doctors.He mentions in passing a reason why his First Recon unit in Iraq had _some_ less than stellar leaders.  Recon marines were expected to operate at the noncom/trooper level in the field.  As a result, most of the officers were desk bound and might have found themselves out of their depth in the front lines.If you are interested by the military give it a read.  It is most definitely nuanced and does not "rah rah" the problems raised by the use of deadly force.  Despite a deep respect for the military way of life.One caveat:  those solely interested in Iraq/Afghanistan coverage will find that it is not the main subject here.  Lt. Fick only covers two fairly short deployments.  On the other hand, it dovetails nicely and covers the same unit and mission as Generation Kill, albeit in a less critical fashion.0Comment|

The book is paced well, it's interesting, it's engaging. It's very, very good. I'd watched Gen Kill years ago when it came out and just recently watched it again. I hadn't realized until recently that Nate had written a book as well and I was incredibly interested to see his take on what Evan had written and how closely it mirrored the HBO series.0Comment|

Please try again later.5.0 out of 5 starsExcellent.ByKindle Customeron May 12, 2014Format: Kindle Edition|Verified PurchaseThis is obviously a non-fiction book.  That can be seen clearly by the thoughts, actions and emotions from start to finish. Truly, a well written book, by an intelligent and caring human being. I believe the author is of the few excellent authors that can describe life at it's best, worst and emotional stages of doing what needs to be done, thinking with mind and heart and succeeding without destroying one's inner being.  Once a Marine, ALWAYS a Marine. I am grateful that we have such intelligent men and women doing the country's most objectionable work following their own heart and soul, when able to.  THANK YOU.0Comment|

Please try again later.5.0 out of 5 starsMore Than A Combat MemoirByNightRangeron July 21, 2014Format: Kindle Edition|Verified PurchaseThis story of one Marine officer’s transition from Ivy League college kid to thoroughly squared away combat leader is worth the read on many levels. Fick’s sense of duty leads him to join the Corps’ PLC training between his junior and senior year. He seeks a challenge and quickly finds it especially after 911 when the training ceases and it becomes a real war.Fick’s account of combat, its after effects and his riflemen’s reaction to it are well-written and put the reader there. He is unafraid to criticize the bad leadership he saw as well as salute the bravery of the kids ordered to fight in this misguided attempt at nation building. His description of combat deaths is sympathetic without being maudlin.This book is worth the read for the grunts among us. Fick’s attitude about measuring up and seeking a challenge will surely resonate with those of us who had the same questions in the middle 1960’s.0Comment|

Please try again later.5.0 out of 5 starsA very well-written book about marine life in the 2003 Iraq warByAmazon Customeron May 14, 2014Format: Kindle Edition|Verified PurchaseI liked this book a lot. It told an interesting story (2/3 at least about being in the 2003-2011 Iraq war), and was very well written. No dead spots in the story, no big grammar, typo, or formatting issues. Interesting information throughout, educational, well-presented and balanced in points of view, and told many very real stories of what it is like to be fighting in the fog of war as part of a large military organization.The author did a really nice job on this book, I think. I'm amazed at the detail and accuracy throughout the book, because it's hard to imagine him taking detailed notes throughout his campaign. (On the other hand, he tells many stories of all the paperwork that is involved in planning missions, so he definitely was familiar with working with paper, as well as his recon troops!)I would easily recommend this book to anyone who is interested in these kinds of topics.Another good book that I liked on a similar topic (although with far fewer combat stories) is Life in the French Foreign Legion: How to Join and What to Expect When You Get There.0Comment|

Jacobson September 22, 2014Format: Kindle Edition|Verified PurchaseI am surprised at the number of overwhelmingly positive reviews for this book. I read this because the author was portrayed so admirably in Generation Kill (which I recommend) by Evan Wright. This is not a terrible book. This trouble is that the author keeps it safe and bland.  I get the impression that he does not want to offend anyone. Another reviewer referred to this book as a politician’s memoir.  I think this hits the nail on the head. If you are going to read a military memoir there are probably dozens (perhaps hundreds) of better choices.0Comment|

There was a problem loading comments right now. Please try again later.5.0 out of 5 starsAn unusual military adventureByChuck Ashfordon May 17, 2014Format: Kindle Edition|Verified PurchaseIntrospective may be the best description of this military adventure book.  Throughout the plot, there is an strong undercurrent of exactly why the military does things the way they do.  How they build strong soldiers, how the civilian world really has no concept of this process, and why the civilian world does not really want to know.The "one bullet" analogy is introduced early and it sticks in the readers mind as the adventure unfolds.  The conclusion of the book avoids triteness.  Things are not wrapped up in a neat bundle.  Rather just the opposite, very similar to the situation many of our military heroes must experience upon returning home from combat.An unusual read, well worth your time.0Comment|

Overview



If the Marines are “the few, the proud,” Recon Marines are the fewest and the proudest. Nathaniel Fick’s career begins with a hellish summer at Quantico, after his junior year at Dartmouth. He leads a platoon in Afghanistan just after 9/11 and advances to the pinnacle—Recon— two years later, on the eve of war with Iraq. His vast skill set puts him in front of the front lines, leading twenty-two Marines into the deadliest conflict since Vietnam. He vows to bring all his men home safely, and to do so he’ll need more than his top-flight education. Fick unveils the process that makes Marine officers such legendary leaders and shares his hard-won insights into the differences between military ideals and military practice, which can mock those ideals.In this deeply thoughtful account of what it’s like to fight on today’s front lines, Fick reveals the crushing pressure on young leaders in combat. Split-second decisions might have national consequences or horrible immediate repercussions, but hesitation isn’t an option. One Bullet Away never shrinks from blunt truths, but ultimately it is an inspiring account of mastering the art of war.

Editorial Reviews


From the Publisher
"Fick's writing style sets this book apart from other accounts of recent conflicts and guarantees One Bullet Away a place in the war memorial hall of fame." USA Today"Harrowing . . . deserves close reading and serious discussion." The Washington Post"What One Bullet Away accomplishes, in a way all the blather on cable TV never will, is to give readers real insights into the modern war and its warriors."Rocky Mountain News"Fick makes a fascinating contribution to the growing shelf of soldiers' tales with his insight into the minds of today's young officers." Boston Magazine"The best sign of military intelligence." Gentleman's Quarterly"Provides a close-up and often harrowing look at [his] service both in Iraq and Afghanistan." U.S. News & World Report"Much more than a simple dispatch from the fronts of Afghanistan and Iraq, One Bullet Away finds Nathaniel Fick reaching deep within his heart and soul. culling up the irony, frustration, humor, tragedy, andmore than anything elsethe pathos that informs the enterprise of war."Military.com"Fick sounds like precisely the kind of thoughtful, mature commander any soldier would revere." Cleveland Plain Dealer"Ponders the nature of leadership and war . . . A tough-minded, beautifully written account." Men's Journal"Rapid-fire, vertiginous . . . Fick brilliantly evokes the split second before the first muzzle flashes of an ambush...His story is trulyas one Marine motto has itleadership by example."National Review"A compelling and exciting memoir of military service, swift in its pacing and sure in its details. The courage, selflessness, and skill of Marines are intensely portrayed here and arein the highest and rarest praise for a military memoirunmistakably authentic."Senator John McCain"Nathaniel Fick shares a powerful account of the bravery of the Marines and the simple truth every soldier shares: that war is hell. Our troops on the ground in Iraq and Afghanistan are heroes who have sacrificed to serve our country, and in these pages we are reminded of their courage under fire. Fick's story is testimony to their struggle."Senator John Kerry"A gripping account of twenty-first-century war by a twenty-first-century warrior. Perhaps most astounding is Nathaniel Fick's candor concerning his own emotions, fears, and moral quandries as he rises to the challenge of leadership. Fick has written the story of our times."Evan Wright, author of Generation Kill"A splendid story of a young Marine officer's journey from a promising begining to the truth and horror of combat. He pulls no punches in a book that is hard to put down."Joseph L. Galloway, coauthor of We Were Soldiers Once . . . and Young"This is the war on terrorism at the working level, where it's very cold or very hot, where you're dirty and you don't get much sleep, and your life can be over in the next breath. Washington poobahs do grand strategy; people like Fick do the work. This is their story of the fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq. Fick's book makes those wars become real, with all the heroism and the mistakes that still come with ground combat."Richard A. Clarke, author of Against All Enemies"A superb account of the challenges that confront a young officer in today's conflicts. Fick offers exceptionally vivid descriptions of leadership, duty, and brotherhood under fire. One Bullet Away is brilliant, a must-read for anyone who wants to truly understand what our troops face."General Anthony C. Zinni, USMC (ret.), former commander in chief, U.S. Central Command, and coauthor of Battle Ready"A brilliant, no-bullshit piece of under-the-helmet reporting. One Bullet Away is much more than a chronicle of war. It illuminates a man's mind and heart as he is thoroughly transformed by training and combat."Steven Pressfield, author of Gates of Fire"This is one of the best books on the Marine Corps in a long time. If you want to understand what it takes to become a Marine today, read this. Then, if you want to really understand what it takes to serve in today's wars, read it again. One Bullet Away is a terrific book by a natural writer."Tom Ricks, military correspondent, Washington Post, and author of Making the Corps"A remarkable book that will give today's readers a much fuller picture of the realities of their military, and that will be read for many years to come because of its vivid, humane, unsparing but also humorous portrayal of the making of a warrior."James Fallows, national correspondent, Atlantic Monthly"Far more than a glory-soaked collection of war stories, this memoir proves the ideal of the scholar-soldier is alive and well. One can hardly imagine a finer boots-on-the-ground chronicle of this open-ended conflict, no matter how long it may last." Kirrkus Reviews, Starred"Essential . . . candid and fast-paced . . . Like the best combat memoirs, Fick's focuses on the men doing the fighttting and avoids hyperbole and sensationalism. He does not shrink from the truth, however personal or unpleasant." Publishers Weekly"The psychological distance between those who serve and fight and those who publish and pontificate is vast. Nathaniel Fick has closed the gap considerably with this fine book."Robert D. Kaplan, author of Imperial Grunts: The American Military on the Ground"The Marines develop leaders who are not only skilled, courageous, and tough, but also humane. Join one of them as he leads a Recon platoon to Baghdad and beyond. One Bullet Away is a riveting and highly charged account of modern war as seen through the eyes of a young lieutenant."Lieutenant General Bernard E. Trainor, USMC (ret.), author of Cobra II"One Bullet Away is much more than a war story. It recounts a young officer's daily duty to lead, to make ethical decisions, and to balance the immense responsibilities of accomplishing missions and saving lives. These lessons are as useful in the boardroom as on the battlefield."Marshall N. Carter, retired Fortun 500 CEO and two-tour Marine infantry officer in Vietnam"Distinguished by its intelligence and candor . . . a rare perspective on modern warfareand on the culture of America's warriors." People Magazine"Makes a compelling argument for an oft-overlooked military virture: competence." The New York Times"Fick and his men come across as America's dream fighting force: hypercapable, ever vigilant, wire-tough, and loyal to the end." Outside


The Barnes & Noble Review from Discover Great New WritersTo meet Nate Fick is to walk away encouraged about the future of America.  For in this young man, one finds an uncommon mixture of thoughtfulness, intelligence, and drive -- all of which come shining through in his first book, One Bullet Away.     

In the mid-1990s, Fick was a Dartmouth student with plans for grad school -- big plans that would cost big money.  So when he made a calculation and entered the Marine Corps' Officer Candidates School to fund his further education, he was tested within an ounce of his strength in order to stay the course.  But several years later, the catastrophic events of 9/11 would send Fick to Afghanistan and later to Iraq, where his hard-core training came in handy, and the throwaway lines he'd heard from instructors, like "There's a fine line between aggressive and foolish," "Don't be in a hurry to get your Marines killed," and "Deal with it," held a new weight -- that of the lives of his fellow soldiers and of the civilians they encountered.  

Fick is a man with a conscience, too -- one that was tried while he was serving overseas, and one that plagues him still.  Reflecting on his experiences as a soldier, he writes, "Philosophical debates were a luxury I could not enjoy.  War was what I had.  We didn't vote for it, authorize it, or declare it.  We just had to fight it."  Fight it, he did.

Publishers Weekly
The global war on terrorism has spawned some excellent combat  narratives-mostly by journalists. Warriors, like Marine Corps  officer Fick, bring a different and essential perspective to the  story. A classics major at Dartmouth, Fick joined the Marines in  1998 because he "wanted to go on a great adventure... to do  something so hard that no one could ever talk shit to me." Thus  begins his odyssey through the grueling regimen of Marine  training and wartime deployments-an odyssey that he recounts in  vivid detail in this candid and fast-paced memoir. Fick was  first deployed to Afghanistan, where he saw little combat, but  his Operation Freedom unit, the elite 1st Reconnaissance  Battalion, helped spearhead the invasion of Iraq and "battled  through every town on Highway 7" from Nasiriyah to al Kut.  (Rolling Stone writer Evan Wright's provocative Generation Kill  is based on his travels with Fick's unit.) Like the best combat  memoirs, Fick's focuses on the men doing the fighting and avoids  hyperbole and sensationalism. He does not shrink from the  truth-however personal or unpleasant. "I was aware enough," he  admits after a firefight, "to be concerned that I was starting  to enjoy it." Agent, E.J. McCarthy. (Oct.)   Copyright 2005 Reed Business Information.


KLIATT  - Raymond Puffer
The US Marines have justly earned their honored reputation on nearly all of the nation's battlefields, and numerous boot camp epics over the years have shown the American public how the Corps sets about turning their boys into mature fighting men. Infusing young enlisted troops with esprit de corps is all well enough, but consistently winning battles demands a whole lot more than high morale. This book provides one answer: solid and unending professional training that deliberately eschews any trace of Semper Fi bombast. Nate Fick, a young Ivy League student, went through Marine Officer Candidate School and then its acclaimed Infantry Officer School. The first thing that young Fick learned was that being a college athlete was no guarantee that he could pass the physical. Once admitted, he watched as the school systematically winnowed out even more candidates. He and the other young students soon discovered that infantry fighting is a complex and intricate business, simultaneously brutal and yet subtle, a world away from the blazing heroics of the movies. The green lieutenants learned that besides winning battles, their highest goal was good stewardship of their young, hyped-up enlisted troops. Lieutenant Fick went off to the fleet and received his own weapons platoon. A few short months later, the World Trade Center atrocities soon had him leading his sea soldiers into combat into Afghanistan, and then into Iraq. Fick's account of training, leadership, and combat is straightforward and unadorned, and he is refreshingly unselfconscious about his own baptism by fire. Yet he writes with enthusiasm and avid curiosity about the varied personalities and the unusual situations heencountered. During controversial times like these, it is good to be able to put yourself into the minds of those who actually are on the scene, actively involved in the situation. Like all good memoirs, this one tells us lots more than just the adventures of one young Marine Corps officer.


Library Journal
With a compelling need to be the best and lead the best, this  Dartmouth graduate became a Marine officer who led his men in  combat in Afghanistan in 2001 and in Iraq in 2003. Fick's memoir  provides an incomparable analysis of the training an officer  must undergo and the standards that must be met. His battle  narratives are exciting, but the story of the training of a  combat leader provides the real meaning. Physical ability, moral  courage, and quick intelligence represent Fick's leadership  qualities. Here, these qualities are used in combat, but they're  applicable to any successful leadership  role in or out of the Marines. Fick's narrative eschews tough,  vulgar language and instead deploys an intelligent, sensitive  descriptive prose. Recommended for all libraries. [See Prepub  Alert, LJ 6/15/05.]   Copyright 2005 Reed Business Information.


Kirkus Reviews
From the front lines in the war on terror, a former Marine captain's lucid account of his transformation from privileged college student to fighter in Afghanistan and Iraq. Fick, now a student at Harvard Business School and the Kennedy School of Government, intended to go to med school until flunking a chemistry class at Dartmouth persuaded him to major in classics. Feeling insufficiently challenged by both academics and athletics, he gravitated toward Officer Candidate School for an experience he hoped would be "more transformative. Something that might kill me-or leave me better, stronger, and more capable." He gets it. A grueling summer of training is a mere prelude to more elite challenges, where Fick's teachers push him past the point of consciousness, instruct him on how to suppress panic, avoid capture and resist torture. Eventually, he makes it to Recon, the Marines' special operations force. To Fick's credit, these sections are every bit as compelling as his recollections of putting his training into practice, whether in Afghanistan just weeks after 9/11, where he helped recover a downed Black Hawk helicopter, or Iraq, where on his order-"Light him up!"-his platoon fired on vehicles speeding toward them. Quoting Plutarch and Thucydides, Fick's memoir is steeped in duty, honor and tradition. Moreover, his commitment to the soldiers in his charge is unwavering: He took 65 men to war and brought them all back. Sure to be compared to Anthony Swofford's profane, self-loathing Jarhead, Fick's account puts the Marines in a vastly more flattering light. Far more than a glory-soaked collection of war stories, this memoir proves the ideal of the scholar-soldier as alive and well. One canhardly imagine a finer boots-on-the-ground chronicle of this open-ended conflict, no matter how long it may last.

Read an Excerpt


1Fifteen of us climbed aboard the ancient white school bus. Wire mesh covered its windows and four black words ran along its sides: UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS. Dressed casually in shorts and sandals, we spread out and sat alone with our bags. Some sipped coffee from paper cups, and a few unfolded newspapers they had brought. I found a seat near the back as the bus started with a roar and a cloud of smoke blew through the open windows. A second lieutenant, looking crisp in his gabardine and khaki uniform, sat in the front row. He had just graduated from Officer Candidates School, and would escort us on the hour’s drive to the Marine Corps base in Quantico, Virginia. Shortly after we pulled away from the recruiting office, he stood in the aisle and turned to face us. I expected a welcome, a joke, some commiseration. “Honor, courage, and commitment are the Marines’ core values,” the lieutenant shouted over the engine.He sounded scripted, but also sincere. “If you can’t be honest at OCS, how can the Corps trust you to lead men in combat?” Combat. I glanced around the bus’s gunmetal interior, surprised to see people reading or pretending to sleep. No one answered the lieutenant’s question. He stood there in the aisle, glaring at us, and I sat up a little straighter. The lieutenant was my age, but he looked different. Shorter hair, of course, and broader shoulders. It was more than that. He had an edge, something in his jaw or his brow that made me self-conscious. I turned toward the window to avoid his gaze. Families drove next to us, on their way to the lake or the beach. Kids wearing headphones gawked, surely wondering what losers were riding a school bus in the summertime. A girl in an open Jeep stood and started to raise her shirt before being pulled back down by a laughing friend. They waved and accelerated past. I thought of my friends, spending their summer vacations in New York and San Francisco, working in air-conditioned office towers and partying at night. Staring through the wire mesh at the bright day, I thought this must be what it’s like on the ride to Sing Sing. I wondered why I was on that bus.I went to Dartmouth intending to go to med school. Failing a chemistry class had inspired my love of history, and I ended up majoring in the classics. By the summer of 1998, my classmates were signing six-figure contracts as consultants and investment bankers. I didn’t understand what we, at age twenty-two, could possibly be consulted about. Others headed off to law school or medical school for a few more years of reading instead of living. None of it appealed to me. I wanted to go on a great adventure, to prove myself, to serve my country. I wanted to do something so hard that no one could ever talk shit to me. In Athens or Sparta, my decision would have been easy. I felt as if I had been born too late. There was no longer a place in the world for a young man who wanted to wear armor and slay dragons. Dartmouth encouraged deviation from the trampled path, but only to join organizations like the Peace Corps or Teach for America. I wanted something more transformative. Something that might kill meor leave me better, stronger, more capable. I wanted to be a warrior. My family had only a short martial tradition. My maternal grandfather, like many in his generation, had served in World War II.He was a Navy officer in the South Pacific, and his ship, the escort carrier Natoma Bay, fought at New Guinea, Leyte Gulf, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa, often supporting Marine invasion forces ashore. At 0635 on June 7, 1945, so the family story went, only two months before the end of the war, a Japanese kamikaze crashed into the Natoma Bay’s flight deck. The explosion tore a hole in the steel twelve feet wide and twenty feet long. Shrapnel peppered my grandfather’s body. My mother remembers watching him pick pieces of metal from his skin twenty years later. He had some of that shrapnel melted into a lucky horseshoe, which was shown to me with great reverence when I was a child. My father enlisted in the Army in 1968.When most of his basic training class went to Vietnam, he received orders to the Army Security Agency. He spent a year in Bad Aibling, Germany, eavesdropping on Eastern bloc radio transmissions and waiting for the Soviets to roll through the Fulda Gap. He completed OCS just as President Richard Nixon began drawing down the military, and took advantage of an early out to go to law school. But my dad was proud to have been a soldier. The Army sent me a leetter during my junior year at Dartmouth, promising to pay for graduate school.The Navy and Air Force did the same, promising skills and special training.The Marine Corps promised nothing. Whereas the other services listed their benefits, the Corps askeeeeed, “Do you have what it takes?” If I was going to serve in the military, I would be a Marine. A few months before, I’d seen a poster in the dining hall advertising a talk by Tom Ricks. Then the Wall Street Journal’s Pentagon correspondent, Ricks had recently written a book about the Marines. I sat up most of one night reading it. I arrived early to get a good seat and listened as Ricks explained the Corps’s culture and the state of civil-military relations in the United States. His review of the Marines, or at least my interpretation of it, was glowing. The Marine Corps was a last bastion of honor in society, a place where young Americans learned to work as a team, to trust one another and themselves, and to sacrifice for a principle. Hearing it from a recruiter, I would have been skeptical.But here was a journalist, an impartial observer. The crowd was the usual mix of students, faculty, and retired alumni. After the talk, a young professor stood. “How can you support the presence of ROTC at a place like Dartmouth?” she asked. “It will militarize the campus and threaten our culture of tolerance.” “Wrong,” replied Ricks. “It will liberalize the military.” He explained that in a democracy, the military should be representative of the people. It should reflect the best of American society, not stand apart from it. Ricks used words such as “duty” and “honor” without cynicism, something I’d not often heard at Dartmouth. His answer clinched my decision to apply for a slot at Marine OCS during the summer between my junior and senior years of college. I would have laughed at the idea of joining the Corps on a bet or because of a movie, but my own choice was almost equally capricious. Although I had reached the decision largely on my own, Tom Ricks, in an hour-long talk on a cold night at Dartmouth, finally convinced me to be a Marine. But even joining the Marines didn’t seem as crazy as it had to my parents’ generation. This was 1998, not 1968. The United States was cashing in its postcold war peace dividend. Scholars talked about “the end of history,” free markets spreading prosperity throughout the world, and the death of ideology. I would be joining a peacetime military. At least that’s the rationale I used when I broke the news to my parents. They were surprised but supportive. “The Marines,” my dad said, “will teach you everything I love you too much to teach you.”The Marine Corps base in Quantico straddles Interstate 95, sprawling across thousands of acres of pine forest and swamp thirty miles south of Washington. Our bus rumbled through the gate, and we drove past rows of peeling warehouses and brick buildings identified only by numbered signs. They looked like the remnants of some dead industry, like the boarded-up mills on the riverbanks of a New Hampshire town. “Christ, man, where’re the ovens? This place looks like Dachau.” Only a few forced laughs met this quip from someone near the back of the bus. We drove farther and farther onto the basealong the edge of a swamp, through miles of trees, far enough to feel as if they could kill us here and no one would ever know. That, of course, was the desired effect. When the air brakes finally hissed and the door swung open, we sat in the middle of a blacktop parade deck the size of three football fields. Austere brick barracks surrounded it. A sign at the blacktop’s edge read UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS OFFICER CANDIDATES SCHOOLDUCTUS EXEMPLO. I recognized the motto from Latin class: “Leadership by Example.” I hoped a drill instructor in a Smokey Bear hat would storm onto the bus and order us off to stand on yellow footprints. Pop culture has immortalized the arrival of enlistedMarine recruits at Parris Island, South Carolina. But this was OCS, and the lack of theatrics disappointed me. A fresh-faced Marine with a clipboard took the roll by Social Security number and then handed a pencil to each of us, saying we had a lot of paperwork to fill out. For two days, we shuffled from line to line for haircuts, gear issue, and a battery of physical tests.Candidates who had returned after being dropped from previous OCS classes explained this routine: the schedule was designed to minimize the number of us who flunked out for high blood pressure. On day three, with physical evaluations completed, the hammer would fall. We slept in squad bays with fifty bunks per room. There, on the evenings before OCS really started, I got my first lesson in esprit de corps. OCS is competitive. Since the peacetime Marine Corps needs a fixed number of officers, a certain number of candidates are earmarked to graduate while the rest are destined to fail. I thought this put us in competition with one another, but the candidates who had been dropped before, or who had served as enlisted Marines, shared their knowledge with the rest of us. The Corps is a naval service, with nautical vocabulary. Doors are hatches, walls are bulkheads, and floors are decks. Signs at Quantico, miles from the sea, read WELCOME ABOARD. They also taught us the more arcane language of the Marines. Running shoes were called go-fasters. Our flashlights, worn on the hip at OCS, were moonbeams. When we looked confused, one of the prior-service Marines laughed. Just wait till you get to the Fleet, he told us. Three different pieces of equipment were known as a “donkey dick”a radio antenna, a brush for cleaning mortar tubes, and a funnel for fueling Humvees. In the beginning, my strongest impression of Quantico, apart from its isolation, was its timelessness.Looking around the squad bay, I could imagine Franklin Roosevelt in the White House. No plastic, no advertising, no bright colors. Just two-high metal racks, as our bunks were called, a green linoleum floor, brick walls, and bare bulbs overhead. The only decoration was a sign of two-foot-high letters stenciled along an entire wall: HONOR, COURAGE, COMMITMENT. I already had the feeling that the Marines were a world apart, that what we did at OCS would be separate from the rest of my life. When another candidate dragged a wooden footlocker next to mine and sat down, I was glad of the company. “I’m Dave Adams.” He stuck out his hand. Dave was a football player at William and Mary. His brother had gone to Dartmouth. His easy smile made me like him right away. “So what do you think?” I tried to ask the question with less trepidation than I felt. Dave smiled and said, “I think we’re in for a shitty summer. But I’ve wanted to be a Marine since I was a kid. What’s that saying? ‘Pain is temporary. Pride is forever.’” “I saw a bumper sticker in the parking lot that said ‘Nobody ever drowned in sweat.’” I was nervous. Not scared or intimidatedthat would come laterbut apprehensive. The Marine transformation is one of American life’s storied tests. I knew its reputation was earned. We had the barest taste of it at the supply warehouse on the morning of the ominous third day. All the candidates lined up and moved from bin to bin, selecting green camouflage blouses and trousers, nylon belts with two olive-drab canteens attached, and odd items such as bug spray labeled “Repellent, Arthropod.” Two young Marines in the warehouse took advantage of the chance to hassle a group of future officers. “Get at parade rest!” It was an alien command. I clasped my hands in front of me and tried to look respectful. “You gonna gaff us off? Get at the position of attention.” The candidates around me stood a little straighter, with their hands at their sides. The two Marines told us there were only two ways to stand at OCS: parade restfeet shoulder-width apart, hands clasped in the small of the back, eyes straight ahead; and at attentionheels together, back straight, hands at your sides with thumbs along the trouser seams. Later, we assembled for lunch in a Word War IIera Quonset hut. Baking in this sun-beaten aluminum oven, we munched processed meat sandwiches and applesa prepared lunch the Marines called a “boxed nasty”as the school’s commanding officer (CO) outlined his expectations of us. The colonel’s lantern jaw, craggy nose, and graying hair were straight from a recruiting commercial. He looked as if he could wrestle any of us to the floor, and authority ran deep in his voice. “We seek to identify in each candidate those qualities of intellect, human understanding, and moral character that enable a person to inspire and to control a group of people successfully: leaders,” he said. “A candidate’s presence under pressure is a key indicator of leadership potential. In trying to identify Marine leaders who may someday face combat, we want to see who can think and function under stress. Stress at OCS is created in many ways, as you will see.” When the colonel concluded, he called forward the school’s staff, introducing each Marine. All had served as drill instructors. At OCS, though, they were called “sergeant instructors,” and we would address them by that title, their rank, and their name. The staff marched smartly down the aisle and stood at attention before us. Khaki uniforms with splashes of colored ribbons, eyes focused over our heads on the back wall of the room, no smiles. They were sergeants, staff sergeants, and gunnery sergeants, mostly men with ten to twenty years in the Corps. I saw scars and biceps and tattoos. With introductions complete, the colonel turned to the staff and uttered ten words that ended our civilian lives: “Take charge and carry out the plan of the day.” Tables turned over, chairs clattered to the floor, and I forgot all about the half-eaten apple in my hand.The staff charged us. We ran out the back door of the Quonset hut. I wanted to keep running, to disappear into the woods, make my way out to the highway, and hitchhike home. But pride trumps most other impulses in young men, and I fell into a ragged formation with my new platoon-mates. “Stop eyeballing the freakin’ area, maggot.” My eyes were locked to the front. I didn’t think he was talking to me. Warm, wet breath on my cheeks. If not me, then someone right next to me. “Lock your body!” Spittle across my eyes and lips. The Marine strutted up and down our crooked ranks. He spoke to the group, but in a way that made it personal for each of us. “If you so much as breathe, I’ll hear it and rip your freakin’ windpipe out. Now grab your freakin’ trash and move with purpose. Pretend for me that you want to be here.” We shouldered our bags. Candidates with foresight had brought hiking packs. They stood comfortably, looking ready to strike out down the Appalachian Trail. The truly lost labored with their leather brief bags and suitcases. I fell somewhere in between, striving mightily to be inconspicuous with an oversize duffel bag. I snuck a look at the instructor’s nametag. Olds. Three stripes on his shoulder. Sergeant Olds. He was yelling, veins popping, eyes bulging. His arms waved from broad shoulders that tapered to his waist with all the menacing grace of a wasp. I looked at Sergeant Instructor Sergeant Olds, sensing he had just become a fixture in my life. “Don’t eyeball me, candidate. Do you want to ask me out on a date? You look like you want to ask me out.” “No, Sergeant Instructor Sergeant Olds.” “Go ahead, candidate. Keep whispering.And keep looking deep into my eyes.” His voice dropped to a whisper, and he moved in close. I watched a vein throbbing in his temple and struggled not to make eye contact. “I dare you to ask me out. Your chucklehead classmates here might get a laugh out of it, but I swear it’ll be the last thing you ever do.” This is theater, right? I had seen Full Metal Jacket. It’s all a joke. But it didn’t feel like a joke. When Olds spoke to me, icy adrenaline washed through my chest. My legs shook. The worst part was that Olds knew he’d gotten to me. He would, I feared, increase the pressure. For now, Olds pivoted on a spit-shined heel and struck out across the parade deck. Lacking better options, we followed him. Large raindrops splotched the dark asphalt. The splotches grew bigger and closer together until they finally merged into a single, dark stain. I dragged my duffel bag along the pavement, struggling to keep its strap from biting into my shoulder. The bag had felt lighter when I’d hefted it the night before. I had packed only the required list: three sets of civilian clothes, running shoes, a toiletry kit, and the combat boots mailed weeks before so I could break them in. I folded the clothes crisply, careful to crease each trouser leg and keep the shirt fronts smooth. Sergeant Olds had opened a gap of fifty yards between himself and the straggling platoon. He stood facing us with his hands on his hips. “Dump your trash. I want to see who’s trying to sneak naked pictures of his boyfriend into my squad bay.” I hesitated, unsure whether he actually meant for us to dump our belongings onto the puddled pavement.Steam rose as the rain hit the ground. “What are we, deaf? I said dump your trash. Do it now. Move!” I unzipped my bag and placed the boots on the blacktop. Then I stacked my clothes on them and put the toiletry bag on top to deflect the rain. Olds’s attention landed on my carefully constructed pile. He kicked it over and put a boot print on the chest of my neatly ironed shirt. “What’s in here?” He grabbed my toiletry bag. “Drugs? Booze? Maybe a tube of K-Y jelly and a big cucumber?” One by one, my toothbrush, toothpaste, razor, and shaving cream fell to the ground. “You must have hidden it pretty well, candidate,” Olds growled. “But I’ll find it. Oh, yeah, I’ll find it. And when I do, I’ll run your ass out of my Marine Corps before you can even call your congressman.” Olds moved on to his next victim, and I hesitantly began to piece my life back together, wondering again why I was at OCS. Next to me, Dave caught my eye with a smile and mouthed, “Semper fi.” Copyright © 2005 by Nathaniel Fick. Reprinted by permission of Houghton Mifflin Company.

If you want to understand what it takes to become a Marine today, read this. Then, if you want to really understand what it takes to serve in today's wars, read it again. One Bullet Away is a terrific book by a natural writer."Tom Ricks, military correspondent, Washington Post, and author of Making the Corps"A remarkable book that will give today's readers a much fuller picture of the realities of their military, and that will be read for many years to come because of its vivid, humane, unsparing but also humorous portrayal of the making of a warrior."James Fallows, national correspondent, Atlantic Monthly"Far more than a glory-soaked collection of war stories, this memoir proves the ideal of the scholar-soldier is alive and well. One can hardly imagine a finer boots-on-the-ground chronicle of this open-ended conflict, no matter how long it may last." Kirrkus Reviews, Starred"Essential . . . candid and fast-paced . . . Like the best combat memoirs, Fick's focuses on the men doing the fighttting and avoids hyperbole and sensationalism. He does not shrink from the truth, however personal or unpleasant." Publishers Weekly"The psychological distance between those who serve and fight and those who publish and pontificate is vast. Nathaniel Fick has closed the gap considerably with this fine book."Robert D. Kaplan, author of Imperial Grunts: The American Military on the Ground"The Marines develop leaders who are not only skilled, courageous, and tough, but also humane. Join one of them as he leads a Recon platoon to Baghdad and beyond. One Bullet Away is a riveting and highly charged account of modern war as seen through the eyes of a young lieutenant."Lieutenant General Bernard E. Trainor, USMC (ret.), author of Cobra II"One Bullet Away is much more than a war story. It recounts a young officer's daily duty to lead, to make ethical decisions, and to balance the immense responsibilities of accomplishing missions and saving lives. These lessons are as useful in the boardroom as on the battlefield."Marshall N. Carter, retired Fortun 500 CEO and two-tour Marine infantry officer in Vietnam"Distinguished by its intelligence and candor . . . a rare perspective on modern warfareand on the culture of America's warriors."

Overview



If the Marines are “the few, the proud,” Recon Marines are the fewest and the proudest. Nathaniel Fick’s career begins with a hellish summer at Quantico, after his junior year at Dartmouth. He leads a platoon in Afghanistan just after 9/11 and advances to the pinnacle—Recon— two years later, on the eve of war with Iraq. His vast skill set puts him in front of the front lines, leading twenty-two Marines into the deadliest conflict since Vietnam. He vows to bring all his men home safely, and to do so he’ll need more than his top-flight education. Fick unveils the process that makes Marine officers such legendary leaders and shares his hard-won insights into the differences between military ideals and military practice, which can mock those ideals.In this deeply thoughtful account of what it’s like to fight on today’s front lines, Fick reveals the crushing pressure on young leaders in combat. Split-second decisions might have national consequences or horrible immediate repercussions, but hesitation isn’t an option. One Bullet Away never shrinks from blunt truths, but ultimately it is an inspiring account of mastering the art of war.

Editorial Reviews



The Barnes & Noble Review from Discover Great New WritersTo meet Nate Fick is to walk away encouraged about the future of America.  For in this young man, one finds an uncommon mixture of thoughtfulness, intelligence, and drive -- all of which come shining through in his first book, One Bullet Away.     

In the mid-1990s, Fick was a Dartmouth student with plans for grad school -- big plans that would cost big money.  So when he made a calculation and entered the Marine Corps' Officer Candidates School to fund his further education, he was tested within an ounce of his strength in order to stay the course.  But several years later, the catastrophic events of 9/11 would send Fick to Afghanistan and later to Iraq, where his hard-core training came in handy, and the throwaway lines he'd heard from instructors, like "There's a fine line between aggressive and foolish," "Don't be in a hurry to get your Marines killed," and "Deal with it," held a new weight -- that of the lives of his fellow soldiers and of the civilians they encountered.  

Fick is a man with a conscience, too -- one that was tried while he was serving overseas, and one that plagues him still.  Reflecting on his experiences as a soldier, he writes, "Philosophical debates were a luxury I could not enjoy.  War was what I had.  We didn't vote for it, authorize it, or declare it.  We just had to fight it."  Fight it, he did.

So when he made a calculation and entered the Marine Corps' Officer Candidates School to fund his further education, he was tested within an ounce of his strength in order to stay the course.  But several years later, the catastrophic events of 9/11 would send Fick to Afghanistan and later to Iraq, where his hard-core training came in handy, and the throwaway lines he'd heard from instructors, like "There's a fine line between aggressive and foolish," "Don't be in a hurry to get your Marines killed," and "Deal with it," held a new weight -- that of the lives of his fellow soldiers and of the civilians they encountered.  

Fick is a man with a conscience, too -- one that was tried while he was serving overseas, and one that plagues him still.  Reflecting on his experiences as a soldier, he writes, "Philosophical debates were a luxury I could not enjoy.  War was what I had.  We didn't vote for it, authorize it, or declare it.  We just had to fight it."  Fight it, he did.

The global war on terrorism has spawned some excellent combat  narratives-mostly by journalists. Warriors, like Marine Corps  officer Fick, bring a different and essential perspective to the  story. A classics major at Dartmouth, Fick joined the Marines in  1998 because he "wanted to go on a great adventure... to do  something so hard that no one could ever talk shit to me." Thus  begins his odyssey through the grueling regimen of Marine  training and wartime deployments-an odyssey that he recounts in  vivid detail in this candid and fast-paced memoir. Fick was  first deployed to Afghanistan, where he saw little combat, but  his Operation Freedom unit, the elite 1st Reconnaissance  Battalion, helped spearhead the invasion of Iraq and "battled  through every town on Highway 7" from Nasiriyah to al Kut.  (Rolling Stone writer Evan Wright's provocative Generation Kill  is based on his travels with Fick's unit.) Like the best combat  memoirs, Fick's focuses on the men doing the fighting and avoids  hyperbole and sensationalism. He does not shrink from the  truth-however personal or unpleasant. "I was aware enough," he  admits after a firefight, "to be concerned that I was starting  to enjoy it." Agent, E.J. McCarthy. (Oct.)   Copyright 2005 Reed Business Information.


KLIATT  - Raymond Puffer
The US Marines have justly earned their honored reputation on nearly all of the nation's battlefields, and numerous boot camp epics over the years have shown the American public how the Corps sets about turning their boys into mature fighting men. Infusing young enlisted troops with esprit de corps is all well enough, but consistently winning battles demands a whole lot more than high morale. This book provides one answer: solid and unending professional training that deliberately eschews any trace of Semper Fi bombast. Nate Fick, a young Ivy League student, went through Marine Officer Candidate School and then its acclaimed Infantry Officer School. The first thing that young Fick learned was that being a college athlete was no guarantee that he could pass the physical. Once admitted, he watched as the school systematically winnowed out even more candidates. He and the other young students soon discovered that infantry fighting is a complex and intricate business, simultaneously brutal and yet subtle, a world away from the blazing heroics of the movies. The green lieutenants learned that besides winning battles, their highest goal was good stewardship of their young, hyped-up enlisted troops. Lieutenant Fick went off to the fleet and received his own weapons platoon. A few short months later, the World Trade Center atrocities soon had him leading his sea soldiers into combat into Afghanistan, and then into Iraq. Fick's account of training, leadership, and combat is straightforward and unadorned, and he is refreshingly unselfconscious about his own baptism by fire. Yet he writes with enthusiasm and avid curiosity about the varied personalities and the unusual situations heencountered. During controversial times like these, it is good to be able to put yourself into the minds of those who actually are on the scene, actively involved in the situation. Like all good memoirs, this one tells us lots more than just the adventures of one young Marine Corps officer.


Library Journal
With a compelling need to be the best and lead the best, this  Dartmouth graduate became a Marine officer who led his men in  combat in Afghanistan in 2001 and in Iraq in 2003. Fick's memoir  provides an incomparable analysis of the training an officer  must undergo and the standards that must be met. His battle  narratives are exciting, but the story of the training of a  combat leader provides the real meaning. Physical ability, moral  courage, and quick intelligence represent Fick's leadership  qualities. Here, these qualities are used in combat, but they're  applicable to any successful leadership  role in or out of the Marines. Fick's narrative eschews tough,  vulgar language and instead deploys an intelligent, sensitive  descriptive prose. Recommended for all libraries.

Kirkus Reviews
From the front lines in the war on terror, a former Marine captain's lucid account of his transformation from privileged college student to fighter in Afghanistan and Iraq. Fick, now a student at Harvard Business School and the Kennedy School of Government, intended to go to med school until flunking a chemistry class at Dartmouth persuaded him to major in classics. Feeling insufficiently challenged by both academics and athletics, he gravitated toward Officer Candidate School for an experience he hoped would be "more transformative. Something that might kill me-or leave me better, stronger, and more capable." He gets it. A grueling summer of training is a mere prelude to more elite challenges, where Fick's teachers push him past the point of consciousness, instruct him on how to suppress panic, avoid capture and resist torture. Eventually, he makes it to Recon, the Marines' special operations force. To Fick's credit, these sections are every bit as compelling as his recollections of putting his training into practice, whether in Afghanistan just weeks after 9/11, where he helped recover a downed Black Hawk helicopter, or Iraq, where on his order-"Light him up!"-his platoon fired on vehicles speeding toward them. Quoting Plutarch and Thucydides, Fick's memoir is steeped in duty, honor and tradition. Moreover, his commitment to the soldiers in his charge is unwavering: He took 65 men to war and brought them all back. Sure to be compared to Anthony Swofford's profane, self-loathing Jarhead, Fick's account puts the Marines in a vastly more flattering light. Far more than a glory-soaked collection of war stories, this memoir proves the ideal of the scholar-soldier as alive and well. One canhardly imagine a finer boots-on-the-ground chronicle of this open-ended conflict, no matter how long it may last.

Read an Excerpt


1Fifteen of us climbed aboard the ancient white school bus. Wire mesh covered its windows and four black words ran along its sides: UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS. Dressed casually in shorts and sandals, we spread out and sat alone with our bags. Some sipped coffee from paper cups, and a few unfolded newspapers they had brought. I found a seat near the back as the bus started with a roar and a cloud of smoke blew through the open windows. A second lieutenant, looking crisp in his gabardine and khaki uniform, sat in the front row. He had just graduated from Officer Candidates School, and would escort us on the hour’s drive to the Marine Corps base in Quantico, Virginia. Shortly after we pulled away from the recruiting office, he stood in the aisle and turned to face us. I expected a welcome, a joke, some commiseration. “Honor, courage, and commitment are the Marines’ core values,” the lieutenant shouted over the engine.He sounded scripted, but also sincere. “If you can’t be honest at OCS, how can the Corps trust you to lead men in combat?” Combat. I glanced around the bus’s gunmetal interior, surprised to see people reading or pretending to sleep. No one answered the lieutenant’s question. He stood there in the aisle, glaring at us, and I sat up a little straighter. The lieutenant was my age, but he looked different. Shorter hair, of course, and broader shoulders. It was more than that. He had an edge, something in his jaw or his brow that made me self-conscious. I turned toward the window to avoid his gaze. Families drove next to us, on their way to the lake or the beach. Kids wearing headphonesgawked, surely wondering what losers were riding a school bus in the summertime. A girl in an open Jeep stood and started to raise her shirt before being pulled back down by a laughing friend. They waved and accelerated past. I thought of my friends, spending their summer vacations in New York and San Francisco, working in air-conditioned office towers and partying at night. Staring through the wire mesh at the bright day, I thought this must be what it’s like on the ride to Sing Sing. I wondered why I was on that bus.I went to Dartmouth intending to go to med school. Failing a chemistry class had inspired my love of history, and I ended up majoring in the classics. By the summer of 1998, my classmates were signing six-figure contracts as consultants and investment bankers. I didn’t understand what we, at age twenty-two, could possibly be consulted about. Others headed off to law school or medical school for a few more years of reading instead of living. None of it appealed to me. I wanted to go on a great adventure, to prove myself, to serve my country. I wanted to do something so hard that no one could ever talk shit to me. In Athens or Sparta, my decision would have been easy. I felt as if I had been born too late. There was no longer a place in the world for a young man who wanted to wear armor and slay dragons. Dartmouth encouraged deviation from the trampled path, but only to join organizations like the Peace Corps or Teach for America. I wanted something more transformative. Something that might kill me — or leave me better, stronger, more capable. I wanted to be a warrior. My family had only a short martial tradition. My maternal grandfather, like many in his generation, had served in World War II.He was a Navy officer in the South Pacific, and his ship, the escort carrier Natoma Bay, fought at New Guinea, Leyte Gulf, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa, often supporting Marine invasion forces ashore. At 0635 on June 7, 1945, so the family story went, only two months before the end of the war, a Japanese kamikaze crashed into the Natoma Bay’s flight deck. The explosion tore a hole in the steel twelve feet wide and twenty feet long. Shrapnel peppered my grandfather’s body. My mother remembers watching him pick pieces of metal from his skin twenty years later. He had some of that shrapnel melted into a lucky horseshoe, which was shown to me with great reverence when I was a child. My father enlisted in the Army in 1968.When most of his basic training class went to Vietnam, he received orders to the Army Security Agency. He spent a year in Bad Aibling, Germany, eavesdropping on Eastern bloc radio transmissions and waiting for the Soviets to roll through the Fulda Gap. He completed OCS just as President Richard Nixon began drawing down the military, and took advantage of an early out to go to law school. But my dad was proud to have been a soldier. The Army sent me a leetter during my junior year at Dartmouth, promising to pay for graduate school.The Navy and Air Force did the same, promising skills and special training.The Marine Corps promised nothing. Whereas the other services listed their benefits, the Corps askeeeeed, “Do you have what it takes?” If I was going to serve in the military, I would be a Marine. A few months before, I’d seen a poster in the dining hall advertising a talk by Tom Ricks. Then the Wall Street Journal’s Pentagon correspondent, Ricks had recently written a book about the Marines. I sat up most of one night reading it. I arrived early to get a good seat and listened as Ricks explained the Corps’s culture and the state of civil-military relations in the United States. His review of the Marines, or at least my interpretation of it, was glowing. The Marine Corps was a last bastion of honor in society, a place where young Americans learned to work as a team, to trust one another and themselves, and to sacrifice for a principle. Hearing it from a recruiter, I would have been skeptical.But here was a journalist, an impartial observer. The crowd was the usual mix of students, faculty, and retired alumni. After the talk, a young professor stood. “How can you support the presence of ROTC at a place like Dartmouth?” she asked. “It will militarize the campus and threaten our culture of tolerance.” “Wrong,” replied Ricks. “It will liberalize the military.” He explained that in a democracy, the military should be representative of the people. It should reflect the best of American society, not stand apart from it.Ricks used words such as “duty” and “honor” without cynicism, something I’d not often heard at Dartmouth. His answer clinched my decision to apply for a slot at Marine OCS during the summer between my junior and senior years of college. I would have laughed at the idea of joining the Corps on a bet or because of a movie, but my own choice was almost equally capricious. Although I had reached the decision largely on my own, Tom Ricks, in an hour-long talk on a cold night at Dartmouth, finally convinced me to be a Marine. But even joining the Marines didn’t seem as crazy as it had to my parents’ generation. This was 1998, not 1968. The United States was cashing in its post–cold war peace dividend. Scholars talked about “the end of history,” free markets spreading prosperity throughout the world, and the death of ideology. I would be joining a peacetime military. At least that’s the rationale I used when I broke the news to my parents. They were surprised but supportive. “The Marines,” my dad said, “will teach you everything I love you too much to teach you.”The Marine Corps base in Quantico straddles Interstate 95, sprawling across thousands of acres of pine forest and swamp thirty miles south of Washington. Our bus rumbled through the gate, and we drove past rows of peeling warehouses and brick buildings identified only by numbered signs. They looked like the remnants of some dead industry, like the boarded-up mills on the riverbanks of a New Hampshire town. “Christ, man, where’re the ovens? This place looks like Dachau.” Only a few forced laughs met this quip from someone near the back of the bus. We drove farther and farther onto the base — along the edge of a swamp, through miles of trees, far enough to feel as if they could kill us here and no one would ever know. That, of course, was the desired effect. When the air brakes finally hissed and the door swung open, we sat in the middle of a blacktop parade deck the size of three football fields. Austere brick barracks surrounded it. A sign at the blacktop’s edge read UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS OFFICER CANDIDATES SCHOOL — DUCTUS EXEMPLO. I recognized the motto from Latin class: “Leadership by Example.” I hoped a drill instructor in a Smokey Bear hat would storm onto the bus and order us off to stand on yellow footprints. Pop culture has immortalized the arrival of enlistedMarine recruits at Parris Island, South Carolina. But this was OCS, and the lack of theatrics disappointed me.A fresh-faced Marine with a clipboard took the roll by Social Security number and then handed a pencil to each of us, saying we had a lot of paperwork to fill out. For two days, we shuffled from line to line for haircuts, gear issue, and a battery of physical tests.Candidates who had returned after being dropped from previous OCS classes explained this routine: the schedule was designed to minimize the number of us who flunked out for high blood pressure. On day three, with physical evaluations completed, the hammer would fall. We slept in squad bays with fifty bunks per room. There, on the evenings before OCS really started, I got my first lesson in esprit de corps. OCS is competitive. Since the peacetime Marine Corps needs a fixed number of officers, a certain number of candidates are earmarked to graduate while the rest are destined to fail. I thought this put us in competition with one another, but the candidates who had been dropped before, or who had served as enlisted Marines, shared their knowledge with the rest of us. The Corps is a naval service, with nautical vocabulary. Doors are hatches, walls are bulkheads, and floors are decks. Signs at Quantico, miles from the sea, read WELCOME ABOARD. They also taught us the more arcane language of the Marines. Running shoes were called go-fasters. Our flashlights, worn on the hip at OCS, were moonbeams. When we looked confused, one of the prior-service Marines laughed. Just wait till you get to the Fleet, he told us. Three different pieces of equipment were known as a “donkey dick” — a radio antenna, a brush for cleaning mortar tubes, and a funnel for fueling Humvees. In the beginning, my strongest impression of Quantico, apart from its isolation, was its timelessness.Looking around the squad bay, I could imagine Franklin Roosevelt in the White House. No plastic, no advertising, no bright colors. Just two-high metal racks, as our bunks were called, a green linoleum floor, brick walls, and bare bulbs overhead. The only decoration was a sign of two-foot-high letters stenciled along an entire wall: HONOR, COURAGE, COMMITMENT. I already had the feeling that the Marines were a world apart, that what we did at OCS would be separate from the rest of my life. When another candidate dragged a wooden footlocker next to mine and sat down, I was glad of the company. “I’m Dave Adams.” He stuck out his hand. Dave was a football player at William and Mary. His brother had gone to Dartmouth. His easy smile made me like him right away. “So what do you think?” I tried to ask the question with less trepidation than I felt. Dave smiled and said, “I think we’re in for a shitty summer. But I’ve wanted to be a Marine since I was a kid. What’s that saying? ‘Pain is temporary. Pride is forever.’” “I saw a bumper sticker in the parking lot that said ‘Nobody ever drowned in sweat.’” I was nervous. Not scared or intimidated — that would come later — but apprehensive. The Marine transformation is one of American life’s storied tests. I knew its reputation was earned. We had the barest taste of it at the supply warehouse on the morning of the ominous third day. All the candidates lined up and moved from bin to bin, selecting green camouflage blouses and trousers, nylon belts with two olive-drab canteens attached, and odd items such as bug spray labeled “Repellent, Arthropod.” Two young Marines in the warehouse took advantage of the chance to hassle a group of future officers. “Get at parade rest!” It was an alien command. I clasped my hands in front of me and tried to look respectful. “You gonna gaff us off? Get at the position of attention.” The candidates around me stood a little straighter, with their hands at their sides. The two Marines told us there were only two ways to stand at OCS: parade rest — feet shoulder-width apart, hands clasped in the small of the back, eyes straight ahead; and at attention — heels together, back straight, hands at your sides with thumbs along the trouser seams. Later, we assembled for lunch in a Word War II–era Quonset hut. Baking in this sun-beaten aluminum oven, we munched processed meat sandwiches and apples — a prepared lunch the Marines called a “boxed nasty” — as the school’s commanding officer (CO) outlined his expectations of us. The colonel’s lantern jaw, craggy nose, and graying hair were straight from a recruiting commercial. He looked as if he could wrestle any of us to the floor, and authority ran deep in his voice. “We seek to identify in each candidate those qualities of intellect, human understanding, and moral character that enable a person to inspire and to control a group of people successfully: leaders,” he said. “A candidate’s presence under pressure is a key indicator of leadership potential. In trying to identify Marine leaders who may someday face combat, we want to see who can think and function under stress. Stress at OCS is created in many ways, as you will see.” When the colonel concluded, he called forward the school’s staff, introducing each Marine. All had served as drill instructors. At OCS, though, they were called “sergeant instructors,” and we would address them by that title, their rank, and their name. The staff marched smartly down the aisle and stood at attention before us. Khaki uniforms with splashes of colored ribbons, eyes focused over our heads on the back wall of the room, no smiles. They were sergeants, staff sergeants, and gunnery sergeants, mostly men with ten to twenty years in the Corps. I saw scars and biceps and tattoos. With introductions complete, the colonel turned to the staff and uttered ten words that ended our civilian lives: “Take charge and carry out the plan of the day.” Tables turned over, chairs clattered to the floor, and I forgot all about the half-eaten apple in my hand.The staff charged us. We ran out the back door of the Quonset hut. I wanted to keep running, to disappear into the woods, make my way out to the highway, and hitchhike home. But pride trumps most other impulses in young men, and I fell into a ragged formation with my new platoon-mates. “Stop eyeballing the freakin’ area, maggot.” My eyes were locked to the front. I didn’t think he was talking to me. Warm, wet breath on my cheeks. If not me, then someone right next to me. “Lock your body!” Spittle across my eyes and lips. The Marine strutted up and down our crooked ranks. He spoke to the group, but in a way that made it personal for each of us. “If you so much as breathe, I’ll hear it and rip your freakin’ windpipe out. Now grab your freakin’ trash and move with purpose. Pretend for me that you want to be here.” We shouldered our bags. Candidates with foresight had brought hiking packs. They stood comfortably, looking ready to strike out down the Appalachian Trail. The truly lost labored with their leather brief bags and suitcases. I fell somewhere in between, striving mightily to be inconspicuous with an oversize duffel bag. I snuck a look at the instructor’s nametag. Olds. Three stripes on his shoulder. Sergeant Olds. He was yelling, veins popping, eyes bulging. His arms waved from broad shoulders that tapered to his waist with all the menacing grace of a wasp. I looked at Sergeant Instructor Sergeant Olds, sensing he had just become a fixture in my life. “Don’t eyeball me, candidate. Do you want to ask me out on a date? You look like you want to ask me out.” “No, Sergeant Instructor Sergeant Olds.” “Go ahead, candidate. Keep whispering.And keep looking deep into my eyes.” His voice dropped to a whisper, and he moved in close. I watched a vein throbbing in his temple and struggled not to make eye contact. “I dare you to ask me out. Your chucklehead classmates here might get a laugh out of it, but I swear it’ll be the last thing you ever do.” This is theater, right? I had seen Full Metal Jacket. It’s all a joke. But it didn’t feel like a joke. When Olds spoke to me, icy adrenaline washed through my chest. My legs shook. The worst part was that Olds knew he’d gotten to me. He would, I feared, increase the pressure. For now, Olds pivoted on a spit-shined heel and struck out across the parade deck. Lacking better options, we followed him. Large raindrops splotched the dark asphalt. The splotches grew bigger and closer together until they finally merged into a single, dark stain. I dragged my duffel bag along the pavement, struggling to keep its strap from biting into my shoulder. The bag had felt lighter when I’d hefted it the night before. I had packed only the required list: three sets of civilian clothes, running shoes, a toiletry kit, and the combat boots mailed weeks before so I could break them in. I folded the clothes crisply, careful to crease each trouser leg and keep the shirt fronts smooth. Sergeant Olds had opened a gap of fifty yards between himself and the straggling platoon. He stood facing us with his hands on his hips. “Dump your trash. I want to see who’s trying to sneak naked pictures of his boyfriend into my squad bay.” I hesitated, unsure whether he actually meant for us to dump our belongings onto the puddled pavement.Steam rose as the rain hit the ground. “What are we, deaf? I said dump your trash. Do it now. Move!” I unzipped my bag and placed the boots on the blacktop. Then I stacked my clothes on them and put the toiletry bag on top to deflect the rain. Olds’s attention landed on my carefully constructed pile. He kicked it over and put a boot print on the chest of my neatly ironed shirt. “What’s in here?” He grabbed my toiletry bag. “Drugs? Booze? Maybe a tube of K-Y jelly and a big cucumber?” One by one, my toothbrush, toothpaste, razor, and shaving cream fell to the ground. “You must have hidden it pretty well, candidate,” Olds growled. “But I’ll find it. Oh, yeah, I’ll find it. And when I do, I’ll run your ass out of my Marine Corps before you can even call your congressman.” Olds moved on to his next victim, and I hesitantly began to piece my life back together, wondering again why I was at OCS. Next to me, Dave caught my eye with a smile and mouthed, “Semper fi.”Copyright © 2005 by Nathaniel Fick. Reprinted by permission of Houghton Mifflin Company.

One reason is simple, while the Internet may be everywhere, it's not always accurate, and when it comes to educating people you need to have accurate information. That's why approved textbooks are so important; they give you the facts, not the opinions of someone on the Internet.Help for the Home SchooledNo one needs textbooks more than the parent who home schools their children. There is a growing movement toward home schooling so that parents can focus their children's education on the aspects Engl are most important to them, and tailor the curriculum to their own child's individual learning styles. From science and mathematics to English and history, textbooks are a vital part of any education program.For Every Age LevelNo matter what age or grade level your student is at, there are education textbooks to cover their needs.  Even if they go to a regular grade school, there are supplementary textbooks you can pick up to help them if they need it. Not every book is the right fit for every student, and sometimes the one who is having the most trouble with math in school is the one who flourishes the most as soon as you expose them to a different textbook.Explore Adult EducationEducation isn't just for children; many adults have a need for textbooks too. From those who left school early and are now looking for textbooks so they can get their GED, to professionals looking to further their development, there's a huge demand for textbooks from people in all walks of life. It's not just academic textbooks. You can also get textbooks on practical subjects from financial management, to woodworking, and auto repair.Control Your College EducationCollege is more than just an investment in your future; it's an investment. One way to take charge of your college costs is to look outside your college bookstore for your textbooks. Many textbooks, especially in fields such as English and history do not change much from year to year, so grabbing last  year's engineering handbook may be the best way to go.Tell us what you think - opens in new window or tabSide Refine PanelShop by CategoryBooksTextbooks & Educational BooksBook AccessoriesAntique Books and ManuscriptsAudiobooksCatalogsChildren & Young Adult BooksCookbooksFiction & Literature BooksMagazine Back IssuesNonfiction BooksBook & Magazine Wholesale & Bulk LotsOther BooksFormatsee allHardcoverMixed LotPaperbackNot SpecifiedPublication Yearsee all1900-19491950-19992000-20102011-NowSubjectsee allBusiness & EconomicsEducation, TeachingEngineeringHistoryMathMedicinePerforming ArtsScience & TechLanguagesee allConditionsee allBrand NewLike NewVery GoodGoodAcceptableNot SpecifiedPricePlease provide a valid price range$-$Buying Formatsee allAll ListingsAuctionBuy It NowItem Locationsee allDefaultWithindistance2 miles5 miles10 miles15 miles20 miles50 miles75 miles100 miles150 miles200 miles500 miles750 miles1000 miles1500 miles2000 milesofGoUS OnlyNorth AmericaWorldwideDelivery Optionssee allFree ShippingFree In-store PickupShow onlysee allReturns AcceptedCompleted ItemsSold ItemsDeals & SavingsMore refinements...

                      They were called a generation without heroes. Then they were called upon to be heroes. Within hours of 9/11, America's war on terrorism fell to those like the 23 Marines of the First Recon Battalion, the first generation dispatched into open-ended combat since Vietnam.

                      When Donovan Campbell's platoon deployed to Ramadi in the spring of 2004, they believed they'd be spending most of their time building schools, training police, and making friends with the citizens. But shortly after arriving, when Campbell awoke to the chilling cry of "Jihad, Jihad, Jihad!" echoing from minaret to minaret across the city, he knew they had an altogether different situation on their hands.

                      Five months after being deployed to Iraq, Lima Company's 1st Platoon became one of the first American forces to enter Fallujah, where they encountered some of the most intense hand-to-hand combat since World War II. Civilians were used as human shields or as bait to lure soldiers into buildings rigged with explosives; suicide bombers approached from every corner hoping to die and take Americans with them; radical insurgents, high on adrenaline, fought to the death.

                      Aware of U.S. plans to withdraw from the country, knowing their efforts were only a footprint in the sand, the fifty Marines of 3rd Platoon fought in Sangin, the most dangerous district in all of Afghanistan. So heavy were the casualties that the Secretary of Defense offered to pull the Marines out. Instead, they pushed forward. Each Marine in 3rd Platoon patrolled two and a half miles a day for six months - a total of One Million Stepsin search of a ghostlike enemy that struck without warning.

The celebrated 2010 HBO miniseries The Pacific, winner of eight Emmy Awards, was based on two classic books about the War in the Pacific, Helmet for My Pillow and With The Old Breed. Audible Studios, in partnership with Playtone, the production company co-owned by Tom Hanks and Gary Goetzman, and creator of the award-winning HBO series Band of Brothers, John Adams, and The Pacific, as well as the HBO movie Game Change, has created new recordings of these memoirs, narrated by the stars of the miniseries.

                      The unforgiving Afghan winter settled upon the 22 men of Marine Special Operations Team 8222, call sign Dagger 22, in the remote and hostile river valley of Bala Murghab, Afghanistan. The Taliban fighters in the region would have liked nothing more than to once again go dormant and rest until the new spring fighting season began. No chance of that - this winter would be different.

                      The army does not want you to listen to this book. It does not want to advertise its detention system that coddles enemy fighters while putting American soldiers at risk. It does not want to reveal the new lawyered-up Pentagon war ethic that prosecutes US soldiers and marines while setting free spies who kill Americans. This very system ambushed Captain Roger Hill and his men.

Gates of Fire puts you at the side of valiant Spartan warriors in 480 BC for the bloody, climactic battle at Thermopylae. There, a few hundred of Sparta’s finest sacrificed their lives to hold back the invading Persian millions. The time they bought enabled the Greeks to rally - saving, according to ancient historian Herodotus, “Western democracy and freedom from perishing in the cradle.” How did the Spartans accomplish this superhuman feat? This is what the King of Persia hopes to learn from the sole Spartan survivor.

Trainees learn to utilize every edge possible to make their shot - from studying crosswinds, barometric pressure, latitude, and even the rotation of the Earth, to becoming ballistic experts. But marksmanship is only one aspect of the training. Each SEAL's endurance, stealth, and mental and physical stamina are tested and pushed to the breaking point.

But before they found the target, the target found them. The team was caught in a deadly ambush that threatened not only their lives but the entire mission. The elite soldiers fought huddled for hours on a small rock ledge as rocket-propelled grenades and heavy machine-gun fire rained down on them.

Firing from entrenched positions, the enemy was positioned to wipe out 100 men who were pinned down and were repeatedly refused artillery support. Ordered to remain behind with the vehicles, 21 year-old Marine corporal Dakota Meyer disobeyed orders and attacked to rescue his comrades.

At first, the Marines were strongly against any Marines serving under anyone other than another Marine. Then 9/11 happened. In the years following, Marine forces found themselves growing more agreeable to inter-branch operational command, finally forming the Marine Special Operations Command in 2006.

Publisher's Summary

            A former captain in the Marines' First Recon Battalion, who fought in Afghanistan and Iraq, reveals how the Corps trains its elite and offers a point-blank account of twenty-first-century battle.
If the Marines are "the few, the proud", Recon Marines are the fewest and the proudest. Only one Marine in a hundred qualifies for Recon, charged with working clandestinely, often behind enemy lines. Fick's training begins with a hellish summer at Quantico, after his junior year at Dartmouth, and advances to the pinnacle, Recon, four years later, on the eve of war with Iraq. Along the way, he learns to shoot a man a mile away, stays awake for 72 hours straight, endures interrogation and torture at the secretive SERE course, learns to swim with Navy SEALs, masters the Eleven Principles of Leadership, and much more.
His vast skill set puts him in front of the front lines, leading 22 Marines into the deadliest conflict since Vietnam. He vows he will bring all his men home safely, and to do so he'll need more than his top-flight education. He'll need luck and an increasingly clear vision of the limitations of his superiors and the missions they assign him.
Fick unveils the process that makes Marine officers such legendary leaders and shares his hard-won insights into the differences between the military ideals he learned and military practice, which can mock those ideals. One Bullet Away never shrinks from blunt truths, but it is an ultimately inspiring account of mastering the art of war.

What the Critics Say
"Candid and fast-paced....Like the best combat memoirs, Fick's focuses on the men doing the fighting and avoids...sensationalism." (Publishers Weekly)

"Captures both the heroism and frustration"



If you're looking for support of your view on the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, this is not the book to find it.  Rather it is a compelling listen from a dedicated Marine who begins his career with idealistic patriotism, and sees it morphed into a love of his comrades.  You'll witness the journey from gung-ho officer candidate to combat leader to sober veteran.  I finished this book with a greater appreciation for the dedication and sacrifice we ask of our military men and women, not only in terms of the risk to their lives, but the cost to them after their part in the wars are over.  This book toned my political rhetoric down a few notches and it just might yours.

"Great book on the war experience of a Marine"



I really enjoyed this book.  I recommend it to anyone interested in what our troops are currently experiencing.  It helped me to understand what U.S. troops go through and how much they sacrifice.  Great book for any military guru.

"Great insight and a great read"



My particular interest was in the making of a recon marine, as my dad was one in the Korean War. The rest was secondary for me. Thankyou, Nathaniel Fick.  It was an insightful and interesting and amazing account of tough warriors who handle small children like butterflies, in the midst of war. His account of the psychology of the Iraqi people was wonderful to read, and puts tv reports in so much better perspective.This is a page-turner, and a gift to the informed American reader.

"Good story badly abridged"



I listened to the audiobook and then happened to correspond w/ the author.  He recommended I read the book itself b/c the abridgment wasn't good in his estimation.  After reading it I agree w/ him.  It's a great and prescient account of a young Marine officer's training and the earliest days of the Iraq War by a thoughtful, dedicated leader of troops, and I recommend the story itself highly.  But whoever abridged it did Capt Fick and his men a disservice.  Better to listen to the audiobook than not experience the book at all, but the audio book does not do it justice.

"Captivating listen......."



This audiobook had me hooked from the start. The story is down to earth, not pro political propaganda or full of brovado, just an individual's experiences, both good and bad. The author shares his fears, thoughts and views and shares a very personal insight as to what it's like to got to war and then to come back home and readjust. I felt like I had come to know the author and was saddend when the audiobook came to an end. This is one book where I wish it was unabridged. Of particular interest was the descriptions of the pro's and cons of the military organisation, things they do well, things they don't do well - working for a large company I could relate exactly to these descriptions.The narration was excellent, low key but never boring or monotone, but added to the personalisation of the story (the author, Nathaniel  was also the narrator).Congratulations Nathaniel on an excellent book - this is one of the most balanced down to earth accounts of life in the US Military that I have read/listend to.This is a must listen. One of the best audio books that I have listed to.Nathaniel should consider a followup story of his life after the military and how his experiences in war have influenced his path in life.... Steve

"aka I Wrote This Book to Overcome PTSD"



Fick is a gifted observer and story-teller.  Wish unabridged version were available.  Couldn't quit listening, even though it wasn't always what I wanted to hear.

"Absolutely brilliant."

Perhaps the most and honest account of an experience as a marine officer. Very well written and honestly illstruative of the development as a leader and moral dihlmeas of combat as well as the issue of leadership in war.

If the Marines are “the few, the proud,” Recon Marines are the fewest and the proudest. Nathaniel Fick’s career begins with a hellish summer at Quantico, after his junior year at Dartmouth. He leads a platoon in Afghanistan just after 9/11 and advances to the pinnacle—Recon— two years later, on the eve of war with Iraq. His vast skill set puts him in front of the front lines, leading twenty-two Marines into the deadliest conflict since Vietnam. He vows to bring all his men home safely, and to do so he’ll need more than his top-flight education. Fick unveils the process that makes Marine officers such legendary leaders and shares his hard-won insights into the differences between military ideals and military practice, which can mock those ideals.In this deeply thoughtful account of what it’s like to fight on today’s front lines, Fick reveals the crushing pressure on young leaders in combat. Split-second decisions might have national consequences or horrible immediate repercussions, but hesitation isn’t an option. One Bullet Away never shrinks from blunt truths, but ultimately it is an inspiring account of mastering the art of war.

I have already read Generation Kill by Evan Wright, which follows Lt. Fick and the First Recon Marines in the Iraq War. Would you still recommend this book, or is it mostly the same thing?

Fick's book starts way before the events of Operation Iraqi Freedom, when he first enlisted and he describes his training and things like that (there are some hilarious moments early in the book actually). Then there's the part on OIF which gives a different perspective from Evan Wright's and the book goes a little beyond that, when 1st Recon got back home. I thought both books were complementary and One Bullet Away is definitely worth reading if you liked Generation Kill, I think. Also, Nate Fick seems to be a pretty admirable man and his book is further proof of that. That's just my opinion, though. (less)

"Soldiering has one great trap...To be a good soldier you must love the army. But to be a good officer you must be willing to order the death of the thing you love. This is...a very hard thing to do.

"Soldiering has one great trap...To be a good soldier you must love the army. But to be a good officer you must be willing to order the death of the thing you love. This is...a very hard thing to do. No other profession requires it. That is one reason why there are so few good officers. Although there are many good men."-- Michael Schaara, The Killer Angels My friend overnighted this book to me when I told him I was joining the National Guard. He told me to read it before making a decision. He hoped that by reading it, I would be change my mind. It didn't exactly happen like that; rather, when I finished, I felt kind of bad about myself, like I'd failed some ineffable duty. Still, I didn't join the Guard, but not because of anything I've read. In the end, it came down to the fact that the Guard's loan repayment plan is paltry, and I would've gone underwater on my debt while in training. (There's also a better, funnier story about why I didn't join, which involves a long night at the bar and the Guard physical scheduled the next day, but I won't go into that). Nathaniel Fick went through with it, though. He joined the Marines, via officer candidacy school, after graduating from Dartmouth. This memoir tells of his journey from lesser-Ivy League (take that, Dartmouth!) English major to OCS to SERE (survival, evasion, resistance, escape) to Afghanistan to Iraq to home. It does a good job of capturing the little details of soldiering, and highlighting the dichotomy between two very separate worlds: that of soldiers and civilians. The subtitle of the book is "The Making of a Marine Corps Officer." This implies that the book provides some sort of template, which is just not the case. Fick is unlike any soldier I've ever met - and I've lived and been friends with my share of soldiers. He brings to his experiences, and this memoir, a liberal sensitivity (with the requisite lethality, of course) that is missing in most military men. He doesn't join the Marines out of monetary necessity, to pay for college, or because he doesn't have any other options. He joined the Marines because he really believed in their ethos of duty, honor and country. But he's not some Reagan-era-Red-Dawn-Watching-2nd-Amendment-Glorifying-Wannabe-GI Joe. Rather, he seems to be a really smart guy with a fine-tuned sense of duty (and also, I think, a bit of intellectual curiosity about the military). When he enlists, in the far-away days of peace we knew in the late 90's, his father tells him that: "The Marines will teach you everything I love you too much to teach you." The book is divided into two main sections, Peace and War. The first section is shorter, as Fick breezes through OCS and infantry training. The second half of the book begins with the September 11, 2001 terrorists attacks. Fick goes to Afghanistan where, frankly, nothing much really happens. He joins a Marine reconaissance batallion, and then is sent to Iraq. This is where the bulk of the story takes place, as Fick and his recon platoon race towards Baghdad (coincidentally, Rolling Stone reporter Evan Wright was embedded with Fick's platoon, codenamed Hitman 2, and he featured them in his book Generation Kill, making Hitman 2 the most written-about and televised group of soldiers since Easy Company of the 501st, who have been immortalized by Stephen Ambrose in Band of Brothers). Fick is a fine, easy-to-read writer. He keeps things simple and informative, with a good memory for dialogue (or a good ear for making up dialogue) and a keen sense of telling details. With his Dartmouth degree going to waste, he is fond of literary allusions. He never gives any details of his personal life, save an offhand reference to a girlfriend, so he remains elusive as a person, and a blank slate as a narrator. That doesn't stop him from giving his opinions, however. Throughout the book, he peppers his story with his personal perspective on events. For instance, after a visit to the site of the former World Trade Center (the so-called "Ground Zero"), he derides the empty patriotism of the SUV-driving-yellow-bumper-sticker-they-won't-destroy-our-way-of-life crowd. During his time in Iraq, he is critical of the blunt instruments of modern warfare, which killed and injured the very civilian populace the American military was trying to "liberate." He also discretely chides his superiors, especially his captain, whom he pointedly does not mention by name. It's true that every soldier fights a limited war. The things Fick sees are his entire universe, and expand to fill his imagination, even though it is a much smaller part of the whole. In other words, the sense of a soldier is that he is at the center of the war, when in fact, history may relegate him and his companions to the periphery.To be sure, Hitman 2 is not Ambrose's "Band of Brothers." These are not guys out saving the world. They are not even seriously challenged (the story takes place during the initial invasion of Iraq, before IEDs and quagmires and the long, bloody summer of 2006). This is not to say Fick and his men weren't in danger, because they were, and they faced it bravely; however, he went to war with 65 men, and all of them came home alive. Most of the time, the Iraqi Army does not put up much of a fight. The most memorable incidents of this book take place outside of combat, such as when the platoon comes upon wounded children. There is an especially harrowing scene when Fick's battalion commander, Major Benelli, refuses to evacuate a wounded girl. Breaching his self-imposed rule about not naming names, Fick directly addresses his smirking commander: I felt impotent, but I wasn't powerless. I had an assault rifle in my hands. I could shoot the motherf****r. I could hold him hostage until he called in that helicopter. There is also a marvelous scene where Sergeant Colbert, hero of the HBO miniseries Generation Kill, cooly blows up an unexploded RGP round that had landed in a man's yard. Though doing so was against orders, Fick realizes this is an instance to do some lasting good. Though his men didn't fight any pitched battles, Fick does an especially good job describing modern combat, as in this scene where his men fire on a truck that refuses to stop at a checkpoint:In slow motion, I watch .50-caliber tracers and Mark-19 rounds arcing over the truck. It closed the gap on the gunners faster than they could lower their guns. For a second, I thought he'd run right into us. The gunners corrected, and grenades exploded against the grille and windshield as armor-piercing incendiary machine gun rounds ripped the cab apart...Still the truck rushed closer...I jammed the rifle stock into my shoulder and flipped the selector level to 'burst'...I aimed low, at the middle of the grille, knowing the shots would float upward toward the windshield. The rifle stuttered, three little kicks at a time. The end of the book finds Fick returning home and resigning so he can go to grad school (Harvard Business School and the Kennedy School of Government, natch). It's a short, interesting, provocative section. There is Fick swerving as he goes beneath underpasses, because in Iraq, grenades were often dropped from them. There is Fick, answering questions from an admissions officer, who wanted to know about something he'd said that appeared in Rolling Stone ("Do I feel compelled to explain myself to you? I don't"). There is Fick taking a friend to Antietam, which gives him a chance to be ostentatiously rueful about his experiences, and subtly belittle the "civvie" who doesn't understand. There is Fick getting pissed about people who thanked him for his service. This section really calls to mind a fascinating and important questions about military and civilian roles in a democracy. I've never served in the military. Like I said, the closest I came was that National Guard recruiting office. I respect what soldiers do; and I am also very wary of what they do. Undue deference leads to bad policy, which should go without saying. I grew a little wary of Fick's mindset, that of superior knowledge, which however natural and psychologically explicable, leads to a growing gulf between the military and the civilian population. The wider the gulf, the worse the policy choices. In college, I lived with a ROTC student, and I can't even count the number of times my former roomate-now-Army-lieutenant and I got into political debates. Without fail, at some point in the argument (right around the time I had eviscerated him with my slashing logic) he'd riposte to the effect that: "You have no right to say that about the Army because the Army has given you the right to say that." It's a dangerous bit of self-indulgence on the part of the military to believe they are protecting or even giving us rights, thus giving them some control over them. It smacks of praetorianism. The last section of One Bullet Away shows that even the most enlightened, liberal thinker can fall prey to that reasoning. That should be enough to give anyone pause.

As a retired Marine officer myself, I believe this may be the best job I've seen yet of getting inside the mind of a Marine leader. Nathaniel Fick is smart, caring, conscientious, brave, and introspective. Upon leaving the Corps he went to grad school with the goal of getting into politics, and I hope to hear his name a lot in the years to come - he has much more to give our country.Incidentally, in another book titled Generation Kill, you can get the perspective of a reporter attached to Lt.

Nate is one of my favorite characters in Generation Kill, so when I realized that he had written a book of his very own that treated on some of the same events, I snapped it up immediately. I like Nate because he is an officer and a gentleman, a Dartmouth classics major who joined the Marine Corps in a fit of idealism, and one of only two competent officers portrayed in Generation Kill. Why I love Nate can be best understood first hand.The rules of engagement harked back to my college classes on Saint Augustine and "just war" theory. I couldn't control the justice of the declaration of war, but I could control the justice of its conduct within my tiny sphere of influence. Doing right, I thought, wasn't only a moral imperative but also the most expedient way to lead the platoon." This book is about Nate's journey from making the decision to join the Corps, through Afghanistan, the Basic Recon Course, and Iraq. It is well worth reading as an excellent first person account of life in the modern military, but I think those who have read Generation Kill may find it most rewarding. The discrepancies between the two accounts are fascinating. Some can be explained simply by the way Fick is more gentle with his fellow officers than Wright was inclined to be--he never, for instance, calls out Captain America for his insane cowardice--but in some places the two stories are genuinely different. As Tim O'Brien teaches us, "there is no such thing as a true war story." Well written, exciting, thoughtful, informative, and interesting, this book is an absolute must read for anyone who liked Generation Kill, is curious about how exactly the military works, or claimed citizenship in the United States of America during 2002-2003.

One Bullet Away: The Making of a Marine Officer is a narrative on the military and war from an Ivy League liberal arts major. With Lt Nathaniel Fick’s background in the classics, I was hoping for a mix of real experience and historical interpretation of his experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq. He focuses more on the experience and not on the wider view. Still, it was a well-written account of joining the military and going to war from a segment of society that is much more focused on getting rich on Wall Street or joining law firms to make a big killing than serving the nation. Nate Fick’s background made him more open to military service and he joined at exactly the right time to be in the vanguard going to war after 9/11.I most enjoyed his descriptions of entering the military and his progress through basic and follow on training. I’ve been through enlisted and officer basic training and his description of the purposeful craziness had me rolling on the floor. One thing for sure, Marine training is probably the toughest around.In the middle of his first sea cruise, 9/11 occurs and his unit is sent to support the Afghanistan campaign. He goes into Pakistan and then into the Kandahar area, supporting but not involved in any of the major actions. Returning from Afghanistan, he is reassigned from command of an infantry platoon to a reconnaissance platoon, extending his opportunity to command at the “point of the spear”. That is where he is when Iraqi Freedom occurs. He takes us through the battles from Kuwait to Baghdad, concentrating on the day-to-day operations. No big picture on this war, just what he and his platoon went through. It was interesting to see his perspective when he finds out his unit was the feint towards Baquoba for a move towards Baghdad. It was a good strategic move but his view on risking his men’s lives for a fake attack was revealing. After returning from Iraq, he leaves the military and gives a clear, simple description of PTSD and how it affected him.Nate Fick’s view of the Marine Corps is very positive as he looks down the chain at his enlisted force and is mostly negative as he looks up the chain. I have known some excellent Marine officers and have not met the type of “tactical incompetents” he describes. His high opinion of the enlisted force continues to the end, backed up with plenty of examples in combat. This book is not so much about combat post 9/11 but about how tough it is to be in combat and stay alert, focused while observing all the rules of engagement. 5 Stars for the pre 9/11 and 3 stars for the post 9/11, leaving me at the 4 Star level.

An interesting book that for some reason did not quite gel with me. After watching the T.V series Generation kill this book offered the story from a marines point of view. While the book was an engaging read for me it lacked spark that makes a good book a great one.

Nate Fick seems like a classy guy and this is a classy, classy book. After graduating with a degree in Classics from Dartmouth, Fick joined the US Marine Corps as an officer candidate. While his friends when to med school, law school or became “consultants” (as Fick points out, what exactly can a 22-year-old consult on?), he became a peacetime officer who was abruptly thrust into wartime after September 11.After serving in Afghanistan, Fick joined the infamously-tough First Reconnaissance Battal
Nate Fick seems like a classy guy and this is a classy, classy book. After graduating with a degree in Classics from Dartmouth, Fick joined the US Marine Corps as an officer candidate. While his friends when to med school, law school or became “consultants” (as Fick points out, what exactly can a 22-year-old consult on?), he became a peacetime officer who was abruptly thrust into wartime after September 11.After serving in Afghanistan, Fick joined the infamously-tough First Reconnaissance Battalion. One of the book’s most powerful sequences involves Fick’s training to become the so-called ‘point of the Marines’ spear’. He deliberately marks down water-based training as his last pick – and, of course, because a First Recon Marine must be trained to do exactly what he hates, he spends a couple of weeks being forced to perform tasks underwater or in stormy seas, until the fear of drowning is beaten out of him.The final part of Fick’s memoir, recounting his experience as a first lieutenant during the 2003 Iraq invasion, will be familiar to readers of Evan Wright’s Generation Kill. Fick gives a more personally-focused (and more balanced) account of what happened, which is, perhaps inevitably, less interesting.I enjoyed this book a lot – though I found the military experiences rather blended together, especially due to the sheer size of the book (hint: it’s long). I preferred Fick’s more personal and philosophical reflections to the raw action of the book, but that's probably just because I’m more interested in people than warriors. ;)The fact that Fick is a former Classics student gives the book a genuine lift. Fick’s prose is always meditative and frequently beautiful. That said, Fick remains carefully neutral on most political subjects, which makes for slightly frustrating reading – sometimes you just want Fick to stand up and give a candid opinion.

I didn't think I liked this book so much at first, but when I reached the last chapter I started having an ache in my stomach. By the last pages it had reached the level of full on grieving. I don't know why, I guess it really got to me; the people, their choices and the honesty of it all. The guy is very reflective, and though I feel I would have liked to know even more about some parts, I'm still impressed with how much he remembered. All things considered.I'm gonna go reread it now.

Note: I've read this book a couple of weeks and my review is based on the notes I took while reading it.Review:I have no doubts that "One Bullet Away" by Nathaniel Fick is going to be one, if not the best book, I'm going to read this year. After I finished it, it took me along time to stop thinking about it (actually, I still haven't), and it moved me in a way I didn't expect. And that was before I watched the excellent HBO TV series "Generation Kill", which I highly recommend, btw.As you may remember, I read and reviewed Evan Wright's "Generation Kill" some time ago. For those of you who don't know the connection, "Generation Kill" covers Wright's time as an embedded journalist with a platoon of recon marines, whose commanding officer was Nathaniel Fick, the author of "One Bullet Away". While I enjoyed "Generation Kill" very much, I also judged it as a book written for an MTV audience - young people with a short attention span and a (however misled) desire for action."One Bullet Away" is very very different from "Generation Kill", and not only because it covers Fick's personal journey to becoming a Marine officer and some of his missions before the events in "Generation Kill". It is different, because Fick's accounts, compared to GK, are so, well, unspectacular. He is all rational, planning, calm - where Evans is the terrified and fascinated journalist who sees the heroics of the single man, and not the camaraderie of the team that is so evident in everything that Fick describes. Where Evans watches and describes, Fick thinks (and writes. And people who can truly think are so rarely found these days. (*sigh*)I was fascinated and confused by the lack of information that Fick describes. He knows, has been taught by the Marine Corps, that you can never have all the intel, so you must act and plan with what you have. For the reader, at least for me as a reader, this was rather unsettling - how can these men make the decision they have to make when they lack so much important information? Hell, I can't even order a pizza if I don't know what kind of cheese is going to be on it!Fick doesn't describe this lack of intel so much as he just lives it - this became most apparent to me on his first mission to Pakistan and Afghanistan - he and the others around him seem to live in an information vacuum onboard their ship -opinion building? Following the press? Not happening. Nowhere else did it become so evident to me that we have to overcome the (heroic) idea that fighting for one's country means fighting for what one believes in. Fighting for one's country means following orders, making the best of the information one is given - fighting for a policy that in the best case scenario you stand behind, but most of the time, you won't even know. What you have to believe in is the idea of serving your country, although Fick doesn't outright say that in this book (but he does so in later articles).And I'm not saying this to make it worth less - the opposite is the case. But it is a truth, and I think it is an important truth to know in order to be able to understand any kind of war. And it makes perfect sense from a military POV: you can't have everyone doing what they think is best - you need them to do what they are told to do. Fick doesn't complain about this, in fact he doesn't seem to object to this. What does make him decide to leave the Corps in the end is the price you pay for being part of the chain of command - you send men to war and they will get killed, and as a commanding officer, no matter how little information you've been given by your superiors, no matter if you believe in the policy you are fighting for or not - this is going to be your responsibility. This had quite an impact on me, the fact that for Fick, for anyone else right there, it's not about good or bad or right or wrong - it's about survival. It's as basic as that.And honestly, I don't know how this makes me feel - there are people fighting out there who are excellent at their jobs - but all they do depends on the words of some policy makers in Washington- What if the policy is wrong? Fick doesn't answer this question -he doesn't even ask it. But I don't think you can read this book without thinking about it.That is not to say that Fick is uninformed. On the contrary -even though he skips the details, Fick mentions and describes again and again the meticulous planning that goes into preparing missions and giving orders: the intelligence gathering, the officer meetings, the ordering, assembling and (re-)checking of equipment -all parts that are virtually non-existent in Evan's book. Where GK sometimes seems to be about a bunch of guys who took an armed roadtrip in Iraq for their Spring break, OBA shows that - overall agenda or not (see above) - these people actually seemed to know what they were doing. And in addition to his excellent personal descriptions of his life as a Marine officer, the book also provides a lot of factual information of the work of the Marine Corps and its officers.And then there is the fact that from everything else I've read not about, but from Nate Fick since then (for those who don't know, he's the CEO of the think tank CNAS), he seems to be one of the more intelligent people out there, and I agree with mostly everything he says (plus he writes so compellingly that I would happily read his shopping list, and enjoy doing so), and I could never resist really good, intelligent reasoning. It turns me on. Yes, really. (but that's beside the point, maybe)Anyway, I found this book very very impressive. It is well-written and informative, but it is also personal and heartfelt. I am a bit ashamed to admit that I didn't expect Fick to be such a good writer (I only read his other articles and interviews after I read OBA) and was therefore surprised that I liked this book even better than I had hoped to like it. I have since learned that OBA is required reading for many Marine officers, and I find that decision fully justified. An important book that I highly, HIGHLY recommend to everyone who is even the least bit interested in the subject.

This military memoir by Nathaniel Fick, who served with the Marines in Afghanistan and Iraq, is superb. Fick may be known as one of the main characters in the book and mini-series Generation Kill, and this book dives far deeper into his experiences. In addition to the expected stories of combat and camaraderie, Fick elucidates issues he balanced as a lieutenant, in dealing with both the enlisted men below him and the often-disconnected officers above him. He's often able to take a step back, providing as nuanced and reasonable views as possible, and that in turn sheds significant light on Marine and military philosophy. Fick writes in a first-person style that's pensive and technical yet still easy to read and follow. I thoroughly enjoyed the book, maybe because Fick is the type of officer I'd like to think I'd have been had my path led that direction. I wish he'd written more about returning to civilian life, though he does express his brief thoughts well. This gets my highest recommendation for anyone looking for on-the-ground action with a reflective bent, from an admirable Marine leader.

I think what worked in this book was all the little details Nathan put it there, like when he remembers the exact amount of reps he had in training or how long it took another group of soldiers to get to his position. I don't really think anything was disappointing in this book. Overall this is a great book if you are interested in the army and what you do to climb the ranks.

This book is a memoir about the author, Nathanial Fick, and his story of his time in the Marines. The beginning of the story is about the difficulty of getting through training to be a marine. He explains every part of his grueling training experience. After boot camp, he is deployed on a ship patrolling the Australian coast for a year long deployment. However, 9/11 happens during his deployment, and he is moved to go fight in Afghanistan. The rest of the book talks about the stress and hardship

However, 9/11 happens during his deployment, and he is moved to go fight in Afghanistan. The rest of the book talks about the stress and hardships of being a real platoon commander, and the perspective of a regular soldier on the battlefield at this time. I would recommend this book for people who like to read about history, war stories, or are just curious about what was happening during this war. One thing they could've done better in this book is giving the reader some perspective of time while reading. When reading, I didn't really know how long he was deployed, and some key events would've helped line up his story and the history better. One thing I liked was the intense detail of his stories. He included some things that didn't matter to his story, but set the mood or feeling, with so much detail. Overall, it is an alright book for people who enjoy these kinds of topics, and would recommend it to the people who have an interest.

http://www.andalittlewine.blogspot.com/2012/08/book-review-one-bullet-away-by.ht...In his memoir One Bullet Away, Nate Fick shares his story of joining the Marine Corps as an officer, and deploying just before the September 11th terrorist attacks.Fick's story, told in ways that are both too glib and too frank, confuses the hell out of me.I understand the call to serve. I understand the frustration that clearly mounts as he is thrust into war zones, in Afghanistan and again in Iraq, that his training did not fully prepare him for by commanders more interested in jockeying for promotion than in the safety of Fick's platoon.But I don't understand who Fick was writing for. Who does he think will love his book?Fick starts off with a glorification of war, of the Marines, of martial life that is, to me, off-putting. "The grunt life was untainted," he writes. "Being a Marine... was a rite of passage in a society becoming so soft and homogenized that the very concept was often sneered at." I could spend all day trying to unpack what Fick means by "soft," but I think the quote shares the flavor of the opening chapters, and the hard-soft motif resurfaces throughout the memoir's nearly 400 pages.Fick handles death lightly. All of his platoon members survive his tour in Iraq, though some are wounded or killed later. The people who die are enemies, othered, and largely nondescript. Threats among the Marines to kill each other if they screw up, as Fick does when one of his men offers to blow an undetonated bomb, are common. But the story lacks the grittiness, the nastiness of military memoirs that have lately been turned into successful movies.But as much as Fick loves the Marines, his platoon, his life as a soldier, he ultimately leaves the Corps because of its seemingly mindless bureaucracy. He leaves because he can't imagine putting himself back in harms way if he is surrounded by the kind of people he served his first Iraq deployment with- the idiots who drive down every road with guns blazing, endangering allies and civilians, or the ladder climbing fools who want to call in air support strikes simply become another company had called one earlier. So the book is not written, I think, for the military enthusiast.Fick makes a compelling case for the re-assessment of American readiness. "I was noticing a trend in my career: train to lead a rifle platoon, but get a weapons platoon; train to raid the coastline in rubber boats, but go to war in a landlocked country; train to jump into patrols via parachute, but use boots or Humvees in the real world." Fick chooses to see this train for Plan A, fight with Plan B as "a tribute to flexibility," but given the dysfunction evident throughout his dealings with military command, it smacks of mismanagement.

Nathaniel Fick received a degree in classics from Dartmouth before joining the Marines, and that blend of scholar and soldier proves to be a good mix in writing this book. Though Fick goes into detail about his training and war experience, I rarely felt lost, as can happen with me when military slang and terminology is tossed around. Occasionally I forgot the meaning of an acronym while reading and wished for a glossary, but it didn’t impede my comprehension overall.I liked reading about the Iraq conflict from Fick’s perspective. He was an officer, so the book includes explanations of how he made hard decisions on the fly. It definitely is an excellent book for examining how it is to lead under pressure. And yet his rank meant that he was close to the action as well.The level of detail is astonishing and vivid. Fick does a good job of placing the reader in the thick of it. One Bullet Away encompasses a range of emotions, from humor to heartbreak. And there is a definite arc to the story; one feels the passage of time. By the time the book has reached April 2003, Fick’s training in Officer Candidates School feels far away. You sense how much things have changed, both for and in him and in the world.The phrase “support our troops” seems so reflexive and emptied of meaning to my ears. I sometimes feel that the speaker of the phrase is trying more to signify something about themselves than actually using it as an exhortation. For instance, it may be used partly as an utterance of protection against accusations of unpatriotism. I know that I used it that way, or a phrase like it, in college discussions about the war back in 2003.So when I say that this book made me truly appreciate the people in the armed forces, I am trying my hardest to not make that seem like an empty platitude. I can’t imagine facing the decisions and danger that the author and his fellow Marines faced. The civilian life is not inferior but it is very different.Fick does illuminate problems he saw while in Iraq, including certain decisions made by higher command. The Marines see the initial welcome of the Iraqi people begin to sour and there is a sense of squandered opportunity.At the close of the book, I felt satisfied in the reading experience but also sobered. I believe I will be thinking about this book for a while yet.

I enjoyed the series, which led me to the book, and both highlighted platoon commander Lieutenant Nathaniel Fick, a bright young Dartmouth grad. It turned out that Fick, who now runs a Washington think tank, had also written about his experiences.Fick has all of the makings of a good autobiographical war writer. He's sharp, so his memoir is well-written, chalk full of detail and analysis. Because of his civilian origins and destiny, Fick's experiences were surprisingly relatable to me. What cost One Bullet Away the fifth star in my rating is that the narrative engaged the reader on a highly intellectual level, which made for a rewarding read but not as much an engrossing page-turner. Still, I highly recommend One Bullet Away for its first-person on-the-ground perspective on the invasion that began the war that defined global geopolitics for most of the last decade.

Nathaniel Fick does a wonderful job detailing his experience, and manages to not step on Evan Wright’s work, even though Wright was embedded with his platoon (23 guys and a reporter from Rolling Stone in this case), and wrote a book that became an HBO miniseries (Generation Kill). He does validate Wright’s closeness to combat, detailing the bullet holes in Wright’s humvee door, but includes very few other details about him, in what I assume was professional courtesy. Fick’s post-USMC exchange with a woman concerning a possible job may have been my favorite part. To give you an idea of the training, well, I don’t think I’m hard enough for Recon. At one point Fick talks about their ‘typical Friday’ which involved an eight mile run, a two mile swim in the ocean, and an eight mile run back. I mentioned that to my rackmate who responded, “That sounds great except for the running and swimming.”

Fick captures what it's like to try to be honorable in a situation that's gone toe-up. He is clearly smart and articulate, lays it out well. And you might never know that what he wrote is inadequate until you read Generation Kill, a much stronger retelling of the beginning of Iraqi Freedom. In contrast and hindsight, One Bullet Away is wan, boring. Idealist boyscout shit.You should read it anyway.NOTE: Rejected whole idea of job; culture mismatch.

The story is of his journey from Dartmouth undergraduate to Marine officer candidate and then as an elite Recon Marine veteran of Iraq and Afghanistan. You don't need to be strongly interested in the military before reading it as it's easily written for a novice like myself and is openly critical of decisions in places. That's what makes it standout. It's a balanced perspective that ultimately points out the importance of competence in harrowing situations. Fick is a thoughtful writer and his book gave me a greater appreciation for the fear, sacrifices, and discomfort that military men and women endure.

I couldn't put this book down, but I didn't want it to end. Captain Fick gives equal attention to the tactical and logistical challenges of war, and the moral and ethical ones. A classics major with all the historical and philosophical lessons and ideas of a first-rate liberal arts education in his thinking, he is also a highly trained warrior. He shows a belief in and dedication to the highest ideals of the Marine Corps, with a practical grasp of all the ways in which the reality can and sometimes does fall short of those ideals. His perspective was fascinating, candid about the ugliness and the terrible allures of war, and heartening in some ways, but also illustrated the importance of good and conscientious leadership to the well-being of all. If all the decision-makers shared more of Fick's qualities, I think we'd all be better off.

Nathaniel Fick entered the Marines by way of Dartmouth College, not the standard route by any means. In “One Bullet Away” he has written a terrific book that should be required reading for all. It gave me a whole new perspective on the war in Iraq. The bravery with which our men serve is incredible. The content is gripping, and Fick’s writing style just adds to it.

He paints a vivid picture of life on the front lines during the initial surge into Iraq after 9/11. Fick is obviously a very intelligent man, but he is also a man of immense bravery and compassion. ‘Compassionate’ wasn’t a word that came to mind when I thought of the typical Marine, but I came away from “One Bullet Away” realizing that many Marines are just that. Fick opens up and shares his inner thoughts and fears, which is what makes it such a compelling read.

Came away with some idea of his attitude to war in general and the marines in particular, but left me wondering what is he doing now he has left?One of the best accounts I have read on what it means to volunteer for military service.

I had great hopes for this book after hearing an interview with the author on NPR. The book is pretty long and after having it for 6 weeks from the library, I couldn't bring myself to finish it. The book does a good job in describing the training of Marines and officers, and a partially good job in describing what they go through in battle, but otherwise it's slow and somewhat boring.

An entertaining read, but written by someone with an obviously over-inflated opinion of himself. As a Marine Infantry Officer myself, I can assure you his accomplishments, particularly while in training at TBS and IOC, are not as glorious as he makes them out to be. It's an easy and entertaining read, but best read with the understanding that Fick's picture of himself is embellished by his own delusions of grandeur.

I said that this was okay only because I might not be interested in it, but I know the perfect audience that would be: young adult males who are interested in joining some sort of army or military and who do not often read. Fick's voice is hard, truthful, and to the point. Very masculine. I don't think I could get into it because my brain does not function on the combat level but he is very informative and honest. Highly recommend for the specified audience.

Synopses & ReviewsPublisher CommentsIf the Marines are "the few, the proud," Recon Marines are the fewest and the proudest. Nathaniel Fick's career begins with a hellish summer at Quantico, after his junior year at Dartmouth. He leads a platoon in Afghanistan just after 9/11 and advances to the pinnacle  Recon   two years later, on the eve of war with Iraq. His vast skill set puts him in front of the front lines, leading twenty-two Marines into the deadliest conflict since Vietnam. He vows to bring all his men home safely, and to do so he'll need more than his top-flight education. Fick unveils the process that makes Marine officers such legendary leaders and shares his hard-won insights into the differences between military ideals and military practice, which can mock those ideals.  

In this deeply thoughtful account of what it's like to fight on today's front lines, Fick reveals the crushing pressure on young leaders in combat. Split-second decisions might have national consequences or horrible immediate repercussions, but hesitation isn't an option. One Bullet Away never shrinks from blunt truths, but ultimately it is an inspiring account of mastering the art of war.'Review"This is one of the best books on the Marine Corps in a long time. If you want to understand what it takes to become a Marine today, read this. Then, if you want to really understand what it takes to serve in today's wars, read it again. One Bullet Away is a terrific book by a natural writer."  Tom Ricks, military correspondent, Washington Post, and author of Making the CorpsReview"Fick sounds like precisely the kind of thoughtful, mature commander any soldier would revere." Cleveland Plain DealerReview"Nathaniel Fick shares a powerful account of the bravery of the Marines and the simple truth every soldier shares: that war is hell. Our troops on the ground in Iraq and Afghanistan are heroes who have sacrificed to serve our country, and in these pages we are reminded of their courage under fire. Fick's story is testimony to their struggle."  Senator John KerryReview"Essential...candid and fast-paced....Like the best combat memoirs, Fick's focuses on the men doing the fighting and avoids hyperbole and sensationalism.  He does not shrink from the truth, however personal or unpleasant." Publishers WeeklyReview"The best sign of military intelligence." Gentleman's QuarterlyReview"A compelling and exciting memoir of military service, swift in its pacing and sure in its details. The courage, selflessness, and skill of Marines are intensely portrayed here and are  in the highest and rarest praise for a military memoir  unmistakably authentic."  Senator John McCainReview"Makes a compelling argument for an oft-overlooked military virture: competence." The New York TimesReview"What One Bullet Away accomplishes, in a way all the blather on cable TV never will, is to give readers real insights into the modern war and its warriors."  Rocky Mountain NewsReview"Much more than a simple dispatch from the fronts of Afghanistan and Iraq, One Bullet Away finds Nathaniel Fick reaching deep within his heart and soul. culling up the irony, frustration, humor, tragedy, and  more than anything else -- the pathos that informs the enterprise of war."  Military.comReview"The Marines develop leaders who are not only skilled, courageous, and tough, but also humane. Join one of them as he leads a Recon platoon to Baghdad and beyond. One Bullet Away is a riveting and highly charged account of modern war as seen through the eyes of a young lieutenant."  Lieutenant General Bernard E. Trainor, USMC (ret.), author of Cobra IIReview"A gripping account of twenty-first-century war by a twenty-first-century warrior. Perhaps most astounding is Nathaniel Fick's candor concerning his own emotions, fears, and moral quandries as he rises to the challenge of leadership. Fick has written the story of our times." Evan Wright, author of Generation KillReview"A splendid story of a young Marine officer's journey from a promising begining to the truth and horror of combat. He pulls no punches in a book that is hard to put down."  Joseph L. Galloway, coauthor of We Were Soldiers Once...and YoungReview"A superb account of the challenges that confront a young officer in today's conflicts. Fick offers exceptionally vivid descriptions of leadership, duty, and brotherhood under fire. One Bullet Away is brilliant, a must-read for anyone who wants to truly understand what our troops face."  General Anthony C. Zinni, USMC (ret.), former commander in chief, U.S. Central Command, and coauthor of Battle ReadyReview"A remarkable book that will give today's readers a much fuller picture of the realities of their military, and that will be read for many years to come because of its vivid, humane, unsparing but also humorous portrayal of the making of a warrior."  James Fallows, national correspondent, Atlantic MonthlyReview"The psychological distance between those who serve and fight and those who publish and pontificate is vast. Nathaniel Fick has closed the gap considerably with this fine book."  Robert D. Kaplan, author of Imperial Grunts: The American Military on the GroundReview"One Bullet Away is much more than a war story. It recounts a young officer's daily duty to lead, to make ethical decisions, and to balance the immense responsibilities of accomplishing missions and saving lives. These lessons are as useful in the boardroom as on the battlefield."  Marshall N. Carter, retired Fortune 500 CEO and two-tour Marine infantry officer in VietnamReview"Fick's writing style sets this book apart from other accounts of recent conflicts and guarantees One Bullet Away a place in the war memorial hall of fame." USA Today"Harrowing . . . deserves close reading and serious discussion." The Washington Post"What One Bullet Away accomplishes, in a way all the blather on cable TV never will, is to give readers real insights into the modern war and its warriors." --Rocky Mountain News"Fick makes a fascinating contribution to the growing shelf of soldiers' tales with his insight into the minds of today's young officers." Boston Magazine"The best sign of military intelligence." Gentleman's Quarterly"Provides a close-up and often harrowing look at [his] service both in Iraq and Afghanistan." U.S. News and World Report"Much more than a simple dispatch from the fronts of Afghanistan and Iraq, One Bullet Away finds Nathaniel Fick reaching deep within his heart and soul. culling up the irony, frustration, humor, tragedy, and -- more than anything else -- the pathos that informs the enterprise of war." --Military.com"Fick sounds like precisely the kind of thoughtful, mature commander any soldier would revere." Cleveland Plain Dealer"Ponders the nature of leadership and war . . . A tough-minded, beautifully written account." Men's Journal"Rapid-fire, vertiginous . . . Fick brilliantly evokes the split second before the first muzzle flashes of an ambush...His story is truly -- as one Marine motto has it -- leadership by example." --National Review"A compelling and exciting memoir of military service, swift in its pacing and sure in its details.

He pulls no punches in a book that is hard to put down." --Joseph L. Galloway, coauthor of We Were Soldiers Once . . . and Young"This is the war on terrorism at the working level, where it's very cold or very hot, where you're dirty and you don't get much sleep, and your life can be over in the next breath. Washington poobahs do grand strategy; people like Fick do the work. This is their story of the fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq. Fick's book makes those wars become real, with all the heroism and the mistakes that still come with ground combat." --Richard A. Clarke, author of Against All Enemies"A superb account of the challenges that confront a young officer in today's conflicts. Fick offers exceptionally vivid descriptions of leadership, duty, and brotherhood under fire. One Bullet Away is brilliant, a must-read for anyone who wants to truly understand what our troops face." --General Anthony C. Zinni, USMC (ret.), former commander in chief, U.S. Central Command, and coauthor of Battle Ready"A brilliant, no-bullshit piece of under-the-helmet reporting. One Bullet Away is much more than a chronicle of war. It illuminates a man's mind and heart as he is thoroughly transformed by training and combat." --Steven Pressfield, author of Gates of Fire"This is one of the best books on the Marine Corps in a long time. If you want to understand what it takes to become a Marine today, read this. Then, if you want to really understand what it takes to serve in today's wars, read it again. One Bullet Away is a terrific book by a natural writer." --Tom Ricks, military correspondent, Washington Post, and author of Making the Corps"A remarkable book that will give today's readers a much fuller picture of the realities of their military, and that will be read for many years to come because of its vivid, humane, unsparing but also humorous portrayal of the making of a warrior." --James Fallows, national correspondent, Atlantic Monthly"Far more than a glory-soaked collection of war stories, this memoir proves the ideal of the scholar-soldier is alive and well. One can hardly imagine a finer boots-on-the-ground chronicle of this open-ended conflict, no matter how long it may last." Kirrkus Reviews, Starred"Essential . . . candid and fast-paced . . .

The New York Times"Fick and his men come across as America's dream fighting force: hypercapable, ever vigilant, wire-tough, and loyal to the end." OutsideReview"Few if any of the Iraq war memoirs that have been published so far are likely to endure. But the best of them, their narratives as yet immune to the wisdom of time, offer vivid, immediate glimpses of the dust and smoke of war. Such is One Bullet Away, a tale told by an intelligent, dedicated warrior seduced by the ethos of the Marines."

Nathaniel Fick shows his Dartmouth education in the writing of "One Bullet Away".  His writing is fluent and easy to read and understand, even when writing about complicated military missions in Iraq and Afghanistan.  The clear descriptions of Marine Officer training takes you right inside Quantico and Camp Pendleton (Force Recon) leaving you experiencing conditions right along with Fick.  I have personally known Marines who were involved in Vietnam and Iraq who realized the same things about leadership as Lt. Fick did.  I was sucked into the action and decision making as though I was standing next to him.  Anyone who is considering becoming an Officer in any of the military branches needs to read this book.

If the Marines are “the few, the proud,” Recon Marines are the fewest and the proudest. Nathaniel Fick’s career begins with a hellish summer at Quantico, after his junior year at Dartmouth. He leads a platoon in Afghanistan just after 9/11 and advances to the pinnacle—Recon— two years later, on the eve of war with Iraq. His vast skill set puts him in front of the front lines, leading twenty-two Marines into the deadliest conflict since Vietnam. He vows to bring all his men home safely, and to do so he’ll need more than his top-flight education. Fick unveils the process that makes Marine officers such legendary leaders and shares his hard-won insights into the differences between military ideals and military practice, which can mock those ideals.In this deeply thoughtful account of what it’s like to fight on today’s front lines, Fick reveals the crushing pressure on young leaders in combat. Split-second decisions might have national consequences or horrible immediate repercussions, but hesitation isn’t an option. One Bullet Away never shrinks from blunt truths, but ultimately it is an inspiring account of mastering the art of war.

I have already read Generation Kill by Evan Wright, which follows Lt. Fick and the First Recon Marines in the Iraq War. Would you still recommend this book, or is it mostly the same thing?

Fick's book starts way before the events of Operation Iraqi Freedom, when he first enlisted and he describes his training and things like that (there are some hilarious moments early in the book actually). Then there's the part on OIF which gives a different perspective from Evan Wright's and the book goes a little beyond that, when 1st Recon got back home. I thought both books were complementary and One Bullet Away is definitely worth reading if you liked Generation Kill, I think. Also, Nate Fick seems to be a pretty admirable man and his book is further proof of that. That's just my opinion, though. (less)

"Soldiering has one great trap...To be a good soldier you must love the army. But to be a good officer you must be willing to order the death of the thing you love. This is...a very hard thing to do. No other profession requires it. That is one reason why there are so few good officers. Although there are many good men."-- Michael Schaara, The Killer Angels My friend overnighted this book to me when I told him I was joining the National Guard. He told me to read it before making a decision. He hoped that by reading it, I would be change my mind. It didn't exactly happen like that; rather, when I finished, I felt kind of bad about myself, like I'd failed some ineffable duty. Still, I didn't join the Guard, but not because of anything I've read. In the end, it came down to the fact that the Guard's loan repayment plan is paltry, and I would've gone underwater on my debt while in training. (There's also a better, funnier story about why I didn't join, which involves a long night at the bar and the Guard physical scheduled the next day, but I won't go into that). Nathaniel Fick went through with it, though. He joined the Marines, via officer candidacy school, after graduating from Dartmouth. This memoir tells of his journey from lesser-Ivy League (take that, Dartmouth!) English major to OCS to SERE (survival, evasion, resistance, escape) to Afghanistan to Iraq to home. It does a good job of capturing the little details of soldiering, and highlighting the dichotomy between two very separate worlds: that of soldiers and civilians. The subtitle of the book is "The Making of a Marine Corps Officer." This implies that the book provides some sort of template, which is just not the case. Fick is unlike any soldier I've ever met - and I've lived and been friends with my share of soldiers. He brings to his experiences, and this memoir, a liberal sensitivity (with the requisite lethality, of course) that is missing in most military men. He doesn't join the Marines out of monetary necessity, to pay for college, or because he doesn't have any other options. He joined the Marines because he really believed in their ethos of duty, honor and country. But he's not some Reagan-era-Red-Dawn-Watching-2nd-Amendment-Glorifying-Wannabe-GI Joe. Rather, he seems to be a really smart guy with a fine-tuned sense of duty (and also, I think, a bit of intellectual curiosity about the military). When he enlists, in the far-away days of peace we knew in the late 90's, his father tells him that: "The Marines will teach you everything I love you too much to teach you." The book is divided into two main sections, Peace and War. The first section is shorter, as Fick breezes through OCS and infantry training. The second half of the book begins with the September 11, 2001 terrorists attacks. Fick goes to Afghanistan where, frankly, nothing much really happens. He joins a Marine reconaissance batallion, and then is sent to Iraq. This is where the bulk of the story takes place, as Fick and his recon platoon race towards Baghdad (coincidentally, Rolling Stone reporter Evan Wright was embedded with Fick's platoon, codenamed Hitman 2, and he featured them in his book Generation Kill, making Hitman 2 the most written-about and televised group of soldiers since Easy Company of the 501st, who have been immortalized by Stephen Ambrose in Band of Brothers). Fick is a fine, easy-to-read writer. He keeps things simple and informative, with a good memory for dialogue (or a good ear for making up dialogue) and a keen sense of telling details. With his Dartmouth degree going to waste, he is fond of literary allusions. He never gives any details of his personal life, save an offhand reference to a girlfriend, so he remains elusive as a person, and a blank slate as a narrator. That doesn't stop him from giving his opinions, however. Throughout the book, he peppers his story with his personal perspective on events. For instance, after a visit to the site of the former World Trade Center (the so-called "Ground Zero"), he derides the empty patriotism of the SUV-driving-yellow-bumper-sticker-they-won't-destroy-our-way-of-life crowd. During his time in Iraq, he is critical of the blunt instruments of modern warfare, which killed and injured the very civilian populace the American military was trying to "liberate." He also discretely chides his superiors, especially his captain, whom he pointedly does not mention by name. It's true that every soldier fights a limited war. The things Fick sees are his entire universe, and expand to fill his imagination, even though it is a much smaller part of the whole. In other words, the sense of a soldier is that he is at the center of the war, when in fact, history may relegate him and his companions to the periphery.To be sure, Hitman 2 is not Ambrose's "Band of Brothers." These are not guys out saving the world. They are not even seriously challenged (the story takes place during the initial invasion of Iraq, before IEDs and quagmires and the long, bloody summer of 2006). This is not to say Fick and his men weren't in danger, because they were, and they faced it bravely; however, he went to war with 65 men, and all of them came home alive. Most of the time, the Iraqi Army does not put up much of a fight. The most memorable incidents of this book take place outside of combat, such as when the platoon comes upon wounded children. There is an especially harrowing scene when Fick's battalion commander, Major Benelli, refuses to evacuate a wounded girl. Breaching his self-imposed rule about not naming names, Fick directly addresses his smirking commander: I felt impotent, but I wasn't powerless. I had an assault rifle in my hands. I could shoot the motherf****r. I could hold him hostage until he called in that helicopter. There is also a marvelous scene where Sergeant Colbert, hero of the HBO miniseries Generation Kill, cooly blows up an unexploded RGP round that had landed in a man's yard. Though doing so was against orders, Fick realizes this is an instance to do some lasting good. Though his men didn't fight any pitched battles, Fick does an especially good job describing modern combat, as in this scene where his men fire on a truck that refuses to stop at a checkpoint:In slow motion, I watch .50-caliber tracers and Mark-19 rounds arcing over the truck. It closed the gap on the gunners faster than they could lower their guns. For a second, I thought he'd run right into us. The gunners corrected, and grenades exploded against the grille and windshield as armor-piercing incendiary machine gun rounds ripped the cab apart...Still the truck rushed closer...I jammed the rifle stock into my shoulder and flipped the selector level to 'burst'...I aimed low, at the middle of the grille, knowing the shots would float upward toward the windshield. The rifle stuttered, three little kicks at a time. The end of the book finds Fick returning home and resigning so he can go to grad school (Harvard Business School and the Kennedy School of Government, natch). It's a short, interesting, provocative section. There is Fick swerving as he goes beneath underpasses, because in Iraq, grenades were often dropped from them. There is Fick, answering questions from an admissions officer, who wanted to know about something he'd said that appeared in Rolling Stone ("Do I feel compelled to explain myself to you? I don't"). There is Fick taking a friend to Antietam, which gives him a chance to be ostentatiously rueful about his experiences, and subtly belittle the "civvie" who doesn't understand. There is Fick getting pissed about people who thanked him for his service. This section really calls to mind a fascinating and important questions about military and civilian roles in a democracy. I've never served in the military. Like I said, the closest I came was that National Guard recruiting office. I respect what soldiers do; and I am also very wary of what they do. Undue deference leads to bad policy, which should go without saying. I grew a little wary of Fick's mindset, that of superior knowledge, which however natural and psychologically explicable, leads to a growing gulf between the military and the civilian population. The wider the gulf, the worse the policy choices. In college, I lived with a ROTC student, and I can't even count the number of times my former roomate-now-Army-lieutenant and I got into political debates. Without fail, at some point in the argument (right around the time I had eviscerated him with my slashing logic) he'd riposte to the effect that: "You have no right to say that about the Army because the Army has given you the right to say that." It's a dangerous bit of self-indulgence on the part of the military to believe they are protecting or even giving us rights, thus giving them some control over them. It smacks of praetorianism. The last section of One Bullet Away shows that even the most enlightened, liberal thinker can fall prey to that reasoning. That should be enough to give anyone pause.

Nate is one of my favorite characters in Generation Kill, so when I realized that he had written a book of his very own that treated on some of the same events, I snapped it up immediately. I like Nate because he is an officer and a gentleman, a Dartmouth classics major who joined the Marine Corps in a fit of idealism, and one of only two competent officers portrayed in Generation Kill. Why I love Nate can be best understood first hand.The rules of engagement harked back to my college classes on Saint Augustine and "just war" theory. I couldn't control the justice of the declaration of war, but I could control the justice of its conduct within my tiny sphere of influence. Doing right, I thought, wasn't only a moral imperative but also the most expedient way to lead the platoon." This book is about Nate's journey from making the decision to join the Corps, through Afghanistan, the Basic Recon Course, and Iraq. It is well worth reading as an excellent first person account of life in the modern military, but I think those who have read Generation Kill may find it most rewarding. The discrepancies between the two accounts are fascinating. Some can be explained simply by the way Fick is more gentle with his fellow officers than Wright was inclined to be--he never, for instance, calls out Captain America for his insane cowardice--but in some places the two stories are genuinely different. As Tim O'Brien teaches us, "there is no such thing as a true war story." Well written, exciting, thoughtful, informative, and interesting, this book is an absolute must read for anyone who liked Generation Kill, is curious about how exactly the military works, or claimed citizenship in the United States of America during 2002-2003.

One Bullet Away: The Making of a Marine Officer is a narrative on the military and war from an Ivy League liberal arts major. With Lt Nathaniel Fick’s background in the classics, I was hoping for a mix of real experience and historical interpretation of his experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq. He focuses more on the experience and not on the wider view. Still, it was a well-written account of joining the military and going to war from a segment of society that is much more focused on getting rich on Wall Street or joining law firms to make a big killing than serving the nation. Nate Fick’s background made him more open to military service and he joined at exactly the right time to be in the vanguard going to war after 9/11.I most enjoyed his descriptions of entering the military and his progress through basic and follow on training. I’ve been through enlisted and officer basic training and his description of the purposeful craziness had me rolling on the floor. One thing for sure, Marine training is probably the toughest around.In the middle of his first sea cruise, 9/11 occurs and his unit is sent to support the Afghanistan campaign. He goes into Pakistan and then into the Kandahar area, supporting but not involved in any of the major actions. Returning from Afghanistan, he is reassigned from command of an infantry platoon to a reconnaissance platoon, extending his opportunity to command at the “point of the spear”. That is where he is when Iraqi Freedom occurs. He takes us through the battles from Kuwait to Baghdad, concentrating on the day-to-day operations. No big picture on this war, just what he and his platoon went through. It was interesting to see his perspective when he finds out his unit was the feint towards Baquoba for a move towards Baghdad. It was a good strategic move but his view on risking his men’s lives for a fake attack was revealing. After returning from Iraq, he leaves the military and gives a clear, simple description of PTSD and how it affected him.Nate Fick’s view of the Marine Corps is very positive as he looks down the chain at his enlisted force and is mostly negative as he looks up the chain. I have known some excellent Marine officers and have not met the type of “tactical incompetents” he describes. His high opinion of the enlisted force continues to the end, backed up with plenty of examples in combat. This book is not so much about combat post 9/11 but about how tough it is to be in combat and stay alert, focused while observing all the rules of engagement. 5 Stars for the pre 9/11 and 3 stars for the post 9/11, leaving me at the 4 Star level.

An interesting book that for some reason did not quite gel with me. After watching the T.V series Generation kill this book offered the story from a marines point of view. While the book was an engaging read for me it lacked spark that makes a good book a great one.

Nate Fick seems like a classy guy and this is a classy, classy book. After graduating with a degree in Classics from Dartmouth, Fick joined the US Marine Corps as an officer candidate. While his friends when to med school, law school or became “consultants” (as Fick points out, what exactly can a 22-year-old consult on?), he became a peacetime officer who was abruptly thrust into wartime after September 11.After serving in Afghanistan, Fick joined the infamously-tough First Reconnaissance Battal
Nate Fick seems like a classy guy and this is a classy, classy book. After graduating with a degree in Classics from Dartmouth, Fick joined the US Marine Corps as an officer candidate. While his friends when to med school, law school or became “consultants” (as Fick points out, what exactly can a 22-year-old consult on?), he became a peacetime officer who was abruptly thrust into wartime after September 11.After serving in Afghanistan, Fick joined the infamously-tough First Reconnaissance Battalion. One of the book’s most powerful sequences involves Fick’s training to become the so-called ‘point of the Marines’ spear’. He deliberately marks down water-based training as his last pick – and, of course, because a First Recon Marine must be trained to do exactly what he hates, he spends a couple of weeks being forced to perform tasks underwater or in stormy seas, until the fear of drowning is beaten out of him.The final part of Fick’s memoir, recounting his experience as a first lieutenant during the 2003 Iraq invasion, will be familiar to readers of Evan Wright’s Generation Kill. Fick gives a more personally-focused (and more balanced) account of what happened, which is, perhaps inevitably, less interesting.I enjoyed this book a lot – though I found the military experiences rather blended together, especially due to the sheer size of the book (hint: it’s long). I preferred Fick’s more personal and philosophical reflections to the raw action of the book, but that's probably just because I’m more interested in people than warriors. ;)The fact that Fick is a former Classics student gives the book a genuine lift. Fick’s prose is always meditative and frequently beautiful. That said, Fick remains carefully neutral on most political subjects, which makes for slightly frustrating reading – sometimes you just want Fick to stand up and give a candid opinion.

I didn't think I liked this book so much at first, but when I reached the last chapter I started having an ache in my stomach. By the last pages it had reached the level of full on grieving. I don't know why, I guess it really got to me; the people, their choices and the honesty of it all. The guy is very reflective, and though I feel I would have liked to know even more about some parts, I'm still impressed with how much he remembered. All things considered.I'm gonna go reread it now.

Note: I've read this book a couple of weeks and my review is based on the notes I took while reading it.Review:I have no doubts that "One Bullet Away" by Nathaniel Fick is going to be one, if not the best book, I'm going to read this year. After I finished it, it took me along time to stop thinking about it (actually, I still haven't), and it moved me in a way I didn't expect. And that was before I watched the excellent HBO TV series "Generation Kill", which I highly recommend, btw.As you may remember, I read and reviewed Evan Wright's "Generation Kill" some time ago. For those of you who don't know the connection, "Generation Kill" covers Wright's time as an embedded journalist with a platoon of recon marines, whose commanding officer was Nathaniel Fick, the author of "One Bullet Away". While I enjoyed "Generation Kill" very much, I also judged it as a book written for an MTV audience - young people with a short attention span and a (however misled) desire for action."One Bullet Away" is very very different from "Generation Kill", and not only because it covers Fick's personal journey to becoming a Marine officer and some of his missions before the events in "Generation Kill". It is different, because Fick's accounts, compared to GK, are so, well, unspectacular. He is all rational, planning, calm - where Evans is the terrified and fascinated journalist who sees the heroics of the single man, and not the camaraderie of the team that is so evident in everything that Fick describes. Where Evans watches and describes, Fick thinks (and writes. And people who can truly think are so rarely found these days. (*sigh*)I was fascinated and confused by the lack of information that Fick describes. He knows, has been taught by the Marine Corps, that you can never have all the intel, so you must act and plan with what you have. For the reader, at least for me as a reader, this was rather unsettling - how can these men make the decision they have to make when they lack so much important information? Hell, I can't even order a pizza if I don't know what kind of cheese is going to be on it!Fick doesn't describe this lack of intel so much as he just lives it - this became most apparent to me on his first mission to Pakistan and Afghanistan - he and the others around him seem to live in an information vacuum onboard their ship -opinion building? Following the press? Not happening. Nowhere else did it become so evident to me that we have to overcome the (heroic) idea that fighting for one's country means fighting for what one believes in. Fighting for one's country means following orders, making the best of the information one is given - fighting for a policy that in the best case scenario you stand behind, but most of the time, you won't even know. What you have to believe in is the idea of serving your country, although Fick doesn't outright say that in this book (but he does so in later articles).And I'm not saying this to make it worth less - the opposite is the case. But it is a truth, and I think it is an important truth to know in order to be able to understand any kind of war. And it makes perfect sense from a military POV: you can't have everyone doing what they think is best - you need them to do what they are told to do. Fick doesn't complain about this, in fact he doesn't seem to object to this. What does make him decide to leave the Corps in the end is the price you pay for being part of the chain of command - you send men to war and they will get killed, and as a commanding officer, no matter how little information you've been given by your superiors, no matter if you believe in the policy you are fighting for or not - this is going to be your responsibility. This had quite an impact on me, the fact that for Fick, for anyone else right there, it's not about good or bad or right or wrong - it's about survival. It's as basic as that.And honestly, I don't know how this makes me feel - there are people fighting out there who are excellent at their jobs - but all they do depends on the words of some policy makers in Washington- What if the policy is wrong? Fick doesn't answer this question -he doesn't even ask it. But I don't think you can read this book without thinking about it.That is not to say that Fick is uninformed. On the contrary -even though he skips the details, Fick mentions and describes again and again the meticulous planning that goes into preparing missions and giving orders: the intelligence gathering, the officer meetings, the ordering, assembling and (re-)checking of equipment -all parts that are virtually non-existent in Evan's book. Where GK sometimes seems to be about a bunch of guys who took an armed roadtrip in Iraq for their Spring break, OBA shows that - overall agenda or not (see above) - these people actually seemed to know what they were doing. And in addition to his excellent personal descriptions of his life as a Marine officer, the book also provides a lot of factual information of the work of the Marine Corps and its officers.And then there is the fact that from everything else I've read not about, but from Nate Fick since then (for those who don't know, he's the CEO of the think tank CNAS), he seems to be one of the more intelligent people out there, and I agree with mostly everything he says (plus he writes so compellingly that I would happily read his shopping list, and enjoy doing so), and I could never resist really good, intelligent reasoning. It turns me on. Yes, really. (but that's beside the point, maybe)Anyway, I found this book very very impressive. It is well-written and informative, but it is also personal and heartfelt. I am a bit ashamed to admit that I didn't expect Fick to be such a good writer (I only read his other articles and interviews after I read OBA) and was therefore surprised that I liked this book even better than I had hoped to like it. I have since learned that OBA is required reading for many Marine officers, and I find that decision fully justified. An important book that I highly, HIGHLY recommend to everyone who is even the least bit interested in the subject.

This military memoir by Nathaniel Fick, who served with the Marines in Afghanistan and Iraq, is superb. Fick may be known as one of the main characters in the book and mini-series Generation Kill, and this book dives far deeper into his experiences. In addition to the expected stories of combat and camaraderie, Fick elucidates issues he balanced as a lieutenant, in dealing with both the enlisted men below him and the often-disconnected officers above him. He's often able to take a step back, providing as nuanced and reasonable views as possible, and that in turn sheds significant light on Marine and military philosophy. Fick writes in a first-person style that's pensive and technical yet still easy to read and follow. I thoroughly enjoyed the book, maybe because Fick is the type of officer I'd like to think I'd have been had my path led that direction. I wish he'd written more about returning to civilian life, though he does express his brief thoughts well. This gets my highest recommendation for anyone looking for on-the-ground action with a reflective bent, from an admirable Marine leader.

I enjoyed the different perspective this book brings to the Marine Corps type books. It was great to get an officer's perspective, since the majority of Marines are enlisted men, it takes a certain type of human to lead this rowdy bunch of young professionals.

I think what worked in this book was all the little details Nathan put it there, like when he remembers the exact amount of reps he had in training or how long it took another group of soldiers to get to his position. I don't really think anything was disappointing in this book. Overall this is a great book if you are interested in the army and what you do to climb the ranks.

This book is a memoir about the author, Nathanial Fick, and his story of his time in the Marines. The beginning of the story is about the difficulty of getting through training to be a marine. He explains every part of his grueling training experience. After boot camp, he is deployed on a ship patrolling the Australian coast for a year long deployment. However, 9/11 happens during his deployment, and he is moved to go fight in Afghanistan. The rest of the book talks about the stress and hardship

However, 9/11 happens during his deployment, and he is moved to go fight in Afghanistan. The rest of the book talks about the stress and hardships of being a real platoon commander, and the perspective of a regular soldier on the battlefield at this time. I would recommend this book for people who like to read about history, war stories, or are just curious about what was happening during this war. One thing they could've done better in this book is giving the reader some perspective of time while reading. When reading, I didn't really know how long he was deployed, and some key events would've helped line up his story and the history better. One thing I liked was the intense detail of his stories. He included some things that didn't matter to his story, but set the mood or feeling, with so much detail. Overall, it is an alright book for people who enjoy these kinds of topics, and would recommend it to the people who have an interest.

http://www.andalittlewine.blogspot.com/2012/08/book-review-one-bullet-away-by.ht...In his memoir One Bullet Away, Nate Fick shares his story of joining the Marine Corps as an officer, and deploying just before the September 11th terrorist attacks.Fick's story, told in ways that are both too glib and too frank, confuses the hell out of me.I understand the call to serve. I understand the frustration that clearly mounts as he is thrust into war zones, in Afghanistan and again in Iraq, that his training did not fully prepare him for by commanders more interested in jockeying for promotion than in the safety of Fick's platoon.But I don't understand who Fick was writing for. Who does he think will love his book?Fick starts off with a glorification of war, of the Marines, of martial life that is, to me, off-putting. "The grunt life was untainted," he writes. "Being a Marine... was a rite of passage in a society becoming so soft and homogenized that the very concept was often sneered at." I could spend all day trying to unpack what Fick means by "soft," but I think the quote shares the flavor of the opening chapters, and the hard-soft motif resurfaces throughout the memoir's nearly 400 pages.Fick handles death lightly. All of his platoon members survive his tour in Iraq, though some are wounded or killed later. The people who die are enemies, othered, and largely nondescript. Threats among the Marines to kill each other if they screw up, as Fick does when one of his men offers to blow an undetonated bomb, are common. But the story lacks the grittiness, the nastiness of military memoirs that have lately been turned into successful movies.But as much as Fick loves the Marines, his platoon, his life as a soldier, he ultimately leaves the Corps because of its seemingly mindless bureaucracy. He leaves because he can't imagine putting himself back in harms way if he is surrounded by the kind of people he served his first Iraq deployment with- the idiots who drive down every road with guns blazing, endangering allies and civilians, or the ladder climbing fools who want to call in air support strikes simply become another company had called one earlier. So the book is not written, I think, for the military enthusiast.Fick makes a compelling case for the re-assessment of American readiness. "I was noticing a trend in my career: train to lead a rifle platoon, but get a weapons platoon; train to raid the coastline in rubber boats, but go to war in a landlocked country; train to jump into patrols via parachute, but use boots or Humvees in the real world." Fick chooses to see this train for Plan A, fight with Plan B as "a tribute to flexibility," but given the dysfunction evident throughout his dealings with military command, it smacks of mismanagement.

Nathaniel Fick received a degree in classics from Dartmouth before joining the Marines, and that blend of scholar and soldier proves to be a good mix in writing this book. Though Fick goes into detail about his training and war experience, I rarely felt lost, as can happen with me when military slang and terminology is tossed around. Occasionally I forgot the meaning of an acronym while reading and wished for a glossary, but it didn’t impede my comprehension overall.I liked reading about the Iraq conflict from Fick’s perspective. He was an officer, so the book includes explanations of how he made hard decisions on the fly. It definitely is an excellent book for examining how it is to lead under pressure. And yet his rank meant that he was close to the action as well.The level of detail is astonishing and vivid. Fick does a good job of placing the reader in the thick of it. One Bullet Away encompasses a range of emotions, from humor to heartbreak. And there is a definite arc to the story; one feels the passage of time. By the time the book has reached April 2003, Fick’s training in Officer Candidates School feels far away. You sense how much things have changed, both for and in him and in the world.The phrase “support our troops” seems so reflexive and emptied of meaning to my ears. I sometimes feel that the speaker of the phrase is trying more to signify something about themselves than actually using it as an exhortation. For instance, it may be used partly as an utterance of protection against accusations of unpatriotism. I know that I used it that way, or a phrase like it, in college discussions about the war back in 2003.So when I say that this book made me truly appreciate the people in the armed forces, I am trying my hardest to not make that seem like an empty platitude. I can’t imagine facing the decisions and danger that the author and his fellow Marines faced. The civilian life is not inferior but it is very different.Fick does illuminate problems he saw while in Iraq, including certain decisions made by higher command. The Marines see the initial welcome of the Iraqi people begin to sour and there is a sense of squandered opportunity.At the close of the book, I felt satisfied in the reading experience but also sobered. I believe I will be thinking about this book for a while yet.

I enjoyed the series, which led me to the book, and both highlighted platoon commander Lieutenant Nathaniel Fick, a bright young Dartmouth grad. It turned out that Fick, who now runs a Washington think tank, had also written about his experiences.Fick has all of the makings of a good autobiographical war writer. He's sharp, so his memoir is well-written, chalk full of detail and analysis. Because of his civilian origins and destiny, Fick's experiences were surprisingly relatable to me. What cost One Bullet Away the fifth star in my rating is that the narrative engaged the reader on a highly intellectual level, which made for a rewarding read but not as much an engrossing page-turner. Still, I highly recommend One Bullet Away for its first-person on-the-ground perspective on the invasion that began the war that defined global geopolitics for most of the last decade.

Nathaniel Fick does a wonderful job detailing his experience, and manages to not step on Evan Wright’s work, even though Wright was embedded with his platoon (23 guys and a reporter from Rolling Stone in this case), and wrote a book that became an HBO miniseries (Generation Kill). He does validate Wright’s closeness to combat, detailing the bullet holes in Wright’s humvee door, but includes very few other details about him, in what I assume was professional courtesy. Fick’s post-USMC exchange with a woman concerning a possible job may have been my favorite part. To give you an idea of the training, well, I don’t think I’m hard enough for Recon. At one point Fick talks about their ‘typical Friday’ which involved an eight mile run, a two mile swim in the ocean, and an eight mile run back. I mentioned that to my rackmate who responded, “That sounds great except for the running and swimming.”

Fick captures what it's like to try to be honorable in a situation that's gone toe-up. He is clearly smart and articulate, lays it out well. And you might never know that what he wrote is inadequate until you read Generation Kill, a much stronger retelling of the beginning of Iraqi Freedom. In contrast and hindsight, One Bullet Away is wan, boring. Idealist boyscout shit.You should read it anyway.NOTE: Rejected whole idea of job; culture mismatch.

You don't need to be strongly interested in the military before reading it as it's easily written for a novice like myself and is openly critical of decisions in places. That's what makes it standout. It's a balanced perspective that ultimately points out the importance of competence in harrowing situations. Fick is a thoughtful writer and his book gave me a greater appreciation for the fear, sacrifices, and discomfort that military men and women endure.

I couldn't put this book down, but I didn't want it to end. Captain Fick gives equal attention to the tactical and logistical challenges of war, and the moral and ethical ones. A classics major with all the historical and philosophical lessons and ideas of a first-rate liberal arts education in his thinking, he is also a highly trained warrior. He shows a belief in and dedication to the highest ideals of the Marine Corps, with a practical grasp of all the ways in which the reality can and sometimes does fall short of those ideals. His perspective was fascinating, candid about the ugliness and the terrible allures of war, and heartening in some ways, but also illustrated the importance of good and conscientious leadership to the well-being of all. If all the decision-makers shared more of Fick's qualities, I think we'd all be better off.

Nathaniel Fick entered the Marines by way of Dartmouth College, not the standard route by any means. In “One Bullet Away” he has written a terrific book that should be required reading for all. It gave me a whole new perspective on the war in Iraq. The bravery with which our men serve is incredible. The content is gripping, and Fick’s writing style just adds to it.

He paints a vivid picture of life on the front lines during the initial surge into Iraq after 9/11. Fick is obviously a very intelligent man, but he is also a man of immense bravery and compassion. ‘Compassionate’ wasn’t a word that came to mind when I thought of the typical Marine, but I came away from “One Bullet Away” realizing that many Marines are just that. Fick opens up and shares his inner thoughts and fears, which is what makes it such a compelling read.

I met Nate Fick in 2009 well after he left the service and was impressed by his mind. Now having read his book I understand him better. The value of Nate's book is in the clarity of his story about life as a young Marine officer. It is an enjoyable read, as well as honest and transparent.

Nate has the great fortune to be part of Marine units who spearhead our actions in Afghanistan, then Iraq, which he describes with detail. As in any military experience things don't always turn out the way one wants or expects, nor do things always go right. Any officer can relate to the ups & downs Nate recounts in his service and in the thrill and immense burden of leading young men in training and combat.

Gripping account of a marine officer's journey from training through to fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq to his eventual departure from the corps. Very matter of fact in its delivery, avoiding hyperbole and jingoism and is an essentially personal examination of conflict and the Marines Corps. Touches on the history and what it meant to him to be an officer commanding a platoon in battle.Stark imagery gives a great feel for what Fick went through, even though I wouldn't have nearly enough hubris

Touches on the history and what it meant to him to be an officer commanding a platoon in battle.Stark imagery gives a great feel for what Fick went through, even though I wouldn't have nearly enough hubris to assume I had any idea what it was really like. Came away with some idea of his attitude to war in general and the marines in particular, but left me wondering what is he doing now he has left?One of the best accounts I have read on what it means to volunteer for military service.

I had great hopes for this book after hearing an interview with the author on NPR. The book is pretty long and after having it for 6 weeks from the library, I couldn't bring myself to finish it. The book does a good job in describing the training of Marines and officers, and a partially good job in describing what they go through in battle, but otherwise it's slow and somewhat boring. It's unsettling to find out just how dumb a lot of the Marine commanders are.I would not recommend this book alt

I hope there are better books out there on this subject (an interesting one to me) who are a better read.

This book is a memoir; the author became a marine officer after graduating from Dartmouth in the late 90s and though he began serving in peacetime, he managed to be among the first marines into both Afghanistan and Iraq. The details about training are interesting, but the dramatic and honest look at the drive towards Baghdad at the beginning of the conflict is riveting--the details and the action will keep you reading late into the night.

Highly recommended for both the good writing and the important on-the-ground view of the Iraq war.

An entertaining read, but written by someone with an obviously over-inflated opinion of himself. As a Marine Infantry Officer myself, I can assure you his accomplishments, particularly while in training at TBS and IOC, are not as glorious as he makes them out to be. It's an easy and entertaining read, but best read with the understanding that Fick's picture of himself is embellished by his own delusions of grandeur.

I said that this was okay only because I might not be interested in it, but I know the perfect audience that would be: young adult males who are interested in joining some sort of army or military and who do not often read. Fick's voice is hard, truthful, and to the point. Very masculine. I don't think I could get into it because my brain does not function on the combat level but he is very informative and honest. Highly recommend for the specified audience.
