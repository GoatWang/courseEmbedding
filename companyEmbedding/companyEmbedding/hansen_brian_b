The American pursuit team consisted of Hansen, Chad Hedrick, Jonathan Kuck and Trevor Marsicano.

The American team were defeated by the Canadians in the gold medal final. The same trio that skated the semifinal trailed Canada in the gold medal final by as much as 0.73 seconds early in the race, trimming that margin to 0.21 at the finish with a time of 3:41.58. The Canadians hit the line at 3:41.37 to win the gold medal, leaving the American team with silver. The bronze went to the Netherlands, which set an Olympic record in the B final with a time of 3:39.95.[4]

Games[edit]
In the 1500 m, Hansen placed 18th with a time of 1:48.45.[1]
The American pursuit team consisted of Hansen, Chad Hedrick, Jonathan Kuck and Trevor Marsicano. Kuck, Hedrick and Marsicano eliminated Japan in the quarterfinal, which advanced them to face the heavily favored Netherlands in the semifinal.[2] Kuck, Hedrick and Hansen then beat the Dutch team by .4 seconds, with a final time of 3:42.71.[3]
The American team were defeated by the Canadians in the gold medal final. The same trio that skated the semifinal trailed Canada in the gold medal final by as much as 0.73 seconds early in the race, trimming that margin to 0.21 at the finish with a time of 3:41.58. The Canadians hit the line at 3:41.37 to win the gold medal, leaving the American team with silver. The bronze went to the Netherlands, which set an Olympic record in the B final with a time of 3:39.95.[4]
Personal life[edit]
Brian was born in Evanston, Illinois, and was raised in Glenview, Illinois. Hansen is coached by 4-time Olympian Nancy Swider-Peltz. Hansen is the youngest member of the Long Track Speedskating Team and the only junior. Brian attended Attea Middle School and Glenbrook South High School, both in Glenview.
