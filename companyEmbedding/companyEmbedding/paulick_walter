Job Details
               Agios is an independent, private biopharmaceutical company at the forefront of drug discovery in one of the most exciting new areas of cancer research: cancer metabolism. The intersection of two fields of research - cancer and metabolism - offers an important and novel approach to treating cancer. Research in cancer metabolism has provided new understandings of fundamental mechanisms behind cancer survival, representing a new, powerful strategy to target this deadly disease. Agios is developing a diverse pipeline of cancer metabolism drug candidates, building on the company's intellectual property and drug discovery platform as well as the unique insights of its founders and scientific advisors. Agios' novel drugs will be targeted therapies directed at modulating key metabolic pathways such as glycolysis (sugar metabolism), fatty acid metabolism, and autophagy (self-metabolism). The company's primary focus is in oncology, though Agios' platform may also be applicable to other therapeutics areas featuring diseases of cellular proliferation, including autoimmune, inflammatory and neurological diseases. Agios has a scientific team that is second to none in the field of cancer metabolism. The company was founded by the core thought leaders who have made key advances and discoveries in the field of cancer metabolism. Agios has attracted and continues to seek out top talent to translate the science of cancer metabolism into transformational drugs for patients.
