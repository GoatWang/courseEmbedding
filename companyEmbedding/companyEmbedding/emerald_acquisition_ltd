                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

13F Filings



The Security, Class, and CUSIP columns in the table below are shown exactly as filed by the investor.
        We do our best to track continuity of investments through acquisitions, and this will be reflected in
        the table as changes in names and cusips.
In addition to descriptive data, performance of the investment
        is shown over time. To calculate quarterly performance, we first calculate cost basis of the shares purchased during the quarter, then use
            that to calculate gross profit. Quarterly return is Gross Profit / Starting Portfolio value.
Note that cost basis is calculated and stored in thousands, so small quarterly changes in shares frequently
            result in a cost basis of zero.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

      Or use day whenever the filing was submitted to the SEC

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).
      You can optionally adjust when the backtest actually starts.

EMERALD KALAMA CHEMICAL COMPLETES ACQUISITION OF INNOSPEC WIDNES LTD, RENAMES AS EMERALD KALAMA CHEMICAL LTD
Emerald Kalama Chemical, a business group of Emerald Performance Materials LLC (“Emerald”), announced that it has acquired Innospec Widnes Limited (“Widnes”). Emerald Kalama Chemical is a leading global producer of benzoic acid, benzaldehyde and other downstream specialty materials. The acquisition is the latest in a series of key strategic investments the company has made to expand these core product platforms targeted for food and beverage, consumer and industrial applications. Emerald is a portfolio company of American Securities LLC, a leading private investment firm. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed.
Innospec Widnes Limited, a subsidiary of Innospec Inc., is a leading manufacturer of high purity aroma chemicals, key ingredients that impart fragrance to perfumes and household products. In announcing the sale of this business to Emerald, Innospec, Inc. indicated that it will focus more of its resources on key businesses in fuel specialties, personal care and oilfield specialties. The Innospec Widnes business, located in Widnes, UK, will become part of the Emerald Kalama Chemical flavor and fragrance business and will do business under the Emerald Kalama Chemical Ltd. company name going forward.
Emerald Kalama Chemical has long been a recognized leader in the benzoate business, focused on benzoic acid, benzaldehyde, benzyl alcohol and sodium benzoate that have been manufactured at facilities in Rotterdam, Netherlands, and Kalama, Wash. (USA) for more than 50 years. The company is also well known for its downstream derivatives based on benzoic acid, as well as Kalama® benzaldehyde a key feedstock used to produce specialty aroma chemicals at the company’s Kalama site and at the newly acquired operation in Widnes, UK. Emerald will continue to serve both the current market needs and internal consumption demands for benzaldehyde from its existing capacity.

“It is imperative to our overall growth strategy to expand our global footprint to support customers in our core markets around the world,” said Edward T. Gotch, CEO of Emerald Kalama Chemical and board member of the International Fragrance Association North America (IFRANA). “Emerald Kalama Chemical has been intentional in executing key investments to reshape the business into a market-focused leading global specialty chemical company since it was formed. We have experienced the benefits that a key acquisition can make to accelerate that transition process. At the time Emerald Kalama was formed, our business was primarily North American focused, and Asia was second given the location of our US-Pacific Coast plant. The acquisition of the Rotterdam operation in 2010, along with its established European sales and service team, accelerated our transition to a more global company. As a result, Europe has grown from 8 percent of our sales to 35 percent of our sales today. With additional investments, expansions and innovative new products, our business has tripled since our formation, and our vision is to double again by 2020.”
Gotch continued, “The Innospec Widnes acquisition represents another key step in executing on this strategy and dovetails with other recent investments to expand our infrastructure, capabilities and product range. We expect the acquisition of Innospec Widnes to have a significant impact on the global growth of our flavor and fragrance business, providing Emerald with a significant manufacturing presence in Europe and a great base from which to support our growth in that region.”
Since 2006, Emerald Kalama Chemical has made key investments in its flavor and fragrance business, expanding aroma chemicals at its U.S. operation and effectively doubling its capacity over that time period. The company continues to ramp up expansion activities in Europe. In April 2015, the company announced it is investing tens of millions of dollars on its latest expansions at Rotterdam, which will nearly double the capacity of high purity benzoic acid once complete, as well as increase capacity for downstream products. The company also expanded its technical center and added several new products to its aroma chemicals portfolio: 3-phenyl propanol, cinnamic alcohol and methyl benzoate. The company has also made key additions to its team to support its flavor and fragrance business.
Peter M. Fielder, vice president of Emerald Kalama Chemical’s flavor and fragrance (F&F) business, stated, “We are very enthusiastic about this acquisition and feel that the expertise and reputation of Innospec Widnes in the market closely parallels those of Emerald Kalama Chemical and our company as a whole. The acquisition of Innospec Widnes helps us to accomplish several key strategic goals, including the expansion of our footprint, global reach and service to customers in the flavor and fragrance industry. Our F&F operations in Widnes and Kalama are configured to be flexible, which will facilitate production of certain specialty materials at both sites. As a result, we will be able to offer our customers double the range of products in our aroma chemical line from our base on two continents, with an expanded commercial and technical team to provide improved service to our customers globally.”
