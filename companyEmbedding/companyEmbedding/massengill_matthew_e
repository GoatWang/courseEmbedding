Home > Employee Stock Ownership Plan


Markertek is an ESOP Company
Employee Owned, Managed and Operated.You're Dealing with Actual Owners!
At Markertek, we have always done things differently than the rest of the industry! That is why we decided in 2016 to make our employees actual equity stake owners in 100% of the company.We believe our employees should share in the success of our company in a tangible manner. This is the ultimate way to reward employees for their contributions to our ongoing success and growth. That’s why we created an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (“ESOP”). Participating in the ESOP program means employees are actual part owners of the company and benefit financially from a job well done. In this way, there is direct incentive for employees to work hard and take pride in what they do. It is also why we lead the broadcasting industry with the most energetic and knowledgeable employee-owners under the sun!Markertek Employees Share in the Success and Vision of the Company.

	The  new 147,000-square-foot Seng-Liang Wang Hall, located just north of the Northwestern Avenue Parking Garage, provides laboratories, offices, conference rooms, and support facilities for the College of Engineering. The  School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, the primary tenant, occupies 40 percent of the innovative, multipurpose building.

	To help provide new facilities for Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE), Patrick Wang, (BSEE ’72, MSEE, ’72, HDR ’04) and his wife, Lucy, both of Hong Kong, contributed the lead gift to the building, naming it in honor of Patrick’s late father. “My father did not have the opportunity to finish high school, let alone college, but he toiled tirelessly so I and other members of my family could go to college in America,” said Patrick. What Seng-Liang may have lacked in formal education, he made up for in ingenuity, character, dedication, entrepreneurship, and a strong belief in the value of education. In 1959, he founded Johnson Electric in Hong Kong, which today is a growing multinational company for which Patrick now serves as chairman and chief executive officer.

	Under Patrick’s leadership, Johnson Electric has evolved from a $2 million company best known for producing motors for high-end model racing cars, to a leader in motion subsystems, serving many industries including automotive, building automation, business machines, home technologies, health care, and power tools. 

	Patrick said he hopes that the building will afford students opportunities to flourish in ways that will contribute to a brighter future. “I was fortunate to be born to parents who were entrepreneurs. Their unwavering belief in me, and their mentorship, imbued in me a ‘can do’ attitude and a resilience to setbacks,” he said. “It is my wish that this building will be the place to nurture talents for professional excellence as well as entrepreneurship — so these things can make our world a better place for future generations.”

2016 Electrical & Computer Engineering Awards


I am delighted to recognize the 2016 Outstanding Electrical and Computer Engineers as we celebrate not only the successes of our OECEs, but the successes of our on-campus ECE family as well. Our OECE honorees join a distinguished group of alumni who have previously received this honor, engineers who represent the finest in their fields, and who embody the spirit of Purdue Engineering, applying a world view to work that has a universal impact.
            


We are proud to count each of our honorees among the Purdue ECE family of extraordinary people who are making a global impact. Please join me in congratulating our ECE honorees and our 2016 OECE honorees as they receive the School of Electrical and Computer Engineeringâs top accolade for professional achievement.
 
- Leah Jamieson, John A. Edwardson Dean of Engineering and Ransburg Distinguished Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering

The Outstanding Electrical and Computer Engineering (OECE) awards celebration â recognizing the achievements of alumni and faculty â is a highlight event each year. This year marks the first time in our 128-year-old history when our faculty size exceeds the 100 mark. And many of our performance metrics are at record or near-record levels. As we near the end of the planned engineering expansion, we are well-positioned to achieve even greater levels of excellence.


This evening I am pleased to congratulate a special group - the newest class of Outstanding Electrical and Computer Engineering alumni. We are proud of their achievements and Iâm honored to welcome them to an elite group. Their accomplishments along with those of our faculty serve as an inspiration to all of us, and especially to our students as they set out to make a difference in the world. 
- V. "Ragu" Balakrishnan, Michael and Katherine Birck Head and Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering

1998 Electrical & Computer Engineering Awards


In an era when electrical and computer engineering has an 
ever-increasing impact on daily life, it is especially appropriate 
to recognize the contributions made by our alumni to the profession 
we share. As we work on a personal computer or make a 911 call, use 
the Internet or a power tool, we are using techniques and devices 
developed by our 1998 Outstanding Electrical Engineer Award recipients.

Purdue University is dedicated to education, research, and 
service. As you will learn from the short biographies, 
our outstanding engineers have reflected those same 
priorities as they shared their education and experience with 
others in this country and abroad, advanced the technologies of 
their industry, and contributed to their communities. In so doing 
they have brought honor upon themselves and, indirectly, upon the 
university where they studied. Purdue University is proud to claim 
them as alumni and honor them as Outstanding Electrical Engineers.

Home > Employee Stock Ownership Plan


Markertek is an ESOP Company
Employee Owned, Managed and Operated.You're Dealing with Actual Owners!
At Markertek, we have always done things differently than the rest of the industry! That is why we decided in 2016 to make our employees actual equity stake owners in 100% of the company.We believe our employees should share in the success of our company in a tangible manner. This is the ultimate way to reward employees for their contributions to our ongoing success and growth. That’s why we created an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (“ESOP”). Participating in the ESOP program means employees are actual part owners of the company and benefit financially from a job well done. In this way, there is direct incentive for employees to work hard and take pride in what they do. It is also why we lead the broadcasting industry with the most energetic and knowledgeable employee-owners under the sun!Markertek Employees Share in the Success and Vision of the Company.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
