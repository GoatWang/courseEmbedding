WELCOME 


 We are located in the School of Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology. 
Our primary focus is on creating, understanding, and rationally engineering nanoporous materials and membranes through innovative and scalable processing strategies. 
We work on challenging  problems relating directly to renewable/clean energy, chemical production,  and water purification. 
A common thread uniting the problems under investigation is the reduction of material dimensions or key structural features to the nanometer length scale.

 General Facilities and Equipment



Laboratories

Synthesis: We are well equipped for inorganic material/membrane synthesis and purification. Facilities include nanotube synthesis setups, zeolite and metal-organic framework (MOF) synthesis reactors, purification equipment (dialysis, centrifuge), substrate preparation equipment (disk press, furnace, polishing wheel), water purification systems, Schlenk line for organic chemistry.


Membrane permeation: We are equipped with several single-component and multi-component gas/vapor permeation and pervaporation measurement systems, a membrane reactor test bed, and a catalytic reactor test bed. 


Adsorption: We are equipped with single-component gas (pressure decay) and vapor (VTI-SA) adsorption measurement setups, as well as multi-component vapor and liquid breakthrough measurement setups. 

                Materials characterization 

                Use ShaRa to locate a number of characterization equipment available in our group and on campus.

                We are  frequent users of instrumentation available in the following Georgia Tech central facilities:
Center for Nanostructure Characterization
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Center
Institute for Electronics and Nanotechnology


X-Ray Diffraction Access

We maintain a PANalytical X-ray diffractometer and reflectometer equipped with high-speed RTMS detector, Miniprop detector with parallel plate collimator, reflectivity stage, mirror, automatic beam attenuator, and TTK-450 temperature/environment control chamber. To obtain access:
1. Fill in and print Form B from the Office of Radiological Safety (ORS). Then have the Form B signed by Dr. Nair (EST 2224). 
2. Submit Form B to the ORS. Enroll for, and complete, their Radiation Safety training. 
3. We will receive your ORS training certificate and will contact you with the next available training date (see below the current training dates and times). 
4. Please arrive at the location mentioned below on the scheduled date and time. After completing the training, you can use the instrument provided the trainer feels you are capable of operating it safely and correctly. Else, additional training is required. You can discuss your experimental needs/difficulties with us during training or afterwards. 
5. At the end of training, you will receive a user name and password to access the sign-up scheduler.

Strategy & Management Tools 
17October, 201417October, 2014 / ajaysankarnair  / 2 Comments



To be successful in business, you should know how to manage your business and strategise your success. In my new post, ‘’Strategy & Management Tools’’, I have compiled a list of tools to manage your business and strategise your success.


Ansoff’s Matrix (Also known as Product/Market Expansion Grid)– Ansoff Matrix, classifies and explains different growth strategies for a company. This matrix is used by companies which have a growth target or a strategy of specialization. This tool, crossing products and markets of a company, facilitates decision making.
The Ansoff matrix offers four strategies to achieve the objectives.

Penetration of the market ;
Extension of the market ;
New products ;
Diversification.

Benchmarking– Benchmarking is the process of measuring products, services, and processes against those of organizations known to be leaders in one or more aspects of their operations. Benchmarking provides necessary insights to help you understand how your organization compares with similar organizations, even if they are in a different business or have a different group of customers.
Benchmarking has been classified into two distinct categories:

Technical benchmarking
Competitive benchmarking

Blue Ocean Strategy– Blue ocean strategy describes how organizations should try and find a way to work in a marketplace that isn’t bloodied by the competition and is free of competitors.
Four actions can help to create a blue ocean strategy. The actions are found by answering these questions:

Which of the factors that the industry takes for granted should be eliminated?
Which factors should be reduced well below the industry’s standard?
Which factors should be raised well above the industry’s standard?
Which factors should be created that the industry has never offered?

Boston Matrix (Also known as the BCG Matrix, the Growth-Share Matrix and Portfolio Analysis)– Boston Matrix helps organizations figure out which areas of their business deserve more resources and investment. The matrix framework categorizes products within a company’s portfolio according to each product’s growth rate, market share, and positive or negative cash flow. By using positive cash flows, a company can capitalize on growth opportunities.
Competitive Advantage– The Competitive Advantage (CA) model of Porter learns that competitive strategy is about taking offensive or defensive action to create a defendable position in an industry, in order to cope successfully with competitive forces and generate a superior return on investment. According to Michael Porter, the basis of above-average performance within an industry is sustainable competitive advantage. There are 2 basic types of CA:

Cost leadership (low cost)
Differentiation

Core Competencies– A Core Competency is a deep proficiency that enables a company to deliver unique value to customers. It embodies an organization’s collective learning, particularly of how to coordinate diverse production skills and integrate multiple technologies. Such a Core Competency creates sustainable competitive advantage for a company and helps it branch into a wide variety of related markets. Core Competencies also contribute substantially to the benefits a company’s products offer customers. Understanding Core Competencies allows companies to invest in the strengths that differentiate them and set strategies that unify their entire organization.
Economic value added (EVA)– Economic value added measures a corporation’s true economic profit. The objective of EVA is to understand which business units’ best leverage their assets to generate returns and maximise shareholder value.
Five Forces Model – Porter’s five forces help to identify where power lies in a business situation. This is useful both in understanding the strength of an organisation’scurrent competitive position, and the strength of a position that an organisation may look to move into. Strategic analysts often use Porter’s five forces to understand whether new products or services are potentially profitable.
Force Field Analysis – Force Field Analysis is a general tool for systematically analyzing the factors found in complex problems. It frames problems in terms of factors or pressures that support the status quo (restraining forces) and those pressures that support change in the desired direction (driving forces). A factor can be people, resources, attitudes, traditions, regulations, values, needs, desires, etc. As a tool for managing change, Force Field Analysis helps identify those factors that must be addressed and monitored if change is to be successful.
Goals and Methods Matrix – Turner and Cochrane’s Goals and Methods Matrix judge the projects based on two parameters:

whether the goals are well defined
whether the methods of achieving them are well defined

The resulting 2 x 2 matrix implies four types of project:

Type-l projects: for which the goals and methods of achieving the project are well defined
Type-2projects: for which the goals are well defined but the methods are not
Type-3 projects: for which the goals are not well defined but the methods are
Type-4 projects: for which neither the goals nor the methods are well defined

Hayes and Wheelwright‘s PRODUCT-PROCESS MATRIX -This matrix is to examine market manufacturing congruence issues and to facilitate the understanding of the strategic options available to a company. The matrix itself consists of two dimensions, product structure/product life cycle and process structure/process life cycle. The production process used to manufacture a product moves through a series of stages, much like the stages of products and markets, which begins with a highly flexible, high-cost process and progresses toward increasing standardization, mechanization, and automation, culminating in an inflexible but a cost-effective process. The process structure/process life cycle dimension describes the process choice (job shop, batch, assembly line, and continuous flow) and process structure (jumbled flow, disconnected line flow, connected line flow and continuous flow) while the product structure/product life cycle describes the four stages of the product life cycle (low volume to high volume) and product structure (low to high standardisation).
Kano Model Analysis– Kano Model Analysis is a useful technique for deciding which features you want to include in a product or service. It helps you break away from a profit-minimizing mindset that says you’ve got to have as many features as possible in a product, and helps you think more subtly about the features you include. This can be the difference between a product or service being profitable or unprofitable.
McKinsey 7-S framework – The McKinsey 7- S framework is a popular model used in organizations to analyse the environment to investigate if the company is achieving its intended objectives. The model proposes 7 interdependent factors – 3 hard ‘S’ i.e.strategy, structure, systems; and 4 soft ‘S’ i.e. shared values, skills, style and staff. The hard ‘S’ are more tangible, easy to define and easy to influence than the soft ‘S’.


Organisational Configuration – Henry Mintzberg theory is that an organisation’sstructure emerges from the interaction of the organisation’s strategy, the environmental forces it experiences, and the organisational structure it has. When these fit together well, they combine to create organisations that can perform well. When they don’t fit, then the organisation is likely to experience problems. Mintzberg has defined a number of organisational types and by understanding them, you can analyse whether a company’s structure is well suited to its conditions. If it isn’t, analysis can start to on what needs to be done to change things.
The main structures of organisations that he identifies are:

The entrepreneurial organisation
The machine organisation (bureaucracy)
The professional organisation
The divisional (diversified) organisation
The innovative organisation (adhocracy)

Puttick Grid– The Grid was introduced as a methodology through which a manufacturing or service company could develop an operational strategy which was wholly aligned to delivering specific customer values. To this end, the Grid assists companies to evaluate:

How does the market view a company’s product-market arena today
How will the market view a company’s product-market arena tomorrow

Thus the company is able to prepare its strategies and plans in the light of the how the customer views and appreciates the products it wishes to acquire and the characteristics of the acquisition process, rather than how the organisation views its own products, strengths and weaknesses.
Product families are placed in one of four categories:

Super Value Goods
Products/Services with time-limited windows of opportunity (e.g. fashion goods, spares)
Consumer Durables
Commodities

Strategic Audit– A strategy audit is a review of a company’s business plan and strategies to identify weaknesses and shortcomings and enable a successful development of the company. The strategy audit secures that all necessary information for the development of the company are included in the business plan and that the management supports it.
Does your business plan:

Cover the key areas and the critical issues for the company’s future success?
Clarify and verify your business model?
Provide guidance for daily operations and activities?
Correspond with the management team’s opinion and priorities?

Team Role Theory (Also known as Belbin’s team roles) – Team Role Theory is used to identify people’s behavioural strengths and weaknesses in the workplace. This information can be used to:

Build productive working relationships
Select and develop high-performing teams
Raise self-awareness and personal effectiveness
Build mutual trust and understanding
Aid recruitment processes

Terry Hill Framework– The process of how internal operational capabilities are converted to a criteria that may lead to competitive advantage and market success. Professor Terry Hill emphasised the interactions and cooperation between operations and marketing. The operations people are responsible for providing the order-winning and order-qualifying criteria—identified by marketing—that enable products to win orders in the marketplace. This process starts with the corporate strategy and ends with the criteria that either keeps the company in the running (i.e., order qualifiers) or wins the customer’s business.
VRIO Analysis-The VRIO Analysis is an analytical technique, which for each type of resource considers several evaluation dimensions for the organization as well as for its competitors. VRIO is an acronym from the initials of the names of the dimensions: Value, Rareness, Imitability, Organization. It is a way of evaluating the resources of an organization which are divided as follows:

Financial resources
Human resources
Material resources
Nonmaterial resources (information, knowledge)

Value Chain Analysis– Value Chain Analysis is a strategic tool used to analyze internal firm activities. Its goal is to recognize, which activities are the most valuable (i.e. are the source of cost or differentiation advantage) to the firm and which ones could be improved to provide competitive advantage.

India Post: How to feed a starving lion? 
10October, 201410October, 2014 / ajaysankarnair  / Leave a comment



India Post, according to Wikipedia, it has 154,866 post offices, of which 139,040 (89.78 percent) in rural areas and 15,826 (10.22 percent) in urban areas and has employee strength over 470,000. Imagine, what if a company like Amazon, eBay or Indian companies like Flipkart or Snapdeal has these many offices and employees. India Post would have become another Deutsche Post DHL!

It is due to lack of vision of people at the helm of the this organisation that has made once a prestigious organisation to a loss making organisation. With the present infrastructure, there are many ways to revive this government organisaiton and change it to a profit making body. As a supply chainer, to change it to a profit making body I will re-engineer the business process in following ways. As this is a LinkedIn post, I am only listing a few important points:
1. Train the employees: Bring in experts in the field and of change management for employees to understand why the change in their organisation.
2. Warehouse: Build the warehouses or share the existing warehouses of governmentorganisation in strategically located cities. If the organisation should become a one stop shop for all logistics requirements; they should have warehouses in key cities.

3. Distribution Center / Reverse fulfillment center: Convert every post office into a secondary distribution center and reverse fulfillment center. Every post office can act as a point of contact or a link between manufacturer / e-commerce company and the end customers. The office will be a secondary distribution center that delivers the shipment to the customer and also pick the consignment from the customer as part of the reverse fulfillment process.
4. IT networking: Massive investment in IT infrastructure is required. This includes establishing a communication link between the India Post’s customer (manufacturer / e-commerce company and the post offices itself.
5. Tracking devices/handheld devices: Upgrading or introducing handheld devices for its delivery team so that the sender can know the status of the delivery. Meanwhile, the India Post’s fleet should be equipped with tracking devices so that its logistics team is aware of every truck’s movement.
These are a few points that they should implement to become a real competitor in the field of logistics. Once India Post becomes a truly logistics solution provider, it can reach out to the people within 24 hours or 48 hours.
Following three points would be India Post’s unique selling point when pitching for new business from the private companies. At present, in the India Post website, I can see a General Manager’s email address and contact number for the private company that wants to do business with India Post. It is laughable and not surprised because that is how an Indian Government organisation function.
Office space aggregation: As said earlier in the post, India Post has more than 100,000 offices across India. Most of the office space can be used as storage places for small consignments.
Personnel aggregation: Since the introduction of email, the employees have less work to do and more time to relax. Therefore, India Post’s personnel can be utilised so that it benefits the India Post, clients and customer.
Transportation aggregation: India Post’s fleet can be used for delivering heavy shipments. Some of the trucks can be upgraded to temperature controlled truck that can deliver food products, flowers etc.,

When India Post becomes a professionally managed logistics company, they can deal with companies from various industries ranging from flower vendors, e-commerce companies to OEM Manufacturing companies. Once Indian Post succeeds to become a successful 3PL company, it can enter the international market.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
