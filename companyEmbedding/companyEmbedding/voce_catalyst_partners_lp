Voce Capital Sends Letter to Obagi Medical Products Board of Directors




Investor criticizes recent adoption of poison pill and demands 
      immediate action to rectify governance deficiencies and to evaluate 
      strategic alternatives






February 10, 2012 12:23 PM Eastern Standard Time



SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Voce Capital Management LLC (“Voce”) announced today that it has sent a 
      letter to the Board of Directors of Obagi Medical Products, Inc. 
      (“Obagi”) (Nasdaq:OMPI) criticizing the Board’s recent adoption of a 
      poison pill and demanding immediate action to address corporate 
      governance deficiencies and to evaluate strategic alternatives.
    


      Voce’s letter states that it believes Obagi has spurned recent overtures 
      to acquire the Company, and further cites pervasive corporate governance 
      deficiencies that explain the Board’s unwillingness to consider those 
      proposals. Voce also expresses concern over the Board’s recent decision 
      to adopt a poison pill, citing it as further evidence of the Board’s 
      entrenchment.
    

      In the letter to the Board, Voce’s Managing Partner, J. Daniel Plants, 
      said “We have grown increasingly concerned by the Company’s lack of 
      progress in broadening its product portfolio and expanding its reach. In 
      our view Obagi would be much more valuable in the hands of a larger and 
      more skilled operator, and indeed we believe that interested strategic 
      parties have approached the Company only to be consistently rebuffed by 
      a Board unwilling to even entertain discussion of an acquisition 
      proposal.”
    

      Mr. Plants went on to state in the letter:
    

      “To date, we have enjoyed regular and candid dialog with Obagi and have 
      refrained from publicly questioning or criticizing its leadership. 
      However, we believe the Company’s deficient corporate governance is a 
      key contributor to its refusal to consider acquisition offers it has 
      received and explains the actions the Board has taken to entrench 
      itself. While we would have preferred to continue these discussions in 
      private, the Board’s decision to adopt a poison pill – two days before 
      Christmas and in sight of the notice deadline for shareholder actions at 
      the annual meeting – leads us to conclude that the Board’s interests 
      have become so misaligned with those of the Obagi shareholders that 
      public disclosure of these matters is not only warranted but required.”
    

      Voce’s letter also questions the Obagi Board’s independence, 
      particularly the undue influence of Stonington Partners and the absence 
      of meaningful stock ownership by directors. “The Board appears to be 
      preeminently interested in its self-perpetuation and the maintenance of 
      its insular and clubby nature.”
    

      Specifically, Voce calls upon the Board of Obagi to immediately:
    


        commence a review of the Company’s strategic alternatives, including 
        good faith consideration of the strong strategic interest in acquiring 
        the Company;
      

        overhaul the Obagi Board, including the removal of Directors 
        Fitzgibbons and Bartholdson and their replacement with proper 
        independent shareholder representation; and
      

        commit that it will put the poison pill to a vote at the 2012 annual 
        meeting, and that it will not adopt another poison pill or any other 
        anti-takeover device should the shareholders not ratify the pill at 
        that time.

      February 10, 2012
    

      Members of the Board of DirectorsObagi Medical Products, Inc.3760 
      Kilroy Airport Way, Suite 500Long Beach, CA 90806
    

      Attention: Corporate Secretary
    

      Gentlemen:
    

      Voce Capital Management LLC (“VCM”) is the investment advisor to Voce 
      Catalyst Partners LP (“VCP” and, together with VCM, “Voce”). VCP has 
      been a shareholder of Obagi Medical Products, Inc. (“Obagi” or the 
      “Company”) continuously since June 2, 2011. We write in response to the 
      decision by the Obagi Board of Directors (the “Board”) on December 23, 
      2011 to adopt a “Preferred Share Purchase Rights Plan”, more commonly 
      known as a “poison pill”.
    

      We have grown increasingly concerned by the Company’s lack of progress 
      in broadening its product portfolio and expanding its reach. In our view 
      Obagi would be much more valuable in the hands of a larger and more 
      skilled operator, and indeed we believe that interested strategic 
      parties have approached the Company only to be consistently rebuffed by 
      a Board unwilling to even entertain discussion of an acquisition 
      proposal.
    

      To date, we have enjoyed regular and candid dialog with Obagi and have 
      refrained from publicly questioning or criticizing its leadership. 
      However, we believe the Company’s deficient corporate governance is a 
      key contributor to its refusal to consider acquisition offers it has 
      received and explains the actions the Board has taken to entrench 
      itself. While we would have preferred to continue these discussions in 
      private, the Board’s decision to adopt a poison pill – two days before 
      Christmas and in sight of the notice deadline for shareholder actions at 
      the annual meeting – leads us to conclude that the Board’s interests 
      have become so misaligned with those of the Obagi shareholders that 
      public disclosure of these matters is not only warranted but required.
    

      * * *
    

      Since its founding in 1988, Obagi has built a distinctive franchise. Its 
      flagship Nu-derm® product line is universally acclaimed, and the Obagi 
      brand commands loyalty from consumers and doctors alike. Obagi has an 
      extremely valuable physician distribution network and a recurring 
      revenue stream with no reimbursement risk. As a result, Obagi enjoys 
      premium margins and cash flows.
    

      Obagi has not, however, been able to grow beyond its original success 
      with meaningful new products, nor has it adequately monetized its 
      distribution platform. Despite repeated attempts, it has stumbled in 
      efforts to develop new applications and treatments. After years of 
      discussion about potential international opportunities, non-US revenues 
      still comprise only about 16% of the Company’s net sales. And we’ve seen 
      little traction in terms of in-licensing or acquiring complementary 
      products that could be sold through Obagi’s network.
    

      Obagi has not posted double digit revenue growth since 2007, and it is 
      expected to grow only 2% for 2011. While not an abject failure, these 
      results are hardly cause for celebration given all of the time and 
      capital that has been invested in trying to grow the Company. We believe 
      the investment community broadly shares these concerns.
    

      There is no sign that the appointment of Mr. Hummel as CEO has changed 
      any of this. Perhaps owing to his experience as a “big pharma” 
      executive, Mr. Hummel initially talked about rejuvenating the Company’s 
      research pipeline. On the last quarterly call, however, he shifted the 
      Company’s strategic focus to a new plan to launch a nationwide internet 
      pharmacy. This latest idea was short on details and presumably would be 
      expensive, complex and time consuming to implement.
    

      And yet Obagi’s key strengths – its core product line, brand equity, 
      unique distribution and sound business model – are undoubtedly 
      attractive to strategic acquirers which are better positioned to 
      monetize these assets. We believe Obagi would field significant 
      strategic interest from potential buyers in the following industries: 
      pharmaceutical (aesthetic, specialty and integrated categories alike); 
      aesthetic energy (lasers); beauty and cosmetics; and health and 
      wellness. Many of these players are much larger than Obagi and would pay 
      a significant premium to control this unique property. Moreover, while 
      the strategic rationales differ by category and by individual acquirer, 
      there are significant cost and revenue synergy opportunities. Based on 
      our analysis a purchase price well in excess of Obagi’s 52-week high is 
      not only achievable but is the likely outcome in the event of a 
      transaction.
    

      Indeed, we believe that potential acquirers have recently approached 
      Obagi only to be rebuffed by the Company. In our view, the Board’s 
      fiduciary duties require it to consider in good faith any serious 
      interest in acquiring the Company, and it appears that the Board has 
      abdicated its responsibility here. The Board is so adamantly opposed to 
      a sale that it apparently ousted the previous CEO (Mr. Hummel’s 
      predecessor) over his advocacy of a sale of the Company.
    

We believe the only credible alternative for the 
      Board at this juncture is to undertake a legitimate review of the 
      Company’s strategic alternatives, with the advice of reputable legal and 
      financial advisors. If the Board truly believes that its own 
      strategic plans will create the highest value for shareholders then 
      those plans can be evaluated and quantified and compared against the 
      results of a thorough process. A competitive process will also likely 
      elicit more and better offers than those received to date, as some 
      parties (particularly larger acquirers) will only invest the time in a 
      potential transaction if it appears that a deal is a legitimate 
      possibility.
    

      * * *
    

      We are also compelled to take issue with the lax corporate governance at 
      Obagi. How can a company that derives the overwhelming majority of its 
      revenues selling pharmaceutical products to women through the physician 
      channel not have a single female or doctor on its Board? Or at least 
      someone with executive experience in beauty or cosmetics? Moreover, 
      while the Company touts its efforts to cultivate a trendier image 
      through viral marketing and social media, and talks of its plans to 
      broaden its appeal to younger consumers, the average age of the men on 
      the Board is over 60 years old.
    

      The Board’s hiring of Mr. Hummel as CEO – himself a director at the time 
      of his appointment – is also troubling. Mr. Hummel is concurrently the 
      chief executive of another company, Cobrek Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
      (“Cobrek”), based in suburban Chicago. How can the CEO of a public 
      company also be the CEO of another company in another city at the same 
      time? Moreover, since Mr. Hummel has taken over as CEO of Obagi the 
      Company has begun making payments to Cobrek for unspecified “consulting” 
      services. While the Company has previously responded to us that these 
      matters have all been disclosed in public filings, their disclosure does 
      not clear their unseemly air let alone make them appropriate actions for 
      a publicly-traded corporation.
    

      But the most glaring governance deficiency is that the management and 
      Board of Obagi own almost none of its common stock. Collectively, the 
      six members of the Board (including Mr. Hummel) own less than 1% of the 
      Company’s common stock. To our knowledge, none of the directors have 
      ever purchased a single share of Obagi stock in the open market, 
      including when it touched multi-year lows in 2009 and including when the 
      Board thought the stock was a compelling enough value that it authorized 
      the Company to repurchase shares.
    

      This lack of alignment with shareholder interests is succinctly 
      illustrated by the continued Board membership of Messrs. Fitzgibbons and 
      Bartholdson. These gentlemen are both executives of Stonington Partners 
      (“Stonington”), a leveraged buyout firm. They, along with Mr. Hummel, 
      obtained their Board seats after the acquisition of Obagi by Stonington 
      but prior to its IPO. While it is not uncommon for a financial sponsor 
      to retain board representation following an IPO if it continues to hold 
      a significant ownership position, Stonington sold all of its remaining 
      Obagi shares (primarily back to the Company) in 2010. To permit these 
      gentlemen to retain their seats after the disposition of all but a token 
      amount of their ownership suggests that their actions are primarily 
      motivated by a desire to retain the prestige and perquisites of sitting 
      on a public Board.
    

      In addition to the direct connection between Messrs. Fitzgibbons and 
      Bartholdson – who remain business partners at Stonington and have worked 
      together for many years – the Stonington reach in this boardroom extends 
      even further. All of the “independent” Obagi directors have sat together 
      on the boards of other Stonington portfolio companies. Messrs. 
      Fitzgibbons, Badie and Grant all served together on the board of Merisel 
      Inc., a Stonington investment. Messrs. Fitzgibbons and Duerden were 
      members of the Dictaphone board, another Stonington portfolio company, 
      where Mr. Duerden also served as the CEO – effectively making him a 
      Stonington employee at the time. This same group of “independent” 
      directors constituted Obagi’s Board at the time Obagi repurchased 
      Stonington’s shares in 2010.
    

      Far from being an academic exercise in good corporate housekeeping, 
      these governance failures are at the heart of what precludes serious 
      consideration of the Company’s strategic alternatives. Quite simply, the 
      Board appears to be preeminently interested in its self-perpetuation and 
      the maintenance of its insular and clubby nature. This misalignment has 
      prevented a frank assessment of the likelihood that the Company’s best 
      option to create shareholder value is to sell itself to a larger and 
      more skilled operator. We believe this explains the Board’s hostility to 
      any proposals to acquire Obagi and its ongoing efforts to entrench 
      itself through actions such as appointing one of its own in Mr. Hummel 
      as CEO and the adoption of a poison pill.
    

      Unfortunately, this list of Obagi’s governance deficiencies is not 
      exhaustive. While there are many other steps the Board should take to 
      strengthen itself, at a minimum we call upon the 
      Obagi Board to immediately remove Messrs. Fitzgibbons and Bartholdson 
      and replace them with independent directors whose ownership of common 
      stock in the Company aligns their interests with the broader Obagi 
      shareholder base.
    

      * * *
    

      Finally, we return to what prompted this letter. While the preceding 
      list of operating and governance issues had concerned us, the Company’s 
      recent adoption of a poison pill left us with no choice but to come 
      forward. The decision by this Board – with its rank governance 
      failures and misplaced priorities – at this time, while it 
      apparently refuses to even consider offers that might create meaningful 
      shareholder value – is unacceptable.
    

      It also bears repeating that Company decided to implement the Obagi 
      poison pill on December 23 – while the majority of the investing world 
      and press were already home for the holidays. It did not issue a press 
      release nor reflect it on the investor relations page of its website. It 
      chose to mail notice of this action to its shareholders on January 10, 
      2012 – just a short time before the deadline for the submission of 
      shareholder proposals and nomination of director candidates for the 2012 
      annual meeting.
    

      It is clear from the circumstances surrounding the enactment of the 
      Obagi poison pill that it is not, as Mr. Hummel claimed in his 
      transmittal letter to shareholders, designed to “guard against abusive 
      tactics to gain control of the Company” nor to prevent “unfair treatment 
      by an acquirer”. Likewise, it is disingenuous for Mr. Hummel to defend 
      the poison pill as “intended to encourage anyone seeking to control or 
      acquire the Company to negotiate with the Board”, when we believe the 
      Board steadfastly refuses to engage in such negotiations with anyone who 
      approaches it and has spurned all such overtures. In this context, the 
      adoption of the poison pill appears to be a desperate move by the Board 
      to send a signal that Obagi is not for sale at any price and to stifle 
      further acquisition interest.
    

We call upon the Board to commit irrevocably to 
      bring the poison pill to a shareholder vote at the 2012 annual 
      shareholders’ meeting, and further commit not to adopt another poison 
      pill nor institute any other anti-take-over devices if the shareholders 
      do not ratify the poison pill at that time.
    

      * * *
    

      As stated at the outset, Voce’s bias would have been to continue 
      expressing our concerns to Obagi outside of public view. However, the 
      Board’s decision to institute a poison pill at this time and in this 
      manner has convinced us that a public airing of these serious issues is 
      necessary. Furthermore, while we invite the Board’s response to what we 
      have written and would welcome the opportunity to meet to amplify our 
      concerns, our objective is to see that the three demands set forth 
      herein are immediately met.
    

      To repeat, we call for:
    


        the commencement of a review of the Company’s strategic alternatives, 
        including good faith consideration of what we believe to be strong 
        strategic interest in acquiring the Company;
      

        the complete overhaul of the Obagi Board, including the immediate 
        removal of Messrs. Fitzgibbons and Bartholdson and their replacement 
        with proper independent shareholder representation; and
      

        the Board’s irrevocable commitment that it will put the poison pill to 
        a vote at the 2012 annual meeting, and that it will adopt another 
        poison pill or any other anti-takeover device should the shareholders 
        not ratify the pill at that time.
      


      If these actions are not taken, we reserve the right to take any and all 
      steps that we believe will unlock value for Obagi’s shareholders.
    

      Respectfully yours,

Voce Capital Demands Changes at CONMED Corporation




Seeks End of Family Domination; Sees Significant Take-over 
      Interest and Value






November 04, 2013 09:15 AM Eastern Standard Time



SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Voce Capital Management LLC (“Voce”) today sent a letter to the Board of 
      Directors of CONMED Corporation (“ConMed” or the “Company”) 
      (Nasdaq:CNMD), calling for an end to the Company’s subjugation by the 
      Corasanti family and demanding that ConMed pursue strategic 
      alternatives, including a sale of the Company.
    

      The thirteen page letter follows months of detailed research by Voce 
      into ConMed’s operations and prospects, including multiple meetings with 
      the Company. Voce’s letter states that “ConMed is a strategically 
      attractive asset trapped within a dysfunctional public vehicle that will 
      never achieve its potential in current form. [S]hareholders have 
      witnessed years of sub-par operational performance, lethargic leadership 
      and missed opportunities. Serial acquisitions have obscured weak organic 
      growth and provided cover for poor execution. As a result, ConMed today 
      is an overly complex, subscale player surrounded by much larger and more 
      successful competitors.”
    

      Voce believes the multi-generational dominion over ConMed by its 
      founding family has caused this poor performance. It’s been abetted by a 
      toothless Board that has tolerated conflicts of interest and sanctioned 
      the misuse of corporate assets. Voce’s letter continues:
    

      ConMed suffers from a culture of nepotism, patronage and dystopian 
      corporate governance that would be corrosive in a closely-held 
      corporation but which is utterly corrupting in a public company. And 
      therein lies the wellspring for so many of ConMed’s failures: ConMed is 
      unquestionably family-run – the Corasanti clan members pull all 
      the strings and pamper themselves royally – yet it’s not family-owned, 
      as they hold very little of its stock.
    

      Voce notes the Corasanti family collectively owns approximately 2.3% of 
      ConMed’s equity.
    

      Voce’s letter discusses why ConMed is attractive to a wide range of 
      strategic acquirors, including large orthopedic players as well as 
      diversified med-tech companies. Based on its analysis, Voce believes 
      ConMed’s shareholders would likely receive a significant premium, 
      potentially in excess of 50% of the stock’s current value, were the 
      Board to pursue a sale of the Company with the assistance of 
      professional advisors.
    

      Voce’s letter concludes that should ConMed fail to act Voce is 
      preserving the full range of options at its disposal to protect 
      shareholder interests.

      The full text of Voce’s letter follows.
    

      November 4, 2013
    

      Members of the Board of DirectorsCONMED Corporation525 
      French RoadUtica, New York 13502
    

      Attention: General Counsel
    

      Lady and Gentlemen:
    

      Voce Capital Management LLC (“VCM”) is the investment advisor to Voce 
      Catalyst Partners LP (“VCP” and, together with VCM, “Voce”), a 
      shareholder of CONMED Corporation (“ConMed” or the “Company”).
    

      We appreciate the time management has spent with us beginning in June of 
      this year, including meetings in Utica, San Francisco and New York City. 
      This has assisted us as we’ve analyzed ConMed’s businesses, operations 
      and prospects. The conclusion of our research is that ConMed is a 
      strategically attractive asset trapped within a dysfunctional public 
      vehicle that will never achieve its potential in current form. Your 
      shareholders have witnessed years of sub-par operational performance, 
      lethargic leadership and missed opportunities. Serial acquisitions have 
      obscured weak organic growth and provided cover for poor execution. As a 
      result, ConMed today is an overly complex, subscale player surrounded by 
      much larger and more successful competitors. Its margins and returns are 
      comparatively weak and in long-term decline.
    

      Perhaps most disturbing, ConMed suffers from a culture of nepotism, 
      patronage and dystopian corporate governance that would be corrosive in 
      a closely-held corporation but which is utterly corrupting in a public 
      company. And therein lies the wellspring for so many of ConMed’s 
      failures: ConMed is unquestionably family-run – the Corasanti 
      clan members pull all the strings and pamper themselves royally – yet 
      it’s not family-owned, as they hold very little of its stock. 
      Their hegemony over ConMed could have never occurred without the docile 
      cooperation of the very fiduciaries who were elected to protect 
      shareholder interests: You, its Board of Directors.
    

      * * *
    

      Any analysis of ConMed’s corporate governance must begin with the 
      recognition that, until July of this year, its Board of Directors has 
      been inhabited exclusively by denizens of Utica, New York.1 
      Lest we receive hate mail from the Utica Chamber of Commerce, we preface 
      our comments with nothing but kind words for this fine burg of 60,000 
      souls, astride the Mohawk River in central New York. ConMed was founded 
      there in 1973 and it has remained the headquarters since.
    

      Yet the ConMed of today is far different from 40 years ago. As the CEO’s 
      statement on the website proclaims: “Beginning as a small, private 
      company manufacturing ECG monitoring electrodes, we have become a large, 
      publicly held, and diversified medical device organization … with 
      approximately 50% of the Company's revenues generated in the United 
      States and 50% from other world-wide locations.” Unfortunately ConMed’s 
      corporate governance has not kept pace with this evolution.
    

      Given the level of influence wielded by the family, one could be 
      forgiven for thinking that the Company’s name is Corasanti 
      Corporation. ConMed’s patriarch, Eugene R. Corasanti, stepped down as 
      CEO in 2006 after installing his son, Joseph J. Corasanti, Esq., as his 
      replacement. The elder Mr. Corasanti is now 83 years old yet continues 
      as Chairman of the Board, a position he’s held since inception. As 
      Chairman, he’s paid an annual retainer twice what an ordinary director 
      would receive. He simultaneously serves as the Company’s Vice 
      Chairman, pursuant to a separate employment agreement, and receives an 
      additional salary of more than $100,000 per year and equity compensation 
      which in 2012 totaled almost $150,000, for making himself “available to 
      advise the Chief Executive Officer” (i.e., his son). Isn’t that what all 
      directors are supposed to do as part of their job?
    

      But it doesn’t stop there. E. Corasanti is collecting $3.7 million of 
      deferred compensation as if he had retired in 2006, even though as a 
      current employee of the Company he’s not retired and otherwise would not 
      be entitled to receive it at this time. He also continues to enjoy “an 
      automobile allowance, club memberships and life and health insurance 
      benefits.” These benefits continue “during E. Corasanti’s life and the life 
      of his wife.” Mrs. Corasanti’s specific contributions to ConMed’s 
      success are unclear to us.
    

      Like his father, J. Corasanti has a pretty nice gig. His annual 
      compensation is approximately $2.5 million. Just like dad, he earns 
      additional payments for his Board service – despite the fact that he’s 
      also an employee. This is both inappropriate and unnecessary, given how 
      handsomely he’s already paid as CEO.2 The Company continues 
      to carry as a loan to father and son premiums paid by ConMed to purchase 
      multi-million “split-dollar” life insurance policies for their benefit. 
      In addition to the other perquisites lavished on top ConMed executives, 
      J. Corasanti also has access to special life and health insurance 
      policies and benefits for himself and his wife should she outlive him 
      (coincidentally, just like her mother-in-law). And finally, he’s 
      protected by a generous ($15mm) golden parachute. The apple, they say, 
      never falls far from the tree.
    

      ConMed’s employment practices reveal an alarming degree of nepotism and 
      cronysim. For starters, was J. Corasanti – the family scion and a former 
      attorney – really the best choice to replace E. Corasanti? One wonders 
      whether there might have been candidates from outside the Company – or 
      at least from outside the family – better suited to run a complex global 
      medical device operation such as ConMed. Apparently J. Corasanti beat 
      out at least one other candidate for the job: His brother, David 
      Corasanti, who also works at ConMed. Given ConMed’s serial acquisitions, 
      we also respectfully question whether William W. Abraham remains the 
      optimal choice to lead ConMed’s corporate and business development 
      activities – at age 82. Were Mr. Abraham to retire he’d still be able to 
      keep close tabs on ConMed, as he has two sons-in law employed by the 
      Company.
    

      And while the Company hasn’t disclosed it in its filings, we’ve learned 
      that J. Corasanti’s sister-in-law is also a member of ConMed’s senior 
      management team. Heather L. Cohen is “Executive Vice President, Human 
      Resources, Deputy General Counsel and Secretary.” In this role, she’s 
      involved in managing the personnel dynamics and conflicts of interest at 
      ConMed, including those between the Corasantis and the Company – despite 
      the fact that Ms. Cohen herself is part of the family. We fail to see 
      how she can discharge these responsibilities impartially and we 
      particularly can’t understand how ConMed believes this isn’t material 
      enough to warrant disclosure.
    

      The boundary between business and personal expenses at ConMed is quite 
      blurry. Several of the top executives are furnished with munificent 
      perquisites, such as country club memberships, automobile leases and 
      special insurance policies. There’s also a tradition of ConMed making 
      payments to related parties, such as to E. Corasanti’s brother-in-law; 
      to J. Corasanti’s father-in-law and brother-in-law; and to the law firm 
      of a former director, Robert E. Remmell, throughout his tenure on the 
      Board. Most recently, J. Corasanti used ConMed assets to promote the 
      book of his wife, Michelle Cohen Corasanti,3 including the 
      use of his staff’s time, corporate letterhead and Company email 
      accounts. Shareholders wonder where the line is drawn between the assets 
      of ConMed and the interests of the Corasanti family, or if there’s a 
      line at all.
    

      With all this incestuous behavior one might suppose Corasanti & Co. feel 
      entitled because they own most of ConMed’s equity. Yet taken together, 
      Messrs. Corasanti Senior and Junior collectively own 0.7% of ConMed’s 
      common stock. Even if credited with the various options and other 
      compensation awards they’ve granted themselves over the years, the total 
      is still only 2.3%. As for the rest of the Directors, they collectively 
      own about 0.2% (0.4% including options). In the past 10 years, only two 
      Directors have ever bought a share of stock with their own money – for a 
      grand total of 3000 shares purchased (1000 of which occurred in June of 
      this year when a new Director joined). Mr. Daniels is a case in point: 
      At age 79, he has inhabited the Board since 1992 and chairs the audit 
      committee, yet holds 3400 shares of common stock.
    

      The Board’s lack of alignment with shareholders, coddling of management 
      and toothless oversight is highly relevant to the review of ConMed’s 
      strategic positioning and financial and operational performance, which 
      we take up next in turn.
    

      * * *
    

      ConMed’s essentially a roll-up. Since inception, it has completed 24 
      acquisitions totaling more than $1 billion. In the past decade, ConMed’s 
      organic growth has been only 3% per annum and its market capitalization 
      is less than what it collectively cost to acquire these businesses. The 
      Company has had to pay increasing multiples over time to get deals done 
      as the acquisition market has grown more competitive and the number of 
      targets has declined. Its one truly successful acquisition, Linvatec, 
      occurred over 15 years ago.
    

      At the same time, ConMed has never divested anything. Units like Patient 
      Care – the legacy business on which E. Corasanti founded ConMed from his 
      kitchen table in the 1970s – appears to have more sentimental than 
      economic value, with commoditized products, negative growth and 
      operating losses. Management insists it needs to maintain the full 
      portfolio of six businesses to absorb some $17 million of corporate 
      overhead, but that simply begs the question as to whether corporate 
      overhead is too high. It also illustrates how woefully subscale ConMed’s 
      core businesses are.
    

      The sheer complexity of its empire, particularly for such a relatively 
      small firm, has proved challenging to manage. ConMed competes in six 
      different categories with five separate salesforces. This sprawling 
      enterprise has required semi-regular reshuffling, as the Company has 
      experimented with managerial, reporting and distribution models by 
      vertical, by horizontal and by geography. That’s led to frequent 
      restructuring charges and write-offs.4


      The shotgun approach has also disadvantaged ConMed competitively. 
      ConMed’s #2 or #3 in most categories and #4 in another; but it’s not #1 
      in any of its six major business lines. Within each segment, ConMed 
      competes against much larger competitors and not a single one of them, 
      despite their far greater resources, has elected to compete across more 
      than three of the verticals chosen by ConMed. The size of its 
      core businesses has limited ConMed’s ability to bundle and cross-sell, a 
      key strategy larger competitors also increasingly use to counter-act 
      shifts in healthcare spending. Its competitors invest far greater sums 
      in R&D. And, as we shall see, its lack of scale in its core businesses, 
      and mishmash of other endeavors, has impacted ConMed’s financial 
      performance.
    

      * * *
    

      ConMed’s stated financial goals are simple: The “Company's revenue 
      growth should outpace operating expense growth, thus creating margin and 
      bottomline expansion in excess of topline growth.” Central to that are 
      “our efforts to grow the topline and improve our gross margins through 
      the introduction of new products.”
    

      In the last ten years, ConMed’s organic growth has slowed considerably, 
      from high single digits early in the prior decade to essentially flat to 
      down this decade. These results significantly underperform orthopedic 
      industry leaders such as Smith & Nephew, Stryker and Zimmer. Zooming in 
      on 2013, ConMed is the only one of its peers to report negative revenue 
      growth.
    

      What’s more, ConMed has consistently overestimated its revenue growth, 
      sapping the confidence of the investment community. Starting in 2008, 
      ConMed was late recognizing and responding to the global recession and 
      way too early calling its conclusion. It reiterated wildly unrealistic 
      4Q08 and FY08 projections as late as October 23, 2008, which it 
      subsequently missed by a mile. Throughout 2009 ConMed declared the worst 
      was behind it, yet went on to fall short of its revenue guidance for FY 
      2009. In February 2010 it confidently announced “the economic effects on 
      the company had reached a welcome turning point” and in July went on to 
      say “our business is stabilizing and returning to a state of steady 
      consistent growth.” Yet ConMed missed both its 3Q10 and 4Q10 revenue 
      targets (4Q10 actually shrank 3.5% year-over-year). As a result, ConMed 
      subsequently fell short of its full year 2010 revenue guidance, then 
      missed it again in 2011…and yet again in 2012. While 2013 is not 
      formally over, it’s not too early to write its epitaph because 
      management has already lowered its full year revenue target below the 
      bottom end of its original forecast – making six straight years 
      ConMed has missed its revenue projections.
    

      These trends were on full display again with ConMed’s 3Q13 results. 
      Revenues actually declined 1.4% year on year, missing the Company’s 
      guidance as well as every analyst’s estimate, which had already been 
      progressively lowered throughout the year. ConMed cut its FY 2013 
      guidance – again – and introduced a 4Q13 revenue target the midpoint of 
      which implies revenue will fall even faster in Q4 (-1.8%) than in Q3. 
      This is particularly striking when compared to the results of the other 
      orthopedic companies who have just reported, all of which are growing 
      nicely. For example, Smith & Nephew’s sports medicine business, a direct 
      ConMed competitor, grew 7%. Each has its own mix of business but all are 
      fundamentally levered to the same reconstruction market as ConMed. 
      Analysts estimate this market is growing at approximately 5% worldwide, 
      while ConMed is shrinking. ConMed used to be satisfied keeping pace with 
      the market, but now it’s slowly but surely falling behind. Drooping 
      revenues in a rising market means only one thing: ConMed is losing 
      share.


      ConMed’s strategic disadvantages have also manifested themselves in 
      structurally inferior margins and returns on capital. Ten years ago, 
      ConMed’s operating margins were in the high teens, similar to Smith & 
      Nephew’s and Stryker’s; Zimmer’s were considerably higher then and still 
      are, near 30%. Today, ConMed’s margins have fallen to about 10% while 
      Stryker and Smith & Nephew hover in the low 20s. Consider this: Not only 
      are ConMed’s operating margins lower today than they were a 
      decade ago, despite revenues having grown by 50% during this time, but 
      its operating income dollars are also lower now.
    

      ConMed management has long boasted of its plan to reverse this trend by 
      achieving “adjusted” operating margins of 14%. Not only has it been ten 
      years since it last achieved that level (2004), but the commitment 
      itself has been an ever-moving target. In October of 2009, for example, 
      the CFO, Mr. Shallish, said, “[o]ur goal is to achieve operating margins 
      in the low- to mid-teens in approximately three to four years” (i.e., 
      2012-13). J. Corasanti peddled the same promise throughout the 2011 fall 
      conference season, saying in September: “Our profit goal for ConMed is 
      to improve our operating margins to 14%. . . . We can achieve this 
      operating profit goal in 3 or 4 years” (i.e., 2014-15). In October 2011 
      he said:
    

      [W]e’re so focused now on moving this operating margin up. We’re trying 
      to get 100 basis points a year. . . . If that operating margin moves up 
      to our target goal of 14%, we are talking about a massive increase in 
      EPS and I would expect that to translate on a very large increase in our 
      share price.
    

      On the 2Q12 earnings call, management stood firm on a 100 basis point 
      expansion in margin for 2012. But by October of 2012 they retreated, 
      forecasting only 60-70 basis points for 2012 and 50 for 2013. Despite 
      this significant setback, by May of this year J. Corasanti was back on 
      script: “So our corporate goal in terms of profitability . . . is to 
      achieve 14% operating margin, probably in the next three or four years” 
      (i.e., “probably” around 2016-17).
    

      Even more outlandish than management’s constantly shifting operating 
      targets is the embellishment of its success in increasing margins. 
      According to J. Corasanti in November 2012: “[W]e are focused on 
      increasing our operating margin. We have a stated goal of 14% and . . . 
      about 100 basis points annually and we’ve done a nice job of that 
      over the last couple of years.”
    

      Really? ConMed’s adjusted operating margin bottomed at 7.5% in 2009, in 
      part because it was so late in removing costs during the recession. 
      Management then massaged the “adjusted” operating income each year 
      thereafter by adding back all manner of items, including restructuring 
      costs every single year and either an inventory adjustment or 
      acquisition related cost in every year as well (and there were several 
      other add-backs too). Even with all of these credits, “adjusted” 
      operating margins grew from an artificially depressed 7.5% in 2009 to 
      9.0% in 2010; to 10.1% in 2011; to 10.7% in 2012 and are expected to be 
      10.9% in 2013 (excluding the medical device tax). At these levels it 
      remains very far away from the Holy Grail of 14%.
    

      Closer inspection reveals that management’s “adjustments” neglected 
      items artificially propping up the margins. First, the Company’s 
      acquisition of exclusive rights to MTF’s tissue in 2012 significantly 
      boosted margins as it’s a revenue commission with virtually no cost of 
      goods to ConMed. Second, management slashed R&D sequentially each year – 
      from 4.6% of sales in 2009 to about 3.5% in 2013. It will either 
      continue to do so to buttress margins (a trend that has alarmed the 
      investment community worried about the effects of underinvestment) or 
      reverse course and normalize R&D, becoming yet another headwind for 
      margins. If one corrects management’s “adjusted” operating margin for 
      these two items the picture looks much different, increasing a mere 150 
      basis points over four years.5


      * * *
    

      According to J. Corasanti, “one of the key points of ConMed’s corporate 
      strategy is to expand our margins through introduction of new products.” 
      The best way to evaluate this claim is to review the launch of Altrus, 
      easily the most important new product in ConMed’s history. Altrus is 
      ConMed’s entry into the $2 billion tissue sealing market, a high margin 
      category growing 7-10% per year. ConMed already has a leading position 
      in Electrosurgery, anchored by its #2 position (with a 30-35% share) in 
      tissue cutting. So the opportunity to leverage that position with the 
      same surgeon to seal the same tissue is compelling, and ConMed spent 
      millions of dollars developing Altrus for this very reason. If ConMed 
      could attain even a fraction of the penetration it has in its core 
      Electrosurgery business, Altrus would be a homerun, easily becoming 
      ConMed’s largest product.
    

      Yet for a company that prides itself on the development and 
      commercialization of important new products, Altrus has been a 
      manufacturing, regulatory and sales debacle for the better part of six 
      years. As early as April 2008, ConMed told shareholders to expect an 
      Altrus launch “later this year” and in July of 2008 predicted “a fairly 
      significant ramp of tissue sealing in 2009.” Yet by October management 
      began backpedaling, pushing the launch out until spring 2009. By the 
      next earnings call in February 2009 Altrus was further delayed until 
      3Q09. In April 2009 Altrus was “still on target for our third quarter 
      release,” but then in July it had slipped again: “[W]e’re hopeful that 
      we can get the tissue-sealing product out early next year [2010].” For 
      the first time management acknowledged it was experiencing production 
      issues with Altrus. In October 2009 management reassured shareholders it 
      had a handle on them and that it would launch by the end of 1H10, a 
      promise it reiterated on the subsequent two earnings calls.
    

      But in 2010, regulatory problems appeared. In April management disclosed 
      it had filed its 510k applications and hoped to have clearance to begin 
      selling Altrus by summer. Yet when July arrived management cited 
      unanticipated delays receiving FDA clearance, which continued to linger 
      when ConMed reported in October 2010. Although it eventually received 
      the US approval in November 2010, in July 2011 management revealed still 
      more regulatory snafus, citing delays in approvals outside of the US 
      (principally Europe and Canada).
    

      In February 2011 management guided to $5-10 million in 2011 revenues for 
      Altrus. In addition to regulatory delays, by April 2011 there were new 
      manufacturing breakdowns retarding the re-launch, causing management to 
      dial the 2011 revenue expectations down to $2-3 million. In October 
      management spoke of further glitches, specifically a muffed sales launch 
      during summer vacation schedules. It slashed the 2011 forecast yet 
      again, to $1 million, but predicted 2012 sales of $10 million. These 
      forecasts were reiterated in November and management introduced a goal 
      of 10% market share (i.e., $200 million). Altrus’s final 2011 sales: 
      “slightly less than $1 million.”
    

      In February 2012 J. Corasanti claimed “Altrus is proceeding very, very 
      well” and reiterated the $5-10 million revenue guidance. But two months 
      later management hedged again, saying the launch was “not moving as fast 
      as we thought” and blamed “continuing manufacturing difficulties” owing 
      to its “being a complicated product to produce”; all product shipping 
      ceased for several weeks. Despite reconfirming the revenue guidance at 
      that time management dropped it again in July to $4-6 million. In 
      October the salesforce reemerged as the scapegoat, as management blamed 
      poor training for fresh setbacks. It also alluded to new commercial 
      challenges, admitting “we are going to have to start now to pay 
      attention to GPO contracts,” as if that were news. It whacked revenue 
      guidance again, to $2.0-2.5 million.
    

      By February 2013, management was confidently forecasting $5-10 million 
      again in Altrus revenues. But just as in prior years, by April 2013 
      management retreated and cut its forecast once more (to $4-5 million). 
      For the first time, management cited pricing pressures on Altrus – 
      surprising indeed, given management’s long-held insistence that it could 
      displace incumbents Covidien and Johnson & Johnson with a premium-priced 
      product. ConMed stubbornly clung to pricing Altrus at $750 per tip 
      despite a widespread view that Covidien was delivering an effective 
      price (through bundling and discounts) of almost 1/2 of that on its 
      market-leading Ligasure product. We don’t take issue with management’s 
      belief in the technological superiority of Altrus but we question its 
      judgment in trying to displace a deeply entrenched competitor with a 
      product priced at such a rich premium, regardless of its efficacy.6 
      In May management conceded that Altrus has a “longer selling cycle … 
      than we expected.” By July management referred again to pricing 
      compression and, for the first time, suggested they were encountering 
      resistance from purchasing managers due to a lack of clinical 
      preference, making this simply the latest gaffe in the never-ending 
      Altrus comedy of errors.
    

      ConMed refused to provide any 2014 revenue guidance for Altrus on the 
      3Q13 call, but we estimate that Altrus’ lifetime-to-date revenues (since 
      2008) are generously about $4 million – a market penetration of at 
      most 0.1%.7

      somewhat of late, appreciating about 29.8% this year. While respectable, 
      that’s essentially in line with its peers and the index. Most 
      importantly, its revenue and earnings estimates have fallen consistently 
      throughout 2013, meaning ConMed’s valuation multiples have expanded 
      faster than its stock price. Despite its current poor fundamentals and 
      limited visibility, ConMed trades for 22x the mid-point of management’s 
      2013 earnings estimate (assuming they actually meet it).11 
      That’s near the largest premium ConMed has ever traded versus its 
      orthopedic peers, which change hands for about 17x 2013 earnings – an 
      especially wide gap in light of the fact they’re much larger, growing 
      faster and reap meaningfully higher margins. And while its peers have 
      also seen multiple expansion this year it’s been in the context of 
      revenue growth and heightened comfort with their prospects – not the 
      other way around, as with ConMed.
    

      So what explains the anomalous improvement in ConMed’s stock recently? 
      It must be viewed in the context of simmering shareholder discontent, 
      which culminated on ConMed’s 2Q13 earnings call on July 24. During Q&A, 
      one of the Company’s largest shareholders – a long time owner and highly 
      respected investor – posed the following question: “But I just wonder 
      why it’s not in the shareholders’ best interest to maybe, hire a bank 
      and see whether a strategic might surface that would rectify the 50% or 
      greater discount the company is currently bearing in the public markets 
      versus what the private markets might bear?” The collective expectation 
      of changes at ConMed has clearly buoyed the stock: ConMed was 
      underperforming before the July 24 earnings call, and has significantly 
      outperformed since, despite flubbing both 2Q13 and 3Q13:

      The market believes there’s an attractive sale option available to 
      ConMed, and that the odds of it occurring have increased; it has bid the 
      stock accordingly. We tend to agree.
    

      * * *
    

      While ConMed has chosen to remain until now a stand-alone company and to 
      manage a disparate portfolio, the rest of the industry has consolidated. 
      M&A in med-tech generally and orthopedics specifically has been on a 
      rampage, with high multiples being paid for strategic acquisitions. 
      Competitors J&J, Smith & Nephew, Stryker, Zimmer and Biomet have all 
      been active, recent acquirors in this space. Thirteen transactions, 
      totaling approximately $25 billion, have occurred within orthopedics in 
      the last 24 months alone.
    

      ConMed’s principal attraction is that it’s one of only three players 
      with a full-line of sports medicine products, an attractive growth area 
      within orthopedics. We estimate that 2/3 of ConMed’s revenues, and 3/4 
      of its EBITDA, derive from this business and that it constitutes the 
      substantial majority of the Company’s value. Almost 80% of its total 
      revenues are single-use disposables rather than capital equipment, 
      another desirable trait in this uncertain economic environment.
    

      There are many companies for whom we believe ConMed is strategically 
      attractive. Prime among them would be Zimmer, a small player in sports 
      medicine today who has identified this as a focus going forward. 
      Moreover, Zimmer actually owned ConMed’s orthopedic business (Linvatec) 
      prior to Zimmer’s spin-off from Bristol-Myers Squibb and continues to 
      serve as Linvatec’s distribution partner. It’s unclear why Bristol 
      separated the sports medicine and tools business from the implants in 
      the first place, but it’s well-known that Zimmer now believes it needs 
      its own line of power tools and procedure-specific instruments – which 
      happen to be one of ConMed’s strengths. Or consider Stryker, where 
      ConMed would nicely fill out its arthroscopy offerings. Stryker is an 
      aggressive acquiror that recently paid $1.5 billion to buy Mako Surgical 
      and $750 million to purchase Trauson. While there is some product 
      overlap in power tools, each is stronger in different parts of the 
      world. Smith & Nephew, on the other hand, has a strong arthroscopy 
      franchise but lacks the depth in power tools offered by ConMed. Then 
      there’s Biomet, a $3 billion private company backed by top private 
      equity firms, which has a number of holes in arthroscopy; ConMed’s 
      shoulder restoration system, for example, would be of particular value 
      to it. Privately-held Arthrex, reportedly larger than ConMed, is another 
      possibility.
    

      J&J, the world’s largest orthopedics business, is also intriguing. 
      ConMed would not only complement the DePuy Synthes businesses, but J&J 
      would also be interested in ConMed’s general surgery units given its 
      strengths in those areas too. Similarly, Covidien competes in 
      Endosurgery, Electrosurgery and Patient Care; Covidien would certainly 
      not want to see Altrus fall into the hands of a more capable rival. 
      Diversified players such as Bard, Boston Scientific, Danaher, Medtronic, 
      Teleflex and 3M, to name just a few, are all serial acquirers and could 
      be buyers of ConMed as they compete in one or more of its segments. 
      Several of these companies have approached ConMed but been turned away.
    

      Transaction multiples within orthopedics vary but it’s hard to find any 
      less than double digit multiples of forward EBITDA (typically between 
      10-14x). Such valuations are well supported by the synergies observed in 
      these strategic transactions, with efficiencies across the entire income 
      statement. The midpoint would imply a $55 price for ConMed, a 50% 
      premium to its current trading range. And given their relative size, 
      every one of these potential acquirors could buy ConMed for cash and 
      realize EPS accretion (in most cases, materially so) in the first year. 
      Based on previous transactions, cost synergies alone could exceed $100 
      million.12 That implies that an acquisition of ConMed at a 
      headline multiple of 12x EBITDA is really more like 7x – easily do-able 
      and a win-win for all involved.
    

      * * *
    

      On the most recent earnings call, J. Corasanti conceded that the 
      Company’s results and guidance are “disappointing to me and the entire 
      senior management team at ConMed.” ConMed’s shareholders are more than 
      just disappointed. With significant value embedded in the 
      business, and a white hot transaction market, a sale of ConMed could 
      fetch a king’s ransom. Why does ConMed refuse to even consider this 
      possibility? Perhaps one clue to its motivations is that, despite its 
      history of empire building through acquisitions, ConMed has never 
      divested a single asset. Perhaps another is a perception held by some 
      acquirers that dynastic family control stands as a moat around ConMed, 
      impeding its capture. A sale would indeed mark the end of the Corasanti 
      reign, but it would unlock tremendous value for the true owners of 
      ConMed’s realm, its shareholders. The time has come for the Corasanti 
      family to abdicate the ConMed throne, and the commencement of a proper 
      process to find a suitor for ConMed would be the right first step in 
      that direction.
    

      Make no mistake: Should you fail to act, we are preserving the full 
      range of options at our disposal to protect shareholder interests.
    

      Respectfully yours,

          Managing Partner
        







           
        



1 ConMed added two new directors at the end of July, 
      immediately following this year’s annual meeting.
    

2 Not a single company identified in ConMed’s proxy as a peer 
      for compensation purposes pays its CEO a separate fee for serving as a 
      director.
    

3 The Almond Tree (Garnet Publishing 2012), a 
      self-described “uplifting read, which respectfully travels a 
      controversial history and delivers an enriching experience that is a 
      testament to the human spirit and a hope for peace.”
    

4 ConMed has recently reorganized again by combining its two 
      weakest businesses, Patient Care and Endoscopic Technologies, with the 
      Electrosurgery and Endosurgery lines. This will cloak the poor results 
      of the laggard businesses and make it more difficult for investors to 
      analyze ConMed.
    

5 It’s worth noting a string of other cavalier predictions 
      ConMed has made along the way. For example, while everyone in the 
      industry long-ago braced for the impact of the medical device tax, J. 
      Corasanti dismissed this looming hit, blithely claiming for several 
      quarters ConMed would simply pass it along to customers by raising 
      prices or tacking it onto the invoice – preposterous in this 
      environment. Yet by the 3Q12 call, ConMed had changed its tune and began 
      blaming its failures on “headwinds driven principally by the medical 
      device tax.” By April 2013, J. Corasanti claimed the “impact of the 
      medical device tax . . . were headwinds we expected,” as if he 
      had seen it coming all along.
    

6 Similarly, ConMed priced itself out of the Sequent 
      opportunity, eventually conceding that Sequent’s modest success relative 
      to its initial lofty expectations was due to customer belief that it was 
      too expensive.
    

7 While Altrus is by far ConMed’s biggest missed opportunity, 
      there are plenty of others. After several years of empty promises and an 
      estimated $20 million of investment (including an acquisition), 
      management recently gave up the ghost on ECOM, another ballyhooed new 
      product with huge potential but whose revenues never exceeded $100,000. 
      Management has also acknowledged that part of the culprit for its 
      falling capital equipment sales is that it’s over a year late in 
      bringing its next-generation 2D video product to market. ConMed only 
      launched four new products in 2013.
    

8 Smith & Nephew, Stryker and Zimmer.
    

9 ConMed’s proxy identifies the following peers: Cooper 
      Companies; GenProbe; Greatbatch; Haemonetics; IDEXX; Integra 
      LifeSciences; Masimo; Orthofix; ResMed; Sirona Dental Systems; Steris; 
      West Pharmaceutical; Wright Medical; and Zoll Medical. We leave for 
      another time discussion of whether this is an appropriate sample set.
    

10 Two of the fourteen peers ConMed identifies in its proxy 
      have been acquired within the past year and almost 40% (10/26) have been 
      bought since ConMed started disclosing peers in 2007. This reveals a 
      survivor bias in the remaining comparisons – the acquired companies (and 
      take-out premiums) are all excluded, making the bar easier for ConMed to 
      clear – but it also illustrates the surging consolidation wave that 
      ConMed continues to miss.
    

11 This includes the impact of the medical device tax, which 
      ConMed excludes from its adjusted EPS, despite the fact that none of its 
      peers do.
    

12 This says nothing of the potential value that could be 
      created from Altrus and other inchoate ConMed opportunities in the hands 
      of a more skillful operator.

Intevac Confirms Receipt Of Director Nominations From Voce Catalyst Partners






Business Wire




Mar 18, 2014 12:34 PM EDT













 




























































  Intevac, Inc. (NASDAQ: IVAC) today confirmed that on December 4, 2013, Voce Catalyst Partners LP (“VCP”), which is affiliated with Voce Capital LLC and Voce Capital Management LLC (together with VCP, “Voce Capital”), that has disclosed beneficial ownership of approximately 0.49% of the outstanding shares of Intevac, submitted to the Company a notice of nomination of three director candidates for election to the Company’s Board of Directors at the 2014 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Intevac stockholders are not required to take any action at this time.  The Company issued the following statement:  Our Board of Directors and management team are committed to creating value for all stockholders, and we will continue to take the actions that we believe will enable us to achieve this objective. Intevac welcomes open communications with stockholders and values their input.  Importantly, on December 10, 2013, Intevac appointed Matthew Drapkin to the Board. Mr. Drapkin is a founding partner of Becker Drapkin Management, a Dallas-based investment firm that beneficially owns approximately 4.5% of Intevac’s outstanding common stock and is one of Intevac’s largest stockholders. Mr. Drapkin brings to the Board important experience as a public company director, a wealth of financial knowledge and the perspective of a major stockholder. With the addition of Mr. Drapkin, Intevac’s Board comprises eight highly qualified directors, six of whom are independent, two of whom joined the Board in the past year and four of whom joined the Board in the past four years. The Intevac Board is active and engaged and our directors possess skills and experience across a wide range of disciplines and industries that are critical to Intevac’s business.  We believe Intevac is well-positioned to build long-term stockholder value. Intevac has an innovative product portfolio and a strong balance sheet and recently commenced a $30 million share repurchase program. Intevac has the right strategies in place to drive growth in our existing markets and to apply our core technical capabilities in attractive new markets. The Board and management team continue to execute on Intevac’s strategic initiatives, and we are confident that the right strategies are in place to drive sustainable growth and enhance value for all stockholders.
