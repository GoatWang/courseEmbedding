COMMINGLED MULTI-MANAGER PROGRAMS
Capturing the unique characteristics of hedge fund investing, Optima seeks to construct multi-manager hedge fund programs designed to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns with significant downside protection and low correlation to equity and fixed income markets.  Key to the process is: 1) robust manager due diligence, 2) selecting complementary managers considering correlations and volatilities, 3) top-down asset allocation, 4) ongoing risk management and manager monitoring.  Optima currently offers commingled funds in several strategies including:

Long/Short Equity FOFsSince 1988


Global Macro FOFsSince 1991


Multi-Strategy FOFsSince 1999




CUSTOMIZED MULTI-MANAGER PROGRAMS
Since 1991, Optima has been designing and implementing customized multi-manager programs tailored to the specific objectives and constraints of our larger institutional clients. Optima currently manages dedicated long/short equity, discretionary macro, CTA/tactical trading, and multi-strategy programs on behalf of our institutional clients. 

SINGLE MANAGER PROGRAMS
Optima has partnered in sub-advisory relationships with several world-class hedge fund managers who we believe each offer a distinctive and unique investment expertise along with strong track records and outstanding manager pedigree.  Optima serves as sponsor, and provides legal, administrative, risk management, reporting, proprietary technology and marketing support. These  partnerships allow each manager to leverage Optima’s global distribution channels. 







                "We add value on so many levels - our experience ... our knowledge ... the products we offer. Every one at Optima
                is intensely proud of the company we have built." D. Dixon Boardman, Founder and CEO

INTRODUCTION
Optima Fund Management was founded by D. Dixon Boardman, Managing Member and Chief Executive Officer, to focus on investments which would generate attractive risk-adjusted returns while providing significant downside protection. Today, the Firm offers both commingled and custom tailored separate account hedge fund of funds programs across a variety of strategies. Optima also has a single manager hedge fund program. The hedge funds in this program were selected by Optima based on Optima's assessment of their strong track record and outstanding manager pedigree.

Founded in 1988, making Optima one of the oldest independent alternative asset management firms. 
Client base is 70% institutional / 30% high net worth with 900 clients across 20 countries. 
Optima Fund Management LLC has been an SEC Registered Investment Advisor since 1993 and Optima Fund Management Limited Partnership has been an SEC Registered Investment Advisor since 2004. 
Since 2000, Optima has had a strategic alliance with BNY Mellon Wealth Management and Mellon Financial Corp., which holds a 17% interest in the Firm. 

PHILOSOPHY 
Since inception, Optima has been committed to the quality and integrity of its investment programs, operations and client service. This is not just our business strategy; it is the standard against which we measure everything we do. This includes Optima's belief that of the thousands of hedge funds that exist today, at most 10% are worthy of review and perhaps only half of that number are worthy of serious consideration. 

Optima differentiates itself from other fund of hedge funds based on strong qualitative and quantitative research aspects of the due diligence process as well as a special focus on operational and portfolio risk management. 
Optima strives to invest with those that it views as the "best and the brightest" talent in the hedge fund industry. 
Optima is responsive to specific mandates and can customize portfolios to meet investor goals and guidelines. 



D. Dixon Boardman








                “We spend considerable time getting to know each of our clients. A deep understanding of their unique goals and requirements forms the foundation of our customized programs.” 
                Christopher J. Heath, Managing Director

OPTIMA PORTFOLIO EVALUATION RESEARCH & ACCOUNTING SYSTEM (OPERAS) 
Optima’s entire investment process is supported by a proprietary IT platform which was developed by an internal IT team.  The IT platform provides robust and consistent data processing and management, but is also flexible enough to accommodate new functionality and dimensions as necessary.  Functional areas include:

 Manager due diligence and portfolio management 
 Accounting and back office operations 
 Risk management analytics and monitoring 
 Internal reporting 
 Client reporting 
 Specialized analytical procedures 


The Optima IT team first began implementation of the Optima Portfolio Evaluation Research & Accounting System (“OPERAS”) in 2004.  The platform makes our business more scalable as well as providing increased quantitative and qualitative value to the Firm’s research process. All research, both data- and document-based, is stored in OPERAS and provides the Research team with a solid platform on which to run various analytical programs. 
Additionally, with the capability to run a wide variety of risk scenarios, OPERAS enables the investment, operations and risks teams to holistically evaluate all aspects of a fund and the risks associated with its investments. 










                “We’ve worked diligently to develop a secure, transparent, and user-friendly technological platform in order to
                help our clients make informed investment decisions.” Arnold Rozenvasser, Director

MORE THAN TWO DECADES OF EXCELLENCE
Optima has been on the cutting edge of developments in the hedge fund industry ever since the launch of its first fund of funds in 1988.  While there has been a tremendous proliferation of hedge funds and fund of funds since that time, few can offer the depth and breadth of experience that Optima has.
Today, the firm consists of a sophisticated team of professionals with expertise in all aspects of designing, structuring, marketing, and managing effective hedge fund investment programs.
PRESERVING AND GROWING CAPITAL
Since inception, Optima has maintained an unswerving dedication to earning its clients’ trust and meeting the demands of one paramount objective:


To overcome volatile markets and unpredictable economic and political developments by preserving 			and 	growing capital over time.

RIGOROUS RISK MANAGEMENT
Vigilance is an essential component of preserving and growing capital.  Optima devotes substantial effort to actively manage and monitor asset allocations, not only through the qualitative process of ongoing dialogue with managers, but also by utilizing rigorous quantitative measures.
Risk management is handled by a team of portfolio risk and operational risk professionals who are independent of the research team.








                “The most rewarding aspect of what we do is developing strong, long-term relationships with our clients. At the
                end of the day, that is how we define our success.” Geoffrey Lewis, Managing Director and CFO

DISCIPLINED INVESTMENT PROCESS
The investment process for our multi-manager portfolios is rigorous, disciplined and consistent.  It combines a top-down macro-economic view with bottom-up fundamental research performed by the investment and operations teams – all of which is supported by the Firm’s proprietary manager analysis and research system, OPERAS.  Optima’s four-step investment process includes:
Macro/Asset Allocation
is the product of our Investment Outlook which is based on the analysis of macro-economic data and other factors that impact the major geographic regions and hedge fund strategies in which we invest. Key data inputs are formally reviewed by the Research Department on a quarterly basis, resulting in a baseline outlook and asset allocations are then adjusted as appropriate.
Manager Selection is conducted through a systematic three-stage process which incorporates both qualitative and quantitative analyses.  Prior to funding any manager, a detailed investment book, based upon the findings of the due diligence process, is finalized, bound and signed  by the CIO, CFO/Chief Operations Risk Officer,  Chief Portfolio Risk Officer and General Counsel. 
Portfolio Construction
similarly integrates both qualitative and quantitative elements in constructing portfolios from Optima’s list of managers approved for investment.   An investment is made and sized based on factors including correlations, liquidity, exposures, and diversification. 
Risk Management efforts are forward looking and aim to identify problems early enough to take pre-emptive action before substantial losses are incurred. The team is divided between specialists in portfolio risk and operational risk.  The evaluation of risk is central to determining whether a manager is approved for investment and the risk team has the right to
veto any manager unable to meet Optima’s strict standards.
 





                “We evaluate numerous managers, across a broad spectrum of strategies. Only those we deem ‘best-in-class’
                qualify for our single-manager funds.” Michael Spelman, Managing Director

About Optima Fund Management LP


Since inception, Optima has been committed to the quality and integrity of its investment programs, operations and client service. This is not just our business strategy; it is the standard against which we measure everything we do. This includes Optima's belief that of the thousands of hedge funds that exist today, at most 10% are worthy of review and perhaps only half of that number are worthy of serious consideration.

Optima differentiates itself from other fund of hedge funds based on strong qualitative and quantitative research aspects of the due diligence process as well as a special focus on operational and portfolio risk management.
Optima strives to invest with those that it views as the "best and the brightest" talent in the hedge fund industry.
Optima is responsive to specific mandates and can customize portfolios to meet investor goals and guidelines.
