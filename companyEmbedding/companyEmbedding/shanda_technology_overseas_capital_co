Amendment No. 2 to Schedule 13D (this “Amendment No. 2”) relates to the Common Stock, par value $0.01 per
share (the “Common Stock”), of Legg Mason, Inc., a Maryland corporation (the “Issuer”)
and amends the Schedule 13D filed on April 21, 2016 (the “Original Schedule 13D”), as amended by Amendment
No. 1 to the Original Schedule 13D filed on July 7, 2016 (“Amendment No. 1”, and, together with the
Original Schedule 13D and this Amendment No. 2, the “Schedule 13D”).   This
Amendment No. 2 is being filed to amend Item 2, Item 4, Item 5, Item 6 and Item 7 of the Schedule 13D as follows:   Item
2. Identity and Background   Shanda
Asset Management Investment Limited (formerly known as Shanda Payment Investment Limited) shall also be known as the “Investor”.   Item
4. Purpose of Transaction   The
following paragraph shall be added to Item 4 of the Schedule 13D:   On
December 19, 2016, the Issuer and the Investor entered into an Investor Rights
and Standstill Agreement (the “Investor Rights and Standstill Agreement”) under which the Issuer confirms that
its Board of Directors (the “Board”) has agreed to expand the size of the Board from 11 to 13 directors and
to elect Mr. Chen, Chairman and CEO of Shanda Investment Group Limited (“Shanda Group”) and Robert Chiu, President
of Shanda Group, as directors on or before June 1, 2017, with terms expiring at the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Pursuant
to the Investor Rights and Standstill Agreement, Mr. Chen will be appointed as Vice Chairman when he joins the Board.   The
Issuer also agrees to appoint an Investor nominee as a member of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, subject to
satisfying applicable independence requirements under applicable law or listing rules. The Investor has the right to nominate
a non-voting observer to the Board at any time it does not have two director designees sitting on the Board.   If
the Investor and its affiliates (the “Investor Parties”) do not beneficially own for a period of 30 consecutive
trading days shares of the Common Stock equal to at least 10.0% of the outstanding shares of the Common Stock (the “10%
Minimum Percentage”), the obligations of the Issuer with respect to the appointment of a second director, the appointment
of Mr. Chen as Vice Chairman of the Board and the appointment of an Investor nominee as a member of the Issuer’s Nominating
and Corporate Governance Committee or any other committee of the Board will terminate. If the Investor Parties do not beneficially
own for a period of 30 consecutive trading days shares of the Common Stock equal to at least 5.0% of the outstanding shares of
Common Stock (the “5% Minimum Percentage”), the obligations of the Issuer under the Investor Rights and Standstill
Agreement with respect to the appointment to the Board of both Investor nominees will terminate. If the Investor Parties’
ownership drop below the 10.0% or 5.0% threshold, the Investor director is not required to resign, but, the Board will no longer
be obligated to nominate the Investor director for re-election.   The
agreement further provides that if (i) the Issuer becomes a party to a strategic transaction wherein the membership of
the board of directors of a publicly listed successor entity is split between the directors of the Issuer and the directors
of the other party to such transaction and (ii) the directors of the Issuer (including the Investor directors) immediately
prior to the effectiveness of such strategic transaction do not represent 75% or more of such surviving entity’s board
of directors, then the obligations of the Issuer under the agreement with respect to (x) appointment of an Investor nominee
to a second Board seat , (y) appointment of Mr. Chen as Vice Chairman of the Board and (z) appointment of an Investor nominee
as a member of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee or any other committee of the Board shall terminate. For
the avoidance of doubt, upon the occurrence of the events described in this paragraph, the Investor director(s) whom the
Issuer is no longer obligated to appoint to the Board, the Vice Chairman of the Board or the Issuer’s Nominating and
Corporate Governance Committee, as the case may be, shall not be required to resign from the Board or such committee unless
required pursuant to the terms of the strategic transaction.   Under
the Investor Rights and Standstill Agreement, the Investor Parties have agreed to invest $500 million on a cumulative basis in
investment products managed or advised by the Issuer’s investment affiliates (other than liquidity products). If the Investor
Parties do not invest at least $350 million prior to July 31, 2017, the obligations of
the Issuer will terminate with respect to the appointment of a second Investor nominee to the Board. If the Investor Parties do
not invest at least $500 million on or prior to October 31, 2018, the obligations of the Issuer with respect to the appointment
of a second Investor nominee to the Board, the appointment of Mr. Chen as Vice Chairman of the Board and the appointment of an
Investor nominee to the Issuer’s Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee or any other committee of the Board will
terminate. For the avoidance of doubt, in such event the Investor director(s) whom the Issuer is no longer obligated to appoint to
the Board, the Vice Chairman of the Board or the Issuer’s Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, as the case
may be, shall not be required to resign from the Board or such committee prior to the expiration of the term he or she is
then serving.   The
Investor Rights and Standstill Agreement also contemplates additional purchases of the Common Stock by the Investor Parties to
increase their investment up to 15.0%. The Investor also agrees, among other things and subject to certain limitations, that for
a period of three years from the effective date of the Investor Rights and Standstill Agreement, it will support the Board's full
list of nominees at the Issuer’s annual meetings, will not make acquisitions that result in the Investor Parties owning
more than 15.0% of the outstanding shares of the Common Stock and will not take certain other specified actions. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Investor Parties’ ownership could exceed 15.0% as a result of actions taken by the Issuer including share
repurchases.   Under
the Investor Rights and Standstill Agreement, the Investor also agreed to contribute at least $2.5 million in the Legg Mason Charitable
Foundation by no later than the three month anniversary of the date of the Investor Rights and Standstill Agreement.   Under
a separate agreement (the “Registration Rights Agreement”), the Investor was granted certain registration rights
for the resale of shares of the Common Stock.   The
foregoing descriptions of the Investor Rights and Standstill Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement do not purport to
be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Investor Rights and Standstill Agreement and the Registration
Rights Agreement, which are filed as Exhibits 3 and 4, respectively, to this Schedule 13D and are incorporated herein by reference.   Item

Such purchase price was funded through internally generated funds of the affiliates of Shanda Group.
                       The 3,383 shares of Common Stock directly beneficially owned Mr. Chen were granted to him in his capacity as a director of the Issuer pursuant to and under the conditions of the Issuer’s Non-Employee Director Equity Plan, as amended.  Item 4. Purpose of Transaction.  The following paragraph shall be added to the end of Item 4 of the Schedule 13D:                                 The Reporting Persons continue to be very supportive of the Issuer’s strategy of expanding client choice across investment strategies, product vehicles and client access, as well as its investment managers and the leadership of its management team and Board of Directors.                       In the meantime, the Reporting Persons intend to review their holdings in the Issuer on a continuing basis and, depending upon the price and availability of the Issuer securities, subsequent developments affecting the Issuer, the business prospects of the Issuer, general stock market, industry and economic conditions, tax considerations and other factors deemed relevant, may consider increasing or decreasing their investment in the Issuer or entering into hedging, derivative or other transactions with respect to the Common Stock or other securities of the Issuer.  As part of this ongoing review, the Reporting Persons may seek to engage in discussions with the Board of Directors of the Issuer, the management and/or other stockholders of the Issuer concerning the business, operations, corporate governance or future plans of the Issuer, may engage legal and financial advisors to assist them in such review, and may evaluate strategic alternatives that may become available in the future.

The foregoing percentage is calculated based on 95,871,683 shares of Common Stock outstanding as of May 25, 2017.

This Amendment No. 4 to Schedule 13D (this “Amendment No. 4”) relates to the Common Stock, par value $0.10 per share (the “Common Stock”), of Legg Mason, Inc., a Maryland corporation (the “Issuer”) and amends the Schedule 13D filed on April 21, 2016 (the “Original Schedule 13D”), as amended by Amendment No. 1 to the Original Schedule 13D filed on July 7, 2016 (“Amendment No.1”), Amendment No. 2 to the Original Schedule 13D filed on December 20, 2016 (“Amendment No. 2”) and Amendment No. 3 to the Original Schedule 13D filed on February 1, 2017 (“Amendment No. 3”, and, collectively with the Original Schedule 13D, Amendment No. 1, Amendment No.2 and this Amendment No. 4, the “Schedule 13D”).


This Amendment No. 4 is being filed to amend Item 3, Item 4 and Item 5 of the Schedule 13D as follows:


Item 3. Source and Amount of Funds or Other Consideration


Item 3 of the Schedule 13D is amended and restated to read as follows:
               
The aggregate purchase price for 5,567,653 shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the Reporting Persons was $151,319,692, inclusive of commissions paid and other transaction costs and less the premium received for certain put options sold by the Investor relating to the Common Stock. Such purchase price was funded through internally generated funds of the affiliates of Shanda Group.
                      
The 3,383 shares of Common Stock directly beneficially owned Mr. Chen were granted to him in his capacity as a director of the Issuer pursuant to and under the conditions of the Issuer’s Non-Employee Director Equity Plan, as amended.


Item 4. Purpose of Transaction.


The following paragraph shall be added to the end of Item 4 of the Schedule 13D:
                              

The Reporting Persons continue to be very supportive of the Issuer’s strategy of expanding client choice across investment strategies, product vehicles and client access, as well as its investment managers and the leadership of its management team and Board of Directors.

                    

In the meantime, the Reporting Persons intend to review their holdings in the Issuer on a continuing basis and, depending upon the price and availability of the Issuer securities, subsequent developments affecting the Issuer, the business prospects of the Issuer, general stock market, industry and economic conditions, tax considerations and other factors deemed relevant, may consider increasing or decreasing their investment in the Issuer or entering into hedging, derivative or other transactions with respect to the Common Stock or other securities of the Issuer.  As part of this ongoing review, the Reporting Persons may seek to engage in discussions with the Board of Directors of the Issuer, the management and/or other stockholders of the Issuer concerning the business, operations, corporate governance or future plans of the Issuer, may engage legal and financial advisors to assist them in such review, and may evaluate strategic alternatives that may become available in the future.


Item 5. Interest in Securities of the Issuer.


Item 5 of the Schedule 13D is amended and restated to read as follows:


 

-7-




 
The information set forth in Items 2, 3 and 4 herein is incorporated herein by reference.


(a) – (b)


The Investor holds 5,567,653 shares of Common Stock, representing approximately 5.8% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Issuer. Mr. Chen may be deemed to directly beneficially own an additional 3,383 shares of Common Stock, representing less than 1% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Issuer. The foregoing percentage is calculated based on 95,871,683 shares of Common Stock outstanding as of May 25, 2017.


Mr. Chen, through his ownership of Shanda Media Limited, may be deemed to share voting and dispositive power over the shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by Shanda Media Limited. Shanda Media Limited, through its ownership of Shanda Investment Group Limited (formerly known as Premium Lead Company Limited), may be deemed to share voting and dispositive power over the shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by Shanda Investment Group Limited. Shanda Investment Group Limited, through its ownership of Shanda Technology Overseas Capital Company Limited, may be deemed to share voting and dispositive power over the shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by Shanda Technology Overseas Capital Company Limited. Shanda Technology Overseas Capital Company Limited, through its ownership of the Investor, may be deemed to share voting and dispositive power over the shares of Common Stock directly held by the Investor.


Mr. Chen has the sole power to vote and dispose of the shares of Common Stock directly beneficially owned by him.


Except as set forth in Item 5(a), none of the Reporting Persons, and, to the best of their knowledge, any persons named in Schedule A hereto owns beneficially any Common Stock of the Issuer.


(c)  On June 28, 2017, Shanda Asset Management Investment Limited sold 4,232,500 shares of Common Stock at a price of $38.43 per share in a private sale. No commissions were charged in connection with this sale of Common Stock.  There were no other transactions by the Reporting Persons during the past 60 days.


(d)       Inapplicable.


(e)       Inapplicable.
