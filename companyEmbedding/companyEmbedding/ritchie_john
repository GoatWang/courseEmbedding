                "Preach the Word" was the admonition that Paul gave to the young preacher, Timothy. What was so essential 2000 years ago is still necessary today. To "preach the Word" is to expound the Scripture truths with clarity and conviction. The John Ritchie Sermon Ouline Series brings out truths that change lives and minister to present needs. These aids are not intended to diminish a personal, prayerful study of the Bible. Rather, they will encourage it by offering inspiring insights to those who preach or teach God's truths. The busy preacher or lay person will find helpful and stimulating ideas for a dynamic preaching or teaching ministry in these sermon outlines.
                - Publisher
            
                Born out of an evangelistic zeal, these books include material from a great variety of sources gathered throughout a ministry lasting forty years.

Previews


"Preach the Word" was the admonition that Paul gave to the young preacher, Timothy, almost two thousand years ago. What was so essential then is still necessary today. For more than six generations, the John Ritchie Sermon Outline Series has illuminated Scripture, and it continues to bring out truths that change lives and minister to people today. These aids are not intended to diminish a personal, prayerful study of the Bible. Rather, they will encourage study by offering inspiring insights to those who preach and teach God's truths. The busy preacher or layperson will find helpful and stimulating ideas for a dynamic preaching and teaching ministry in these sermon outlines. John Ritchie (1853-1930) was a Bible teacher in Scotland, Wales, and England. His dynamic preaching was characterized by simple diction, scriptural integrity, timely illustrations, and flashes of humor. Ritchie authored more than two hundred books, among them Feasts of Jehovah, From Egypt to Canaan, and Tabernacle in the Wilderness.

            This is a great little sermon outline book for preachers, both novice and seasoned.  Outlines are brief with much alliteration.
