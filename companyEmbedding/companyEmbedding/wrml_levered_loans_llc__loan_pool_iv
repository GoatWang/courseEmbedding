Multi-Strategy Credit



Capital Under Management

Vehicles
Funds, SMAs



OHA believes that an active, opportunistic strategy investing across a range of asset classes can maximize risk-adjusted returns and capture changing relative value through market cycles. The firm’s multi-strategy portfolios seek to accomplish this by dynamically moving capital within and among the sectors offering the most compelling risk-return profiles. OHA’s integrated firm design and 20+ years of experience managing credit assets across the North American and European markets in high yield bonds, leveraged loans, distressed debt, structured products and private lending, enable us to execute on this rotational strategy. OHA provides broad based credit exposure through commingled fund offerings and customized portfolios tailored to meet clients’ liquidity and return objectives.

High Yield Bonds



Capital Under Management
$9.7 Billion


Inception
1991 


Vehicles
Funds, SMAs



OHA has been an active, value oriented investor in the high yield bond market since the firm’s inception. Utilizing an investment approach focused on generating attractive risk- adjusted total returns, as opposed to a yield-to-maturity focus, OHA has generated outperformance by both minimizing credit losses as well as through active portfolio management. In addition to seeking out investments in stronger issuers with solid credit profiles, the firm focuses on opportunities for which it believes there is a significant likelihood of a positive credit quality or rating changes, tenders, refinancings, IPOs, mergers, defaults or a change in bankruptcy status. With this approach, OHA seeks to generate attractive returns through the credit cycle by capturing upside opportunities in both up and down market environments. The firm offers exposure to the North American and European high yield markets through multi-strategy funds as well as customized portfolios.

OHA’s value-oriented research focus has allowed the firm to generate attractive, risk adjusted returns through various market cycles. Additionally, the firm leverages OHA’s significant distressed investment expertise, which it believes has the potential to meaningfully enhance clients’ returns in more challenging investment environments.

Stressed / Distressed



Capital Under Management
$4.9 Billion

1991 


Vehicles
Funds, SMAs



Across both North American and European markets, OHA has a long history of successfully investing in a broad range of distressed investments, from traditional distressed leveraged loans and high yield bonds, to rescue financing and turnaround opportunities, to opportunistic private equity investments. While OHA has the ability and experience to take a control, influence or trading role in its distressed investments, the firm generally seeks to take an active role in the outcome of its investments. This involves influencing investment outcomes through a variety of means including: (i) negotiating transaction terms in a restructuring process; (ii) acquiring a seat on the Board of Directors; (iii) playing a role in board member selection; (iv) leading / underwriting an equity rights offering; (v) influencing terms and meaningfully participating in exit financings; and (vi) joining or creating ad hoc creditors’ committees. OHA offers exposure to distressed investments through dedicated and multi-strategy funds, as well as, customized portfolios.

OHA-Sponsored CLOS
$8.6 Billion


Third Party CLOS
$2.0 Billion


Inception
2001 


Vehicles
CLOs, Funds, SMAs



OHA is a leading participant in the Collateralized Loan Obligations (“CLO”) market both as a sponsor/manager of CLOs as well as an investor in the debt and subordinated tranches of third party managers’ CLOs. As one of the earliest participants in the CLO market, OHA has successfully sponsored and managed multiple CLOs in both North America and Europe totaling $13.4 billion of issuance since 2001. Since 2008, OHA has been an active investor in third-party CLOs, seeking to opportunistically identify attractive relative and absolute value by leveraging the firm’s proprietary analytical capabilities. Both aspects of OHA’s CLO platform benefit from an integrated approach utilizing a team of specialists from four distinct areas of expertise including Loan Portfolio Management / Research, CLO Structuring, Credit Work-out / Distressed Investments and Compliance / Administration. Investors may participate in the firm’s CLO strategies through both direct investments into OHA-managed CLOs as well as funds and customized portfolios investing in diversified portfolios of CLO tranches.

RMBS and Whole Loans



Capital Under Management
$2.2 Billion


Inception
2008 


Vehicles
Funds, SMAs



OHA developed its residential mortgage capabilities in 2008, taking a deep value, fundamental approach to investing in mortgage related assets. A key component of OHA’s residential mortgage investment strategy, in both securitized investments (principally non-agency RMBS) and whole loans (including non-performing loans “NPL”, re-performing loans “RPL” and other newly originated loans), is to use the firm’s comprehensive, proprietary database and analytics infrastructure to establish an informed valuation opinion on nearly every single family property in the U.S. OHA uses this information to identify principal value drivers including: (i) the value of the properties collateralizing an RMBS bond or a pool of whole loans and (ii) the credit characteristics and expected behavioral patterns of the mortgage borrowers. OHA invests across the spectrum of non-agency mortgage risk from distressed investments to investment grade investments. OHA offers participation in its mortgage-related strategies through multi-strategy and dedicated funds and customized portfolios.

Private Lending



Transaction Experience
$4.2 Billion


Inception
2002 


Vehicles
Funds, SMAs, OHAI



OHA has substantial experience in private lending, having invested over $4.2 B in 130 private lending investments. Employing an opportunistic, credit-driven approach, OHA looks for investment opportunities up and down the capital structure of companies in North America and Europe, typically targeting middle market companies or issuers for whom the syndicated markets do not provide a good fit. The firm sources select directly originated transactions from financial sponsors, company relationships and other sources, and has sought to position itself as a value- added partner in club transactions. OHA believes its industry-focused investment research teams and broad experience in the below investment grade credit markets position it well to execute private transactions and provide creative solutions to its borrower relationships. Participation in OHA-managed private lending strategies are available through certain funds, customized portfolios or via an investment in OHA Investment Corporation (NASDAQ: OHAI), a publically traded BDC.

It was a totally gratifying experience working with Lyon Financial on our pool loan. I am actually writing this review while sitting on my brand new pool deck. The folks over at Lyon were truly professional but also human. They were in constant contact every step of the way and It felt like I was talking with friends because of their concerns that everything worked out well during and after the process. Great people and great company to work with. Thank you Lyon, you guys are great!

We had a great experience working with Lyon Financial on our new pool loan. Everyone was so friendly and knowledgeable throughout the process and they were easy to communicate with. On the day our pool was to be completed we discovered that our pool building company never sent a prior addendum, but I talked to Lyon and I was able to get everything expedited so that we could still finish that day. It has been a pleasure working with Lyon Financial.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

It was a totally gratifying experience working with Lyon Financial on our pool loan. I am actually writing this review while sitting on my brand new pool deck. The folks over at Lyon were truly professional but also human. They were in constant contact every step of the way and It felt like I was talking with friends because of their concerns that everything worked out well during and after the process. Great people and great company to work with. Thank you Lyon, you guys are great!

Alan S.






Thank you so much for making our dreams possible and getting our pool financing. A Professional Team with great follow up and customer service. Made this whole process easy and gave us a list of local builders qualified to build the custom pool and spa we were looking for Carla Barrera was awesome!

Kenneth F.






If you are looking to make your backyard your own paradise Lyon Financial is the company to call. The process is easy and the funds are there quick. Communication was great. Thank you guys for my pool loan. My backyard is my paradise. I would use them again if needed.

Ivan C.






Lyon Financial was quick with their approval process and a breeze to work with all steps of the way. Customer service sometimes is not what it use to be but everyone at LF went beyond to insure we were happy and all of our needs were met. I would highly recommend them to anyone I know.

Amanda E.






We had a great experience working with Lyon Financial on our new pool loan. Everyone was so friendly and knowledgeable throughout the process and they were easy to communicate with. On the day our pool was to be completed we discovered that our pool building company never sent a prior addendum, but I talked to Lyon and I was able to get everything expedited so that we could still finish that day. It has been a pleasure working with Lyon Financial.

Meagan M.






It’s hard to believe it could be this easy. The staff at Lyon always answered my questions right away and every step went so smooth I actually still can’t believe that it’s already done.

Mike M.






What a truly wonderful experience. I have never experienced such an amazingly easy loan process. The professionals at Lyon Financial are truly just that.
