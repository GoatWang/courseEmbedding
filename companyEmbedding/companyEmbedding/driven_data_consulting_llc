✔ CRM: We integrate with your lead and appointment data, we work with just about every provider
✔ Inventory: Historical and current inventory is sync’d, we also update multiple times per day

No More Silos100% Focus on ReportingInnovate with UsNo More Silos








By moving all of your dealership data to the cloud we remove the barriers between your providers.  You don’t have to worry if one provider integrates with another to monitor a process anymore.  Here are a few cool examples of what we can do with this:
✔ Transactional Discount: We  measure the difference between the last online price and the sold price as a percentage.
✔ Leads and Appointments on Inventory: See how many active and total leads as well as upcoming appointments on each vehicle
✔ Website Metrics: Regardless of your providers we can show you every stat on one screen even rolled up to a total or average.
✔ Attribution: We match to your leads, sales and service records automatically to your website visitors, every day.  This shows you what works across the entire customer process.


100% Focus on Reporting








We will never sell you a marketing product…because we will never build one.  We believe in order to truly be unbiased we must refrain from ever self-reporting.  You can be assured we are here to serve your organization with accurate, unfiltered, not to mention trust-worthy data!  Here are a few other key points:
✔ Focus: Unfortunately at most automotive companies reporting tends to be an after-thought, at Driven Data it’s our only thought.  We obsess on how to create new value and integrate with more data.
✔ Speed: Ever wait for a report to load? Not anymore, our application is constantly updating behind the scenes so your data is ready when you want it.
✔ Integrations: We integrate with partner companies in a number of ways from secure ftp, API, scheduled email.  We are pretty crafty and accept all challenges!
✔ Best Practices: Our team is stacked with industry reporting experts.  Our dealer partners have also contributed countless ideas and variations that have led us to this point. On day 1 after your on-boarding you and your team will see the metrics the top dealership operators in the country use every day.  We also help you understand what everything means for your stores.


Innovate with Us








Our team is on the edge of what is possible in automotive analytics today. We haven’t found another company that combines more data across as many providers in one architecture. Here are some of the ways we are innovating
✔ Forecasting: Our sales forecasting algorithm uses 5 different models and determines the correct one for the individual dealership.  It is not uncommon for it to exactly predict the monthly outcome.  Overall it is within 3.2% of actual across all dealers this year
✔ Universal Bench-marking: With data being standardized across all providers we can measure metrics across all dealerships.
✔ Operations Code Categories: We use machine learning to read through every operation code description and categorize your service repair order operation codes into their correct category.  We automate what has been ignored previously.
✔ Attribution: Our latest work on attribution is over 1.5 years in the making and combines data across the entire customer process from marketing, to when they are added to your CRM, when they purchase a vehicle and finally service a vehicle.
