      This press release contains "forward-looking statements" that involve 
      risks and uncertainties, as well as assumptions that, if they never 
      materialize or prove incorrect, could cause the results of Immersion

      technology and statements regarding our OEM business.
    

      Immersion's actual results might differ materially from those stated or 
      implied by such forward-looking statements due to risks and

      encountered in product development efforts by Immersion and its 
      licensees; adverse outcomes in any future intellectual property-related

      Immersion's technologies; and a delay in or failure to achieve the 
      acceptance of touch feedback as a critical user experience. Many of 
      these risks and uncertainties are beyond the control of Immersion.
    

      For a more detailed discussion of these factors, and other factors that 
      could cause actual results to vary materially, interested parties should 
      review the risk factors listed in Immersion's most current Form 10-Q,
