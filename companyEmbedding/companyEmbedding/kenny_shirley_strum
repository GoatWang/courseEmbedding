Dr. Shirley Strum   Kenny is the first woman and first humanist to serve as President of   Stony Brook University. After a distinguished career as a literary scholar,   teacher, and academic administrator, she came to Stony Brook as its fourth   President in 1994. Since then, she has worked to strengthen the core academic   and research operations of the University, fostered close links with business   and industry, and established new working relationships with the Long Island   community.
Concerned about the state of undergraduate education at major   research universities, Dr. Kenny headed a national initiative to address the   issue. She launched and chaired the Boyer Commission on Educating Undergraduates   in the Research University with funding from the Carnegie Foundation for the   Advancement of Teaching. The Commission's report, Reinventing   Undergraduate Education: A Blueprint for America's Research   Universities (1998), advocated a model of education that would engage   students with the resources unique to such institutions and lead them to conduct   research themselves. Stony Brook is currently reorganizing its undergraduate   curriculum along the lines recommended by the Boyer Report. 
Total enrollment at Stony Brook University has increased from   17,000 to 22,000 during Dr. Kenny's presidency; faculty numbers are up 8%. In   2003, the average SAT scores of incoming freshmen rose above 1200.
Dr. Kenny has directed major projects of construction and renewal   on the campus. The Charles B. Wang Center, celebrating Asian and Asian-American   cultures, was completed in 2002. The Center is the largest single gift ever   given to the State University of New York. An 8,300-seat stadium opened in 2002;   named in honor of New York State Senator Kenneth P. LaValle, it is the largest   such venue in Suffolk County. A facility at 401 Park Avenue South, Stony Brook   Manhattan, opened in January 2002.
The center of the campus has been remodeled around an expanded   Student Activities Center and landscaped Academic Mall. All student residence   halls were rehabilitated, in the largest such program in the nation, and several   new residential buildings added. As part of her focus on student life at the   University, Dr. Kenny encouraged the Athletics Program to advance to Division I   status in the shortest time allowed by NCAA regulations and oversaw the adoption   of the Seawolf as Stony Brook's sporting mascot.
New buildings for the Life Sciences, Humanities, and Engineering   are completed, or in progress. Sunwood, the Melville mansion lost to fire in   1987, has been rebuilt as a presidential home and venue for University   functions.
Stony Brook Hospital has begun an expansion that will include new   Heart, Cancer, and Infant Care Centers. An Ambulatory Surgery Center opened in   2001, and the Matt and Debra Cody Center for Autism and Developmental   Disabilities was completed in 2003.
The fiscal health of the University has been a priority of Dr.   Kenny's administration. Stony Brook has seen significant growth in its   independent income. The Stony Brook Foundation Endowment Fund has grown more   than threefold since 1993. In 2000, Stony Brook ranked 15th among U.S.   universities in terms of income from royalties and patents. The University's   first capital campaign will be launched in 2004.
In conjunction with Battelle Corporation, Dr. Kenny established   Brookhaven Science Associates in 1998 to administer Brookhaven National   Laboratory for the US Department of Energy. Stony Brook is the largest user of   BNL facilities.
Prior to her tenure at Stony Brook, Dr. Kenny was President of   Queens College from 1985 to 1994. There she established the Business and Liberal   Arts Program, the Journalism Program, the Asian American Center, the Louis   Armstrong House and Archives Project, the Michael Harrington Center, and the   Center for the New American Workforce.
She serves on the JPMorgan Chase Metropolitan Advisory Board, the   Board of Directors of the Goodwill Industries of Greater New York, the Long   Island Association, and the Institute for Student Achievement. She has   previously served as vice-chair of the Maryland Humanities Council, chair of the   Folger Shakespeare Library Institute Central Executive Committee, steering   committee member of the executive board of the American Society for   Eighteenth-Century Studies, board member of the American Handel Society, chair   of the Association for American Colleges and Universities (AAC&U), and board   member of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching. 
Dr. Kenny published five books and numerous articles in the field   of Restoration and eighteenth-century British drama. Her two-volume scholarly   edition of the dramatic works of George Farquhar was published by Oxford   University Press.
Dr. Kenny has taught at the University of Texas, Gallaudet   University, the Catholic University of America, the University of Delaware, and   the University of Maryland. At Maryland, she was successively Chair of the   Department of English and Provost of Arts and Humanities. Dr. Kenny holds   bachelor's degrees in English and Journalism from the University of Texas, an   M.A. from the University of Minnesota, a Ph.D. from the University of Chicago,   and honorary doctorates from the University of Rochester, and Chonnam National,   Dongguk, and Ajou Universities in Korea.
She has been honored as Outstanding Woman at the University of   Maryland, Outstanding Alumna at the University of Chicago, Outstanding Alumna of   the College of Communications at the University of Texas, and Distinguished   Alumna at the University of Texas.
Dr. Kenny is married to Dr. Robert W. Kenny. They have five   children and three grandchildren.

Florida Insurance Quotes – Shopping For Life Insurance?

Are you looking to save a few dollars a month on your next life insurance policy? What if you could saves tens to hundreds of dollars a month on your insurance policy?
 
Now, saving on any insurance policy is something that a lot of people want to do, even if they don’t immediately indicate such a thing. As important as having an insurance plan is, it’s even more important to save on your insurance when you can—especially when shopping for life insurance.
 
Thanks to the price of whole life insurance across the United States, many people often skip out on getting life insurance altogether. Although it’s considered the best option for a lot of people, dropping out of a whole life insurance policy, at the same time, you don’t have to forgo the allure of proper life insurance.
 
Universal and term life insurance can provide more inexpensive solutions to having an active life insurance policy, especially if you’re the primary income provider in your household. Life insurance is designed to protect your family in the case of your passing, so you wouldn’t want to impose heavy financial burdens on them if you suddenly became ill and/or passed.
 
Finding inexpensive life insurance is a task that’s shared by people in Florida and across the United States. There are a handful of life insurance options already on the market, and some might not even be the best options for your situation. So, what are the best options for anyone’s situation?
 
The best option in any situation simply involves looking for a plan that befits your needs. Lots of people have explained this, but it bears repeating: get an idea about how much health insurance you need and then go from there with researching your life insurance options, which can include getting quotes about your preferred policies.
 
In most cases, it’s best to stick with term life insurance for a variety of reasons, but most importantly, those reasons boil down to the price. Most people actually end up dropping out of whole life insurance policies, since they get too expensive to commit to after a long period of time.
 
It’s always best to start your search for inexpensive life insurance by looking online for Florida life insurance quotes from someone like https://floridainsurancequotes.net/life-insurance-quote/, and then moving offline to talk to potential life insurance providers in the area. You can always find good deals from the many life insurance agents residing in Florida, too.
 
There are many factors that can affect how inexpensive your Florida life insurance quotes may be, so don’t be afraid to ask questions along the way, either.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.source> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11x1gf2m6>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
