Dr. Mohan is one of the most caring doctors I have ever been to.  He has helped me every step of the way in my health, helped me to understand things better and takes the time to listen to my concerns.  He has taken care of my grandmother, parents, my husband and myself and our children.  I cannot imagine going to anyone else!

I was really able to get a lot of information after my visit, and I left feeling a renewed sense of hope. I was definitely satisfied with the level of care I received here. I love how attentive they are here. Even when notified that they have a personal phone call, they always wait to take it later. Their full attention is always on me and it makes me feel special. I was completely at ease during my appointment here. Dr. Mohan went to great lengths to make sure I was completely relaxed and comfortable the entire time. Dr. Mohan made sure every single question I had was answered, and are always available if I think of any more questions I want answered. Dr. Mohan is so kind and caring, and willing to do whatever he needs to do to make sure that my needs are met first and that I am comfortable with him. They wouldn't deny anyone that needed help. I know I can always count on them. Jackie, who is the receptionist there is delightful and very very personable and on point and efficent about everything and if she can't help, she always get back to me in a timely fashion.

Internal Medicine reviews in Bowie

        Real People ~ Real Reviews ~ Real Results      




I go to Dr. Provider name locked. for my yearly check-ups. She's a great listener, punctual, conservative about treatments and generally an excellent care provider. So happy she is my doctor!
 

            - Ward S.          




Reviewed blood tests, prescriptions and other issues with Dr. Provider name locked. . My experience is she gives each patient ample face time without being rushed. This is refreshing considering the push by some to see as many patients as possible. Left feeling all my concerns and issues were addressed, The staff at Thunderbird is friendly and competent in most cases. On other occasions I have dealt with upper management to resolved other issues and experienced helpfulness and compassion ( Provider name locked. and Provider name locked. )
 The lab is in the same building and they have other specialists on site. Thunderbird was a very good choice for me. 

            - Anthony B.          




Dr. Provider name locked. is great! Very helpful, engaged and sympathetic. She doesn't keep you waiting long, she is also efficient and on point. I would recommend her, Dr. Provider name locked. , Dr. Provider name locked. and Dr. Provider name locked. to anyone, they are all wonderful doctors!
I do have a problem, however, with the attitude of the support staff. Not the staff that you encounter on the reception and billing/future appointment desks, they're great, but the prescription refill desks. These employees are obviously very busy, but it's not necessary to be surly.  Even though I go out of my way to be pleasant, I have encountered this at three different doctors in Miami, PGSFL included, and I wonder if the attitude just is the way it is with these women (always women, it seems!). But it doesn't have to be. The patient is calling for a reason, they don't want to be sick, its not their fault they need a prescription, but you are made to feel like you are a great bother to these people. I dread refilling or calling about a prescription. I wish the doctors who run the practices were on the other end of the phone to experience it. It brings the whole practice down, sorry to say.
