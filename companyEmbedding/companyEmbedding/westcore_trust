About Westcore Funds
At Westcore Funds, our mission is to help our shareholders reach their long-term financial goals. We offer a diverse family of mutual funds that reflect the founding principles of the Funds’ manager, Denver Investments. Since the firm’s origin in 1958, independent fundamental research has been the cornerstone of its investment approach.

Independent Research
We believe independent fundamental research is the best way to help our shareholders achieve their long-term financial goals. Our research and financial models are designed to identify attractive investments early—to find and act on key information about companies and securities before it is widely known in the market.
Dedicated Teams of Investment Specialists
Recognizing that different investments require different approaches, we’ve organized our investment professionals into dedicated teams of specialists. Both within and across the investment teams, our professionals work collaboratively – leveraging the knowledge of individuals and the collective expertise of the group – to help achieve the goal of selecting each team’s best ideas for the Funds.
Singular Focus on Shareholders’ Success
At Westcore Funds, your success is our success. Institutional money manager Denver Investments, the Funds’ manager, is 100% employee-owned and concentrated on one business: managing money on behalf of its investors. We believe this independence and focus help align the firm’s success with the success of our shareholders.

Investment Expertise
Westcore’s diverse family of mutual funds reflects the investment strategies of its manager, Denver Investments. Each of the Funds focuses on a different asset class or strategy, and utilizes what we believe are the best investment techniques for each particular universe of securities.
 
 
 


Growth Equity
Our Small-Cap Growth investment philosophy is based on the belief that being early to identify companies with superior growth prospects leads to consistent outperformance over time. The team utilizes independent fundamental research to uncover what it believes are the next great growth companies.
 
 


Small-Cap Growth

 
 
 


Value Equity
Our Value strategy is based on the belief that the market rewards companies over time for their free cash flow (cash remaining after a company has paid all expenses, including what was spent for capital expenditures to support the current business) rather than their reported earnings. The team utilizes a bottom-up approach, which is grounded in independent fundamental research. Analysts seek to invest in dividend-paying companies in which they believe the future free cash flow is undervalued by the market. The team constructs diversified portfolios designed to generate attractive returns primarily through stock selection.
 
 


Mid-Cap Value Dividend
Smid-Cap Value Dividend
Small-Cap Value Dividend

 
 
 


Quantitative Equity
Our Quantitative strategy is based on the belief that market inefficiencies offer opportunities that are best captured through a disciplined approach focused on measurable variables of stocks. The team uses proprietary, sector-specific, multi-factor models to identify companies in which to invest. The team constructs diversified portfolios designed to generate attractive returns primarily through stock selection.
 
 


Global Large-Cap Rising Dividend
Large-Cap Value Dividend
Micro-Cap


 
 
 


International Equity
Our International Small-Cap strategy is based on the belief that investing in cash-generative businesses that trade at attractive valuations leads to consistent outperformance over time. The goal of the team’s approach is to invest in cash-generative companies at attractive valuations. Utilizing a bottom-up process grounded in independent fundamental research, the team constructs portfolios designed to generate attractive returns primarily through stock selection.
 
 


International Small-Cap

 
 
 


Fixed Income
Our Fixed Income strategy is based on the belief that consistently strong risk-adjusted returns are best achieved through an emphasis on income rather than short-term market timing. The team seeks to deliver attractive returns primarily through security and sector selection and, secondarily, through top-down decisions (such as increasing or decreasing exposure to interest rate changes). Using independent research, the team constructs diversified portfolios while adhering to its risk control measures.

Investment Leadership
Our investment platform is defined both by specialization and collaboration. Investment professionals are organized into six dedicated teams of investment specialists. We believe this specialization is essential to adding value through active management, empowering each team to implement the investment approach that best reflects the philosophy and conviction of the team. Both within and across our investment teams, there is a high degree of collaboration including the sharing of insights and information on securities, sectors and markets. We believe this collaboration helps ensure that our shareholders receive each team’s best ideas.
