PRESS RELEASE
Axiom Asia Closes US$ 1.028 Billion Fund IV
Singapore, 09 January 2017 – Axiom Asia Private Capital (“Axiom Asia”) has completed the final close of its fourth fund, Axiom Asia IV, L.P (“Fund IV” or the “Fund”).  The Fund secured over US$ 1 billion in total commitments from a select group of institutional limited partners, exceeding its target of US$ 750 million. The firm is led by Managing Partners Edmond Ng, Chris Loh, Alex Lee and Marc Lau.
“We had a strong re-up rate and are very grateful for the support from our existing and new investors,” said Edmond Ng. He added “The amount raised is a testament to the strong track record of Asian fund managers who have proven their ability to innovate and create profitable investment opportunities. It also highlights the appeal of our differentiated investment strategy that can generate returns even in times of market volatility.”
Consistent with its predecessor funds, Fund IV will continue Axiom’s proven strategy of offering investors access to a portfolio of top-tier, Asian-focused private equity funds that can provide attractive risk-adjusted returns.  The Fund will invest in buyout, venture capital, growth capital and other private equity funds. “We seek to invest with fund managers who bring unique and advantaged capabilities to capitalize on opportunities in their local markets and continue to emphasize commitments to highly capable next generation fund managers who are raising first or second funds,” explained Chris Loh. 





“We believe that private equity in Asia remains one of the most promising asset classes to invest in because of the economic dynamism of the region. Asia continues to possess the largest concentration of rising middle class consumers which provide a unique growth driver for companies,” said Alex Lee.
“To demonstrate its belief, and to further align its interest with its limited partners, the General Partner has increased its GP commitment in every successive Axiom Fund and raised it by one and a half times in Fund IV,” said Marc Lau.
Mike Hoffmann from Probitas Partners who has worked with Axiom Asia since 2006 added that, “Limited Partners value experienced teams, with specialized skill sets, who can be true extensions of their investment teams. Axiom has proven to be a good partner in Asia for its investors over the last 10 years and helped its investors navigate an increasingly uncertain investment world while delivering a significant return pickup over comparable public and private benchmarks.”
