      Fitch Rates Fifth Third Auto Trust 2014-3
    





October 29, 2014 11:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings assigns the following ratings to the notes issued by Fifth 
      Third Auto Trust 2014-3:
    

      --$218,000,000 class A-1 notes 'F1+sf';
    

      --$170,000,000 class A-2-A notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$170,000,000 class A-2-B notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$340,000,000 class A-3 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$102,000,000 class A-4 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS:
    

      Strong Collateral Quality: The pool is consistent with that of recently 
      issued Fifth Third Auto Trust (FITAT) transactions exhibiting a weighted 
      average FICO score of 759 with no scores below 650. The pool also 
      benefits from 15 months of seasoning and is diverse from a make/model 
      and geographic perspective.
    

      Extended Term/Used Vehicle Exposure: The pool does include heavy 
      concentrations in loans over five years (77.1%), including those 
      financing used vehicles, which could expose the pool to higher loss 
      severity.
    

      Sufficient CE Structure: Initial hard credit enhancement (CE) for the 
      class A notes is 4.25% with a target level of 4.75%. Excess spread is 
      expected to be 1.93%. Under Fitch's analysis, the structure is able to 
      support stressed losses commensurate with the expected ratings. The 
      seasoning adjusted base case loss proxy is 1.00%.
    

      Improved Loss Performance: Losses on Fifth Third's auto loan portfolio 
      and recent securitizations have declined significantly from peak levels 
      in 2006 to 2008 due to strong underwriting standards and improved credit 
      quality.
    

      Evolving Wholesale Market: The U.S. wholesale vehicle market is 
      normalizing following strong performance in recent years. Fitch expects 
      increasing used vehicle supply from off-lease vehicles and trade-ins to 
      pressure ABS recovery rates leading to moderately higher loss rates. 
      Fitch's analysis accounts for this risk by including periods of weak 
      wholesale vehicle market performance in the derivation of its base case 
      loss expectation.
    

      Stable Origination, Underwriting, and Servicing: Fitch believes Fifth 
      Third demonstrates adequate abilities as originator, underwriter, and 
      servicer to service FITAT 2014-3.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES:
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base 
      case. This could result in potential rating actions on the notes. Fitch 
      evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to class A notes of 
      Fifth Third Auto Trust 2014-3 to increased losses over the life of the 
      transaction. Fitch's analysis found that the class A notes display minor 
      sensitivity to increased defaults and losses under Fitch's moderate 
      (1.5x base case loss) scenario; however, the class A notes could 
      experience a downgrade of up to one rating category under Fitch's severe 
      (2.5x base case loss) scenario.
    

      Key Rating Drivers and Rating Sensitivities are further described in the 
      presale report dated Oct. 16, 2014. Fitch's analysis of the 
      Representations and Warranties (R&W) of this transaction can be found in 
      Fifth Third Auto Trust 2014-3 --Appendix'. These R&Ws are compared to 
      those of typical R&W for the asset class as detailed in the special 
      report 'Representations, Warranties, and Enforcement Mechanisms in 
      Global Structured Finance Transactions' dated April 17, 2012.

Fitch Affirms Two Classes of Fifth Third Auto Trust 2014-3 at AAAsf; Outlook Stable | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Affirms Two Classes of Fifth Third Auto Trust 2014-3 at AAAsf; 
      Outlook Stable
    





September 01, 2016 11:35 AM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--As part of its ongoing surveillance, Fitch Ratings has affirmed the two 
      outstanding classes of Fifth Third Auto Trust 2014-3. A full list of 
      rating actions follows at the end of this press release.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      The rating affirmations are based on available credit enhancement and 
      loss performance. The collateral pool continues to perform within 
      Fitch's expectations. Based on the current structure and credit 
      enhancement, the securities are able to withstand stress scenarios 
      consistent with the assigned ratings and make full payments to investors 
      in accordance with the terms of the documents.
    

      The ratings reflect the quality of Fifth Third Bank's retail auto loan 
      originations, the strength of its servicing capabilities, and the sound 
      financial and legal structure of the transactions.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base 
      case. This could result in potential rating actions on the notes.
    

      In its initial review of the transaction, Fitch evaluated the 
      sensitivity of the ratings assigned to the class A notes of Fifth Third 
      Auto Trust 2014-3 to increased losses over the life of the transaction. 
      Fitch's analysis found that the class A notes display minor sensitivity 
      to increased defaults and losses under Fitch's moderate (1.5x base case 
      loss) scenario; however, the class A notes could experience a downgrade 
      of up to one rating category under Fitch's severe (2.5x base case loss) 
      scenario.
    

      USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10
    

      Form ABS Due Diligence-15E was not provided to, or reviewed by, Fitch in 
      relation to this rating action.
    

      Fitch has affirmed the following ratings:
    

      Fifth Third Auto Trust 2014-3
    

      --Class A-3 notes at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class A-4 notes at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable.

Fitch Affirms Four Classes of Fifth Third Auto Trust 2014-3

      Fitch Ratings affirms the ratings on the Fifth Third Auto Trust 2014-3 
      notes as follows:
    

      --Class A-2-A notes at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class A-2-B notes at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class A-3 notes at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class A-4 notes at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      The rating actions are based on available credit enhancement (CE) and 
      loss performance to date. The collateral pool continues to perform 
      within Fitch's expectations. Based on the current CE and available loss 
      coverage, the notes are able to withstand stress scenarios consistent 
      with the assigned ratings and make full payments to investors in 
      accordance with the terms of the documents.
    

      The ratings reflect the quality of Fifth Third's retail auto loan 
      originations, the sound financial and legal structure of the 
      transaction, and the strength of the servicing provided by Fifth Third.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      could produce loss levels higher than the current projected base case 
      loss proxies and impact available loss coverage and multiples levels for 
      the transactions. Lower loss coverage could affect the ratings and 
      Rating Outlooks depending on the extent of the decline in coverage.
    

      In Fitch's initial review of the transactions, the notes were found to 
      have limited sensitivity to a 1.5x and 2.5x increase of Fitch's base 
      case loss expectations. To date, the transactions have exhibited strong 
      performance with losses well within Fitch's initial expectations, with 
      rising loss coverage and multiple levels. As such, a material 
      deterioration in performance would have to occur within the asset pools 
      to have potential negative impact on the outstanding ratings.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      No third-party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to 
      this rating action.
    

      Fitch's analysis of the Representation and Warranties (R&W) of this 
      transaction can be found in Fifth Third Auto Trust 2014-3 -- Appendix. 
      These R&W are compared to those of typical R&W for the asset class as 
      detailed in the special report 'Representations, Warranties, and 
      Enforcement Mechanisms in Global Structured Finance Transactions' dated 
      June 12, 2015.

Plan for Your Goals

              Invest For Retirement

Plan your retirement right
Planning for retirement is one of the most important things you can do in life. And it’s never too early—or too late—to start. So tell us where you are today. We’ll help you get to the right retirement tomorrow.

              Plan For Education

Planning for the costs of education
It’s smart to go to college. It’s even smarter to plan ahead. If you have a child or grandchild and you want to start saving for their education, you’re in the right place. A 529 savings account is a great way to help pay for higher education. It allows your money to grow over time with the security of FDIC insurance and 529 tax advantages.

              Buy A Home

Buying a home
Buying a house is a big deal. And finding the home of your dreams is only part of it. You’ll also want to find the loan that fits your finances.
At Fifth Third, our Mortgage Loan Originators are here to listen to you, learn about your unique needs, and answer all of your questions. Then, we will find the loan that's right for you.

              Save For Life Event

Life Events
Life is full of surprises. Some are great—like suddenly falling in love and planning a wedding. Others are not so great. But whatever life has in store, it’s important to be financially prepared. We can help you and your personal bank accounts get ready.

              Consolidate Debt

Consolidate Debt
Credit cards, auto loans, money borrowed for college—paying all those bills every month can be a real hassle. Why not consolidate your debts with someone you can trust?
Consolidating with Fifth Third can help simplify your life by giving you one simple monthly payment. Plus, our competitive rates can really help you put more of your money in your personal bank account.

              Learn About Finance

Power of the Purse
Money isn't everything. But knowing how to manage money can make everything better. That's what our Financial Empowerment program is all about—helping people understand how to better manage their finances and save for the future.
We even have programs designed specifically for students—it's never too soon to learn how to manage money and establish good habits.
