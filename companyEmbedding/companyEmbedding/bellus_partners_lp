A New Look for Bellus Medical




				By Sydni Ellis on April 6, 2017

			
























Unveil a new look with Bellus Medical
As a company whose goal is to offer solutions for medical aesthetic practices in strategic areas of growth, a logo is a very important part in getting its message across. That’s why Addison-based Bellus Medical has recently unveiled a new brand identity and logo as it prepares for significant growth in 2017. The new helix logo doubles as a “B” and an “M” on its side, and it symbolizes the sophisticated science and technology of the company.
Since 2012, Bellus Medical has focused on building a solid foundation, and has experienced steady growth. From a start up business to a leader in micro needling technology, Bellus has also expanded its product portfolio to include Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) and two additional breakthrough technologies that are slated to launch in 2017. The company continues to respond to consumer demand, and its new rebranding is part of its commitment to continued growth.
“We are proud to announce the launch of the new company logo as part of the ongoing evolution of our company’s brand,” said Jelena Boldt, senior director of marketing, in a recent press release. “We are excited to introduce our new look as we expand our reach in the medical aesthetic marketplace, build global brand awareness and strengthen our position as an industry leader.”
The new logo is exciting, but it is only one part of an ongoing effort to build on the company’s reputation for developing safe, efficacious and superior product technology. The new branding includes a modern color palette and photography in addition to the new logo, which will be featured in all of the company’s digital and print marketing materials.
Bellus Medical’s website has also been redesigned to incorporate the new clean, sophisticated science look of the company. In addition, the company will increase its presence and visibility at trade shows, including The American Academy of Dermatology, The Aesthetics Show, American Society for Dermatologic Surgery, and American Society of Plastic Surgeons. Another major milestone in Bellus Medical’s transformation is its move to Addison. Its new office is larger, with a modern design that will enhance the level of service offered to practice partners, better reflect the personality and identity of the brand, and is a better fit for the growing company.
“The goal is that practice partners and consumers alike will be connected to Bellus Medical and be proud of the brand they represent,” continued Boldt in a press release. “We’re thrilled with the response received from our stakeholders and we look forward to an exciting road ahead as we take our business to the next level.”
Welcome to the neighborhood, Bellus Medical! We are excited about your new logo and branding, and looking forward to seeing what you accomplishment in your new office space in Addison.
