What is StreamNet



What is StreamNet Technology
StreamNet Technology is a solution from the ground up for real time media streaming and control over Internet Protocol.
StreamNet was conceived with the notion that the Internet provides a means for the consumption and distribution of rich media content to anyone anywhere.
In fact, the StreamNet context is that sources may or may not exist within the same premises as the display and speakers.  Instead, sources can come and go from a premise, they can be only online, or they can live in the premise scattered around a physical location or simply streamed in by demand over the ubiquitous broadband connection.
The underlying technology of StreamNet is a fully network connected device, in fact, StreamNet devices look like any other network connected device on a network, you can look for their IP address, you can browse to them, you can even interrogate them like a network device to determine their status. On top of this strong base that is provided by the IP network StreamNet adds a number of important benefits.
StreamNet distributes uncompressed and compressed audio and video, synchronized across any number of multiple zones without any centralized control point or matrix switch.  Additionally, StreamNet devices self-configure on the network and they can manage and assign their own IP addresses, advertise their capabilities to other devices on the network and discover the capabilities of any other device on the network. This enables easy provisioning and simple maintenance while providing incredible flexibility. 
The control in the StreamNet system is completely decentralized. The removal of any one device, source, display, speaker, or user interface does not impact the system  the other devices simply work to build logical connections between devices.
In terms of the requirements for audio distribution, StreamNet was designed from the ground up to address these.  StreamNet Connected speaker solutions have been deployed to hundred of synchronous zones of audio. In fact, the limit on the number of StreamNet Connected devices on a network has not been reached yet. Additionally, StreamNet Connected IPcspeakers scale linearly, you only buy what you need to use.

The CTC promised almost entirely comes in hand.2) Great learning curve, ideal for fresh graduates.3) Small teams which mean greater responsibilities on one's shoulders, easier interactions with seniors.Cons1) No definite objective and goals. You can easily find priorities of today getting reverted back tomorrow.2) No proper development model, Often leads to rework.3) Poor marketing. Thus no matter how much you work, no body will use your product.4) Working on weekends without compensation (this might have stopped).5) Few perks, might not be ideal for people with families.6) No documentation.Advice to ManagementPlease focus a bit on marketing. You have been in the market since its inception and have some good products, but still have not been able to capture it. Also please improve the work culture.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (0) StreamNet Response seconds agoEdit • Delete StreamNet 2015-04-19 15:15 PDT Jun 28, 2016 StreamNet Logo"The place to be"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Developer in Bengaluru (India)Current Employee - Developer in Bengaluru (India)RecommendsPositive OutlookApproves of CEOI have been working at StreamNet full-time (More than 3 years)Pros- Management can be approached any time- Less process, faster results- Helpful HRs- Daily healthy snacksCons- Nothing as such to be mentionedAdvice to ManagementDoing well, keep goingShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (0) StreamNet Response seconds agoEdit • Delete StreamNet 2016-06-28 03:29 PDT Mar 25, 2016 Helpful (1) StreamNet Logo"Avoid"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementFormer Employee - Developer in Bengaluru (India)Former Employee - Developer in Bengaluru (India)Doesn't RecommendPositive OutlookDisapproves of CEOI worked at StreamNet full-time (More than a year)Pros1) Quality product work2) Can travel abroad if you are in system administrationCons1) Poor management - Management by Fear2) Management play tricks on employeesAdvice to ManagementGet professional help in management for the benefit of your employeesShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (1) StreamNet Response seconds agoEdit • Delete StreamNet 2016-03-25 08:57 PDT Oct 29, 2015 StreamNet Logo"Good Company to work for"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Senior Programmer Analyst in Bengaluru (India)Current Employee - Senior Programmer Analyst in Bengaluru (India)RecommendsI have been working at StreamNet (More than 8 years)ProsGood Pay.

Working here can Can result in some wise learning from your mistakes.Cons1. Very callous approach in the way they interview you. They actually go to the extent of saying they didn't get time to go through the resume???? And all that after calling for a F2F interview. No need to say they are completely unprepared to ask questions and keep repeating ,blabbering endlessly around their preset questions notions instead of even making a slight attempt to match the requirement with skill sets.2. Lack of professionalism. Almost in every thing.3. Interviewers with almost no knowledge (pls don't even think of depth or getting overblown by their knowledge) sit across you simply beating around the bush, interview Ran helter skelter directionless just as they insisted they proudly insisted they are a small company with no process, i agree no less and its so blatantly evident.You will return wasting your mind and probably forming a negative perception about all small companies.Advice to ManagementPlease learn to value time.Cut the Crap get to the point. The person you are interviewing either fits your requirement or not, its as simple as that.
