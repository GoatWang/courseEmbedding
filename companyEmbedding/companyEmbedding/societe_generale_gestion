General Information Notice to Non-US Persons Disclaimer of Warranty and Limitation of Liability Systems Issues USA PATRIOT Act:  Foreign Banking Clients and Customer Identification Program Copyrights and Trademarks Electronic Links Electronic Communications Choice of Law  General Information The information provided on this site or in any communication containing a link to this site is not intended for distribution to, or use by, any person or entity in any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or regulation or which would subject SG Americas Securities LLC (“SGAS”) or its affiliates to any registration requirement within such jurisdiction or country.  This site has been designed for informational purposes only.  Nothing contained herein constitutes a solicitation, offer or recommendation by SGAS or its affiliates to buy or sell any securities or other financial instruments or provide any investment advice or service.  Such offers only can be made where lawful under applicable law.  Neither SGAS nor any of its affiliates intend to provide investment advice through this site and they make no representation that any described securities or services are suitable for any investor.  SGAS does not render investment, tax, accounting or legal advice, and nothing contained in this site should be construed as such. Investments in securities discussed herein may not be suitable for all investors.  Investors must make their own investment decisions based on their specific investments objectives and financial position and using such independent advisors as they believe necessary.  Where an investment is denominated in a currency other than the investor’s currency, changes in rates of exchange may have an adverse effect on the value, price of, or income derived from the investment.  Past performance is not necessarily a guide to future performance.  Income from investments may fluctuate.  The price or value of the investments, to which this site relates, either directly or indirectly, may fall or rise against the interest of investors.  For further guidance on the impact of market risk on the value of investments, see FINRA’s Investor Alert dated April 16, 2007 on Market Risk:  What You Don’t Know Can Hurt You.  Users of this site agree that the information contained herein will not be the primary basis of any investment decision. Potential investors should be aware that certain legal and tax considerations, margin requirements, commissions and other transaction costs may significantly affect the economic consequences of the issuers or securities discussed herein and they should review such considerations, requirements and transaction costs carefully with their legal counsel and with financial and tax advisors. SGAS, or one or more of its affiliates, may have positions in and effect transactions in securities of companies mentioned and may also perform or seek to perform investment banking or other services for those companies. Notice to Non-US Persons This site is published in the United States for residents of the United States.  The site is not intended for use by, or to provide information to, persons outside the United States and such persons should not rely on the information contained in the site.  SGAS reserves the right to require proof of residence from any user accessing and requesting information from the site.  Investors outside the United States may be subject to securities or tax laws within their jurisdictions that are not addressed on this site. Nothing contained in this site shall be construed as a solicitation to buy any security from or an offer to sell any security, product or service to any non-US investor, nor shall any such security, product or service be offered or sold in any jurisdiction where such activity would be contrary to local laws or subject SGAS to registration within such jurisdictions.  Some securities, products or services may not be available in all jurisdictions.

USA PATRIOT Act:  Foreign Banking Clients and Customer Identification Program In response to the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, the US Congress passed the USA PATRIOT Act.  Parts of this Act apply to the financial services industry and require certain financial institutions to request specific information from foreign banks on a “certification” form.  Also as part of the USA PATRIOT Act and to assist in the government’s fight against terrorist financing and money laundering, SGAS is required to obtain and verify information about the identity of our clients.  Because of this, when you open an account at SGAS, we will ask for information that will allow us to confirm your identity or the identity of your corporation, partnership or other entity.  This process may include a request to see to your driver’s license, passport, corporate papers or other identifying documents.
