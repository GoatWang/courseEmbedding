approvals shall be filed with the Company records or made a part of

meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of that meeting, except

called or convened, and except that attendance at a meeting is not
a waiver of any right to object to the consideration of matters not
included in the notice of the meeting if that objection is
expressly made at the meeting. Neither the business to be
transacted nor the purpose of any meeting of Members need be
specified in any written waiver of notice except as provided in

entitled to vote on that action at a meeting were present and
voted. All such consents shall be filed with the Managers or the

Company records. Any Member giving a written consent, or the
Member’s proxy holders, may revoke the consent by a writing

Articles or this Agreement, a dissolution of the Company, or a

order that the Company may determine the Members of record entitled
to notices of any meeting or to vote, or entitled to receive any
distribution or to exercise any rights in respect of any

Member entitled to vote for Managers or on any other matter shall
have the right to do so either in person or by one or more agents

the Managers or secretary, if any, of the Company. A proxy shall be
deemed signed if the Member’s name is placed on the proxy
(whether by manual signature, typewriting, telegraphic
transmission, electronic transmission or otherwise) by the Member
or the Member’s attorney in fact. A proxy may be transmitted
by an oral telephonic transmission if it is submitted with
information from which it may be determined that the proxy was
authorized by the Member or the Member’s attorney in fact. A
validly executed proxy which does not state that it is irrevocable
shall continue in full force and effect unless (i) revoked by
the person executing it, before the vote pursuant to that proxy, by
a writing delivered to the Company stating that the proxy is
revoked, or by a subsequent proxy executed by, or attendance at the
meeting and voting in person by, the person executing the proxy; or
(ii) written notice of the death or incapacity of the maker of
that proxy is received by the Company before the vote pursuant to
that proxy is counted; provided, however, that no proxy shall be
valid after the expiration of eleven (11) months from the date
of the proxy, unless otherwise provided in the proxy. The
revocability of a proxy that states on its face that it is
irrevocable shall be governed by the provisions of Corporations
Code Sections 705(e) and 705(f).

respectively numbered serially, as they are issued, and shall be
signed by the Managers or officers of the Company. Each Unit
Certificate shall state the name of the Company, the fact that the
Company is organized under the laws of the State of California as a
limited liability company, the name of the person to whom issued,
the date of issue, and the number and class of Units represented
thereby. A statement of the designations, preferences,
qualifications, limitations, restrictions, and special or relative
rights of the Membership Interest, if any, shall be set forth in
full or summarized on the face or back of the Unit Certificates
which the Company shall issue, or in lieu thereof, the certificate
may set forth that such a statement or summary will be furnished to
any holder of a Unit Certificate upon request without charge. Each
Unit Certificate shall be otherwise in such form as may be
determined by the Managers.

B. Cancellation of Unit
Certificate . All Unit Certificates surrendered to the Company
for transfer shall be canceled and no new Unit Certificates shall
be issued in lieu thereof until the former certificates for a like
number of Membership Interests shall have
 


been surrendered and
canceled, except as herein provided with respect to lost, stolen,
or destroyed certificates.

C. Replacement of Lost,
Stolen or Destroyed Certificate . Any Member claiming that such
Member’s Unit Certificate is lost, stolen, or destroyed may
make an affidavit or affirmation of that fact and request a new
certificate. Upon the giving of a satisfactory indemnity to the
Company as reasonably as required by the Managers, a new
certificate may be issued of the same tenor and representing the
same Membership Interest as was represented by the certificate
alleged to be lost, stolen, or destroyed.
5. MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL OF THE
COMPANY

5.1. Management of the
Company by Managers.

A. Exclusive Management by
Managers . The business, property and affairs of the Company
shall be managed exclusively by the Managers. Except for situations
in which the approval of the Members is expressly required by the
Articles or this Agreement, the Managers shall have full, complete
and exclusive authority, power, and discretion to manage and
control the business, property and affairs of the Company, to make
all decisions regarding those matters and to perform any and all
other acts or activities customary or incident to the management of
the Company’s business, property and affairs.

B. Meetings of
Managers . Meetings of the Managers may be called by any
Manager or by the chairperson, president, any vice-president or the
secretary. All meetings shall be held upon four (4) days
notice by mail or forty-eight (48) hours notice delivered
personally or by telephone, telegraph or facsimile. A notice need
not specify the purpose of any meeting. Notice of a meeting need
not be given to any Manager who signs a waiver of notice or a
consent to holding the meeting or an approval of the minutes
thereof, whether before or after the meeting, or who attends the
meeting without protesting, prior to its commencement, the lack of
notice to such Manager. All such waivers, consents and approvals
shall be filed with the Company records or made a part of the
minutes of the meeting. A majority of the Managers present, whether
or not a quorum is present, may adjourn any meeting to another time
and place. If the meeting is adjourned for more than twenty-four
(24) hours, notice of any adjournment shall be given prior to
the time of the adjourned meeting to the Managers who are not
present at the time of the adjournment. Meetings of the Managers
may be held at any place within or without the State of California
which has been designated in the notice of the meeting or at such
place as may be approved by the Managers. Managers may participate
in a meeting through use of conference telephone or similar
communications equipment, so long as all Managers participating in
such meeting can hear one another. Participation in a meeting in
such manner constitutes a presence in person at such meeting. A
majority of the authorized number of Managers constitutes a quorum
of the Managers for the transaction of business. Except to the
extent that this Agreement expressly requires the approval of all
Managers, every act or decision done or made by a majority of the
Managers present at a meeting duly held at which a quorum is
present is the act of the Managers. A meeting at which a quorum is
initially present may continue to transact business notwithstanding
the
 


withdrawal of Managers, if
any action taken is approved by at least a majority of the required
quorum for such meeting. The provisions of this Section 5.1.B
apply also to committees of the Managers and actions taken by such
committees.

Any action required or
permitted to be taken by the Managers may be taken by the Managers
without a meeting, if a majority of the Managers individually or
collectively consent in writing to such action. Such action by
written consent shall have the same force and effect as a majority
vote of such Managers.

The provisions of this
Section 5.1.B govern meetings of the Managers if the Managers
elect, in their discretion, to hold meetings. However, nothing in
this Section 5.1.B or in this Agreement is intended to require
that meetings of Managers be held, it being the intent of the
Members that meetings of Managers are not required.

5.2. Election of
Managers.

A. Number, Term, and
Qualifications . The Company shall initially have one
(1) Manager. The number of Managers of the Company shall be
fixed from time to time by the affirmative vote or written consent
of Members holding a Majority Interest, provided that in no
instance shall there be less than one Manager. Unless such Manager
resigns or is removed, each Manager shall hold office until a
successor shall have been elected and qualified. Managers shall be
elected by the affirmative vote or written consent of Members
holding a Majority Interest. A Manager need not be a Member, an
individual, a resident of the State of California, or a citizen of
the United States. Managers shall be elected by the Members
exercising voting rights as holders of Units applying cumulative
voting-right mechanics as provided in Section 708 of the
California Corporations Code.

B. Resignation . Any
Manager may resign at any time by giving written notice to the
Members and remaining Managers without prejudice to the rights, if
any, of the Company under any contract to which the Manager is a
party. The resignation of any Manager shall take effect upon
receipt of that notice or at such later time as shall be specified
in the notice; and, unless otherwise specified in the notice, the
acceptance of the resignation shall not be necessary to make it
effective. The resignation of a Manager who is also a Member shall
not affect the Manager’s rights as a Member and shall not
constitute a withdrawal of a Member.

C. Removal . All or
any lesser number of Managers may be removed at any time, with or
without cause, by the affirmative vote of Members holding a
Majority Interest at a meeting called expressly for that purpose,
or by the written consent of the Members holding a Majority
Interest. Any removal shall be without prejudice to the rights, if
any, of the Manager under any employment contract and, if the
Manager is also a Member, shall not affect the Manager’s
rights as a Member or constitute a withdrawal of a
Member.

A Manager also may be removed
by the affirmative vote or written consent of a majority of the
remaining Managers if such Manager becomes incapable of fulfilling
such Manager’s obligations under this Agreement because of
injury or physical or mental illness and such incapacity shall
exist for thirty (30) working days in the aggregate during any
consecutive six (6) month period.
 


D. Vacancies . Any
vacancy occurring for any reason in the number of Managers may be
filled by the affirmative vote or written consent of Members
holding a Majority Interest.

5.3. Powers of
Managers.

A. Powers of Managers
. Without limiting the generality of Section 5.1, but subject
to Section 5.3.B and to the express limitations set forth
elsewhere in this Agreement, the Managers shall have all necessary
powers to manage and carry out the purposes, business, property,

power to exercise on behalf and in the name of the Company all of
the powers described in Corporations Code
Section 17003.

B. Limitations on Power of
Managers . The Managers shall not have authority hereunder to

other disposition of all, or substantially all, of the
Company’s assets occurring as part of a single transaction or
plan, or in multiple transactions over a six-month period, except
in the orderly liquidation and winding up of the business of the
Company upon its duly authorized dissolution.

(ii) The merger of the
Company with another limited liability company or limited
partnership, provided in no event shall a Member be required to
become a general partner in a merger with a limited partnership
without his express written consent or unless the agreement of
merger provides each Member with the dissenter’s rights
described in the Act.

(iii) The merger of the
Company with a corporation or a general partnership or other
Person, provided in no event shall a Member be required to become a
partner in a merger with a general partnership without his or her
express written consent or unless the agreement of merger provides
each Member with the dissenter’s rights described in the
Act.

(iv) An act which would make
it impossible to carry on the ordinary business of the
Company.

5.4. Members Have No
Managerial Authority . The Members shall have no power to
participate in the management of the Company except as expressly
authorized by this Agreement or the Articles and except as
expressly required by the Act. Unless expressly and duly authorized
in writing to do so by a Manager or Managers, no Member shall have
any power or authority to bind or act on behalf of the Company in
any way, to pledge its credit, or to render it liable for any
purpose.

5.5. Performance of
Duties: Liability of Managers . The Managers shall perform
their managerial duties in good faith, in a manner they reasonably
believe to be in the best interests of the Company and its Members,
and with such care, including reasonable inquiry, as an ordinarily
prudent person in a like position would use under similar
circumstances. A Manager, however, shall not be liable to the
Company or to any Member for any loss or damage sustained by the
Company or any Member, unless the loss or damage shall have been
the result of fraud, deceit,
 

gross negligence, reckless or
intentional misconduct, or a knowing violation of law by the
Manager.

In performing their duties,
the Managers shall be entitled to rely on information, opinions,
reports, or statements, including financial statements and other
financial data, of the following persons or groups unless they have
knowledge concerning the manner in question that would cause such
reliance to be unwarranted and provided that the Managers act in
good faith and after reasonable inquiry when the need therefor is
indicated by the circumstances:

A. one or more
officers, employees or other agents of the Company whom the
Managers reasonably believe to be reliable and competent in the
matters presented;

B. any attorney,
independent accountant, or other person as to matters which the
Managers reasonably believe to be within such person’s
professional or expert competence; or

C. a committee upon
which the Managers do not serve, duly designated in accordance with
a provision of the Articles or this Agreement, as to matters within
its designated authority, which committee the Managers reasonably
believe to merit competence.

5.6. Devotion of Time
. The Managers are not obligated to devote all of their time or
business efforts to the affairs of the Company. The Managers shall
devote whatever time, effort, and skill as they deem appropriate
for the operation of the Company.

5.7. Transactions between
the Company and the Managers . Notwithstanding that it may
constitute a conflict of interest, the Managers may, and may cause
their Affiliates to, engage in any transaction (including, without
limitation, the purchase, sale, lease, or exchange of any property
or the rendering of any service, or the establishment of any
salary, other compensation, or other terms of employment) with the
Company so long as such transaction is not expressly prohibited by
this Agreement and so long as the terms and conditions of such
transaction, on an overall basis, are fair and reasonable to the
Company and are at least as favorable to the Company as those that
are generally available from Persons capable of similarly
performing them and in similar transactions between parties
operating at arm’s length, and provided that a Majority
Interest of the Members having no interest in such transaction
(other than their interests as Members) affirmatively vote or
consent in writing to approve the transaction.

A transaction between the
Managers and/or their Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Company,
on the other hand, shall be conclusively determined to constitute a
transaction on terms and conditions, on an overall basis, fair and
reasonable to the Company and at least as favorable to the Company
as those generally available in a similar transaction between
parties operating at arm’s length if a Majority Interest of
the Members having no interest in such transaction (other than
their interests as Members) affirmatively vote or consent in
writing to approve the transaction.

5.8. Payments to
Managers . Except as specified in this Agreement, no Manager or
Affiliate of a Manager is entitled to remuneration for services
rendered or goods provided to the Company. The Managers and their
Affiliates shall receive only the following payments:
 


A. Management Fee .
Excepting duly elected officers of the Company, who shall serve
without further compensation, the Company shall pay each Manager an
annual fee for services in connection with the management of the
Company in the amount of ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS ($1,000.00). Such fee
may be changed from time to time only by an affirmative vote of
Members holding at least a Majority in Interest, and no Manager
shall be prevented from receiving any fee because the Manager is
also a Member of the Company.

B. Services Performed by
Managers or Affiliates . The Company shall pay the Managers or
Affiliates of the Managers for services rendered or goods provided
to the extent that the Managers are not required to render such
services or goods themselves without charge to the Company, and to
the extent that the fees paid to such Managers or Affiliates do not
exceed the fees that would be payable to an independent responsible
third party that is willing to perform such services or provide
such goods.

C. Expenses . The
Company shall reimburse the Managers and their Affiliates for the
actual cost of goods and materials used for or by the Company. The
Company shall also pay or reimburse the Managers or their
Affiliates for organizational expenses (including, without
limitation, legal and accounting fees and costs) incurred to form
the Company and prepare the Articles and this Agreement and other
operating costs incurred for the benefit of the Company which are
ordinary and necessary excepting certain indirect expenses to be
borne by the Managers as per Company policy.

5.9. Acts of Managers as
Conclusive Evidence of Authority . Any note, mortgage, evidence
of indebtedness, contract, certificate, statement, conveyance, or
other instrument in writing, and any assignment or endorsement
thereof, executed or entered into between the Company and any other
person, when signed by at least two Managers (or by one Manager if
the Articles state that the Company is managed by only one
Manager), is not invalidated as to the Company by any lack of
authority of the signing Managers or Manager in the absence
® f actual knowledge on the part
of the other person that the signing Managers or Manager had no
authority to execute the same.

5.10.
Officers.

A. Appointment of
Officers . The Managers may appoint officers at any time. The
officers of Company, if deemed necessary by the Managers, may
include a chairperson, president, vice president, secretary, and
chief financial officer. The officers shall serve at the pleasure
of the Managers, subject to all rights, if any, of an officer under
any contract of employment. Any individual may hold any number of
offices. No officer need be a resident of the State of California
or citizen of the United States. If a Manager is not an individual,
such Manager’s officers may serve as officers of Company if
elected by the Members. The officers shall exercise such powers and
perform such duties as specified in this Agreement and as shall be
determined from time to time by the Managers. The officers elected
to serve commencing upon formation are set forth on Exhibit
B.

B. Removal, Resignation
and Filling of Vacancy of Officers . Subject to the rights, if
any, of an officer under a contract of employment, any officer may
be removed, either with or without cause, by the Managers at any
time.
 


Any officer may resign at any
time by giving written notice to the Managers. Any resignation
shall take effect at the date of the receipt of that notice or at
any later time specified in that notice; and, unless otherwise
specified in that notice, the acceptance of the resignation shall
not be necessary to make it effective. Any resignation is without
prejudice to the rights, if any, of the Company under any contract
to which the officer is a party.

A vacancy in any office
because of death, resignation, removal, disqualification or any
other cause shall be filled in the manner prescribed in this
Agreement for regular appointments to that office.

C. Salaries of
Officers . Subject to Sections 5.10 and 5.11, the salaries of
all officers and agents of the Company shall be fixed by a
resolution of the Managers. The Managers serving as Officers shall
initially serve without compensation other than that paid to them
in their capacity as Managers.

D. Duties and Powers of
the Chairman . The chairman shall, if present, preside at
meetings of the Members and the Managers, and exercise and perform
such other powers and duties as may from time to time be assigned
to him by the Managers or prescribed by this Agreement.

E. Duties and Powers of
the President . Subject to such supervisory powers, if any, as
may be given by the Managers to the chairperson, if there be such
an officer, the president shall be the chief executive officer of
the Company, and shall, subject to the control of the Managers,
have general and active management of the business of the Company

Such a wonderful day out I had to do it twice! The boat offers a fun day frolicking in the crystal clear waters of the blue lagoon. Whether you choose to spend the day soaking up the sun sipping pina coladas on the sun deck, snorkeling the turquoise water or whizzing around gozo it's an experience I won't forget. On my second trip I took the optional speed boat ride through the caves with Oki Koki (or his dad Crazy Tony) and it was worth every penny The boat offers a full range of soft drinks and alcoholic beverages as well as surprisingly good food (I recommend the chicken ciabatta) . The staff are highly interactive and speak multiple languages.

“Best cruise to the Blue Lagoon!”


Reviewed 27 August 2016




My girlfriend and I had an awesome day on the Hornblower cruise and we can't thank Kevin and his staff enough for the great experience. We knew that we wanted to do a cruise to the Blue Lagoon, but with so many different options, and everyone offering similar things, it was hard to choose. We are SO glad that we chose Hornblower over the rest. Hornblower has the best spot in the Lagoon where you are free to jump off the boat directly into the water with plenty of space to swim around. Plus there's an awesome sun deck where we spent the entire day. The other boats that came to the Lagoon were packed with people (we had so much space!), no deck space to lay out and no swimming space. We would've been miserable on another boat, no doubt. Thank you, Kevin for a great day!!

“Definitely book this cruise over others!!! You won't regret it!”


Reviewed 25 August 2016



via mobile




Booked the hornblower cruise to the blue lagoon after popping in to itour Malta (across from the Great Wall Chinese in bugibba near the bus station). It costs €20 pp (25 if you also want to do the Gozo trip but we chose not to). The €20 trip to the blue lagoon is a 4 hour stay. We got on the boat and on the way the staff on board were helpful! They gave facts and monuments pointed out as we were on the way to the blue lagoon. When we arrived at the blue lagoon it was really busy! We got off the boat to have a bit of an explore - absolutely nowhere to sunbathe or even sit comfortably (extremely rocky) leaving us with either spending 4 hours stood around or 4 hours in the water (fine for my boyfriend but I wanted to sunbathe!) - this would have been a massive issue had we been with any other cruise but the hornblower! We went back to the boat were the top deck was a sunbathing area!! They had deckchairs free of charge and fake grass! They also had steps into the blue lagoon as well as a platform from both decks to jump into the water! They had toilets on board and sold food (burgers, chips etc) The blue lagoon is beautiful and definitely worth a visit, however had I been on another cruise (they were all seating only and a lot of them shades!) I wouldn't have enjoyed my time at the lagoon, however the fact that I could relax and sunbathe and then go into the water straight from the boat whenever I fancied was brilliant!!! And my boyfriend loved the snorkelling and jumping in! On the way back you see Gozo and have a trip into a cave! Thank you so much Stella for recommending it!! So glad we chose this cruise :)

“Great Way to Visit Gozo and Comino”


Reviewed 25 August 2016



via mobile




This all day trip really was my favourite part of my holiday. From start to finish, the views are terrific and the day is packed with things ti do. I went on the Comino, Malta Gozo trip which takes you from Malta to the Blue Lagoon and then on to Gozo and finally back to Malta.On the way, there is running commentary about the sights and in between there are some retro disco tunes played for your enjoyment. The boat moors in Blue lagoon where you get an hour to do as you please. This is absolutely beautiful with crystal clear waters and the boat has areas where you can jump in! So much fun! We took the optional half hour speedboat trip which is run by a crazy Italian and is good fun. On Gozo, we took the additional minibus tour which takes you to the Azure window, a church and Victoria. In my opinion the church is not worth the stop and the time would ve better spent at the Azure window which is quite a rushed experience. But it becomes apparent that getting your way round the island would be difficult without the help of the tour.I booked this trip at about 23:00 hours the night before boarding. Even at this time I was able to converse through emails with them to ensure that my trip went smoothly the next day including organising a pick up and drop iff service. Overall customer service here was brilliant. The staff are very friendly and attentive, and really make your trip fun and easy. WORTH NOTING - the base price was 25 euros which is actually very reasonable. The speedboat, pick up service and minibus tour are additional extras which cost 10, 5, 10 euros respectively. This takes the total to 50 euros. Which in my opinion is still a very good price. Also, there is food and drink available to buy on board which is not too expensive, a beer was 2.50. Overall I would definitely recommend this tour as it was well organised, fun and exciting. It only drops one star as the Azure window was too rushed, and the water I bought tasted very bad. All else was perfect.
