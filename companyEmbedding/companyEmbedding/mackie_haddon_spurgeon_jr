Sweetwater did very well getting my order to me. It came fast, was packed well, and me being a first-time customer, I marveled at the candy! Love the personal service, too. I did not expect to get a call from my sales engineer, either. I felt very well taken care of and love the thankful and sincere attitude found here! You guys have a standout business. Keep it up, and hang on to those special extra touches that make you different from the rest.

Brett, Phelan, CA

The Mackie Story
Founded by Greg Mackie in 1988 in Woodinville, Washington, Mackie was one of the first companies to build a quality mixing console that home recording musicians could afford. The company's first offering, the LM-1602 16-channel mixer, was enormously popular. Its revolutionary follow-up, the CR-1604, arrived in 1991 and cemented the company's reputation for rugged, affordable mixers with excellent sound. After Mackie released the CR-1604, the number of home studios grew exponentially. Corporate video departments, houses of worship, and schools were also eager to get their hands on a CR-1604.
Expanding Beyond Mixers
By the mid '90s, Mackie was flourishing. Greg continued to focus on building quality, affordable, easy-to-use mixers. He also continually reinvested profits into production, ensuring that Mackie churned out nothing but top-notch products. In 1996, Mackie charted a new course by releasing its first non-mixer products: the M-1200 power amplifier and 8200 studio monitors. The company also, while not abandoning its affordable roots, built the SR40-8 large-format mixing console. Due to the success of these new products, Mackie began investing heavily in research and development.
Continued Success
Today, Mackie continues to build innovative, high quality gear at affordable prices. Their Mackie Control is a widely used DAW tactile control surface. Their lightweight, yet powerful Thump series active PA speakers can be found on live stages everywhere. Mackie's VLZ series demonstrates that they still build practical, affordable mixers with preamp technology that's renowned for its price to performance ratio. Their DL series mixers even provide you with wireless iPad control that allows you to mix from anywhere! If you're looking for great gear at a great price, you can't go wrong with Mackie.
