Innovation vs. Reform
Finjan supports a balanced approach to patent reform and believes that the original intent for granting ownership rights to inventors - a US patent system that promotes innovation will strengthen the US economy - remains true today. As shown in our schematic, we propose reforms which restrict abusive patent behaviors on the one hand while incentivizing good faith licensing and enforcement practices on the other hand. Specifically, those who comply with certain transparent and elevated standards on ownership disclosure, notice letters, claim charts, Complaints, and efficient use of the judicial system should be exempt from the currently proposed reforms, such as fee-shifting, bond requirements, one-side discovery reforms, and joinder, otherwise imposed on abusive patent owners. Without the exemption, ethical individual innovators, startups, and small established companies who each contribute significantly to the US's global role as a leader in innovation will face challenges in direct conflict with their due process rights. Join us in supporting this proposal.

Enforcement Glossary
Affirmative Defenses
Facts other than those pled by plaintiff, if proven by defendant, defeats or mitigates the legal consequences of the defendant's otherwise unlawful conduct. Certain waiveable defenses must be pled at time of answering the complaint, e.g., non-infringement due to invalidity, unenforceability due to misuse or inequitable conduct during prosecution of patent application, etc. Non-waiveable affirmative defenses include lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
Case Management Conference (CMC)
Brief proceedings with the court following filing of complaint to address various scheduling, discovery, or status issues; timing and scope of these conferences vary among the courts.
Claim Chart
Sets forth each limitation in a claim and charts the limitations against the components of the allegedly infringing product.
Claim Construction
A fundamental issue in patent cases, strictly in the province of the courts. Both infringement and validity are two-step processes, requiring construction of the patent claims first, and then application of the appropriately construed claims to the accused device or the prior art, respectively. Claim construction gives scope and meaning to the patent claims. The applicant may be its own lexicographer and assign a specific definition to the (terms) used in the patent specification; however, if no special meaning is explicitly assigned to a term, it will be given their ordinary meaning.
Contributory Infringement
35 U.S.C. §271(c): whoever sells a component of a patented machine for use in practicing the patented process that does not have a substantial non-infringing use shall be liable as a contributory infringer.
Declaratory Judgment Action
A pre-emptive action by an alleged infringer to bring suit to resolve a threat of litigation by a patent owner. Must show an actual controversy, i.e. the threat of being sued for patent infringement is imminent.
Defensive Action
Usually a defendant or in a position of defending against an assertion. In district court patent litigation, a defendant defends for example against assertions of patent infringement. In re-examination proceedings before the U.S. Patent Office (USPTO), the patent owner defends the validity of its issued patent.
Direct Infringement
Infringement is directly by the accused and not through third parties.
Enhanced Damages
Upon a finding of willful infringement, the court has the discretion to enhance patent damages up to three times. 35 U.S.C. §284 and attorneys' fees and costs under 35 U.S.C. §285.
Indirect Infringement
Infringement occurs through the inducement of another by the accused, e.g. defendant intentionally (knowingly) encouraged patent infringement by another. See “Induced Infringement”
Induced Infringement
35 U.S.C. §271(b): whoever actively induces infringement of a patent shall be liable as a direct infringer. Requires a finding that the defendant engaged in some affirmative act and not simply failed to take steps to prevent infringement.
Injunction
Federal law also allows courts to grant injunctions if necessary to prevent a violation of patent rights. Requires a showing that monetary damages is insufficient for making the patent owner whole.
Ex Parte
In context of USPTO proceedings challenging the validity of an issued patent, ex parte means a legal proceeding brought by one person in the absence of and without representation of other parties.
FRE 408 Evidence Rules
Federal Rules of Evidence Rule 408 provides that certain evidence, e.g. of furnishing, promising, or offering (or accepting, promising to accept, or offering to accept) a valuable consideration in compromising or attempting to compromise a claim or statements made during compromise negotiations about a claim (with exceptions) are inadmissible at trial.
Inter Partes
"Between the parties": In the context of USPTO proceedings challenging the validity of an issued patent, inter partes means all interested parties (patent owner and patent challenger) are given reasonable opportunity to attend and be heard.
Markman Hearing (Markman) or Claim Construction Hearing
Although the courts need not follow a particular formal process for claim construction, courts typically allow briefing, expert testimony, and oral argument in a Markman hearing before issuing a claim construction order. Often, once claims are construed, the parties will file a "Summary Judgment" motion of infringement or invalidity (depending on the party position), which may eliminate the need for a jury trial.
Mediation
A form of Alternative Dispute Resolution that most district courts require litigation parties to participate in early in a case. Mediation is generally court mandated, is supervised by a certified mediator appointed by the court for the purpose of providing an early opportunity for the parties to meet and explore settlement of their dispute. The discussions, written submissions, and results of the mediation are not reported to the presiding judge. Rather, the mediator may only report the fact that mediation took place, whether the parties settled, or whether the parties wish to continue mediation or not continue.
Meet & Confer
A requirement of courts for counsel and their clients to "meet and confer" to try to resolve the matter or at least determine the points of conflict.
Offensive
Usually a plaintiff or in a position of asserting a claim against another. In district court patent litigation, a plaintiff asserts for example assertions of patent infringement. In re-examination proceedings before the U.S. Patent Office (USPTO), the petitioner seeks reexamination of another's patent's validity.
Re-examination (Re-exam)
Reexamination is a specialized proceeding in which the USPTO reconsiders an issued patent. The process can result in invalidation of some, or all, of the patent claims. Reexamination may be initiated by the USPTO or by the patent owner, but increasingly third parties start the process as part of an overall strategy to challenge a patent.
Re-exam Accepted
When the USPTO accepts a petition to re-examine the validity of an issued patent or rules in favor of the petitioner, i.e. invalidates all or some of the patent claims.
Re-exam Denied
When the USPTO rejects a petition to re-examine the validity of an issued patent or rules against the petitioner, i.e. affirms the validity of the patent.
Stay
A court-ordered short-term delay in judicial proceedings.
Summary Judgment Motion (SJ)
SJ is a dispositive ruling appropriate in patent cases where the only real dispute is between the parties' concerns the proper meaning of the patent claims. Infringement is a question of law for the court and SJ is appropriate if there is no material fact sufficient to preclude the grant of summary judgment. The burden of proving infringement is on the patent owner which must be by a preponderance of the evidence. Invalidity may also be disposed of by a SJ motion if the party seeking to invalidate the patent can prove the patent is invalid in light of prior art or is unenforceable due to misconduct on the part of the patent owner, by clear and convincing evidence.
Technical or Technology Tutorial
A quasi-formal court proceedings in a patent case to assist the court in understand complex technical terms and overall state-of-the-art of the technology relevant to the patented subject-matter-in-suit. Depending on the judge, they may request primers from the parties' designated patent experts or counsel. Often takes place in connection with an impending claim construction "Markman" hearing.
Vegas Rules
Finjan's ground rules for proceeding with license negotiations with prospective licensees, such that the parties agree not to use the discussions or information shared in the negotiations as evidence in litigation, if commenced. Also provides for an agreement that the prospective licensee will not commence a declaratory judgment (DJ) action against Finjan during the period of the agreement.
Willful Infringement
Willful infringement is the "deliberate disregard" of another's patent rights.

(  NASDAQ :  FNJN ), a cybersecurity company, announced its re-entry into the development and production of cyber secure products. With a long-established history in developing online security solutions for enterprises, Finjan's new products are for consumers; the first of which is the Finjan Mobile Secure Browser."We had a very clear but simple goal for developing our first secure mobile app -- which was for it to be simple to access, easy to use, and private. Importantly, our app gives mobile users a layer of security and a level of awareness to keep their data safe while surfing the web on their devices," said Julie Mar-Spinola, Finjan's Chief IP Officer. "It's alarming how exposed we are to being hacked through our mobile devices," continued Ms. Mar-Spinola. "These devices have become so convenient that we tend to forget about online security."According to Tim Shipman, Strategy Director at Yeti, "The Finjan Mobile Secure Browser is a compact, elegant solution for protecting your mobile device from malicious content from the Internet. It will sanitize every URL that you attempt to access." The Finjan Secure Browser will also warn the user so that they don't accidentally land on a malicious web page. If the site is safe (green), Finjan Mobile Secure Browser will go directly to the desired address. If the URL is suspect (yellow), it will caution the user and indicate the type of website and the location of the server. If the site is dangerous (red), Finjan's secure browser will, also, warn the user of the danger in proceeding, but allow the user to decide whether or not to proceed. Uniquely, the Finjan Mobile Secure Browser is private and will not collect your data."Until recently, Finjan was bound to a non-compete and confidentiality agreement with its former licensee, M86. M86, who subsequently merged with Trustwave Holdings, Inc., had an exclusive right to make cybersecurity products using Finjan's patented, behavior-based technologies," commented Phil Hartstein, Finjan's CEO. "Now that Finjan is free to develop and produce new cybersecurity products again, we jumped back in with the purpose of giving everyday mobile consumers a private and secure browser to use on their smart devices. The Finjan Secure Browser will scan and educate users on the potential malicious natures of URLs."Version 1 of the Finjan Mobile Secure Browser is free and can be downloaded onto your smartphone from the Google Play Store (for Android devices), or the Apple Store (for Apple devices). You use Finjan's app as you would any other browser such as Safari or Google.ABOUT FINJAN Founded in 1997, Finjan is recognized globally as a cybersecurity pioneer and leader. Finjan's investment in innovation is captured in its patent portfolio, centered around software and hardware technologies capable of proactively detecting previously unknown and emerging threats on a real-time, behavior-based basis.
