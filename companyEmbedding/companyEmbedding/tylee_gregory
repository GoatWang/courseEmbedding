A purchase and sale agreement is a document used in real estate transactions, when a seller property owner (''Seller'') sells a property to a company or individual (''Buyer''). This document outlines the terms and conditions of transaction. Information contained in the document includes the names of both parties, the address and description of the property the agreement concerns, and the purchase price. The closing details of the transaction are included in the document outlining where and when closing on the property shall occur. When purchasing a property, particularly with a cash payment, a real estate investor may provide earnest money as a deposit. This information will be present in the contract and will include details on the amount and how it shall be paid to the seller. If a loan is being used to purchase the property, details of the lender and the amount will be included in the document.There may be clauses regarding property taxes and disclosures of potential issues of the property.  If the seller agrees to perform certain repairs before transfer of ownership to the buyer, the repairs may be contained within the agreement. Some buyers may request fixtures or furnishings along with the sale of the property, and these will be listed within the document.  A purchase and sale agreement may also contain warranties, waiver of claims, and information about the title insurance policy.

The Parties acknowledge the adequacy

representations, warranties, conditions, rights and promises
contained in this Agreement. The Parties, intending to be legally
bound, agree as provided below.



ARTICLE I

SALE AND PURCHASE OF
SHARES

1.1 Sale and Purchase of
Shares . On and subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, at the Closing the Sellers will sell and transfer to
Buyer, and Buyer will purchase and accept from Sellers, all of the
Gibralt and Maretic Shares, the JTF Shares and the Tylee Shares in
exchange for payment of the Purchase Price, as defined below
(collectively, the “ Purchase ”).

1.2 Purchase Price
.

The aggregate consideration payable
for the Purchase (the “ Purchase Price ”) shall
be as follows:

(a) 297,321 shares of Parent Common
Stock, as may be increased or decreased by the adjustment amount,
if any, provided for by Section 1.3 .

(b) Up to $3,500,000 aggregate cash
consideration (the “ Earnout ”) payable to the
Sellers (by wire transfer in accordance with written instructions
delivered by the Sellers in the amounts set forth below to Parent)
within three business days, following the date (if any) on which
the Fully Diluted Market Capitalization reaches each of the
thresholds below on or before December 31, 2016:
 










Fully Diluted Market Capitalization Threshold



  



Aggregate Additional Consideration




$200 million


  



$1 million




$225 million


  



$1 million




$250 million


  



$1.5 million





  



 





Total:


  



$3.5 million





To the extent there occurs a Change
in Control of Parent on or prior to December 31, 2016, any
portion of the $3,500,000 Earnout not yet earned or paid shall
become immediately due and payable to the Sellers on or prior to
the date of such Change of Control.

The allocation of the Purchase Price
deliverable to each Seller at Closing or in connection with the
Earnout is set forth in Section 1.2(b) of the
Disclosure Schedule.

(c) The Earnout is included in the
Purchase Price to account for the goodwill of the Company, which
will not be determinable at Closing.

1.3 Working Capital and
Indebtedness Adjustment .

(a) Estimated Adjustment
.

(i) At least two Business Days prior
to the date of Closing, each of the Company, JTF Holdco and Tylee
Holdco shall prepare and deliver to Parent (a) a draft of its
respective Estimated Balance Sheet as of the date of Closing, which
shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP consistent with the
Financial Statements (as defined in Section 3.6 ), and
(b) a statement setting forth in reasonable detail its
calculation of Estimated Net Working Capital, Estimated Closing
Cash and Estimated Indebtedness based upon the draft Estimated
Balance Sheet. Each Estimated Balance Sheet and the calculation of
Estimated Net Working Capital, Estimated Closing Cash and Estimated
Indebtedness shall be subject to Parent’s review and
approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably delayed. It is
the intention of the Parties that the sum of Estimated Net Working
Capital and Estimated Closing Cash minus Estimated Indebtedness as
of the date of Closing be as close to zero as possible.

(ii) To the extent that the sum of
Estimated Net Working Capital and Estimated Closing Cash
minus Estimated Indebtedness on any such Estimated Balance
Sheet is less than $0, the amount of the Purchase Price deliverable
at Closing to the affected Sellers as set forth on
Section 1.2(b) of the Disclosure Schedule shall be
reduced by the amount of such difference and the number of shares
of Parent Common Stock delivered to the affected Sellers at Closing
shall be reduced accordingly.

(b) Final Adjustment
.

(i) Within 10 days after Closing,
Parent shall prepare and deliver to the Sellers a draft Final
Balance Sheet of each of the Company, JTF Holdco and Tylee Holdco,
which shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP consistent with the
Financial Statements, and a statement setting forth in reasonable
detail Parent’s calculation of the Final Working Capital,
Final Closing Cash and Final Indebtedness of each of the Company,
JTF Holdco and Tylee Holdco based upon each draft Final Balance
Sheet.

(ii) Following its receipt of each
draft Final Balance Sheet, the Sellers shall have 14 days to review
each draft Final Balance Sheet and to inform Parent in writing of
any disagreement that they may have with each draft Final Balance
Sheet, which objection shall, to the extent practicable, specify in
reasonable detail Sellers’ disagreement with such draft Final
Balance Sheet (the “ Working Capital Objection
”). If Parent does not receive a Working Capital Objection
within such 14-day period, each draft Final Balance Sheet shall be
deemed to have been accepted and shall become binding upon the
Parties. If the Sellers timely deliver a Working Capital Objection,
Parent shall then have 10 days from the date of receipt of such
Working Capital Objection (the “ Working Capital Review
Period ”) to review and respond to the Working Capital
Objection (and Parent shall have the right to examine the work
papers and financial records used or generated in connection with
the preparation of the Working Capital Objection and such other
documents as Parent may reasonably request). Parent and the Sellers
shall attempt in good faith to resolve any disagreements with
respect to
 
3



the Final Balance Sheet. If Parent
and the Sellers are unable to resolve all of their disagreements
with respect to any Final Balance Sheet, Parent and the Sellers
shall promptly refer the dispute either to (i) a “Big
Four” public accounting firm, or (ii) any other mutually
agreeable accounting firm, in either case that is
“independent” of both the Parent and the Sellers under
the definitions of the Commission (the “ CPA Firm
”), which CPA Firm shall resolve such disagreements. Parent
and the Sellers shall direct the CPA Firm to use its reasonable
best efforts to render its determination within 20 days after the
dispute is first submitted to the CPA Firm. The CPA Firm’s
determination shall be conclusive and binding upon Parent and the
Sellers. Parent and the Sellers shall make readily available to the
CPA Firm all relevant books and records and all other items
reasonably requested by the CPA Firm. The Final Balance Sheet as
determined by the CPA Firm shall be binding upon Parent and
Sellers.

(iii) To the extent that the sum of
Final Net Working Capital and Final Closing Cash minus Final
Indebtedness is (A) less than the sum of Estimated Net Working
Capital and Estimated Closing Cash minus Estimated
Indebtedness for any Final Balance Sheet, the Tylee Sellers, in the
case of Tylee Holdco, the JTF Holders, in the case of JTF Holdco,
the Company Sellers, in the case of the Company, shall pay, within
two Business Days of the determination of the Final Balance Sheet,
to Parent in cash, by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to the account designated by Parent in writing, the amount of such
shortfall and (B) greater than the sum of Estimated Net
Working Capital and Estimated Closing Cash minus Estimated
Indebtedness for any Final Balance Sheet, for any of the Tylee
Sellers, in the case of Tylee Holdco, the JTF Holders, in the case
of JTF Holdco, the Company Sellers, in the case of the Company,
Parent shall or shall cause Buyer to pay, within two Business Days
of the determination of the Final Balance Sheet, to the Tylee
Sellers, in the case of Tylee Holdco, the JTF Holders, in the case
of JTF Holdco, the Company Sellers, in the case of the Company, as
the case may be, in cash, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to the account designated by such recipient in writing, the
amount of such excess.

(iv) If any unresolved objections
are submitted to the CPA Firm for resolution as provided above, the
fees and expenses of the CPA Firm shall be allocated between
Parent, on the one hand, the respective Sellers, on the other hand,
based upon the relationship the contested amount not awarded to
each party bears to the amount actually contested by such party. By
way of example, if Parent claims that the appropriate adjustments
are $1,000 greater than the amount determined by the Sellers, and
if the CPA Firm ultimately resolves such claim by awarding to
Parent $300 of the $1,000 contested, then the fees, costs and
expenses of the CPA Firm will be allocated 70% to Parent and 30% to
the Sellers.

1.4 Date and Effective Time of
Closing . The Closing shall occur on February 1, 2016, or such
later date as the Parties may agree.

1.5 Withholding Taxes .
Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the
contrary (and subject to the last sentence of this
Section 1.5 ), Parent or Buyer shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the Purchase Price otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as Parent or Buyer is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to
 
4


the making of such payment under the Code, or
any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law; provided that any
amount of the Purchase Price shall be subject to tax withholding
only by Parent or Buyer for payment to the appropriate taxing
authorities. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid
over to the appropriate taxing authority by Parent or Buyer, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the applicable payee in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent or
Buyer.

1.6 Sellers’ Closing
Obligations . At the Closing, in addition to other actions to
be taken by the Sellers at the Closing pursuant to other provisions
of this Agreement, Sellers will deliver the following to
Parent:

(a) certificates representing the
Gibralt and Maretic Shares, JTF Shares and Tylee Shares duly
endorsed (or accompanied by duly executed stock powers) for
transfer to Buyer, with all transfer stamps required by Law affixed

Exhibit A , duly executed by each Seller and each Seller

and Buyer are exempt from withholding any portion of the Purchase
Price;

(e) certificates of the appropriate
Governmental Authority of the jurisdiction of organization of each
Entity Seller and of the Company, JTF Holdco and Tylee Holdco,

confirmation of good status of the Company and each of JTF Holdco
and Tylee Holdco in such jurisdiction;

(f) accurate copies of all

adopted by the board of directors (or similar governing body) of

Agreement to which such Seller is a party, and the consummation of
the Contemplated Transactions, certified as such by the Secretary
or Assistant Secretary of such Seller;

(g) evidence satisfactory to Parent
