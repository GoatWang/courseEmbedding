Home>Products>shrinkMate™






ShrinkMate™ Cable ShieldingThis lightweight solution provides not only electrical continuity, EMI, RFI, and ESD cable shielding, but also enables electrical connection between components of various sizes and shapes, and between solderable and non-solderabale surfaces.

Methode’s ShrinkMate™ cable shielding connectors use MIl-I-23053/5 polyolefin tubing, or clear medical grade polyester tubing and a highly conductive Polymer Thick Film silver inner coating. The coating shrinks with a heat gun, oven, or any other conventional heat source. When the tubing is set, the inner conductive layer provides an electrical connection between the outside surfaces of the objects that are joined by the tubing. Coaxial cable butt joints and cable to shielded connector housing joints can be made fast and easy and without the use of solder.

Technology values


Highly conductive ink properties
Excellent durability
Linear characteristics for sensors
High-resolution printing
Laser trimming to meet tight tolerances
Technology FundamentalsPolymer thick film (PTF) is a field-proven materials and process technology used to create Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) suitable for small features and layers, which can be printed on top of each other to develop multiple functions. PTF technology can be used in increasingly complex ways, including combing PCB manufacturing techniques to provide automotive component designers with a resource that can enhance product performance, improve reliability, raise quality levels and reduce overall component costs.

Our PTF inks are RoHS compliant and create negligible Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) during printing, alleviating the need for specialized ventilation during application. Our silver inks deliver low resistivity, stable physical and electrical properties, generous processing windows based on substrate material, and aggressive miniaturization and increased functionality in electronic circuitry. Utilizing PTF, Methode designs and manufactures cermet and inkjet printed sensor assemblies for a wide breadth of industries including medical, automotive, industrial and military.Standard Products9101 Inkjet Conductive Silver InkMethode's aqueous-based inkjet formulations are designed for all drop on demand printhead technologies as well as a variety of flexible and rigid substrates. The inks contain conductive silver nanoparticles and achieve electrical resistance as low as 200 milliohms per square within minutes of printing. The inks do not require secondary curing or additional processing on many coated substrates. These silver inks can be inkjet printed onto flexible substrates such as polyester, synthetic polymer sheets, coated papers and rigid substrates. Offering resolutions as fine as 100 micron lines and spacing, the ink is suitable for use in the printed electronics market, including sensors, flexible displays, photovoltaic arrays, RFID, security and lighting.3800 Series Resistive Carbon Inkjet InksMethode's aqueous-based inkjet formulations are designed for all drop on demand printhead technologies as well as a variety of flexible and rigid substrates. The inks contain conductive carbon nanoparticles and achieve electrical resistance as low as 2000 Ohms per square. The inkjet inks can be printed onto flexible and rigid substrates such as polyester, synthetic polymer sheets, coated papers and acrylic. Offering resolutions as fine as 100 micron lines and spacing, the ink is suitable for use in the printed electronics market, including sensors, secure packaging, lighting, RF shielding, and toys.6105 Highly Conductive Screen Printable Silver InkHighly conductive silver ink has relatively low cure requirements including less than 3 milliohms per square per mil on higher temp substrates and less than 5 milliohms per square per mil on lower temperature substrates like polyester, polyimide, other plastics, coated paper and FR-4. These low cure requirements allow it to be cured or dried in standard convection ovens or IR ovens.1210 Silver Conductive Via Plugging MaterialA 100% solid system, with no shrinkage on curing, 1210 silver conductive via plugging material provides a high density via plug for low-cost blind and buried vias with or without through-hole plating, where the core boards are fully planar. The material allows PCBs to be designed to recapture much of the real estate that is currently lost to plated through-holes and land patterns.Polymer Thick Film and Cermet SensorsOur polymer thick film (PTF) and cermet sensor technology offers compatibility, adaptability, cost and reliability benefits for many applications. Printed on flexible substrates, PTF products can be folded, twisted, bent around corners or bonded to any surface making them ideal for applications where flexibility is needed. Lightweight, compact and environmentally friendly, PTF technology has become the preferred choice for printing electrodes and disposable biosensor components. If the solution requires overcoming tight tolerances and resisting harsh environments, including extreme temperature, solvents and high moisture, cermet hybrids improve product reliability and help maximize real estate space on your designs.Flexible Circuits and SensorsDesigned for dynamic environments, our flex circuitry is lightweight, low profile and easy to install. Methode will customize the size, substrate material, resistance values, and tolerances of our flexible circuits and sensors to meet customers' specific requirements. Flexible circuits are printed, not etched, to provide a "green solution" to many applications and the inks can be printed on polyester, polyimide, Kapton®, other plastics, coated paper and FR-4 substrates.

interACT – Automotive Control TechnologyThe way we interact with our vehicle is rapidly evolving.  With the explosion of new features and capabilities available to the user, it’s important to ensure that the driver is still safe while driving.  Methode is uniquely positioned to provide the cutting-edge technology that driver’s want while providing a safe, personal, and intuitive means for the driver to interact with their vehicle.






































 A personal and safe vehicle interface covering:

Vehicle access and security
Driver identification
Center stack interface
Mobile device usage




Gesture InterfaceGestures on tablets is a very intuitive way to control the device, but it’s not a perfect solution for all driving experiences.  Anytime you move your eyes away from the road risk is added to the drive.  To minimize this, Methode has designed a gesture based control method for commonly used functions and allows you to never remove your eyes from the road.Capacitive Touch ScreensBringing the tablet experience into the vehicle is not trivial, as it has to meet stringent automotive requirements.  Offering crisp functionality and gestures familiar from using a tablet, Methode’s design offers world class optical and performance properties expected in the automotive world.  Read more about Methode’s Automotive Capacitive Touch Screens.CellControl with DriverIDThe ability to prevent texting (and other distracting functions on the phone) while driving is now available.  When the vehicle is in motion, the driver’s mobile device is locked out except for hands free calling through the vehicle.  Once the vehicle is stopped, the phone is re-activated for use.  DriverID allows the passenger to fully use all features of the driver’s  mobile device when the vehicle is in motion.BiometricsCustomization of the driving experience is difficult to achieve when controlled with just a key FOB as these are often shared.  Once shared, all data gets corrupted by the new user.  Biometrics give you the power to know who is driving and thus ensuring flawless data collection.  Read more about Methode’s Biometric Authentication Technology.

Methode Electronics, Inc. Announces Diversified Product Offerings Contribute To Record Sales 





Methode Electronics, Inc. Announces Diversified Product Offerings Contribute To Record Sales 

 Nov 30, 2000 

   CHICAGO, Nov. 30 -- Methode Electronics, Inc. (Nasdaq: METHA)today announced record sales of $127.6 million for the second quarter ended
October 31, 2000, up 22% from $104.4 million a year ago.  Second quarter net income amounted to $9.1 million with earnings per share of $0.25 compared to $0.21 for last year (last year's second quarter earnings of $0.21 per share
excludes a charge of $0.06 per share related to the bankruptcy of a large automotive safety system supplier).
    For the six months sales amounted to $242.7 million, up 20% from $203.0 million last year.  Net income was $0.49 per share as compared to $0.45 prior to the bad debt charge last year.
    Until the IRS approves Methode's plan for a tax-free spin-off of Stratos Lightwave, Inc., Methode continues to operate in two separate and distinct business segments - the Optical and the Electronic.  Chairman Bill McGinley said, "Our Optical business continues its solid high growth pattern set over the last several years.  The Electronic segment, despite a recent poor
earnings performance in the automotive interconnect and controls business, continues as Methode's primary cash generator." 
    Sales for the second quarter for the Optical segment were $37.9 million, nearly double last year's second quarter sales of $19.5 million with pretax profits up to $5.9 million from $1.1 million last year.  The performance of our Optical segment includes the results of Stratos Lightwave, Inc. and additional other Methode Optical business units which were not transferred to Stratos but will be retained by Methode.
    Of the Optical segment's sales of $37.9 million, Stratos accounted for about $33.8 million with second quarter pretax earnings of $6.1 million (before minority interest), up eightfold from $0.7 million a year ago.  Stratos sales order backlog continued to strengthen to a record of $52 million as of October 31, 2000.  For more details concerning the operations of Stratos Lightwave, see its separate news release dated November 29, 2000, at http://www.stratoslightwave.com .
    Methode previously indicated its intention to spin off its approximate 84% ownership of Stratos to Methode shareholders once it receives a favorable ruling concerning the tax-free nature of such distribution from the Internal Revenue Service.  Methode can neither provide assurance that it will receive a favorable ruling nor control the IRS' timing for the issuing such ruling. Under the requested ruling Methode shareholders will receive just under 1.5 shares of Stratos Lightwave, Inc. for every share of Methode Electronics owned as of the record date.  The cash raised at the time of the public offering
($171.3 million remaining at October 31) will be retained by Stratos and will not be available to Methode Electronics.
    Dale Phillips, Methode's Chief Financial Officer, commented on the Electronic segment, "Sales of electronic interconnect devices, connectors, controls and various cable assemblies were $85.1 million, up 10% from $77.4 million last year, representing 67% of Methode's consolidated shipments.  While Methode's connector and interconnect business in the telecommunications and computer markets experienced solid performance improvements, poor earnings performance in the automotive interconnect and controls business resulted in
pretax profits for the Electronics segment of $10.2 million compared to $10.3 million last year.
"Connector and interconnect devices sold to telecommunications and computer markets continued to enjoy improved sales and earnings as compared to a year ago.  The three leading business units in this group -- Duel Systems, Adam Technologies and Methode Singapore -- all reported solid improvements on a combined sales increase of 36% and a pretax earnings increase of 255% compared to a year ago.
    "The dataMate business continued to strengthen its relationship with Intel and its OEM customers in the quarter.  dataMate began providing its Coppermine terminator to Dell, Hewlett-Packard and IBM in this quarter.  Annual sales estimates for the Coppermine are now expected to reach $5 million.  In addition, dataMate is the first terminator supplier to qualify for Intel's next generation processor.  This terminator is anticipated to achieve annual
sales of $2 - $4 million.  dataMate is currently working on designs for the next several generations of Intel processors."
    Commenting on the underperformance in the automotive interconnect and controls businesses, Mr. Phillips stated, "It has been an interesting and active quarter for the automotive business.  While sales increased 4% to $55.0 million from $52.7 million, several factors contributed to a
disappointing earnings performance and a subsequent change in leadership for the business.
    "First, start-up costs for our Reynosa, Mexico plant ran approximately $1.3 million higher than anticipated for the quarter.  Second, we launched over 30 new product lines in our Carthage and Golden plants this summer compared to five new product launches in fiscal year 2000.  This aggressive launch schedule resulted in at least $.6 million higher than anticipated
operating expenses for these products.  Third, an intense United Auto Workers organizing campaign affected productivity levels at both Carthage and Golden."
    Mr. Phillips further stated, "The initial steps to enhance profitability of this business have already been taken.  First, any further product transfers to Reynosa have been frozen until next Spring.  This step will allow us to better train and develop the growing work force of over 300 newly-hired workers in that plant.  We expect substantial improvements in productivity and quality from that unit in the next three to six months.  Second, recent
internal management changes at the Carthage and Golden plants are expected to renew focus on production details for the newly launched product lines and the employee relations issues generated over the last two years.  These initial steps were taken in order to return to productivity levels more in line with Methode's historical performance in this business.  Finally, the UAW withdrew its organizing petition from the National Labor Relations Board on November 14, 2000.
    "Looking forward, we are concerned that some of these near-term productivity gains may be overshadowed by current industry trends.  After a
year and a half of increasing interest rates, the automotive industry has slowed.  Based on recent production cuts by Methode's major customers, we
currently anticipate flat to modestly down third quarter automotive revenues and flat to modestly up fourth quarter automotive revenues.  Our longer-term projections still reflect reasonably strong growth for fiscal 2002 over fiscal
2001 based on current estimates from our customers.
    "When these results are overlaid with the rest of Methode, we anticipate total third and fourth quarter revenues (including Stratos) to continue to increase with earnings modestly up in the third and fourth quarters.  While the current automotive estimates are fluid at best, they do, however, reflect planned customer announcements regarding production requirements that we expect will be made in the next week to ten days.  Any further announcements from Detroit beyond this time frame may cause us to institute a mid-quarter
business trend call at that time."
    Methode, as previously announced, will conduct an earnings meeting and conference call, led by its Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Dale W. Phillips, on Thursday November 30 at 10:00 a.m. CT.  To participate call 888-222-2994.  A replay of the call will be available for seven days, beginning at 1:00 p.m. CT, November 30.  To hear the replay, call Code No. 142771.

    Certain statements in this press release are forward-looking statements that are subject to certain risks and uncertainties.  The Company's results will be subject to many of the same risks that apply to the automotive, computer and telecommunication industries, such as general economic conditions, interest rates, consumer spending patterns and technological change.  Other factors which may result in materially different results for future periods include market growth; operating costs; currency exchange rates and devaluations; delays in development, production and marketing of new products; and other factors set forth from time to time in the Company's Form 10-K and other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The forward-looking statements in this press release are intended to be subject to the safe harbor protection provided under the securities law.

    Methode Electronics, Inc., with 4,000 full-time and 650 temporary employees in 25 plants worldwide, manufactures component devices for Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) of information processing and networking equipment, voice and data communications systems, consumer electronics, automobiles, aerospace vehicles and industrial equipment.

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million
Updated: June 9, 2013
Data Format: CSV
License: CC-BY

2 GB gzip8 GB uncompressed

Download



The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
