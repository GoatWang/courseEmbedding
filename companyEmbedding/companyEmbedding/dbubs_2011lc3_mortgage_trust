      certificates for A-2C certificates, which have a balance of $0 at 
      closing.)
    

      **Notional amount and interest only
    

      The expected ratings are based on information provided by the issuer as 
      of Aug. 8, 2011. Fitch does not expect to rate the $291,928,485 
      interest-only class X-B or the $50,694,485 class G.
    

      The certificates represent the beneficial ownership in the trust, 
      primary assets of which are 43 loans secured by 64 commercial properties 
      having an aggregate pooled principal balance of approximately $1.4 
      billion as of the cutoff date. The loans were sold by German American 
      Capital Corporation., UBS Real Estate Securities, Ladder Capital Finance 
      LLC, and Starwood Property Mortgage.
    

      Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, 
      including site inspections on 72.7% of the properties by balance, cash 
      flow analysis of 84.8% of the pool and asset summary reviews of 86.5% of 
      the pool.
    

      The transaction has a Fitch stressed debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) 
      of 1.34 times (x), a Fitch stressed loan-to value (LTV) of 91.9%, and a 
      Fitch debt yield of 12.7%. Fitch's aggregate net cash flow represents a 
      variance of 6.3% to issuer cash flows.
    

      The Master Servicer and Special Servicer will be Wells Fargo and Midland 
      Loan Services, Inc., rated 'CMS2' and 'CSS1', respectively, by Fitch.

Kroll Bond Ratings Affirms DBUBS 2011-LC3 Commercial Mortgage Trust PM Certificates2012-08-21 00:00:00open as PDFKroll Bond Rating Agency (KBRA) affirmed six classes of DBUBS 2011-LC3 Commercial Mortgage Trust, a $1.6 billion CMBS conduit/fusion transaction (see ratings list below). KBRA issued ratings for the transaction’s “PM” certificates, which derive all of their cash flow from the Providence Place Mall loan. The $300.4 million mortgage loan is the third largest in the pool. The loan was originated with a ten year term, pays interest at a fixed rate of 5.203%, and amortizes based on a 30 year schedule. The loan collateral is a a leasehold interest in Providence Place Mall, a 1.3 million square foot super-regional mall located in Providence, Rhode Island. The mall is anchored by Macy’s, Nordstrom and JCPenney. Macy’s and JCPenney, which together comprise 316,691 square feet, are not part of the collateral.
The rating affirmations follow our review of the transaction, which utilized information obtained from the master servicer, Wells Fargo, National Association and the trustee, U.S. Bank National Association. The loan has exhibited stable operating performance since issuance. The results of our analysis yielded a KBRA Net Cash Flow (KNCF) of $34.3 million and a KBRA value of $442.5 million, a 2.1% increase from $33.6 million and $433.3 million, respectively, at closing. The KBRA In-Trust Loan to Value (KLTV) is 70.1% and the KBRA In-Trust Debt Service Coverage during the term (KDSCt) is 1.65x, which is consistent with the In-Trust KLTV of 67.9% and KDSCt 1.71x, respectively, at closing. In our analysis of the transaction, we analyzed the property in accordance with our published criteria and considered the property’s historical performance as well as market fundamentals.

Kroll Bond Ratings Affirms DBUBS 2011-LC3 Commercial Mortgage Trust PM Certificates2013-08-28 00:00:00open as PDFNEW YORK, NY (August 28, 2013) – Kroll Bond Rating Agency (KBRA) affirmed its ratings on all six PM classes of DBUBS 2011-LC3 Commercial Mortgage Trust (see ratings list below). The PM certificates were issued in conjunction with a $1.6 billion CMBS conduit/fusion transaction and derive their cash flow solely from the Providence Place Mall loan.  The Providence Place Mall loan is a single $296.3 million non-recourse, first lien mortgage loan secured by a leasehold interest in 980,711 sf of Providence Place Mall, a 1.3 million sf super-regional mall located in Providence, Rhode Island.  The land underlying the property is leased from the Rhode Island Economic Development Corporation under a 99-year ground lease expiring in 2096 with four, 99-year extension options.  The proceeds from the mortgage loan were used by GGP Limited Partnership (GGP) to refinance existing debt.  The loan bears interest at an annualized rate of 5.203% and amortizes on a 30-year amortization schedule.  Providence Place Mall has three anchors, Macy’s (200,000 sf), Nordstrom (197,000 sf), and JCPenney (116,691 sf).  Macy’s and JCPenney own their improvements subject to ground leases with the borrower.  The transaction has exhibited stable performance since issuance.  For the trailing twelve months (TTM) ending March 2013, in-line tenants occupying less than 10,000 sf generated sales of $618 per sf, a 0.2% decrease from $628 as of Full-Year 2012.  The current sales performance is 34.4% above the International Council of Shopping Centers (ICSC) average national mall sales, which were $460 per sf as of June 2013, and 13.4% above ICSC US Northeast region sales, which were $545 per sf for the same period.KBRA used information obtained from the trustee, US Bank National Association, and the servicer, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, to analyze the loan collateral.  The analysis produced a KBRA Net Cash Flow (KNCF) of $34.4 million and a KBRA value of $444.1 million, each of which has increased 0.4% since August 2012 and 2.5% since issuance.  The resulting in-trust KBRA Loan to Value (KLTV) was 66.7%.

KBRA Affirms DBUBS 2011-LC3 Commercial Mortgage Trust PM Certificates




DBUBS 
      2011-LC3 Providence Place Mall Surveillance Report






August 28, 2013 06:05 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Kroll Bond Rating Agency (KBRA) affirmed its ratings on all six PM 
      classes of DBUBS 2011-LC3 Commercial Mortgage Trust (see ratings list 
      below). The PM certificates were issued in conjunction with a $1.6 
      billion CMBS conduit/fusion transaction and derive their cash flow 
      solely from the Providence Place Mall loan. The Providence Place Mall 
      loan is a single $296.3 million non-recourse, first lien mortgage loan 
      secured by a leasehold interest in 980,711 sf of Providence Place Mall, 
      a 1.3 million sf super-regional mall located in Providence, Rhode 
      Island. The land underlying the property is leased from the Rhode Island 
      Economic Development Corporation under a 99-year ground lease expiring 
      in 2096 with four, 99-year extension options.
    

      The proceeds from the mortgage loan were used by GGP Limited Partnership 
      (GGP) to refinance existing debt. The loan bears interest at an 
      annualized rate of 5.203% and amortizes on a 30-year amortization 
      schedule. Providence Place Mall has three anchors, Macy’s (200,000 sf), 
      Nordstrom (197,000 sf), and JCPenney (116,691 sf). Macy’s and JCPenney 
      own their improvements subject to ground leases with the borrower.
    

      The transaction has exhibited stable performance since issuance. For the 
      trailing twelve months (TTM) ending March 2013, in-line tenants 
      occupying less than 10,000 sf generated sales of $618 per sf, a 0.2% 
      decrease from $628 as of Full-Year 2012. The current sales performance 
      is 34.4% above the International Council of Shopping Centers (ICSC) 
      average national mall sales, which were $460 per sf as of June 2013, and 
      13.4% above ICSC US Northeast region sales, which were $545 per sf for 
      the same period.
    

      KBRA used information obtained from the trustee, US Bank National 
      Association, and the servicer, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, 
      to analyze the loan collateral. The analysis produced a KBRA Net Cash 
      Flow (KNCF) of $34.4 million and a KBRA value of $444.1 million, each of 
      which has increased 0.4% since August 2012 and 2.5% since issuance. The 
      resulting in-trust KBRA Loan to Value (KLTV) was 66.7%.

EXPLANATORY NOTES


 


Wells Fargo Bank, National Association is the master servicer, certificate administrator and custodian of the loans serviced under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and the special servicer of the Providence Place Mall Mortgage Loan, which constituted approximately 3.9% of the asset pool of the issuing entity as of its cut-off date. As a result, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association is a “servicer” as defined in Item 1108(a)(2)(iii) of Regulation AB, in the capacities described above because it is servicing mortgage loans that constituted 10% or more of the assets of the issuing entity as of its cut-off date. The assessments of compliance with applicable servicing criteria, accountants’ attestation reports and servicer compliance statements delivered by Wells Fargo Bank, National Association in the capacities described above are listed in the Exhibit Index.


 


Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Master Servicer of the subject transaction did not provide an assessment of compliance with respect to Item 1122(d)(3)(iii). At the time the Pooling and Servicing Agreement was entered into, it was intended that either the master servicer or the certificate administrator would perform this servicing function. In fact, Item 1122(d)(3)(iii) of Regulation AB was performed by the certificate administrator, and is included in the assessment of compliance with applicable servicing criteria and accountants’ attestation report of the certificate administrator for the subject transaction.


 


With regard to the servicing criteria set forth in subsection 1122(d)(3)(iii), KeyBank National Association, as successor by merger to KeyCorp Real Estate Capital Markets, Inc. has indicated that the criteria is not applicable. Under the terms of the related Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the certificate administrator may, and does, perform this servicing function, and KeyBank National Association understands that the certificate administrator has included this criteria in its own assessment of compliance for this transaction.


 


U.S. Bank National Association acts as trustee of the mortgage loans serviced under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement. Pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the trustee is required to provide an assessment of compliance with applicable servicing criteria solely with respect to Item 1122(d)(2)(iii) of Regulation AB (regarding advances of funds or guarantees regarding collections, cash flows or distributions, and any interest or other fees charged for such advances, are made, reviewed and approved as specified in the transaction agreements). However, the trustee is not required to deliver such assessment of compliance with applicable servicing criteria with respect to any reporting period during which there were no servicing criteria applicable to the trustee, as was the case during the reporting period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As a result, this Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an assessment
of compliance with applicable servicing criteria of the trustee. One or more other servicers of the mortgage loans serviced under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement have delivered one or more assessments of compliance with respect to Item 1122(d)(2)(iii) of Regulation AB.


 


This Annual Report on Form 10-K includes assessments of compliance with applicable servicing criteria and accountants’ attestation reports from CoreLogic Commercial Real Estate Services, Inc. and National Tax Search, LLC. These entities were engaged by the master servicer of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement to remit tax payments received from the escrow accounts of borrowers to local taxing authorities, to report tax amounts due, to verify tax parcel information, and to verify non-escrow tax payments. These services are included within the servicing criteria set forth in Items 1122(d)(4)(xi) and 1122(d)(4)(xii). Therefore, under the principles-based definition of “servicer” set forth in Item 1101(j) that looks to the functions that an entity performs, these vendors are “servicers” for the purposes of Item 1122. See Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations, Section 301.01 (Item 1101(j)).

Item 1117 of Regulation AB, Legal Proceedings.


 
The registrant knows of no material pending legal proceeding involving the trust or any party related to the trust, other than routine litigation incidental to the duties of those respective parties, and the following, with respect to UBS Real Estate Securities Inc, as Sponsor and Mortgage Loan Seller, CWCapital Asset Management LLC, as Pooled Special Servicer, U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Certificate Administrator and Custodian, and KeyBank National Association, as Primary Servicer:
 
UBS Real Estate Securities Inc. (“UBSRES”) is currently engaged in litigation with respect to various legacy residential mortgage-backed securities transactions. Some litigants are seeking the repurchase of mortgage loans by UBSRES from certain residential mortgage securitization trusts, on the basis that the loans are allegedly in breach of contractual representations and warranties in governing transaction documents. Other litigants are alleging violations of federal and/or state securities or common law for alleged misrepresentations and omissions in offering documents in connection with the issuance and/or distribution of residential mortgage-backed securities. No assurance can be given that one or more of the foregoing actions will not result in material liability to UBSRES.
 
On December 17, 2015, U.S. Bank National Association, the trustee under five (5) pooling and servicing agreements for (i) Wachovia Bank Commercial Mortgage Trust 2007-C30, (ii) COBALT CMBS Commercial Trust 2007-C2, (iii) Wachovia Bank Commercial Mortgage Trust 2007-C31, (iv) ML-CFC Commercial Mortgage Trust 2007-5 and (v) ML-CFC Commercial Mortgage Trust 2007-6 commenced a proceeding with the Second Judicial District Court of Ramsey County, Minnesota (“Court”) for a declaratory judgment as to the proper allocation of certain proceeds in the alleged amount of $560 million (“Disputed Proceeds”) received by CWCapital Asset Management LLC (“CWCAM”) in connection with the sale of the Peter Cooper Village and Stuyvesant Town property in New York, New York (the “Property”) securing loans held by those trusts.  CWCAM was the special servicer of the Property. The
petition requests the court to instruct the trustee, the trust beneficiaries, and any other interested parties as to the amount of the Disputed Proceeds, if any, that constitute penalty interest and/or the amount of the Disputed Proceeds, if any, that constitute gain-on-sale proceeds, with respect to each trust. On February 24, 2016, CWCAM made a limited appearance with the Court to file a motion to dismiss this proceeding based on lack of jurisdiction, mootness, standing, and forum non conveniens.  There can be no assurances as to the outcome of this motion or the proceeding or the possible impact on CWCAM. However, CWCAM believes that it has performed its obligations under the related pooling and servicing agreements in good faith, and that the Disputed Proceeds were properly allocated to CWCAM as penalty interest, and it intends to vigorously contest any claim that such Disputed Proceeds were improperly allocated
as penalty interest.
 
Since 2014 various plaintiffs or groups of plaintiffs, primarily investors, have filed claims against U.S. Bank National Association (“U.S. Bank”), in its capacity as trustee or successor trustee (as the case may be) under certain residential mortgage backed securities (“RMBS”) trusts. The plaintiffs or plaintiff groups have filed substantially similar complaints against other RMBS trustees, including Deutsche Bank, Citibank, HSBC, Bank of New York Mellon and Wells Fargo. The complaints against U.S. Bank allege the trustee caused losses to investors as a result of alleged failures by the sponsors, mortgage loan sellers and servicers for these RMBS trusts and assert causes of action based upon the trustee's purported failure to enforce repurchase obligations of mortgage loan sellers for alleged breaches of representations and warranties concerning loan quality. The complaints also assert that the trustee failed to notify securityholders of purported
events of default allegedly caused by breaches of servicing standards by mortgage loan servicers and that the trustee purportedly failed to abide by a heightened standard of care following alleged events of default.
 
Currently U.S. Bank is a defendant in multiple actions alleging individual or class action claims against the trustee with respect to multiple trusts as described above with the most substantial case being: BlackRock Balanced Capital Portfolio et al v. U.S. Bank National Association, No. 605204/2015 (N.Y. Sup. Ct.) (class action alleging claims with respect to approximately 794 trusts) and its companion case BlackRock Core Bond Portfolio et al v. U.S Bank National Association, No. 14-cv-9401 (S.D.N.Y.). Some of the trusts implicated in the aforementioned Blackrock cases, as well as other trusts, are involved in actions brought by separate groups of plaintiffs related to no more than 100 trusts per case.
 
There can be no assurance as to the outcome of any of the litigation, or the possible impact of these litigations on the trustee or the RMBS trusts. However, U.S. Bank denies liability and believes that it has performed its obligations under the RMBS trusts in good faith, that its actions were not the cause of losses to investors and that it has meritorious defenses, and it intends to contest the plaintiffs’ claims vigorously.
 
On June 18, 2014, a group of institutional investors filed a civil complaint in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County, against Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., in its capacity as trustee under 276 residential mortgage backed securities (“RMBS”) trusts, which was later amended on July 18, 2014, to increase the number of trusts to 284 RMBS trusts.  On November 24, 2014, the plaintiffs filed a motion to voluntarily dismiss the state court action without prejudice.  That same day, a group of institutional investors filed a civil complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (the “District Court”) against Wells Fargo Bank, alleging claims against the bank in its capacity as trustee for 274 RMBS trusts (the “Complaint”).
In December 2014, the plaintiffs’ motion to voluntarily dismiss their original state court action was granted.  As with the prior state court action, the Complaint is one of six similar complaints filed contemporaneously against RMBS trustees (Deutsche Bank, Citibank, HSBC, Bank of New York Mellon and US Bank) by a group of institutional investor plaintiffs.  The Complaint against Wells Fargo Bank alleges that the trustee caused losses to investors and asserts causes of action based upon, among other things, the trustee's alleged failure to (i) enforce repurchase obligations of mortgage loan sellers for purported breaches of representations and warranties, (ii) notify investors of alleged events of default purportedly caused by breaches by mortgage loan servicers, and (iii) abide by appropriate standards of care following alleged events of default. Relief sought includes money damages in an unspecified amount, reimbursement of expenses, and equitable relief.  Other cases
(collectively, the “Additional Complaints”) alleging similar causes of action have been filed against Wells Fargo Bank and other trustees in the same court by RMBS investors in these and other transactions, and these cases have been consolidated before the same judge. On January 19, 2016, an order was entered in connection with the Complaint in which the District Court declined to exercise jurisdiction over 261 trusts at issue in the Complaint; the District Court also allowed Plaintiffs to file amended complaints if they so chose, and three amended complaints have been filed. There can be no assurances as to the outcome of the litigation, or the possible impact of the litigation on the trustee or the RMBS trusts. However, Wells Fargo Bank denies liability and believes that it has performed its obligations under the RMBS trusts in good faith, that its actions were not the cause of any losses to investors, and that
it has meritorious defenses, and it intends to contest the plaintiffs’ claims vigorously.
 
On February 23, 2016, a certificateholder of the J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial Mortgage Securities Trust, Series 2007-CIBC18 (the “Trust”), filed suit in the Supreme Court of New York, County of New York, against KeyBank National Association and Berkadia Commercial Mortgage LLC (collectively, the “Servicers”).  The suit was filed derivatively on behalf of the Trust.  The action was brought in connection with the Servicers’ determination of the fair value of a loan, secured by the Bryant Park Hotel in New York City, held by the Trust and sold to an assignee of the Trust’s directing certificateholder, pursuant to an exercise of the fair value option.  There can be no assurances as to the outcome of the action or the possible impact of the litigation on the Servicers.  Both Servicers deny liability, believe that they performed their obligations in accordance with the terms
of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement applicable to the Trust, and intend to contest the claims asserted against them.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
