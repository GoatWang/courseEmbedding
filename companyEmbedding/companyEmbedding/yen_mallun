SAN FRANCISCO, April 12, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- RPX Corporation (NASDAQ:   RPXC), the leading provider of patent risk and discovery management solutions, today announced that Mallun Yen has been appointed to the Company's Board of Directors, effective immediately. Ms. Yen, currently the Company's Executive Vice President, will continue to serve in that role through September 1, 2017. 








"Mallun's contributions to the Company date back to when she worked with the founding team to launch RPX," said Marty Roberts, Chief Executive Officer and President of RPX. "From these early days, she has championed the RPX mission to bring transparency, efficiency, and rationality to patent transactions through industry innovation. I am pleased that she will remain engaged with our business through service on our Board." 
"We're delighted that Mallun has joined the Board of Directors," said RPX Chairman of the Board, Shelby Bonnie. "She has been integral to the Company's success from inception. This experience, combined with her leadership in the patent industry and devotion to the organization's mission are invaluable assets." 
Prior to RPX, Ms. Yen spent eight years at Cisco where, as Vice President of Worldwide Intellectual Property and Deputy General Counsel, she built and led the teams responsible for protection of the intellectual property embedded in Cisco's technology, products, and innovation globally. She is also a board member of KQED, Northern California's public media organization, and a board member, co-founder, and chief executive officer of ChIPs, a nonprofit with over 1,500 members dedicated to accelerating innovation in technology, law, and policy by increasing diversity of thought, participation, and engagement.   
"I have been a believer in RPX since the very beginning, and I'm proud of how far we've come in these nearly 10 years," Ms. Yen said. "Through the good work of everyone at RPX and the support of our clients, we've helped our more than 350 clients avoid more than 4,000 litigations and save nearly $3.5 billion. Now as a board member, I'm pleased to continue to advocate for greater transparency in the patent marketplace and to guide RPX as it leverages its great success through new opportunities."
With Ms. Yen's appointment, RPX's Board will consist of nine members until the Company's 2017 shareholder meeting. At that time, RPX anticipates the Board will be reduced to eight members, as Board Member Thomas Ryder previously notified the Company that he will not stand for re-election. Other than Ms. Yen, all members of RPX's Board of Directors are independent directors.     
Executive PromotionsSeparately, the Company announced that Steve Swank has been promoted to Chief Revenue Officer and that Emily Gavin has been promoted to General Counsel. Most recently, Mr. Swank served as Senior Vice President and Head of Client Development and Client Relations, and Ms. Gavin as Deputy General Counsel. Both Mr. Swank and Ms. Gavin report to Mr. Roberts. 
"I'm proud of these promotions. Steve and Emily are both talented executives who have made significant contributions to the Company throughout their long tenures," said Mr. Roberts. "With Steve's proven track record of building, growing, and providing excellent service to our client network, I'm confident in his successes to come as our Chief Revenue Officer."
Mr. Roberts continued, "I'm delighted to have Emily succeed me as General Counsel. She has a keen grasp of our Company's diverse legal and business needs, gained through working on numerous patent transactions and various legal matters throughout the years."
In this newly created position of Chief Revenue Officer, all areas of revenue generation, including Insurance and Product Management, are now consolidated under Mr. Swank's leadership. He has topline responsibility for revenue growth through continued expansion of RPX's client base and development of new services that bring greater cost efficiency to the patent marketplace.

As Senior Vice President, and Head of Client Development and Client Relations, he led efforts to recruit and retain clients, where he was instrumental in building RPX's client network and launching various business development and client service initiatives. Before RPX, he held senior business development and client relations positions at Comdata Corporation, Pine Creek Healthcare Capital, and Fortune Magazine. Mr. Swank holds a BA from Bucknell University and an MBA from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.

Biography

Mallun Yen is a founder, entrepreneur, advisor, senior executive and public company officer who has led organizations ranging from early stage start-ups to large enterprises in creating and launching new products, initiatives and businesses, with a particular focus on using data and analytics to foster innovation, drive better decision-making, shift behaviors and disrupt industry conventions.
Currently Executive Vice President of RPX Corporation (Nasdaq:  RPXC), Mallun has worked with the founding team since inception and helped steer the company to a billion dollar public offering in 2011.  She is known for leading the transformation of an industry to adopt a market-based, data-driven collaborative approach for reducing risk from patent assertion entities, including by developing a number of novel products that helped grow the business and expand the RPX network of member companies to over 220 across a variety of sectors.
Mallun also led the team that sourced, negotiated and closed the industry’s largest syndicated deal with Rockstar, a patent holding entity formed by five major technology companies.  In this complex  syndicated transaction, RPX built a consortium of over 40 US and foreign licensee participants and acquired for $900M the remaining 4,000+ Nortel patent assets owned by Rockstar, resulting in the dismissal of dozens of legal actions, avoidance of numerous future cases, improvement of strained corporate relationships, prevention of further splintering of assets, and savings of hundreds of millions of dollars.  This interdisciplinary case study will serve the basis for her Stanford Law School course entitled The Business of Intellectual Property:  How Patents, Technology, Competition & Finance Converge.
Prior to RPX, Mallun spent eight years at Cisco where, as Vice President of Worldwide Intellectual Property and Deputy General Counsel, she built and led the teams responsible for intellectual property protection of Cisco’s technology, products and innovation around the world including in the areas of strategy, development, prosecution, portfolio, disputes, licensing, acquisitions, pools, standards and policy.  She is credited with driving Cisco’s IP strategy to advance its business objectives and create competitive differentiation, which marked the company’s transformation into a global IP leader.  A key contributor to Cisco’s renowned M&A organization, which acquired and integrated over 60 companies during her tenure, Mallun led the teams responsible for evaluating and valuing target companies’ intellectual assets as well as subsequent protection of acquired innovation, technologies and products.
Mallun has served on Credit Suisse’s New Markets Advisory Board, Stanford University’s Rock Center for Corporate Governance International Advisory Council and UC Berkeley Law’s Berkeley Center for Law and Technology Advisory Board.
A frequently invited speaker on topics ranging from intellectual property, innovation, leadership, recruiting and diversity, Mallun has testified before the Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice on patent reform and spoken at such notable events including the Fortune Most Powerful Women’s Next Gen Summit, SaaStr Annual and the ChIPs Global Summit.  She has also received numerous awards including SF Business Times Most Influential Women in Bay Area Business, The Recorder’s Women Leaders in Law, Women Leaders in Tech Law, IAM’s World’s Leading IP Strategists, UC Berkeley School of Law’s Young Alumnus Award and UC Berkeley’s Young Bear Award, and been featured in various publications including The Secrets of Silicon Valley and Stiletto Network.
After earning a JD from UC Berkeley School of Law, Mallun clerked for the Honorable Ronald M. Whyte for the US District Court in San Jose, California.

Mallun lives in Woodside, California with her serial entrepreneur-turned-blogger/investor husband and two children who enjoy any sports that involve flipping.  While it’s unlikely she’ll exceed her personal record of three marathons in 2010 any time soon, she is happily running shorter distances these days with the family’s recently adopted rescue mutt who was supposed to be four but turns out is at least seven.
