Satya Brata Das (born 1955) is a Canadian author and media commentator .[1]
Das is the author of three books, on oil, and immigration in Canada Dispatches from a Borderless World(1999), The Best Country (2002) and Green Oil(2009).
Dispatches, based on testimonies and personal experience growing up in a borderless world, portrays societies and culture in transition. The writer imagines how borderless societies try to find identity in a new world through their stories.
The Best Country is set in Canada, where "capital and skilled people are mobile, and political borders are no longer clear-cut markers of identity and sovereignty.”.[2] Here, Das views Canadian global leadership from a human -- as opposed to a military or political -- perspective.
In Greenoil he contends that Alberta's oil sands can be profitable and responsibly developed. His take on this estimated $15-trillion oil sands resource is the paradox of green oil, paving a clean energy]] future for his adopted western Canadian province, in the 21st Century.
Das, a former newspaper journalist, runs a consulting company based in Edmonton, Alberta.

MahaMaya: The Grand Illusion
- Satya Brata Das
Photos: Marc J Chalifoux

June 11, 2017

Bharatanatya dance drama with live orchestra was performed by Natyam 
Ensemble, choreographed by Malavika Venkatsubbaiah, at Thousand Faces 
Festival on May 26 and 27, Alberta Avenue Community Centre, Edmonton, 
Canada. 

In the iAge of iPhones and iPads and iEverything, it is deeply 
satisfying to be reminded that iHumans are connected by more than 
technology. As the Hindu tradition has it, we are part of an animating 
force that we cannot imagine, yet which enables us to imagine; the force
 we cannot see, yet which enables us to see; the force which gives us 
the capacity to move beyond the limits of ego to a deeper connection 
with the mystery of our own creation.

Hindu philosophy names this force Shakti (empowerment), the primordial 
cosmic energy that animates everything, the energy behind the cycle of 
destruction, creation and sustenance. Reflected in many human traditions
 as the Divine Mother, Feminine Power, the Mother Goddess; as Diana, 
Isis, Guan-yin, Tara, Venus, Athena, the Virgin Mary; the Hindu concept 
of Shakti is a feminine energy that takes all that is inanimate and 
brings it to life: Maha Devi (the Great Goddess) who gives both agency 
and purpose to the Triune of Creator-Sustainer-Dissolver 
(Brahma-Vishnu-Shiva).

In the fourth canto of Hymns in Praise of the Goddess (Devi Mahatma), 
the Maha Devi is described as the impelling spirit within every atom, 
who spreads the universe before her and pervades it 
(sarvasrayaakhilam idam jagadangsabhutam / avyakrita 
hi parama prakritistvamaadyaa).Yet she remains illusory, beyond 
the understanding of even the gods of the Triune, hence she is MahaMaya,
 or the Grand Illusion. The allegory is that the human life of the 
iWorld is itself an illusion; in the ferocious cosmic swirl, I-ness and 
ego are the fixed point of reference which enables us to ground 
ourselves in the belief of autonomous individual existence. To rise 
beyond to achieve a greater understanding of who we are and why we are, 
the Devi's shakti enables us to overcome the demons of our own nature, 
the demons within us all, to seek a higher calling. Thus, the Maha Devi 
becomes the vessel and the refuge for our journey across life's 
difficult ocean.

In Natyam Dance Academy's MahaMaya, artistic director Malavika 
Venkatsubbaiah leavens this dense philosophy in a dazzling swirl of 
colour and movement, imbued with power and grace, tableaux lasting an 
instant before dissolving into the next, in a skilled ensemble of seven 
that dances as one.

MahaMaya is a spellbinding work, in which one enters with senses 
awakened, being in the moment without ever wanting to leave it. It 
brings alive the potential for the classical Indian dance form 
Bharatanatya to be presented as a swift yet evanescent spectacle, 
breathtaking images that fade so swiftly even as they remain in the 
mind's eye.The rhythmic slapping of feet on the hard floor to the beat 
of the drum- energetic and intricate mridanga by talented Curtis 
Andrews, a particularly lyrical violin by Kaushik Shivaramakrishnan, and
 the hypnotic hymns of the orchestra's soulful vocalist Maha Narasimhan 
and nattuvanga by Dr. Kanchana Sivalingam, all bring a full engagement 
of the senses.

As practised so ably by Malavika in her career as a solo dancer, 
Bharatanatya has a particular grace dictated by its prescribed postures 
and gestures, a strict lyricism, and a pace that allows the audience to 
remark on the subtlety of facial expression and hand gestures. Performed
 in a dance drama format in a swiftly paced ensemble, the effects become
 amplified and multiplied, until one stops watching and simply 
surrenders to the experience. The two narrative themes of MahaMaya were 
the killing of the demons Raktabija (blood-seed, the self-perpetuating 
monster that is an allegory for insatiable desire) and Mahishasura (the 
Great Demon, an allegory for the human ego and the illusion of 
attachment to material objects). 

It is testament of Malavika's evolution as a dancer that her mastery of 
facial expressions and hand gestures seems completely effortless; she 
evokes the presence of the great goddess in both benign and terrifying 
forms, radiating ferocity then transforming to serenity; with a 
particularly compelling evocation of the goddess vanquishing the stream 
of desires by lapping up the blood of Raktabija, and liberating 
Mahishasura with a decisive spear thrust to release his captive soul 
from its buffalo-headed body.

There is a particular grace and fluidity in the ensemble's rendition of 
the Hymn to the Cosmic Dance of the Goddess (Durga Tandava Stotram), in 
which the slayer of the demon Mahisha strides supreme across the 
universe. The expressions of the ensemble remain serenely blissful even 
as they move with sweat-inducing energy through a dizzying array of 
steps and formations, without any sign of breaking a sweat. This is 
where Malavika's skills as a choreographer truly shine. Among the 
exceptional performances of a talented and flawlessly united ensemble, 
Abigail Seewald's expression of the serene face (saumya-badana) of the 
goddess is worthy of kudos. The talented ensemble consisted of Abigail 
Seewald, Visesha Murthy, Hasha Sasitharan, Jacqueline Karatha as 
Raktabija, Shivangi Nagarajan as Mahisha, Malavika Venkatsubbaiah as 
MahaMaya.

MahaMaya takes Bharatanatya to a new dimension, blending lyrical beauty 
with a breathtaking athleticism, offering both a meditation and a 
blessing. It is Malavika Venkatsubbaiah's most polished and evocative 
work to date, transcending the particularity of its origins to present a
 vivid and deeply moving evocation of the forces that bind us.

J. von Schelling and sets his thought against his contemporary, G. W. F. Hegel. He argues that Schelling inaugurates a new thinking outside of Occidental metaphysics, by a paradoxical manner of exit, which prepares for the post-metaphysical philosophy of Martin Heidegger, Franz Rosenzweig and Jacques Derrida. This groundbreaking work contests the universal, homogenizing world politics of modernity through its rereading of Schelling's later work and its rethinking of religious eschatology. Intervening in contemporary debates concerning the post-secular, the return of religion, and political theology, Das shows that religion, in an essential sense, can open up infinitude from the heart of finitude to an irreducible outside of the profane order of worldly hegemonies. Religion here assumes a negative political theology of exception without sovereign power. Schelling's late political theology − far from being a conservative relic of the 19th century, as critics have sometimes suggested − opens up avenues for thinking our common being-together and for forming a political theology worthy of the new millennium.

What is renewed here is the thought of a pure future beyond all that is given and outside of any immanence of self-presence; it is the thought of a promise of time that opens us, on the basis of an irreducible mortality, to the advent of redemptive, messianic future which is incalculable. Along the lines of Heidegger’s notion of ‘Phenomenology of the Inapparent’ as a point of departure, and taking inspiration from thinkers like Schelling, Rosenzweig and Walter Benjamin, this work attempts to work towards a phenomenology of promise that—no longer founding upon eidetic consciousness—takes its bearing from our exposure to the excess of an immemorial promise and its unforeseen fulfilment that arrives from an eternal remnant of time beyond all ‘end’ and all ‘completion’. In this manner, this work argues that the highest ethico-political task of our time is to keep our human condition open for the immemorial promise and redemptive, messianic fulfilment beyond closures of all sorts and to welcome what is always to come without reducing it to various immanent politics of self-consumption. This demands the work of deconstruction of the metaphysical foundation of a historical reason in order to open it up to the messianic affirmation of the event of future. This work contributes in a significant and original manner to the growing and upcoming inter-disciplinary studies that combine philosophical thinking from a certain deconstructive-phenomenological perspective with theological-political studies, added to insights drawn from the place of language from contemporary philosophers like Jean Luc Nancy, Phillippe Lacoue Labarthe and Jean Louis Chrétien.   Bookmark  Download  More  EditView Impact  Readers    Mentions  PapersAt JNU all that is beautiful and "solid has melted into the air" JNU  Bookmark  More  EditView Impact  Readers    Mentions  The Infinite Contestation Indian Politics and Sahitya Akademi  Bookmark  More  EditView Impact  Readers    Mentions  Death, Time and the Other.pdf Ethics, Death, Metaphysics of Time, Émmanuel Lévinas, Martin Heidegger, and 1 more  Bookmark  Download  More  EditView Impact  Readers    Mentions  And the World Should be Made a Desert Philosophy of Literature, Continental Philosophy, Literature and Philosophy, Art and Philosophy, and Existence  Bookmark  Download  More  EditView Impact  Readers    Mentions  The Political Theology of SchellingSaitya Brata Das rigorously examines the theologico-political works of F.

If the task of the world-historical politics of the profane order is none other than happiness itself, this happiness however can be attained there only at the price of singularity. As a result happiness in true sense can never be the conditio sine qua non  for the world-historical reason, a conditio which is the passion of singularity par excellence. Only for the singulars beatitudo can be the eternal passion of existence; in other words, singularity essentially is this passion and none but that. Only such singularity can open itself to true universality, not as a particular mode of given being, but as existence which is first of all exposed to itself through such an eternal passion conditio sine qua non. Taking Kierkegaard’s works as main reference point, this paper argues that the singular notion of beatitudo (beatitudo itself is an idea of singularity), in its irreducibility to the historical reason, and to any theodicy of history, is essentially an eschatological opening of history to the true conditio sine qua non. Beatitudo, understood thus, is the unconditional and absolute demand of the mortals that can only arrive as a gift that marks everything that is “human” with the mark of non-autarchy and non-autochthony. Nothing of the world-historical politics therefore raises itself to the arrival of beatitudo , but only as the eschatological suspension of its law, and abandonment ( Gelassenheit: an idea from Meister Eckhart) of all sovereign claims, or all claims to sovereignty.
