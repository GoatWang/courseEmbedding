Description


The Old Testament book of Ezekiel is filled with visions and prophecies  the Lord revealed to His prophet. Although these revelations were given to the people  of Israel during their Babylonian captivity, many of them are yet to be fulfilled.  Ezekiel gives warnings of punishment for evil practices and waywardness but also  glorious promises to encourage those who seek to honor the Lord even in the midst  of trials. Bible students are often puzzled by these difficult visions  and fail to perceive God's central message--that He alone is Lord. Dr. Ralph Alexander  discusses each section of the prophecy in summary and then treats the major themes,  dealing with various questions and problems that arise.

ROBERT L. HUBBARD (A.B, Wheaton College; B.D., Fuller Theological Seminary; M.A., Ph.D., Claremont Graduate School) is Professor of Biblical Literature at North Park Theological Seminary in Chicago, IL. He also taught at Denver Seminary and served as a chaplain on active duty in the United States Navy and in the United States Naval Reserve. Dr. Hubbard is author of The Book of Ruth: New International Commentary on the Old Testament (Eerdmans, 1988), which received the Christianity Today Critics Choice Award as the best commentary of 1989.


By the waters of Babylon, in the sixth century B.C., the Jewish people felt like permanent refugees in a foreign land. Israel had undergone captivity once before, in Egypt. This time the people were in exile because of disobedience.

  The books of 1 and 2 Kings were meant as an antidote for the sorrow of heart that afflicted their souls. Robert L. Hubbard, Jr. guides you through the maze of kings and empires, prophets and priests, that are the subjects of those two Old Testament historical books. In those books, Hubbard says, are "peaks of unbelievable glory and valleys of unforgettable despair."

  His study of 1 and 2 Kings and of the chaotic time chronicled in those books is written in a comfortable style but with scholarly care. Hubbard applies to our lives today the lessons learned through years of pain. Scholar and layman alike will appreciate the combination of readability and scholarly investigation that marks this book.

The Old Testament book of Ezekiel is filled with visions and prophecies the Lord revealed to His prophet. Although these revelations were given to the people of Israel during their Babylonian captivity, many of them are yet to be fulfilled. Ezekiel gives warnings of punishment for evil practices and waywardness but also glorious promises to encourage those who seek to honor the Lord even in the midst of trials.

   Bible students are often puzzled by these difficult visions and fail to perceive God's central message--that He alone is Lord. Dr. Ralph Alexander discusses each section of the prophecy in summary and then treats the major themes, dealing with various questions and problems that arise.

Publisher's Description▼▲
The Old Testament book of Ezekiel is filled with visions and prophecies the Lord revealed to His prophet. Although these revelations were given to the people of Israel during their Babylonian captivity, many of them are yet to be fulfilled. Ezekiel gives warnings of punishment for evil practices and waywardness but also glorious promises to encourage those who seek to honor the Lord even in the midst of trials. Bible students are often puzzled by these difficult visions and fail to perceive God's central message--that He alone is Lord. Dr. Ralph Alexander discusses each section of the prophecy in summary and then treats the major themes, dealing with various questions and problems that arise.


Author Bio▼▲

ALEXANDER (B.A., Rice University; Th.M., Th.D., Dallas Theological Seminary) is professor of Hebrew Scripture and chariman of the Division of Bible Studies at Western Conservative Baptist Seminary, Portland, Oregon.
