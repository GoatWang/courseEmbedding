914INC. / Q4 2013 / Women in Business ’13: Jane Wasman 








Women in Business ’13: Jane Wasman The president of Acorda Therapeutics’ International & General Counsel BY Marisa LaScala







	Debuting a new drug and marketing it, with all the FDA regulations attached, is legally tricky, to say the least. So is taking a company public, making sure it complies with all SEC regulations post-IPO. So is, for that matter, expanding a company—not just nationally, but internationally.

	Jane Wasman, president, international & general counsel of Acorda Therapeutics, a pharmaceutical company in Ardsley, has done all this, and more. She joined Acorda’s in-house legal team in 2004, shortly before the release of Zanaflex capsules, its first marketed product, which reduces muscle spasticity in patients with MS, spinal cord injuries, and brain trauma. She helped the company build its marketing and distribution infrastructure “almost overnight,” she says, which is no small feat considering all the regulations put on marketing pharmaceuticals. Two years later, she served as chief general counsel during Acorda’s IPO, bringing the company public while still negotiating major product and company acquisition deals. Earlier this year, she spearheaded a redesign of operations that better allowed for collaboration within the company—and now she has her sites set abroad, participating in strategic planning for Acorda to expand internationally.

	But what really drives Wasman is the end result of her work—not the bottom line. “This company is devoted to helping improve the lives of people who are dealing with really devastating medical conditions and diseases,” she says. “That’s what we come to work for every day. We’re developing drugs that make a difference in people’s lives.” She cites bringing the drug Ampyra to market as one of her greatest career achievements, since it helps people with multiple sclerosis improve their ability to walk. “We should all feel proud of that,” she says.

	Wasman also takes pride in mentoring the approximately 25 people who report to her, many of whom are also women. “It’s great for them to see that a woman can, in fact, get to the executive team,” she says. She notes that women comprise 59 percent of Acorda’s full-time employees, for no reason other than the company “genuinely values diversity.” 

	Looking beyond her company, Wasman contributes to the area’s biotech boom by serving on the board of New York Bio (formerly NYBA). “New York as a state has everything to be a major biotech hub, and we haven’t quite gotten there yet,” she says. “We have some of the best university and research institutions in the world, we have a major financial center, and New York and New Jersey have great companies. It just hasn’t all pulled together. We can work with people in the surrounding areas and make that happen.”

HAWTHORNE, N.Y., Feb 13, 2012 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Acorda Therapeutics, Inc.(Nasdaq: ACOR) today   announced that Jane Wasman, J.D. has been named Chief, Strategic Development.

Previously, she held various leadership positions at   Schering-Plough Corporation, including Staff Vice President and Associate   General Counsel. Prior to Schering-Plough, Ms. Wasman specialized in litigation   and also served as Associate General Counsel to the U.S. Senate Committee on   Veteran's Affairs. 
"In the coming years, Acorda has an opportunity to make significant   contributions to patients as we assess additional indications for AMPYRA(R) and   advance our pipeline products, which are being studied as potential treatments   for a range of unmet medical needs in neurology as well as in heart failure,"   said Ms. Wasman. "I look forward to collaborating with my colleagues throughout   the organization to support Acorda's growth and maximize shareholder value." 
Ms. Wasman graduated Magna Cum Laude from Princeton University, and earned   her J.D. from Harvard Law School. She is a member of the Board of Directors and   of the Executive Committee of the Board of the New York Biotechnology   Association (NYBA). 
About Acorda Therapeutics 
Acorda Therapeutics is a biotechnology company focused on developing   therapies that restore function and improve the lives of people with MS, spinal   cord injury and other neurological conditions. 
Acorda markets AMPYRA(R) (dalfampridine) Extended Release Tablets, 10 mg, in   the United States as a treatment to improve walking in patients with multiple   sclerosis (MS). This was demonstrated by an improvement in walking speed. AMPYRA   is marketed outside the United States as FAMPYRA(R) (prolonged-release   fampridine tablets) by Biogen Idec under a licensing agreement from Acorda.   AMPYRA and FAMPYRA are manufactured under license from Alkermes Pharma Ireland   Limited. 
The Company also markets ZANAFLEX CAPSULES(R) (tizanidine hydrochloride) and   Zanaflex tablets, a short-acting drug for the management of spasticity. Acorda   also receives sales royalties on tizanidine hydrochloride tablets, an authorized   generic version of ZANAFLEX CAPSULES distributed by Watson Pharmaceutics, Inc.   under its agreement with Acorda. 
Acorda is developing an industry-leading pipeline of novel neurological   therapies. The Company is studying AMPYRA to improve a range of functional   impairments caused by MS, as well as its use in other neurological conditions,   including cerebral palsy and chronic stroke. In addition, Acorda is developing   clinical stage compounds AC105 for acute treatment of spinal cord injury and   GGF2 for treatment of heart failure. GGF2 is also being investigated in   preclinical studies as a treatment for neurological conditions such as stroke   and spinal cord injury. Additional preclinical programs include rHIgM22, a   remyelinating monoclonal antibody for the treatment of MS, and chondroitinase,   an enzyme that encourages nerve plasticity in spinal cord injury.
