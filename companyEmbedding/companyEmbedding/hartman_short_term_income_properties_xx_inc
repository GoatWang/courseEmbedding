Hartman XX Supplement No 7 to Prospectus dated March 30, 2015
 
CONSIDER THESE RISK FACTORS BEFORE INVESTING
THIS IS NEITHER AN OFFER TO SELL NOR A SOLICITATION OF AN OFFER TO BUY THE SECURITIES DESCRIBED HEREIN. AN OFFERING IS MADE ONLY BY PROSPECTUS. THIS LITERATURE MUST BE PRECEDED OR ACCOMPANIED BY A CURRENT HARTMAN SHORT TERM INCOME PROPERTIES XX, INC. PROSPECTUS. AS SUCH, A COPY OF THE CURRENT PROSPECTUS MUST BE MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU IN CONNECTION WITH THIS OFFERING AND SHOULD BE READ IN ORDER TO MORE FULLY UNDERSTAND THE IMPLICATIONS AND RISKS OF THE OFFERING OF SECURITIES TO WHICH IT RELATES. NON-TRADED REIT INVESTMENTS ARE NOT SUITABLE FOR ALL INVESTORS.
INFORMATION ABOUT INVESTING IN A SPECIFIC NON-TRADED REIT MUST BE ACCOMPANIED BY A PROSPECTUS, WHICH SHOULD BE READ PRIOR TO INVESTING.
No offering is made except by a prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Neither the SEC nor any other state or federal regulator has passed on or endorsed the merits of this offering or these securities or confirmed the adequacy or accuracy of the prospectus. Any representation to the contrary is unlawful. All information contained in this material is qualified in its entirety by the terms of the current prospectus. The achievement of any goals is not guaranteed.
All information contained in this material is qualified in its entirety by the terms of the current prospectus. Investors should consider a fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses before investing. The achievement of any goals is not guaranteed. For more complete information about investing in HSTIPXX, including risks, charges and expenses, refer to our prospectus. Securities offered through D.H. Hill Securities, LLLP, Member FINRA / SIPC, 1543 Green Oak Place, Ste. 100, Kingwood, TX 77339. (832) 644-1852.
Please read the prospectus in its entirety, before investing, for complete information and to learn more about the risks associated with this offering such as:

We commenced operations on December 28, 2010, have a limited operating history and have experienced losses in the past and may experience losses in the future. There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully achieve our investment objectives.
The amount of distributions we may pay, if any, is uncertain. Due to the risks involved in the ownership of real estate, there is no guarantee of any return on your investment in our shares, and you may lose all or a portion of your investment.
There is currently no public market for our common shares and therefore, it likely will be difficult for you to sell your shares, and if you are able to sell your shares, you will likely sell them at a substantial discount.
There are restrictions and limitations on your ability to have all or any portion of your shares redeemed under our share redemption program, and if you are able to have your shares repurchased pursuant to our share redemption program, it may be for a price less than the price you paid for the shares and the then current value of the shares.
The offering price of our shares of common stock for this offering was not determined on an independent basis and bears no relationship to the book or net value of our assets or to our expected operating income.
We have made a limited number of investments and other than investments and prospective investments disclosed in this prospectus, we have not identified any specific assets to acquire or investments to make with the proceeds of this offering. As a result, you will not have the opportunity to evaluate our investments, aside from our limited number of existing investments, prior to your investment.
We rely on Hartman Advisors, LLC and its affiliates for our day-to-day operations and the selection of real estate investments. We pay substantial fees to these affiliates for these services. These affiliates are subject to conflicts of interest as a result of this and other relationships they have with us and other programs sponsored by our sponsor. We also compete with affiliates of our sponsor for tenants and investment opportunities, and some of those affiliates will have priority with respect to specified investment opportunities.
To date, distributions have been paid from offering proceeds and may be paid from offering proceeds or other sources other than cash from operations, such as borrowings, in the future. We have not established a limit on the amount of proceeds from this offering that we may use to fund distributions. Therefore, portions of the distributions that we make may represent a return of capital to you, which will lower your tax basis in our shares.
This is a “best efforts” offering and if we are unable to raise substantial funds then we will be limited in the number and type of investments we may make.
We have made and may continue to make distributions in excess of our earnings and cash generated by operations. Distributions in excess of earnings and or cash generated by operations reduces the amount of capital available for investment in real property.
We are subject to risks generally incident to the ownership of real property.
Our use of leverage increases the risk of loss on our investments.
We have elected to be taxed as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. If we fail to continue to qualify as a REIT, it would adversely affect our operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and may have adverse tax consequences to our stockholders.

HARTMAN SHORT TERM INCOME PROPERTIES XX, INC.   HARTMAN SHORT TERM INCOME PROPERTIES XX, INC. SUPPLEMENT NO. 3 DATED FEBRUARY 8, 2012 TO THE PROSPECTUS DATED FEBRUARY 9, 2010  This document supplements, and should be read in conjunction, with, the prospectus of Hartman Short Term Income Properties XX, Inc. (the"Company") dated February 9, 2010. This Supplement No. 3 supersedes and replaces all previous supplements to the prospectus. Unless otherwise defined in this supplement, capitalized terms used in this supplement shall have the same meanings as set forth in the prospectus.  The purpose of this supplement is to describe the following:   (1)               Status of our public offering;   (2)               Change of Dealer Manager;   (3)               Change of Contact Information;   (4)               Declaration of Distributions;   (5)               Completion of Acquisition of additional interest in a shopping center in Richardson, Texas;    (6)               Placement of debt on Richardson Heights Shopping Center;   (7)               Revisions to our Risk Factors;   (8)               Modification of Directors and Executive Officers Section;    (9)               Clarification of  Advisory Agreement;   (10)           Revisions to Conflicts of Interest   (11)           Revisions to Certain Conflict Resolution Procedures   (12)           Revision to Meetings and Special Voting Requirements;   (13)           Revision to Restrictions on Roll-Up Transactions;   (14)           Update of the Subscription Process;    (15)           Update of Minimum Offering Section   (16)           Incorporation by reference of certain  information into our prospectus;   (17)           Modified form of Subscription Agreement.   1      1. Status of Our Public Offering  We commenced our initial public offering of 27,500,000 shares of common stock on February 9, 2010.  Of these shares, we are offering 25,000,000 shares in a primary offering and have reserved and are offering 2,500,000 shares pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan.  Pursuant to the terms of the offering, we were required to deposit all subscription proceeds in escrow pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement with Trustmark Bank until we received subscription aggregating at least $2,000,000.  As of December 20, 2010, we had satisfied these conditions of the Escrow Agreement.  As of February 1, 2012 we had accepted investors' subscriptions for, and issued, 1,903,527.3637 shares of our common stock in the offering, resulting in gross proceeds of $18,669,583.37.  We will offer shares of our common stock pursuant to the offering until the earliest to occur of (a) our selling shares equal to our maximum offering of $250,000,000, (b) our board of directors determining to terminate the offering, or (c) three years from the effective date of this offering. Our board of directors has the discretion to extend the offering period for the shares being sold pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan up to the sixth anniversary of the termination of the primary offering, in which case we will notify participants in the plan of such extension or until all of the shares designated for the distribution reinvestment plan have been sold to participants if earlier. The offering must be registered in every state in which we offer or sell shares.  Generally, such registrations are for a period of one year.  Thus, we may have to stop selling shares in any state in which our registration is not renewed or otherwise extended annually.  2. Change of Dealer Manager  On December 5, 2011, Allied Beacon Partners, Inc. ("Beacon") notified us of its intention to terminate effective February 3, 2012 the dealer manager agreement dated March 25, 2009, between us and Allied Beacon Partners, Inc. formerly known as American Beacon Partners, Inc. and Pavek Investments, Inc. (as amended, the"Beacon Dealer Manager Agreement").  Pursuant to Section 9 of the Beacon Dealer Manager Agreement, either party may terminate the Beacon Dealer Manager Agreement without cause or penalty upon sixty (60) days notice to the other party.  Beacon continued to serve as dealer manager of the offering until February 3, 2012.  We have entered into an agreement for D.H. Hill Securities LLLP, Humble, Texas to act as our dealer manager effective February 3, 2012.  Beacon is expected to enter into an agreement with D.H. Hill Securities to continue to sell shares of our common stock during the remainder of the offering period.

Risks Related to Conflicts of Interest  The risk factor captioned" Risks Related to Conflicts of Interest -- Our advisor's executive officers and key personnel of Hartman-affiliated entities that conduct our day-to-day operations and this offering will face competing demands on their time, and this may cause our return to suffer" on page 36 of the prospectus is superseded and replaced as follows:     Risks Related to Conflicts of Interest -- executive officers and key personnel of our advisor and property manager will face competing demands on their time, and this may cause our return to suffer.  We rely upon the executive officers and employees of our advisor and our property manager to conduct our day-to day operations and this offering.  These persons also conduct the day-to-day operations of other Hartman-sponsored programs and may have other business interests as well.  Because these persons have competing interests on their time and resources, they may have conflicts of interest in allocating their time between our business and these other activities.  During times of intense activity in other programs and ventures, they may devote less time and resources to our business than is necessary or appropriate.  If this occurs, we may lose the opportunity to enter into or renew a lease or to purchase or sell a property and the returns on our investments may suffer.  Our advisor holds a fiduciary relationship to us and to our shareholders and will endeavor to avoid putting us in a situation where we would lose an economic opportunity due to the inability of our advisor or property manager to perform a necessary task.  If our advisor or our property manager were to fail to perform a task necessary to us, our advisor   6      or property manager could be in breach of a fiduciary duty to us and our shareholders.  8.

Committees of the Board of Directors  Our entire board of directors considers all major decisions concerning our business, including any property acquisitions. However, we have established an audit committee, a compensation committee and a nominating committee so that certain functions can be addressed in more depth than may be possible at a full board meeting. Independent directors comprise all of the members of the audit committee, compensation committee and nominating committee.  Audit Committee  The audit committee meets on a regular basis at least four times a year. Our audit committee is comprised of our two independent directors, Jack Tompkins and Richard Ruskey. Our board of directors has adopted our Audit Committee Charter and it is posted on Hartman's web site at www.hi-reit.com. The audit committee's primary functions are to evaluate and approve the services and fees of our independent auditors; to periodically review the auditors' independence; and to assist our board of directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities by reviewing the financial information to be provided to the stockholders and others, the system of internal controls that management has established, and the audit and financial reporting process.  Compensation Committee  We have established a compensation committee to assist the board of directors in discharging its responsibility in all matters of compensation practices, including any salary and other forms of compensation for our officers and our directors, and employees in the event we ever have   9      employees. Our compensation committee is comprised of our two independent directors, Jack Tompkins and Richard R. Ruskey. Our board of directors has adopted our Compensation Committee Charter and it is posted on Hartman's web site at www.hi-reit.com. The primary duties of the compensation committee include reviewing all forms of compensation for our executive officers, if any, and our directors; approving all stock option grants, warrants, stock appreciation rights and other current or deferred compensation payable with respect to the current or future value of our shares; and advising on changes in compensation of members of the board of directors.  Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee  We have established a nominating committee. Our nominating committee is comprised of our two independent directors, Jack Tompkins and Richard R. Ruskey. Our board of directors has adopted our Nominating Committee Charter and it is posted on Hartman's web site at www.hi-reit.com. The nominating committee will recommend nominees to serve on our board of directors. The nominating committee will consider nominees recommended by stockholders if submitted to the committee in accordance with the procedures specified in our bylaws. Generally, this requires that the stockholder send certain information about the nominee to our corporate secretary between 90 and 120 days prior to the first anniversary of the mailing of notice for the annual meeting held in the prior year. Because our directors take a critical role in guiding our strategic direction and oversee our management, board candidates must demonstrate broad-based business and professional skills and experiences, concern for the long-term interests of our stockholders, and personal integrity and judgment. In addition, directors must have time available to devote to board activities and to enhance their knowledge of our industry. The nominating committee is responsible for assessing the appropriate mix of skills and characteristics required of board members in the context of the perceived needs of the board at a given point in time and shall periodically review and recommend for approval by the board any updates to the criteria as deemed necessary. Diversity in personal background, race, gender, age and nationality for the board as a whole may be taken into account favorably in considering individual candidates. The nominating committee will evaluate the qualifications of each director candidate against these criteria in making its recommendation to the board concerning nominations for election or reelection as a director. The process for evaluating candidates recommended by our stockholders pursuant to our bylaws will be no different than the process for evaluating other candidates considered by the nominating committee.  9. The Advisory Agreement The following information supersedes and replaces in its entirety the first paragraph after the bullet points on page 67 of the prospectus in the section captioned"The Advisory Agreement": The advisory agreement has a one-year term that may be renewed for an unlimited number of successive one-year periods. The current advisory agreement has been renewed through February 9, 2013.  It will be the duty of our board of directors to evaluate the performance of our advisor before entering into or renewing an advisory agreement. The criteria used in such evaluation, including consideration of the reasonableness of advisor compensation in relation to the return to investors, will be reflected in the minutes of such meeting. In addition, either party may   10      terminate the advisory agreement upon 60 days' written notice without cause or penalty. If we elect to terminate the agreement, we must obtain the approval of a majority of our independent directors. In the event of the termination of our advisory agreement, our advisor is required to cooperate with us and take all reasonable steps requested by us to assist our board of directors in making an orderly transition of the advisory function.   10. Conflicts of Interest The following section is added to the prospectus immediately following the section captioned"Conflicts of Interest-Property Manager" on page 81 of the Prospectus: Irvine Venture Law Firm LLP and James H. Stokes, Jr., our General Counsel, each act, and may in the future act, as counsel to us, Hartman Advisors, Hartman Income REIT Management, Inc. and their affiliates in connection with the Offering.  There is a possibility that in the future the interests of the various parties may become adverse, and under the Code of Professional Responsibility of the legal profession, Irvine Venture Law Firm, LLP or James H. Stokes, Jr. may be precluded from representing any one or all of such parties.  In the event that a dispute were to arise between us, Hartman Advisors, Hartman Income REIT Management, Inc. or any of our respective affiliates, separate counsel for such matters will be retained as and when appropriate. 11. Certain Conflict Resolution Procedures The following information supersedes and replaces in its entirety the sections of our prospectus captioned" Conflicts of Interest -- Certain Conflict Resolution Procedures-"Our Acquisitions" and"Loans" beginning on page 84 of the prospectus: We expect our independent directors to act on all matters in which a conflict of interest may arise, and all of our directors have a fiduciary obligation to act on behalf of our stockholders. In order to reduce or eliminate certain potential conflicts of interest, our charter contains a number of restrictions relating to conflicts of interest, including the following:  Our Acquisitions. We will not purchase or lease properties in which our sponsor, our advisor,  any of our directors or officers or any of their respective affiliates has an interest without a determination by a majority of the directors, including a majority of the independent directors, not otherwise interested in such transaction that such transaction is fair and reasonable to us and at a price to us no greater than the cost of the property to the seller or lessor unless there is substantial justification for any amount that exceeds such cost and such excess amount is determined to be reasonable. We will not sell or lease properties to our sponsor, our advisor, any of our directors or any of their respective affiliates unless a majority of the directors, including a majority of the independent directors, not otherwise interested in the transaction, determines the transaction is fair and reasonable to us. We expect that from time to time our advisor or its affiliates will temporarily enter into contracts relating to investment in properties and other assets all or a portion of which is to be assigned to us prior to closing or may purchase property or other investments in their own name and temporarily hold title for us. We may, however, purchase properties developed by affiliates of our advisor and our property manager. We will purchase properties from an affiliate at a price designed to afford such affiliate a reasonable profit, as   11      approved by our independent directors, but in no case, at a price above the fair market value determined by our independent directors, and by an independent qualified appraiser where the transaction is with an affiliate of our sponsor, advisor or a director. Our independent directors may elect to determine the value of a property based on the application of an appropriate capitalization rate to the property's net income or, in appropriate situations, recent sales prices of comparable properties or they may opt to require an independent appraisal of any such property. The independent directors will determine the appropriate capitalization rate under prevailing market conditions and whether and to what extent the sale of another property should be considered comparable in valuing one or more of our properties. Our conflict resolution guidelines present clear standards for the advisor to follow to determine which of the three Hartman affiliated REITs currently in business will have the first opportunity to purchase, finance or sell a property or to negotiate with a prospective tenant. In such an event, Hartman Advisors and HIR Management will offer properties to be developed to one of the other REITs first and will offer all other commercial rental properties to us first.  Loans. We will not make any loans to our sponsor, our advisor, any of our directors or any of their respective affiliates. In addition, our sponsor, our advisor, our directors and their respective affiliates will not make loans to us or to joint ventures in which we are a joint venture partner unless approved by a majority of the directors, including a majority of the independent directors, not otherwise interested in the transaction as fair, competitive and commercially reasonable, and no less favorable to us than comparable loans between unaffiliated parties. The following information supersedes and replaces in its entirety the section of our prospectus captioned" Conflicts of Interest -- Certain Conflict Resolution Procedures- Allocation of Investment Opportunities" on page 85 of the prospectus: Allocation of Investment Opportunities. In the event of a potential conflict in acquiring a property, Hartman Advisors and HIR Management will offer the first opportunity to purchase properties to be developed to other Hartman sponsored entities and will offer the first opportunity to purchase all other commercial rental properties to us. Our independent directors will have the opportunity to vote on whether to purchase the property made available on the terms offered.  It is the duty of the directors, including the independent directors, to insure that such method of allocating investment opportunities is fairly applied to us.  12. Meetings and Special Voting Requirements  The following information supersedes and replaces the fifth paragraph in the section of our prospectus captioned"Description of Shares - Meetings and Special Voting Requirements" beginning on page 113 of the prospectus: Holders of shares of our common stock are entitled to receive a copy of our stockholder list upon request in connection with the exercise of their voting rights or for other proper and legitimate purposes.

The assets shall be appraised on a consistent basis, and the appraisal will be based on the evaluation of all relevant information and will indicate the value of our assets as of a date immediately prior to the announcement of the proposed Roll-up Transaction. The appraisal shall assume an orderly liquidation of assets over a 12-month period. The terms of the engagement of the independent appraiser shall clearly state that the engagement is for our benefit and the benefit of our stockholders. A summary of the appraisal, indicating all material assumptions underlying the appraisal, shall be included in a report to stockholders in connection with any proposed Roll-up Transaction.  The appraisal shall be filed with the SEC and the states as an exhibit to the registration statement for the Roll-up Transaction.   14.

We include these representations in our subscription agreement in order to prevent persons who do not meet our suitability standards or other investment qualifications from subscribing to purchase our shares. See also the section of this prospectus captioned"How to Subscribe".  Subscriptions will be effective upon either our: (1) acceptance and countersigning of the subscription agreement or (2) admission of the investor as a stockholder, both of which will be evidenced by sending a confirmation of our acceptance of the purchase to the investor.  The date of acceptance will be the date that we admit the investor as a stockholder, which may or may not be the date on which the corresponding confirmation is sent. We reserve the right to reject any subscription in whole or in part, notwithstanding our deposit of the subscription proceeds in an escrow or company account. We may not accept a subscription for shares until at least five business days after the date you receive this final prospectus. Subject to compliance with Rule 15c2-4 of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, our dealer manager and the broker-dealers participating in the offering will submit an investor's check promptly to the escrow agent or to us, as applicable.  14       We will accept or reject subscriptions within 30 days after we receive them. If your subscription agreement is rejected, your funds (including interest, to the extent earned) will be returned to you within ten business days after the date of such rejection. If your subscription is accepted, you will receive a confirmation of your purchase after you have been admitted as an investor. After raising the minimum offering amount, we expect to admit new investors at least monthly.  15. Minimum Offering  The following information supersedes and replaces the section of our prospectus captioned"Minimum Offering" beginning on page 133 of the prospectus:  Subscription proceeds were placed in escrow until such time as subscriptions to purchase at least $2.0 million of shares of common stock were received and accepted by us (the"Minimum Offering"), which occurred as of December 20, 2010. Any shares purchased by our advisor or its affiliates were not counted in calculating the Minimum Offering. Funds in escrow were invested in short-term investments, which included obligations of, or obligations guaranteed by, the U.S. government or bank money-market accounts or certificates of deposit of national or state banks that have deposits insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Subscribers could not withdraw funds from the escrow account.  If the Minimum Offering had not been received and accepted by February 9, 2011 (one year after the date of this prospectus), our escrow agent would have promptly notified us, and we would have terminated this offering and your funds (including interest, to the extent earned) and subscription agreement would have been returned to you promptly after the date of such termination. In such event, our escrow agent was obligated to use its best efforts to obtain an executed Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 from each subscriber whose subscription was rejected. In the event that a subscriber failed to remit an executed Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 to our escrow agent prior to the date our escrow agent returned the subscriber's funds, our escrow agent would have been required to withhold from such funds 28.0% of the earnings attributable to such subscriber in accordance with Treasury Regulations.   16.

CONSIDER THESE RISK FACTORS BEFORE INVESTING
The offering is being made by means of a Prospectus only to qualified investors who meet minimum suitability requirements, as well as standards determined by your financial advisor. This material must be preceded or accompanied by the Hartman Short Term Income Properties XX, Inc. (“Hartman XX” or the “REIT”) Prospectus. Please read the Prospectus in its entirety, before investing, for complete information and to learn more about the risks associated with this offering such as:

Hartman XX is a “blind pool,” as it has not identified all of the properties it intends to purchase, and it has a limited operating history.
This investment has limited liquidity. There is no guarantee of a liquidity event. No public market exists for this non-traded REIT, and one may never exist, for the shares of our common stock. There is also the possibility that even if investors were able to sell their shares, they may have to sell them at a substantial discount.
Investors should have an expected investment time horizon in excess of five years.
There is no guarantee that investors will receive or continue to receive distributions. Distributions have been paid from the proceeds of the offering, and may be derived from borrowings, or from the sale of assets, and Hartman XX has no limits on the amounts it may pay from such other sources. Distributions have come from the offering proceeds and paid in excess of earnings. Distributions from sources other than cash flow from operations may decrease or diminish an investor’s interest.
Conflicts of interest between Hartman XX and its advisor and its affiliates, including payments by the REIT of significant fees to the advisor and its affiliates, some of which are payable based upon factors other than the quality of services provided to us. These fees could influence our advisor’s advice to us as well as the judgment of affiliates to our advisor performing service to us.
Economic factors affecting the commercial real estate markets generally, including changes in the economy, tenant turnover, interest rates, of mortgage funds, operating expenses, cost of insurance and each tenant’s ability to continue to pay rent.
No connection between the share price of the REIT and the net asset value of the REIT until such time as the assets are valued the Board of Directors.
If Hartman XX fails to qualify as a REIT, it will be subject to federal income tax. Cash available for distributions could decrease materially and adversely affect the return on your investment.
Leverage (debt) is borrowed money. It is often used to supplement or enhance the total return on an investment However, it is also recognized that leverage, when used excessively, can have a significant negative impact on theperformance of an investment. Leverage risks may include an inability to pay off the interest from the cash flow from the property. Rates on loans can adjust to higher levels, and there’s potential for default on loans. In an effort to maximize the performance of a REIT portfolio, a number of factors are considered in evaluating financing options. Some of the more common factors include cost of capital, fixed versus variable debt, loan-to-value and debt coverage ratio.

The names, logos and all related product and service names, design marks and slogans are the trademarks or service marks of their respective companies.
Hartman Income REIT is the sponsor of Hartman XX. Hartman Advisors LLC is the Company’s advisor.
This material contains forward-looking statements to the business and financial outlook of Hartman XX and its advisor that are based management’s current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections and are not guarantees of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in these statements, and you should not undue reliance on any such statements. A number of important factors could cause actual results to differ from the statements contained in this material.

'Not priced' REITs rattle Lerner clients






Jul 17, 2011 @ 12:01 am
By 
	Bruce Kelly























      Clients of David Lerner Associates Inc. holding shares in nontraded REITs created by Apple REIT Cos. Inc. received account statements at the end of last month in which the longtime value of the shares was shown as “not priced.” For years, shares of the real estate investment trusts were listed at $11 on client account statements. The firm continued to list the same price after the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority Inc. in 2009 told broker-dealers to adjust prices on the investments more frequently. Finra also prohibited broker-dealers from using information more than 18 months old to estimate the value of a nontraded REIT.
				



At the end of May, Finra filed a complaint against David Lerner, alleging that the firm was misleading investors and marketing unsuitable investment products to them. Finra spokeswoman Nancy Condon declined to comment on the firm's change in account pricing. Since 1992, David Lerner has recommended and sold nearly $6.8 billion in Apple REIT shares, according to Finra.  “There have been some questions from investors” about the change of the value of the REITs shown on account statements, said Joseph Pickard, senior vice president and general counsel with David Lerner, which is based in Syosset, N.Y. When asked if investors are anxious about the change, he said, “I can't answer that.” Client account statements also show the cost of investment in the Apple REITs, which is either $10.50 or $11 per share.  Mr. Pickard said there was “no particular reason” for the change, but added that the recent “stir and hoopla in other people's minds” about the REITs' estimated market value contributed to the firm's decision to make the change.  The firm is “absolutely” in compliance with Finra rules and regulations when selling the product, Mr. Pickard said.  The account statement change made by the Lerner firm “is causing serious concern for investors,” said Jake Zamansky, a plaintiff's attorney, who added that his firm, Zamansky & Associates, has spoken with up to 50 David Lerner clients. “People are really looking for clarity here.” A broker-dealer switching a security's value to “not priced” isn't unheard of, but it is far from ordinary, attorneys said. Although some attorneys noted that such a change could be a bad harbinger for any security, another lawyer said that such a price change is a potential step in the right direction.  “The price of $11 per share is most likely a misrepresentation of its true value, which is almost impossible to ascertain and price,” said Phil Aidikoff, a plaintiff's attorney who has been following the David Lerner case but has no investors with the firm as clients.  “Issues of pricing have been going on for a long time in the securities business,” Mr. Aidikoff said.  Having nontraded REITs listed as “not priced” on client account statements is not “systemic,” said Kevin Hogan, executive director of the Investment Program Association, a trade group that includes nontraded REITs and the broker-dealers that sell them. He added that he had “no idea” whether any other REITs have recently made such a change on client account statements.  Finra's complaint against David Lerner has renewed concerns among broker-dealers about the sales of illiquid investments such as nontraded REITs and private placements.

A few small nontraded REITs recently have made disclosures revealing problems, or at least the potential for problems, with investments, broker-dealer executives said.  In addition to problems with investments, some smaller REITs may be having a hard time gaining traction with broker-dealers because firms are looking to product sponsors to educate advisers and their clients, said Nicholas Schorsch, CEO of America Realty Capital, which sponsors five nontraded REITs.  Before the credit crisis in 2008, nontraded REITs could be successful simply by showing up, he said. With anxiety running high among investors and broker-dealer executives due to problems with some of the products and the market in general, that way of doing business has changed, Mr. Schorsch said. “The market is getting more difficult. Just because you get to the table doesn't mean you get to play,” he said. The number of nontraded-REIT products has exploded since 2000, practically quadrupling to 45, noted Jeffrey Hanson, CEO of Grubb & Ellis Equity Advisors LLC.  “There's saturation with all the new entrants, and barriers are very real and high,” he said. New nontraded REITs need to raise $15 million to $20 million a month to work, and many simply can't reach that level.  “If you can't get to $20 million, you're going to have further shutdowns,” he said. Problems at smaller nontraded REITs — those that have raised less than $50 million — have caught the attention of the SEC and Finra, which are scrutinizing the popular products sold exclusively through independent broker-dealers.  Around the same time that Finra filed its complaint against David Lerner, several nontraded REITs reported real or potential difficulties.  For example, Desert Capital Real Estate Investment Trust Inc. in April filed for bankruptcy protection, and at the end of May, Todd Parriott, its chief executive, resigned.  Also in April, a member of the board and chairman of the compensation committee resigned from Hartman Short Term Income Properties XX Inc., a nontraded REIT. After the resignation of the director, Larry Bouffard, the company's board authorized the REIT to consider buying pieces of a related REIT, Hartman Short Term Income Properties XIX Inc.  Meanwhile, this month, Bluerock Enhanced Multifamily Trust Inc., which last year pulled its REIT from the market, said that an affiliated broker-dealer, Bluerock Capital Markets LLC, will assume the managing and distribution for its initial public offering.  Sudden changes in a REIT's board or the broker-dealer that sells the product, or the purchasing of properties by one REIT from another related REIT, are indicators that broker-dealers and registered representatives need to pay careful attention to the investment, industry observers said.  “When we see something like this, it raises eyebrows and we'll look into it further,” said Jeff Young, senior vice president with First Financial Equity Corp., a broker-dealer with 125 affiliated reps.  Problems with nontraded REITs often occur off the radar, he said.  The firm has selling agreements with both the Hartman XIX and Hartman XX REITs but passed on selling agreements with the Desert Capital and Bluerock REITs.  “Hartman is a good company, and the properties are good properties,” Mr. Young said.  But First Financial Equity has become “very restrictive” with its selling agreements for investments such as nontraded REITs and private placements.  Mr. Young said that the nontraded-REIT industry does have potential conflicts of interest, particularly if a sponsor of the REITs has more than one program.  First Financial Equity has become more restrictive with the products that it sells just as the industry continues to mushroom, he said.  “I don't have time to talk to all the REIT wholesalers that are knocking on our door,” Mr. Young said.  Executives from the three nontraded-REIT sponsors stressed that the changes were due to market conditions or a normal part of the business.  Finra hasn't filed actions against broker-dealers related to the sale of those three sponsors' REITs.  Desert Capital REIT spokeswoman Carrie Cook attributed her firm's bankruptcy filing to the effect the credit crisis had on real estate in Las Vegas and elsewhere in Nevada.   Allen Hartman said that the changes revealed in April SEC filings by his firm — which owns about $400 million in real estate, mostly in Texas — were a normal part of doing business and were unrelated. He said that he asked Mr. Bouffard, 78, to resign from the board due to his age.  The two REITs bought properties together, and the Hartman XX REIT is buying up the assets of Hartman XIX based on pricing done by an independent third party and approved by the independent board.  R. Ramin Kamfar, owner and chief executive of Bluerock, said that the broker-dealer switch was necessary because the first firm did a poor job selling the product. The firm's own wholesalers began selling the fund last week, Mr. Kamfar said.  E-mail Bruce Kelly at bkelly@investmentnews.com.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
