Finalists for the $10,000 grand prize have been chosen.






Des Moines, Iowa (PRWEB)
March 24, 2015
 Charrette Venture Group has announced the 2015 Architecture Business Plan Competition finalists.  The competition is in its second year and strives to promote entrepreneurialism and best business practices in the field of architecture.  "We received entries from 29 states and three Canadian provinces," said Todd L. Reding, Chief Operations Officer and Vice President for Investments.  "The level of innovation and visioning was impressive," said Reding.  The winner of the competition will receive a $10,000 grand prize at the awards reception in Atlanta, Georgia on May 14, 2015.
Each entrant was asked to create an executive summary covering the main points of their business plan, and accompany with a brief video defining their vision.  A jury of four experienced professionals reviewed every submission.  Five finalists were chosen and have been invited to present their full plan to the jurors in Atlanta, on May 13, 2015.  "We were extremely impressed with the quality of the summaries," said Mark LePage, founder of Entrepreneur Architect and one of this year's jurors.
Charrette Venture Group was founded in 2014 by licensed architect and successful entrepreneur, Matt Ostanik.  The company is focused on developing a knowledge base of best practices, innovations and successful tactics, and applying this knowledge to help entrepreneurial architects start and grow their firms.
The 2015 finalists are;

     John Issa/Branyo Dvorak, Perimeter Architects (Chicago, Illinois)
    Oscia Wilson/Jeffrey Gustis, Boiled Architecture (San Francisco, CA)
