Earthwards: Johnson & Johnson’s Drive Toward a Healthy Future
We wanted to help our product development teams better understand how lifecycle thinking can result in greener products with science-based claims that help our marketing colleagues better tell our sustainability story.

Johnson & Johnson’s Earthwards: Promoting Greener Product Development


Tags:

Sustainability is no longer a fleeting trend. It is becoming a standard practice of companies both large and small, across multiple industries here in the United States and around the world. The health care sector is no different. While the safety and efficacy of health and personal care products will always be paramount, people today are increasingly interested in the sustainability of the products they purchase.
This series is about EARTHWARDS®, a Johnson & Johnson program designed to promote greener product development throughout the enterprise. You will hear from employees at Johnson & Johnson and its Family of Companies, including some of the sustainability advocates who helped build and evolve the program over the years; brand managers and R&D leaders who collaborate to design greener products; and external corporate social responsibility (CSR) experts who will provide their own unique perspectives on sustainable product development at Johnson & Johnson, including independent reporting by CSRwire's Editorial Director Aman Singh. 
In part one, Keith Sutter, Senior Product Director of Sustainable Brand Marketing, introduces us to the Earthwards® process and gives us a peek into the origins of the program. 
_________________________________
Every product has a footprint, from the raw materials sourced and energy and water used during production, to the impacts of packaging, distribution and disposal. In fact, the only way to really eliminate environmental impacts would be to stop making and using products altogether. But chances are we will continue to use products – whether it’s to shampoo and condition our hair, place a bandage on a scraped knee, take medicine when we aren’t well, or be healed with the help of a surgical device.
Every company is faced with this balancing act of making products to meet consumer needs but also addressing inherent impacts of their products. So, what if we change the way products are made so that they have less of an environmental impact?
It was this thinking that led my colleagues to introduce the Earthwards process at Johnson & Johnson, which was designed to foster product stewardship and sustainable product innovation throughout the enterprise, including 250 operating companies across our Consumer Products, Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices & Diagnostics sectors. We’ve made strides since the program launched in 2009, and are proud to be providing our customers more sustainable products using our robust product stewardship effort that has been externally-validated.
Earthwards®: The Beginning 
At Johnson & Johnson, our highest priority is the health of people and the planet. This is why we established Healthy Future 2015, our sustainability roadmap for the future that includes enterprise-wide goals to reduce our environmental impacts. We’ve had specific sustainability goals in place since the early 1990s, but our commitment to the environment dates back to our origins and our Credo:

We must maintain in good order the property we are privileged to use, protecting the environment and natural resources. 

One way we strive to reduce our environmental impact is by improving the sustainable design of our products. Our first venture into greener product design was in the late '90s, when we launched a Design for the Environment program.
We had some early successes, such as eliminating more than 3,000 tons of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) from our packaging from 2005-2010, but we were convinced we could go further with this and really challenge ourselves. We also recognized the realities of today’s competitive marketplace, in which sustainability can be a tie-breaker, a differentiator, or a reason to believe.
We wanted to help our product development teams better understand how lifecycle thinking can result in greener products with science-based claims that help our marketing colleagues better tell our sustainability story.
In 2009, we worked with Five Winds International, a product stewardship and sustainability consultancy, to develop the Earthwards process. We created a Board of Directors, and recruited product developers and brand marketers, as well as external subject matter experts from organizations such as Practice Greenhealth and World Wildlife Fund.
To keep our process state of the art, the following year, we asked a group of product sustainability experts from government, academia, business and the NGO community to review the Earthwards process and suggest improvements to our approach. As a result, we further integrated the Earthwards process across Johnson & Johnson companies by setting a 2015 Healthy Future goal of 60 Earthwards-recognized products and integration of the process into our company wide Environment, Health and Safety standards.
The Earthwards Process & Scorecard 
Today, the Earthwards process is helping our product development teams identify and address a product’s biggest environmental impacts. We use lifecycle thinking to better understand the areas of greatest impact and guide how we should focus our efforts. In most cases, the greatest impacts associated with our products result from the customer use phase and end-of-life disposal, but depending on the product, impacts related to packaging, raw materials, distribution and waste can also be significant.
To be considered for Earthwards recognition, product teams use our proprietary scorecard to take a product through a four-step process:

Satisfy prerequisites. Product teams ask a series of questions to gauge their general understanding of the product. What materials are used in this product? Where do the materials come from? What happens to a product after it’s used? 
Undergo screening. The product undergoes a lifecycle screening to examine impacts and quantify improvements made, and then it’s evaluated against 12 specific goals that fall into seven categories: materials used, packaging, energy reduction, waste reduction, water reduction, positive social impact or benefit, and product innovation. 
Identify improvements. A product must demonstrate more than a 10 percent improvement in at least three of the 12 goal areas. [Five of the seven Earthwards categories have two goal areas, so it  is possible for a product to achieve recognition by showing improvements  in only two categories.]
Submit for review. Teams then submit the scorecard and improvement results to the Earthwards Board for review. 

Earthwards: Looking Ahead
As we look ahead to the next phase of Earthwards, we see opportunities to continue to improve the suite of tools and resources we created for the product development and marketing teams. We’ve begun by upgrading the scorecard functionality and introducing an online scorecard to replace the spreadsheet-based tool we previously used. This will help minimize errors and ensure the availability of data and calculations.
We also developed a “claims calculator” to help translate the reductions and improvements into meaningful and relevant information for our marketing teams and customers.
It has been an exciting few years for the Earthwards team, but there’s so much more to be done around our sustainable product development. While we’re proud of how far we’ve come, this progress is just one step in our sustainability journey toward our Healthy Future goal of developing 60 Earthwards recognized products by 2015. We are up for the challenge!

Uncle Bubble :: Unbelievabubbly Fun, High Performance Toys


Play all


        I am having a blast working with San Jose based D Now Inc.  Our mission? Introduce Uncle Bubble® Brand's line of excellent bubble toys & professional high performance concentrate to North America. (The rest of the world has been friends with Uncle Bubble for a long time now.)Uncle Bubble is a 30 year old property owned and managed by the Lin family of Taiwan. That's right, family owned and operated for 30 years.  What does that mean?     They still care about your backyard bubble experience.  This "Wonka family" of the bubble world is still inventing unique bubble experiences for us to enjoy.  Literally.Uncle Bubble HQ: http://www.hold.com.twIn 2013, Uncle Bubble/Hold Enterprise Co., Ltd set down roots in America.  D Now Inc. is lead by Vicky.  Her father founded the company in Taiwan all those years ago.Also in 2013? Uncle Bubble changed the bubble world again by introducing a bubble solution concentrate.  Huge, Giant (car sized) bubbles are now something we all can enjoy.This Ultra Bubble Concentrate is certified safe as a toy but offers such astonishingly good bubbles that I now use it in my shows.  Exclusively & through sponsorship.Sure it makes sense for people to buy a concentrate (mix 1 part to 9 parts water).  Who wants to pay to ship water weight when you can add water at home?A nice side note: Uncle Bubble Ultra Bubble Concentrate is the only formula I've found where I can send bathtub sized bubbles sailing out over the heads of herds of kids and not have to worry that their eyes will sting when the big one bursts and splashes into their upturned faces.In March 2013, after nearly a year of testing their products, the Lin family asked if I would join D Now Inc's Uncle Bubble Crew.  YES!The videos here feature documentation footage, testing, product development & promotion.I'm proud to be part of this awesome company and am especially looking forward to helping them expand their High Performance line of products for Kids & Bubble Pros alike.Give UB a try... search for Uncle Bubble products on Amazon.com.  Soon enough you will be able to find UB in stores in America & beyond...Let me know what you think.  If you have new tools, tricks or techniques you would like me to test using these products, let me know!Until then, I hope you enjoy the videos.Happy Bubble Days!Keith JohnsonD Now Inc., Uncle Bubble Brand.Product Development & Promotion

Product Description▼▲
For many people, the word "theology" evokes something dry, academic, irrelevant and disconnected from the everyday concerns of life. We surely would not say that about God, so why is our talk about God any different?In this engaging and accessible introduction, Keith Johnson takes a fresh look at theology. He presents the discipline of theology as one of the ways we participate in the life of the triune God. Without suggesting it should be removed from the academy, Johnson argues that theology has to be integrally connected to the traditions and practices of the church. If academic theology is to be genuinely theological, then it has to be carried out in obedience to Jesus Christ and in service to the church.Unlike other introductions, Theology as Discipleship avoids the usual overview of doctrines according to the creed, which traditionally move from the Trinity to eschatology. Johnson instead explains the content of theology by describing the Christian life - being in Christ, hearing God's Word, sharing the mind of Christ. Theology not only leads to discipleship, but is itself a way of following after Christ in faith.

Endorsements▼▲
This is theology that is saturated with Scripture, humbly centered on Christ and the gospel, and earnestly intended for God's people. This is theology for discipleship, and it is truly theology as discipleship. I learned much from reading it, and I was edified and challenged by it. It is a gift to us all.
-Thomas H. McCall, 
associate professor of biblical and systematic theology, director, Carl F. H. Henry Center for Theological Understanding, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School

This book is the prescription for all Christians who doubt theology's relevance for Christian living - and for all Christians who wonder what theology is about and how it works. Keith Johnson has 'nailed it' with this fine introductory work on the practical relevance of theology for Christian discipleship. Readers with an appreciation for theology will benefit from reading it as well. The chapters on Scripture express an enlightened evangelical approach to the Bible as the living Word of God.
-Roger E. Olson, 
Foy Valentine Professor of Christian Theology and Ethics, George W. Truett Theological Seminary, Baylor University, Waco, Texas

In Theology as Discipleship, Keith Johnson invites readers to inhabit a rich theological landscape as followers of Christ. Johnson's book overflows with wisdom and joy as he shows how Christians of all vocations are called to live in union with Christ, being reshaped by God's Word through the Spirit. This refreshing book is a wonderful theological companion for disciples of Jesus Christ.
-J. Todd Billings, 
Gordon H. Girod Research Professor of Reformed Theology, Western Theological Seminary, Holland, MI

Keith Johnson has done a great service not only for the academic study of theology but for the church. In a time when the church's proclamation of its faith and the academy's reflection upon faith seem to be deeply divided, Johnson builds a bridge across the chasm. He shows not only why theology is necessary for the church but also why it can only find its true meaning when joined to the church's life as a form of Christian discipleship. Drawing upon the riches of the church's past yet grounded solidly in Scripture, this book expounds and reflects upon the gospel as the mystery of God's will that was foreordained in Christ and does so in a way that is not only deeply learned and careful, but also caring and clear. For those wondering why they should bother with theology at all, they will find here a wise and compassionate answer. For those who turn theology into a practice of intellectual theatrics or point of pride, they will find here an incisive and needed corrective. This book is, in short, a wonderful and exemplary primer to the task of theology that deserves many readers.
-Kimlyn J. Bender, 
George W. Truett Theological Seminary, Baylor University

Author Bio▼▲
Keith L. Johnson (PhD, Princeton Theological Seminary) is associate professor of theology at Wheaton College. His research focuses on systematic theology, including the doctrines of the Trinity and Christology and the relationship between Protestant and Roman Catholic theology. He is author of Karl Barth and the Analogia Entis and coeditor of Bonhoeffer, Christ and Culture. An ordained Baptist minister, he and his wife Julie have one son.


Editorial Reviews▼▲
"The heart of Johnson's thesis is that theology is vital to discipleship because it trains us to rightly hear, understand, and use words about God which inevitably influence our religious practices. . . . He closes the book with a gem: a list of nine ways that theology must be practiced in order to serve the church and act as a practice of discipleship. If I were the dean or chair of a confessional school, I would have this list framed in the office of every theologian I employed."
"It is difficult to correctly articulate the importance of Theology as Discipleship by Keith L. Johnson. Not only is the book well-written and engaging, but the content is challenging and intentionally aimed. In fact, to say that this book is necessary for the contemporary church would run the risk of being an understatement. Johnson has produced a timely and important volume that exemplifies a personal pursuit of faithfulness in the discipline of theology. "If you are a Christian educator, pastor, or simply a Christian seeking to live faithfully in all aspects of your life, Theology as Discipleship is a must read booksooner than later."
"This fine, little book would be ideal for undergrad theology courses, as well as congregational adult classes and book-study groups. It would also be quite fitting and beneficial to hand a copy of Theology as Discipleship to the ministerial candidates in your church, your favorite seminarian, and your pastor. And while you're handing out copies, snag one for yourself. You'll be glad you did!"

            Keith L. Johnson is Associate Professor of Theology at Wheaton College. Johnson has an M.Div. from Baylor University, a Th.M. from Duke Divinity School, and a Ph.D. from Princeton Theological Seminary. Johnson has authored or co-authored a number of books, including Karl Barth and the Analogia Entis (T&T Clark, 2010), and published numerous articles related to various theological topics. Most recently, Johnson has published this timely and important volume, Theology as Discipleship (IVP Academic, 2015), that seeks to build a bridge between the study of theology and the Christian life. 


Theology as Discipleship argues, that the discipline of theology and a life of discipleship to Jesus Christ are integrally related because the practice of theology is one of the ways we participate in the life of the triune God (p. 12) The goal of Theology as Discipleship is to show how the study of theology actually enriches the Christian life and how faithful obedience to Christ rightly enables the learning of theology. Thus, it is a reciprocal relationship that functions best when both aspects are equally involved. 


Johnson rightly recognizes the contemporary dilemma that characterizes most Christians today. For Johnson, the study of theology has become so divorced from the everyday endeavors of the Christian life that it has become difficult, even for intelligently committed Christians, to figure out how the two relate. Accordingly, Theology as Discipleship opens with an important chapter that helps the reader identify what went wrong and how it can be effectively reconstructed. It is this reconstruction process that dominates the following chapters of the book. 


As an educator in the context of the local church, I understand that the problem that Johnson seeks to address in Theology as Discipleship is more prevalent than many are willing to admit. In fact, I actually just taught a six-week course that aimed to address the very issue raised by Johnson here, and I wish I had his book prior to that endeavor for a number of reasons. First, Johnson is consistently Christ-centered in his approach and application. Second, his approach does more than provide a hypothetical solution to the problem. Third, his approach and solution are beneficial to both scholars and students. 


Theology as Discipleship concludes, appropriately so, with nine characteristics that distinguish the life of the Christian who practices theology faithfully within the context of Gods saving work in Christ and the Spirit (p. 156). For example, Johnson rightly argues, we practice theology as disciples, when our thinking stays within the limits of our faith in Jesus Christ (p. 158), and, when we pursue both truth and unity (p. 176). This last chapter practically and carefully shows the necessity of theology for the Christian life, and why as Christians we should be quick to engage frequently in theological dialog and thinking. 


It is difficult to correctly articulate the importance of Theology as Discipleship by Keith L, Johnson. Not only is the book well-written and engaging, but the content is challenging and intentionally aimed. In fact, to say that this book is necessary for the contemporary church would run the risk of being an understatement. Johnson has produced a timely and important volume that exemplifies a personal pursuit of faithfulness in the discipline of theology. If you are a Christian educator, pastor, or simply a Christian seeking to live faithfully in all aspects of your life, Theology as Discipleship is a must read booksooner than later.     


I received a review copy of these books in exchange for and honest review. I was not required to write a positive review. The opinions I have expressed are my own. I am disclosing this in accordance with the Federal Trade Commissions 16 CFR, Part 255: Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising.
