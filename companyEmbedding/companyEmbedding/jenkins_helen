About



 

Helen Jenkins is a professional vocalist who specialises in a wide range of genres. She creates dynamic sets and performs versatile songs for your events. With over a three and a half octave range she is able to sing any song with the drop of a hat.

Helen was born in 1995 and grew up on the South Coast of Dorset and from a young age, she loved to sing. At the age of 7, she joined Steppin' Out Academy of Performance who took her under their wing. With two performances a year and opportunities to perform in the West End and with the Royal Ballet School, Helen blossomed.

Helen has honed in on her singing more than ever over the past 8 years, and with the help of her vocal coach Lynsey Simon, she has become phenomenal. Examples of her work include the talents of Whitney Houston, Christina Aguilera, Minnie Ripperton and Etta James. If Helen had to pick a genre she enjoyed singing the most, it would have to be Jazz and soul.

It's time for Helen to share her talent with everyone, contact us.
