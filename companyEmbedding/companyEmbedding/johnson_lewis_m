Store Palladium bullion bars at home, or add the Palladium bullion to your Precious Metals IRA.
Palladium bullion bars and rounds are smart additions to your investment portfolio, whether considering the Palladium for a Precious Metals IRA or a great way to diversify your holdings. In order to buy Palladium wisely, understand the following guidelines to make the most of your investment. From the difference between the spot price of Palladium to the premium price of Palladium to the differences between bullion bars and rounds to the qualifications for a Precious Metals IRA, there is a lot to consider. Once versed, invest in Palladium rounds and bars to balance your investment portfolio in a way that meets your goals. 

Spot price of Palladium that is quoted in the marketplace is the base price of the unfabricated Precious Metal, without consideration for production costs. No one pays the spot price of Palladium for Palladium rounds and bars. Everyone pays the premium price of Palladium that includes costs of distribution, fabrication, nominal dealer markups and any numismatic or collector value. So when you buy Palladium bullion bars and rounds for investments, you want to look for the best premium price per ounce. 
Palladium bullion bars are made from the Precious Metal with a design that has little to no numismatic or collector value. Unlike numismatic Palladium coins that are valued for both weight and collector value, Palladium bullion rounds and bars are priced for Palladium content. When investors buy Palladium, they are also paying per troy ounce, which is slightly heavier than a regular ounce, and the price is always based on U.S. dollars. So whether 1 oz Palladium rounds or bars, the price is the same the world over, even if it has been converted to grams or other currencies. 
When using Palladium bullion bars and Palladium rounds for a Precious Metals IRA, you will want to make sure you have the IRA set up first with a designated custodian. Then you buy Palladium rounds, bars and coins that will become part of the IRA, and these are actual Palladium bullion products, not paper representations. Once Palladium rounds and bars, and other Precious Metals are a part of the IRA, you will not pay taxes on gains like with regular IRAs, but once you decide to liquidate the IRA, you will want to talk with your accountant about any tax liability. Adding 1 oz Palladium rounds and bars to an investment strategy, whether in an IRA or as part of your collection at home often is considered to be a “safe haven” investment because the prices of Precious Metals typically hold even as other investments falter.




We provide all of our customers with a refund, return and / or exchange on everything we sell including all bullion and certified coins. If for any reason, you have a problem, please feel free to call us. We will always do our best to accommodate you.

                                        Tyster in NC  ---  Beautiful coin in the harder to find 1/2 ounce size. Will definitely get more and I'm REALLY hoping they get more 1/2 oz Russian Ballet coins.  But make no mistake, this is a fantastic piece!

The Dirtiest Race in History Ben Johnson – Carl Lewis and the Olympic 100m Final$9.99

The 1988 Seoul Olympics played host to what has been described by some as the dirtiest race of all time, by others as the greatest. The final of the men's 100 metres at those Olympics is certainly the most infamous in the history of athletics, and more indelibly etched into the consciousness of the sport, the Olympics, and a global audience of millions, than any other athletics event before or since.

Description
The 1988 Seoul Olympics played host to what has been described by some as the dirtiest race of all time, by others as the greatest. The final of the men’s 100 metres at those Olympics is certainly the most infamous in the history of athletics, and more indelibly etched into the consciousness of the sport, the Olympics, and a global audience of millions, than any other athletics event before or since.
Ben Johnson’s world-record time of 9.79 seconds – as thrilling as it was – was the beginning rather than the end of the story. Following the race, Johnson tested positive, news that generated as many – if not more – shockwaves as his fastest ever run. He was stripped of the title, Lewis was awarded the gold medal, Linford Christie the silver and Calvin Smith the bronze.
More than two decades on, the story still hadn’t ended. In 1999 Lewis was named Sportsman of the Century by the IOC, and Olympian of the Century by Sports Illustrated. Yet his reputation was damaged by revelations that he too used performance-enhancing drugs, and tested positive prior to the Seoul Olympics. Christie also tested positive in Seoul but his explanation, that the banned substance had been in ginseng tea, was accepted. Smith, now a lecturer in English literature at a Florida university, was the only athlete in the top five whose reputation remains unblemished – the others all tested positive at some stage in their careers.
Containing remarkable new revelations, this book uses witness interviews – with Johnson, Lewis and Smith among others – to reconstruct the build-up to the race, the race itself, and the fallout when news of Johnson’s positive test broke and he was forced into hiding. It also examines the rivalry of the two favourites going into it, and puts the race in a historical context, examining its continuing relevance on the sport today, where every new record elicits scepticism.

Scott considers his clients colleagues—collaborating on issues to achieve the best resolution. His easygoing, friendly demeanor and fierce dedication makes clients loyal, in turn. They appreciate his ability to solve unusual or difficult problems, as he’s adept at uncovering an obscure fact, managing difficult witnesses, working with unpredictable opposing counsel, or establishing rapport with an obstinate judge.
While he works with clients to prevent or quickly resolve litigation, Scott gladly accepts the responsibility of trying a case. He is a board-certified trial attorney who feels perfectly at-home in any courtroom.
When not working or volunteering with various community and professional organizations, Scott cherishes time spent with his wife of twenty-five years, his teenage daughter and son, and his over-active golden retriever. He also loves going out with friends or playing virtually any sport—men’s senior league baseball, Sunday night hockey, tennis, or golf.
