About Wayzata Investment Partners
Wayzata Investment Partners was founded in 2004 by five current partners that have over 19 years experience investing together.  Since inception, the firm has organized three private equity funds through which it has raised more than $7 billion of committed capital.
Broadly speaking, the firm pursues middle market private equity transactions.  More specifically it looks to acquire controlling interests through a distressed debt acquisition strategy or directly acquiring assets in dislocated industries.  Unlike typical private equity firms, Wayzata Investment Partners looks to deleverage businesses, stabilize them and then invest equity as growth capital.
Top notch management teams are crucial to the success of any business.  Wayzata Investment Partners’ role is to identify outstanding talent, inside or outside the business, and then properly incent them to achieve the type of investment returns our investors expect.
Wayzata Investment Partners is a leading investor in the distressed-for-control category, specializing in energy, power, aviation, shipping, industrial manufacturing, real estate and other hard-asset businesses.  The firm has acquired over 45 companies since inception and deployed in excess of $10 billion.  The team consists of 27 individuals (19 investment professionals) located in four offices around the globe (Wayzata, Boston, Mumbai and London).

Posted on January 19, 2009Wayzata Investment Partners have big stake in Star Tribune debt 

Well, I didn’t know what to think of reports that local investment company and spin off of Cargill, Wayzata Investment Partners had purchased a large share of the Star Tribune’s secured debt.

Posted on October 21, 2008Wayzata Investment Partners and United Steelworkers come to terms 

Lynne Baker, part of the United Steel Workers Communications department, emailed me today that Wayzata Investment Partners and the United Steelworkers Local 1189 came to terms regarding the Pope & Talbot Paper Mill that WIP purchased in a bankruptcy sale this June. Here is her press release:
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE October 20, 2008
Halsey, Oregonâ€”Production and maintenance workers from United Steelworkers (USW) Local 1189 here overwhelmingly ratified a new six-year agreement with Cascade Pacific Pulp LLC on Oct. 16 that covers 95 workers. The contract will expire Oct. 31, 2014.
â€œWe were able to get a contract because of the solidarity of our membership, our community allies, and USW brothers and sisters from Canada and Minnesota,â€ Jim Gourley, Local 1189 financial secretary, said. â€œThey supported us in our rallies at Wayzata headquarters in Minnesota and at the plant gate.â€
The union was successful in regaining main provisions of their former contract with Pope & Talbot at the site. The company filed for bankruptcy protection last year and the operations were purchased by Wayzata Investment Partners, a specialist in private equity and hedge funds, for $31.15 million.
â€œItâ€™s been a very hard struggle to work with absentee owners,â€ Leon Harlson, president of Local 1189, said. â€œWe were able to put enough pressure on Wayzata to get them to bargain with us. The contract we obtained addresses most of our issues.â€
One of the most important provisions the union obtained is successorship. If Wayzata sells the pulp mill in the future, the new owner would have to abide by the existing union contract for the term of the agreement, and workers would get to keep their jobs. Since there was not a successorship clause in the old Pope & Talbot contract, the workers lost their jobs and had to reapply for them under the terms offered by the new owner.
Workers will receive a minimum 12 percent wage increase immediately upon ratification and will be paid the difference between their old wage rate and the new one for the five months they were without a contract. On November 1 in 2009 and 2010 they will receive a 2 percent general wage increase. In 2011, 2012 and 2013 on November 1 their wage increase will be based on the average of wage increases negotiated at other Pacific coast mills.
The company agreed to pay a 50-cent per hour shift differential for the 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. shift after ratification instead of its original proposal to start payment in 2009. An additional 25-cents per hour will be added Nov. 1, 2010 instead of a year later. The shift to earlier payment is significant because this provision affects about 75 percent of the membership.
Prior to the new agreement, workers had to pay 50 percent of their health care premiums. In the new agreement, workers will immediately pay 20 percent of the cost. This increases to 22 percent in 2010 and 25 percent in 2012.
Local 1189 was able to retrieve all the contract language under the old contract with Pope & Talbot except for a few minor modifications. Those with 15 years or more of service under Pope & Talbot and Cascade Pacific will automatically get five weeks of vacation without having to re-earn it under the new owner. Before the contract, workers were not paid if they were overlooked for overtime because managers did not follow seniority. If a manager disregards seniority now when assigning overtime, the overlooked person who should have been assigned it will get paid as if the manager had not messed up.
The defined benefit pension workers had under Pope & Talbot will be replaced by a USW 401(k) plan. Cascade Pacific will match up to 6 percent of a workerâ€™s contribution beginning Nov. 1, 2008. This will increase to a 7 percent match on Nov. 1, 2011 and an 8 percent match on Nov. 1, 2012.
The USW represents 130,000 workers in the pulp, paper and forestry industry. It is the largest industrial union in North America, representing more than 850,000 workers in the U.S., Canada, Caribbean and Aruba.

Posted on September 9, 2008More information on the United Steel Workers March on Lake Street Last Friday 

So Elisha and I were well aware what was going on when we took a seat at Sunset’s against the windows facing Lake Street at about 11:40 last Friday,  It was about 20 minutes prior to when reports from Marketwatch.com indicated that the United Steel Workers would march on the headquarters of Wayzata Investment Partners. The couple in the booth behind us wondered out loud what was going on with the heavy police patrol on Lake Street. Our waitress indicated that the Wayzata Police Department had called Sunset’s and indicated that their might be a large distraction.


So Elisha ordered a California Burger (a little dry) and I had half a sandwich and a cup of soup while the USW Local 1189 marched and chanted outside seeking a meeting with President Patrick Halloran. All kinds or rumors swirled around; anarchists from the RNC in St. Paul would be descending on Wayzata, a huge protest, etc.  They stuck around for about an hour, then dispursed as they chanted, “We’ll be back.”
For even more information about the exact happenings, check out this Union sponsored website which breaks down the actions of our local Lt. Mike Murhpy who hand delivered a letter to the Wayzata Investment Partners corporate attorney. The union reportedly was denied access to the building.

Posted on September 4, 2008USW, Supporters to Demonstrate at Wayzata Investment Partners Headquarters 

Marketwatch.com, a division of the Wall Street Journal, is carrying a story that indicates that United Steel Workers will be Marching on the headquarters of Wayzata Investment Partners on Friday, September 5th, at 12 noon.
According to the article, “In June of this year, Wayzata Investment Partners bought the former Pope & Talbot paper mill in Halsey, Ore., and renamed it Cascade Pacific Pulp. In the change of ownership, longtime workers were fired and then made to reapply for their jobs. Wages were slashed from 12 to 28% and employees forced to pay up to $3,000 for deductibles and up to $10,000 in out-of-pocket expenses to retain family health insurance. “
The article went on to say, “USW members from the Oregon plant will be joined by union supporters and community allies from Minnesota at the march and demonstration at Wayzata Investment Partners. This event takes place Friday, Sept. 5, 12 Noon at the firm’s offices at 701 Lake St, E., Wayzata, Minn. The union delegation will seek a meeting with Wayzata boss Patrick Halloran and urge him to halt the company’s unfair demands on workers and their community.
Paper mill workers feel this demonstration at the equity firm’s offices is justified. “If we have no other way of making contact with absentee owners like Wayzata Investment Partners, we have to go to them,” said Jim Gourley, financial secretary for USW Local 1189 in Halsey. “
Lieutenant Murphy of the Wayzata Police Department had no comment.  I can’t remember the last time a protest march occurred in Wayzata. Stay tuned to Wayzata.com for the latest breaking news on the protest in front of Wayzata Investment Partners.

Handymax and supramax vessels are well suited for small ports with length and draft restrictions or ports lacking infrastructure for cargo handling.  Primary dry bulk cargoes are grains, cement, fertilizer, petcoke, coal, iron ore, scrap and finished steel.
