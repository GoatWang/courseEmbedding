Early life and career[edit]
Gelman grew up in the Chicago suburb of Highland Park, Illinois. While earning a degree in broadcast production management from the University of Colorado School of Journalism, Gelman worked for the U.S. Ski Association covering pre-Olympic trials all over the country as a cameraman, field producer and editor. Gelman's most important internship came during the summer of his junior year at WABC-TV in New York, the station that would later produce Live! with Kelly and Ryan. In the 1980s he became a production assistant on Regis Philbin's local talk show, The Morning Show.[1] Gelman worked his way to Executive Producer on The Morning Show which would eventually become Live!.[1]
Gelman has been parodied on The Dana Carvey Show by Stephen Colbert, and on Saturday Night Live by Chris Kattan and Rachel Dratch as a flamboyant, ambiguously gay character.
Personal life[edit]
In 2000, he married Laurie Hibberd, a television personality from Canada. They have two daughters, Jamie and Misha, and live in Manhattan.
