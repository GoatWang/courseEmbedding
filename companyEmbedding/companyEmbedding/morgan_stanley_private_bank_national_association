It Takes a Village to Raise a College Graduate

                            With the rising costs of college, families are taking a multigenerational approach to planning for education and other life goals.
                        





It takes a village to raise a child, but in 2017 it may take an extended family to educate one.
With the costs of higher education trending higher each year, paying for college has become a top-tier life expense, alongside other big-ticket goals like buying a home and planning for retirement. However, education costs have now skyrocketed to the extent that saving for both of those life goals—retirement and home-buying—has become hampered in some families.

Some parents are cutting back on retirement savings contributions to help fund their children’s education.  At the same time, children are entering their 20’s with student loan debt, which in some cases is delaying the purchase of their first home. Even grandparents have modified life goals, choosing to help grandchildren with education expenses now, rather than leaving a larger legacy later.
In short, paying for education has officially become a multigenerational concern. But with a little advance planning, families can make some savvy moves to help prepare for the costs of college. 





The Growing Cost of Education



According to the College Board's latest “Trends in Higher Education" report, the continued increase in average published tuition and fees at colleges and universities is now outpacing the growth in family incomes, financial aid and many consumer goods and services. It now costs, on average, $45,370 per year for tuition, fees, room and board, for a four-year private college. Assuming a college-cost inflation rate of 3%, today’s 8-year-old child may need $255,090 come college time in 2027.
“For parents, the number-one goal from a financial planning perspective is still retirement, but close behind is paying for a child’s education,” says Marc Dextraze, Executive Director, Morgan Stanley Wealth Management Investment Solutions.




It takes a village to raise a child, but in 2017 it may take an extended family to educate one.

One option, says Dextraze, is for parents to start saving early with a 529 college savings plan.  “Having a head start on the costs means less sacrifice later on, avoiding the heavy burden of parental loans," he says. For the child, “Having all or most of their college funding in place means they have more options, like being able to select the college that best fits their interests and goals, as opposed to the college that offers the most aid. And graduating with less student debt means having the ability to pursue the next chapter of their lives with more financial freedom."
Named after Section 529 of the Internal Revenue Code, a 529 plan is a tax-advantaged savings vehicle which allows you to save, or even pay in advance, for college expenses. Earnings in a 529 plan can be tax deferred, and the withdrawals are exempt from federal and state income taxes if you use the funds for qualified expenses such as tuition, fees, room and board and supplies. Many states also offer state tax deductions or tax credits on top of that.





Making Education a Family Affair



Motivated by persistent news headlines about the growing costs of education, grandparents, relatives and even family friends have also begun creating 529 accounts in a child’s name. Not only do 529 plans offer potential tax advantages, they allow the family member or friend to give the gift of education and a young adulthood free from student debt.
“Today it definitely takes a village to send a child to college," says Jennifer Tierney, Vice President, Morgan Stanley Wealth Management Investment Solutions and 529 plans product manager. “It's so important to plan ahead. For grandparents, aunts and uncles, family friends, it just makes sense to leverage the benefits that 529 plans provide to a child and from a tax-perspective, to themselves.”

A Flexible Way to Save and Invest for College



The appeal of 529 plans may derive from their benefits and flexibility.
There are no income restrictions, no required minimum distributions, no limits on the number of accounts the same person or entity can own, generally no maximum age limits for establishing an account, and high contribution limits. Virtually anyone can be named a beneficiary—a child, grandchild, niece, nephew, spouse, even a friend.1
According to Chris Stack, a managing consultant at Savingforcollege.com, one of the most overlooked benefits is the daily access and liquidity of the 529 account, as opposed to a UTMA (Uniform Transfers to Minors Act) or UGMA (Uniform Gifts to Minors Act) account or other strategy. “With 529s, grandparents or extended family give themselves an option, but not an obligation, to apply their funds to help pay college costs," he says. 


Another significant benefit of 529 plans is tax-free compounding. “Earning on an account’s growth, rather than paying taxes on the earnings, provides more funding available in future years when the college costs become a family reality," Stack says. “Having the ability to withdraw the principal and tax-deferred earnings without any federal or state income tax liability is a very significant benefit, especially when compared to alternative strategies such as using a life insurance policy or a taxable account."
Stack recommends that families start preparing for college costs as early as possible. While as soon as the child is born is ideal, he said, some even “begin with an account in their own name years before their first child is born knowing the designated beneficiary can be changed in the future."
Says Dextraze, “At the end of the day, the idea is to harmonize all of your goals, taking whatever tax advantages you can through the various kinds of plans out there, including 401Ks, 529s and others. It’s using all of the available tools. That’s how you reach your goals.”


Morgan Stanley offers many 529s from some of the nation’s leading mutual fund companies. You can choose from a range of investment strategies depending on the specific plan, the age of the beneficiary, your financial objectives and risk tolerance. Talk with your Morgan Stanley Financial Advisor, or find one using the locator below, for more information. 
















1 Some plans may have age, residency or other restrictions and may charge a fee for beneficiary changes, and beneficiary changes may result in an immediate tax liability if the new beneficiary is not a member of the old beneficiary’s family. Contribution limits vary by state. Refer to the individual plan for specific guidelines.


Disclosures
An investor should consider the investment objectives, risks, and charges and expenses associated with 529 plans and municipal fund securities before investing. More information about municipal fund securities is available in the issuer's official statement – the 529 Plan Program Disclosure – which is available from your Financial Advisor. It should be read carefully before investing.
Investments are subject to market risk and may fluctuate in value. Before investing, investors should consider whether tax or other benefits are only available for investments in the investor’s home-state 529 college savings plan. Assets can accumulate and be withdrawn federally tax-free only if they are used to pay for qualified expenses. Earnings on nonqualified distributions will be subject to income tax and a 10% federal income tax penalty. Some states offer favorable tax treatment and other benefits to their residents only if they invest in the state’s own Qualified Tuition Program. Investors should consult with their financial and tax advisor before investing in any 529 plan, or contact their state tax division for more information. Some plans may have age, residency or other restrictions and may charge a fee for beneficiary changes.
Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC (“Morgan Stanley”), its affiliates and Morgan Stanley Financial Advisors do not provide tax or legal advice. Clients should consult their personal tax advisor for tax-related matters and their attorney for legal matters.

                            Navigate the money taboo and get together around what really matters—your family.
                        





What’s the hardest thing to talk about? Death, religion, politics? Would it surprise you to know that one of the most difficult things to discuss is money? When polled, 44% of Americans claimed that personal finance was the hardest to discuss – beating out politics and even death.1
Perhaps this is because money represents more than a topic – it can represent control, power, embarrassment, insecurity, fear. For some people, the hesitation stems from a natural reluctance to confront their own mortality or their potential for future disability. For others, avoiding the topic is caused by the perception that planning is associated with complicated—and expensive—legal and tax issues.

Silence Can Be Harmful



Avoiding these sometimes difficult conversations can have detrimental outcomes and unexpected consequences for your family, such as:
Passing On Bad Habits - Talking to your children about money now can help them avoid mistakes in the future. The key is to talk about what money means to you and why you worked hard to achieve your success. It involves being open about the challenges and responsibilities that accompany wealth – including what you might have wished you’d done differently when younger. And, most important, it’s about your values and what you wish for yourself and your children to accomplish with your privilege. The conversation can serve as an empowering first step to forming a healthy relationship with wealth.
Lost Opportunities - It’s never too early for your children to understand the value of creating a wealth plan that takes family members’ needs into account. Family members may not be aligned on priorities, such as long-term health care needs, charitable giving and generational gifting strategies, and taking the time to establish common goals is the first step in understanding how all members can participate in achieving them. 
The reality is that 70% of families lose their wealth by the second generation.[ii] Lack of communication can ultimately lead to misunderstandings and divergent objectives that could jeopardize your legacy and work against your values.
Costly Procrastination - Perhaps the hardest of conversations to have as an adult is with your aging parents. This is where the danger of putting it off grows exponentially. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human services, 70% of people over 65 will require some long-term care at some point in their lives.[iii] Once a crisis hits, it’s often too late. Now is the time to determine if sufficient long-term health care plans have been made, as well as who will make financial decisions on your parents’ behalf if they lose the ability to safely handle their money. Proper planning gives you time to discuss your decisions with family members. This open communication can help to reduce, if not eliminate, the risk of family discord, resentment or conflict.




Having a hard time starting a conversation about family finances? Here are a few questions to make it easy for you.



 
Is it important to talk about money as a family?




 
At what age do you hope to retire?




 
When is it ok to borrow money?




 
What's your favorite charitable cause and why?




 
How is your generation different from the generations before you?




 
Should children give to charity?

A New Paradigm for Family Wealth Planning











Align Your Goals with Strategies for Reaching Them



Morgan Stanley’s goals-based wealth planning framework strives to guard against more than just market volatility. We believe that a successful planning strategy must meet the following criteria:
1. Your plan should be customized to reflect what you care about most. It should address both the goals you hope to achieve and the risk of outliving your assets.
2. Your plan should address the shifting nature of issues and unknowns you face at different stages of your life and consider risks beyond market volatility, like inflation.
3. Your plan should seek to mitigate judgment and behavioral risks such as panic selling in difficult markets or overspending.





Smash the Taboo



We know it’s hard. Sitting down to discuss your parents’ long-term health needs or checking in with your siblings to see if you are all on the same page relating to any inheritance isn’t easy. What about your children; do they value the same causes that have moved you all your life? Is your spouse prepared should something happen to you?
The tough part is getting started, and that’s where bringing in an objective financial professional can help. We understand that wealth is about much more than just money, and can guide the conversation down those difficult paths to uncover the things that matter most to you and your family. We don’t believe in having a single conversation, but rather a series of talks that shift as your life changes. It’s a road. And you don’t have to travel it alone.
It starts with family, but doesn’t have to end there. We are ready to provide the guidance, tools and information that can help you tackle these difficult topics and transform them into meaningful discussions for your future. Uncover what matters most to you and find a Morgan Stanley Financial Advisor to help guide the conversation. Because the road starts here.

There are so many different fee structures and specialties, knowing how to sort through your options is difficult. You trust your financial advisor with your money, so it is important to make the best possible decision.How to Choose a Financial AdvisorWhen you start your search for a financial advisor, you need to find someone whose skills matches your needs. That means you need to recognize what you are looking for before you start looking.Here are some common needs from financial advisors: Cash flow management Budgeting Retirement planning Investing Paying for children's education No financial advisor is perfect for every need, which is why it is so important to understand your needs before hiring anyone.How to Find a Financial AdvisorYour first step in choosing a financial advisor after examining your needs is to find potential advisors. You will want someone who is easy to reach, and ideally not too far from your home or office so it is easy to get to a meeting if needed.There are over 750,000 registered financial advisors in the United States. SmartAsset's financial advisor search tool can help you navigate to the best advisor for your needs. Answer questions about where you live, your plans for retirement, and other financial priorities. In just a few minutes, you'll be all set and SmartAsset will have an advisor contact you.Questions to Ask a Financial AdvisorOnce you have found a few advisors, you should interview them to decide who is the best fit for your needs. Here are some example questions to ask to make sure you end up with the right advisor.How many years of experience do you have as a professional financial advisor? Do you want someone new and inexperienced managing your money? It is best to find someone with plenty of experience. Advisors with a decade or more under their belt have seen multiple economic cycles and can better help you weather the storm.What is your strongest focus area in financial planning? Some advisors are experts in retirement. Others have expertise in estates and trusts. Others still are best suited to help you pay for your child's education. Some financial advisors focus on people who are self-employed. Be sure to choose someone who can help with what you need, not what someone else needs.What is your budgeting philosophy? Every family's budget is unique. Budgets can be very detailed or more general. Some advisors suggest living frugally to meet your goals, others take a more balanced approach. Find an advisor with a philosophy that matches yours.How are you compensated? Some financial advisors are “fee only.” This means that you pay your advisor a flat fee for their services. Many advisors charge based on the size of your portfolio. The worst situation is where advisors are paid a commission by mutual funds. In this case, a conflict of interest exists. The advisor is incentivized to put your money into those funds even if they are not the best for your needs.How much does it cost to work with you? After learning how they are paid, make sure you know how much you will pay. No one wants a giant surprise bill after your first meeting.Are you a fiduciary? Fiduciary means putting your needs first. Many financial advisors work as a fiduciary and have to put your needs first, even if it means they earn less money. However, many financial advisors are not fiduciaries, and can give you advice that is not in your best interest.Do you own the same investments you'll suggest to me? Do they put their money where their mouth is? Advisors who suggest one strategy to clients and use a different strategy for their own finances should be a big red flag.How have your client's portfolios performed? How did you handle their portfolios during the Great Recession in 2008? These questions get to the root of their performance. If the advisor does not readily share this information, they are probably hiding something that went wrong in the past.  Make Sure Your Financial Advisor is LicensedFinancial advisors are not allowed to give you specific investment advice unless they are licensed. The most common and important license for a financial advisor is the CFP, or Certified Financial Planner. CFPs are regulated and must take a course and pass a test proving their competence in financial topics.Series 7 and Series 63 licenses give finance professionals the ability to recommend and trade stocks, bonds, and other investments on your behalf. Make sure your financial advisor has successfully completed both of these exams and has an up-to-date license.Beware of Lofty PromisesIf an advisor makes promises that sound like something from the 2016 Presidential Campaign, proceed with caution. Promises to beat the market and outperform other advisors and funds are easier said than done. Further, no advisor can promise that they will beat the market.At the end of the day, many financial advisors have similar skills. They use comparable tools and reports to stay up-to-date on the markets and help find the best investments for you. If any advisor gives you a bad vibe, don't feel bad looking elsewhere.Choose an Advisor You Can TrustAfter you have met with a few advisors, it is time to make your decision. Asking about licenses, fees, and past performance is black and white. There are other parts of the decision that are a bit more subjective.Do you like the person? Do you trust them? Would you trust them with your daughter's education fund? Your retirement?If you have been able to limit your list down to your final few, it is time to trust your gut. It is important to have an advisor you like, trust, and enjoy interacting with. Your money is too important to put in the hands of someone you don't trust. Pick and advisor who feels like a partner who will stand beside you through your financial journey. If you do, you'll be on track for a great financial future.If you're ready to start, answer a few questions in SmartAsset's financial advisor selection tool and you'll be contacted by a few advisors in your area to choose from.

Unlike hiring a mechanic or hairstylist, financial advisors are usually long term relationships. They are also taking responsibility for your money. With your entire livelihood on the line, choosing the wrong advisor would be a big mistake. Avoid these 7 common blunders when choosing an advisor to ensure you are on track to meet your financial goals.1. Hiring the First Advisor You MeetDepending on where you live, you could have dozens of options for advisors. It is tempting to hire the closest advisor to home. Some people might just pick the first advisor in the yellow pages. This decision requires more time. Take the time to interview at least a few advisors before picking the best match for you.2. Choosing an Advisor with the Wrong SpecialtyAdvisors can have different focus area. Some specialize on retirement planning. Some are best for business owners or those with a high net worth. Others are best for young professionals starting a family. This type of focus does not make an advisor better or worse. It makes them better for certain people than others. Be sure to understand an advisor’s strengths and weaknesses. Do that before signing on the dotted line.3. Picking an Advisor with an Incompatible StrategyEach advisor has a unique strategy. Some advisors may suggest aggressive investments. Others are more conservative. Again, there is no right or wrong. However, there is a right and wrong for you. If you don’t feel comfortable with risk, don’t choose an advisor that prefers aggressive investments. If you prefer to go all in on stocks, an advisor that prefers bonds and index funds is not a great match for your style.4. Skipping Checking ReferencesMost advisors are happy to offer references to prospective clients. If you ask about references and they act nervous, that's a red flag! Quality advisors are happy to discuss past missteps and what they learned. This helps them keep from repeating the same mistake in the future. Calling references only takes a couple of minutes. It can help put you at ease when handing over the keys to your bank account.5. Not Asking about CredentialsTo give investment advice, financial advisors are required to pass a test. Ask your advisor about their licenses, tests, and credentials. This ensures they are qualified to meet your needs. Financial advisors tests include the Series 7 and Series 66 or Series 65. Some advisors go a step further and become a Certified Financial Planner, or CFP. Also ask where they went to school and what degree they earned. Some advisors have a finance degree from a top school. Others could have an English degree from a community college.6. Making Assumptions When They are Affiliated with a Reputable BrandAn advisor might appear qualified and professional due to an association with a major firm like J.P. Morgan or Morgan Stanley. However, that doesn’t make them a great advisor. Working with an advisor from a reputable firm is not a bad idea. It often leads to stability and better tools and information. However, they still have quite a bit of autonomy. Choose an advisor because they are the best fit, not because of their branding.7. Not Understanding How They are PaidThere are different payment models for financial advisors. Some are “fee only.” In this case, they charge a flat rate no matter what. Others charge a percentage of assets under management. Some advisors are paid by mutual funds. This is the worst situation for you. This is a serious conflict of interest. If the advisor earns more by ignoring your best interests, do not hire them.Do Your Research to Find the Perfect AdvisorChoosing a financial advisor is an important decision. It requires the best information available. Gathering information about financial advisors can be tough. That is why SmartAsset created a financial advisor match tool. Answering basic questions results in a list of local advisors to choose from. It doesn't matter if you need help with your finances or just want a second opinion.

 The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance for one year and under are cumulative, not annualized. Short term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. For additional information, see the fund(s) prospectus.
Each Direxion Fund share price is calculated as of the close of regular trading, usually as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, each day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Each fund seeks to meet its investment objective relative to the value of the target index or benchmark as of 4:00 p.m.
Shares of Direxion Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market Price returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 PM Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Fund returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV. Some performance results reflect expense subsidies and waivers in effect during certain periods shown. Absent these waivers, results would have been less favorable.
After-Tax and After-Tax, Post Sales Returns
Tax-adjusted returns and tax cost ratio are estimates of the impact taxes have had on a fund. We assume the highest tax rate in calculating these figures. These returns follow the SEC guidelines for calculating returns before sale of shares. Tax-adjusted returns show a fund’s annualized after tax total return for the one, three and five year periods, excluding any capital-gains effects that would result from selling the fund at the end of the period. To determine this figure, all income and short-term capital gains distributions are taxed at the maximum federal rate at the time of distribution. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a 15% rate. The after tax portion is then assumed to be reinvested in the fund. State and local taxes are not included in our calculations. For more information, please consult your tax consultant.
Distribution Dates

Payable and Ex-Date – With regard to mutual funds, this is the day on which declared distributions (dividends or capital gains) are deducted from the fund’s assets before it calculates its net asset value (NAV). The NAV per share will drop by the amount of the distribution per share.
Record Date – Date by which a shareholder must officially own shares in order to be entitled to a dividend.

Types of Distributions

Income Dividend – A portion of a company’s profit paid to common and preferred shareholders.
Long Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for more than one year.
Short Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for less than one year

Overview of the Direxion All Cap Insider Sentiment ETF | Direxion


























 






























Why KNOW? Why now?
Since inception, the Direxion All Cap Insider Sentiment Shares ETF (Ticker: KNOW) has outperfomed the major U.S. stock indexes including the: S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400, S&P SmallCap 600 and S&P1500 (source: Morningstar Direct). 
It makes sense. Corporate insiders− top officers, boards of directors, and major shareholders − have a natural edge over retail investors, and even financial analysts, because they typically know their businesses and industries better than anyone. That’s why, no matter how much research you do, or how much financial news you consume, you’re always a step behind those “in the know”.
The Direxion All Cap Insider Sentiment Shares (KNOW) is designed to help long term-investors pursue better portfolio outcomes by using insider sentiment to seek alpha relative to S&P 500® Index.
With a net expense ratio of just 0.65%, this strategic index-based ETF provides investors with cost-effective access to stocks that corporate officers, directors, and shareholders who own more than 5% of each company’s stock, are accumulating.
This insider sentiment selection uses a screening methodology based on public-company filings and positive earnings analysis that provides the basis for the funds’ quantitatively-weighted indexes. The ETF is comprised of 100 companies selected from the S&P 1500 Index.

 The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance for one year and under are cumulative, not annualized. Short term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. For additional information, see the fund(s) prospectus.
Each Direxion Fund share price is calculated as of the close of regular trading, usually as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, each day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Each fund seeks to meet its investment objective relative to the value of the target index or benchmark as of 4:00 p.m.
Shares of Direxion Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market Price returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 PM Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Fund returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV. Some performance results reflect expense subsidies and waivers in effect during certain periods shown. Absent these waivers, results would have been less favorable.
After-Tax and After-Tax, Post Sales Returns
Tax-adjusted returns and tax cost ratio are estimates of the impact taxes have had on a fund. We assume the highest tax rate in calculating these figures. These returns follow the SEC guidelines for calculating returns before sale of shares. Tax-adjusted returns show a fund’s annualized after tax total return for the one, three and five year periods, excluding any capital-gains effects that would result from selling the fund at the end of the period. To determine this figure, all income and short-term capital gains distributions are taxed at the maximum federal rate at the time of distribution. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a 15% rate. The after tax portion is then assumed to be reinvested in the fund. State and local taxes are not included in our calculations. For more information, please consult your tax consultant.
Distribution Dates

Payable and Ex-Date – With regard to mutual funds, this is the day on which declared distributions (dividends or capital gains) are deducted from the fund’s assets before it calculates its net asset value (NAV). The NAV per share will drop by the amount of the distribution per share.
Record Date – Date by which a shareholder must officially own shares in order to be entitled to a dividend.

Types of Distributions

Income Dividend – A portion of a company’s profit paid to common and preferred shareholders.
Long Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for more than one year.
Short Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for less than one year

1Through the pledged-asset feature offered by Morgan Stanley Private Bank, National Association, the applicant(s) or third party pledgor (collectively “Client”) may be able to pledge eligible securities in lieu of a full or partial cash down payment or in connection with a refinance mortgage loan. To be eligible for the pledged-asset feature a Client must have a brokerage account at Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC. If the value of the pledged securities in the account drops below the agreed-upon level stated in the loan documents, a Client may be required to deposit additional securities or other collateral (such as cash) to stay in compliance with the terms of the mortgage loan. If a Client does not deposit additional securities or other collateral, the Client’s pledged securities may be sold to satisfy the Client’s obligation, and the Client will not be entitled to choose which assets will be sold. Thus in deciding whether the pledged-asset feature is appropriate, a Client should consider the degree to which he or she is comfortable subjecting his or her investment in a home to the fluctuations of the securities market. The pledged-asset feature is not available in all states. Other restrictions may apply.
2A conditional approval letter, which is subject to conditions, is not a commitment to lend.
3 Relationship-based pricing offered by Morgan Stanley Private Bank, National Association is based on the value of clients’, or their immediate family members’ (i.e., grandparents, parents, and children) eligible assets (collectively “Household Assets”) held within accounts at Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC. To be eligible for relationship-based pricing, Household Assets must be maintained within appropriate eligible accounts prior to the closing date of the residential mortgage loan. Relationship-based pricing is not available on conforming loans.

When deciding whether an adjustable rate mortgage is right for your situation, you should consider the risk of rising rates and rising payments as well as other factors such as how long you plan to own your home.
Residential mortgage loans/home equity lines of credit are offered by Morgan Stanley Private Bank, National Association, an affiliate of Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC. With the exception of the pledged-asset feature, an investment relationship with Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC does not have to be established or maintained to obtain the residential mortgage products offered by Morgan Stanley Private Bank, National Association. All residential mortgage loans/home equity lines of credit are subject to the underwriting standards and independent approval of Morgan Stanley Private Bank, National Association. Rates, terms, and programs are subject to change without notice. Residential mortgage loans/home equity lines of credit may not be available in all states; not available in Guam, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Other restrictions may apply. The information contained herein should not be construed as a commitment to lend. Morgan Stanley Private Bank, National Association is an Equal Housing Lender and Member FDIC that is primarily regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System Unique Identifier #663185. The proceeds from a residential mortgage loan (including draws and advances from a home equity line of credit) are not permitted to be used to purchase, trade, or carry eligible margin stock; repay margin debt that was used to purchase, trade, or carry margin stock; or to make payments on any amounts owed under the note, loan agreement, or loan security agreement; and cannot be deposited into a Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC or other brokerage account.
Interest-only loans enable borrowers to make monthly payments of only the accrued monthly interest on the loan during the introductory interest-only period. Once that period ends, borrowers must make monthly payments of principal and interest for the remaining loan term, and payments will be substantially higher than the interest-only payments. During the interest-only period, the total interest that the borrower will be obligated to pay will vary based on the amount of principal paid down, if any. If a borrower makes just an interest-only payment, and no payment of principal, the total interest payable by the borrower during the interest-only period will be greater than the total interest that a borrower would be obligated to pay on a traditional loan of the same interest rate having principal-and-interest payments. In making comparisons between an interest-only loan and a traditional loan, borrowers should carefully review the terms and conditions of the various loan products available and weigh the relative merits of each type of loan product appropriately.
1-Month Interest only ARM loan is based on 1-Month LIBOR. 1-Month Interest only ARM loan is not available in Maine.
Private Bankers are employees of Morgan Stanley Private Bank, National Association.
Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC is a registered Broker/Dealer, Member SIPC, and not a bank. Where appropriate, Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC has entered into arrangements with banks and other third parties to assist in offering certain banking related products and services.

It Takes a Village to Raise a College Graduate

                            With the rising costs of college, families are taking a multigenerational approach to planning for education and other life goals.
                        





It takes a village to raise a child, but in 2017 it may take an extended family to educate one.
With the costs of higher education trending higher each year, paying for college has become a top-tier life expense, alongside other big-ticket goals like buying a home and planning for retirement. However, education costs have now skyrocketed to the extent that saving for both of those life goals—retirement and home-buying—has become hampered in some families.

Some parents are cutting back on retirement savings contributions to help fund their children’s education.  At the same time, children are entering their 20’s with student loan debt, which in some cases is delaying the purchase of their first home. Even grandparents have modified life goals, choosing to help grandchildren with education expenses now, rather than leaving a larger legacy later.
In short, paying for education has officially become a multigenerational concern. But with a little advance planning, families can make some savvy moves to help prepare for the costs of college. 





The Growing Cost of Education



According to the College Board's latest “Trends in Higher Education" report, the continued increase in average published tuition and fees at colleges and universities is now outpacing the growth in family incomes, financial aid and many consumer goods and services. It now costs, on average, $45,370 per year for tuition, fees, room and board, for a four-year private college. Assuming a college-cost inflation rate of 3%, today’s 8-year-old child may need $255,090 come college time in 2027.
“For parents, the number-one goal from a financial planning perspective is still retirement, but close behind is paying for a child’s education,” says Marc Dextraze, Executive Director, Morgan Stanley Wealth Management Investment Solutions.




It takes a village to raise a child, but in 2017 it may take an extended family to educate one.

One option, says Dextraze, is for parents to start saving early with a 529 college savings plan.  “Having a head start on the costs means less sacrifice later on, avoiding the heavy burden of parental loans," he says. For the child, “Having all or most of their college funding in place means they have more options, like being able to select the college that best fits their interests and goals, as opposed to the college that offers the most aid. And graduating with less student debt means having the ability to pursue the next chapter of their lives with more financial freedom."
Named after Section 529 of the Internal Revenue Code, a 529 plan is a tax-advantaged savings vehicle which allows you to save, or even pay in advance, for college expenses. Earnings in a 529 plan can be tax deferred, and the withdrawals are exempt from federal and state income taxes if you use the funds for qualified expenses such as tuition, fees, room and board and supplies. Many states also offer state tax deductions or tax credits on top of that.





Making Education a Family Affair



Motivated by persistent news headlines about the growing costs of education, grandparents, relatives and even family friends have also begun creating 529 accounts in a child’s name. Not only do 529 plans offer potential tax advantages, they allow the family member or friend to give the gift of education and a young adulthood free from student debt.
“Today it definitely takes a village to send a child to college," says Jennifer Tierney, Vice President, Morgan Stanley Wealth Management Investment Solutions and 529 plans product manager. “It's so important to plan ahead. For grandparents, aunts and uncles, family friends, it just makes sense to leverage the benefits that 529 plans provide to a child and from a tax-perspective, to themselves.”

A Flexible Way to Save and Invest for College



The appeal of 529 plans may derive from their benefits and flexibility.
There are no income restrictions, no required minimum distributions, no limits on the number of accounts the same person or entity can own, generally no maximum age limits for establishing an account, and high contribution limits. Virtually anyone can be named a beneficiary—a child, grandchild, niece, nephew, spouse, even a friend.1
According to Chris Stack, a managing consultant at Savingforcollege.com, one of the most overlooked benefits is the daily access and liquidity of the 529 account, as opposed to a UTMA (Uniform Transfers to Minors Act) or UGMA (Uniform Gifts to Minors Act) account or other strategy. “With 529s, grandparents or extended family give themselves an option, but not an obligation, to apply their funds to help pay college costs," he says. 


Another significant benefit of 529 plans is tax-free compounding. “Earning on an account’s growth, rather than paying taxes on the earnings, provides more funding available in future years when the college costs become a family reality," Stack says. “Having the ability to withdraw the principal and tax-deferred earnings without any federal or state income tax liability is a very significant benefit, especially when compared to alternative strategies such as using a life insurance policy or a taxable account."
Stack recommends that families start preparing for college costs as early as possible. While as soon as the child is born is ideal, he said, some even “begin with an account in their own name years before their first child is born knowing the designated beneficiary can be changed in the future."
Says Dextraze, “At the end of the day, the idea is to harmonize all of your goals, taking whatever tax advantages you can through the various kinds of plans out there, including 401Ks, 529s and others. It’s using all of the available tools. That’s how you reach your goals.”


Morgan Stanley offers many 529s from some of the nation’s leading mutual fund companies. You can choose from a range of investment strategies depending on the specific plan, the age of the beneficiary, your financial objectives and risk tolerance. Talk with your Morgan Stanley Financial Advisor, or find one using the locator below, for more information. 
















1 Some plans may have age, residency or other restrictions and may charge a fee for beneficiary changes, and beneficiary changes may result in an immediate tax liability if the new beneficiary is not a member of the old beneficiary’s family. Contribution limits vary by state. Refer to the individual plan for specific guidelines.


Disclosures
An investor should consider the investment objectives, risks, and charges and expenses associated with 529 plans and municipal fund securities before investing. More information about municipal fund securities is available in the issuer's official statement – the 529 Plan Program Disclosure – which is available from your Financial Advisor. It should be read carefully before investing.
Investments are subject to market risk and may fluctuate in value. Before investing, investors should consider whether tax or other benefits are only available for investments in the investor’s home-state 529 college savings plan. Assets can accumulate and be withdrawn federally tax-free only if they are used to pay for qualified expenses. Earnings on nonqualified distributions will be subject to income tax and a 10% federal income tax penalty. Some states offer favorable tax treatment and other benefits to their residents only if they invest in the state’s own Qualified Tuition Program. Investors should consult with their financial and tax advisor before investing in any 529 plan, or contact their state tax division for more information. Some plans may have age, residency or other restrictions and may charge a fee for beneficiary changes.
Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC (“Morgan Stanley”), its affiliates and Morgan Stanley Financial Advisors do not provide tax or legal advice. Clients should consult their personal tax advisor for tax-related matters and their attorney for legal matters.

                            Navigate the money taboo and get together around what really matters—your family.
                        





What’s the hardest thing to talk about? Death, religion, politics? Would it surprise you to know that one of the most difficult things to discuss is money? When polled, 44% of Americans claimed that personal finance was the hardest to discuss – beating out politics and even death.1
Perhaps this is because money represents more than a topic – it can represent control, power, embarrassment, insecurity, fear. For some people, the hesitation stems from a natural reluctance to confront their own mortality or their potential for future disability. For others, avoiding the topic is caused by the perception that planning is associated with complicated—and expensive—legal and tax issues.

Silence Can Be Harmful



Avoiding these sometimes difficult conversations can have detrimental outcomes and unexpected consequences for your family, such as:
Passing On Bad Habits - Talking to your children about money now can help them avoid mistakes in the future. The key is to talk about what money means to you and why you worked hard to achieve your success. It involves being open about the challenges and responsibilities that accompany wealth – including what you might have wished you’d done differently when younger. And, most important, it’s about your values and what you wish for yourself and your children to accomplish with your privilege. The conversation can serve as an empowering first step to forming a healthy relationship with wealth.
Lost Opportunities - It’s never too early for your children to understand the value of creating a wealth plan that takes family members’ needs into account. Family members may not be aligned on priorities, such as long-term health care needs, charitable giving and generational gifting strategies, and taking the time to establish common goals is the first step in understanding how all members can participate in achieving them. 
The reality is that 70% of families lose their wealth by the second generation.[ii] Lack of communication can ultimately lead to misunderstandings and divergent objectives that could jeopardize your legacy and work against your values.
Costly Procrastination - Perhaps the hardest of conversations to have as an adult is with your aging parents. This is where the danger of putting it off grows exponentially. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human services, 70% of people over 65 will require some long-term care at some point in their lives.[iii] Once a crisis hits, it’s often too late. Now is the time to determine if sufficient long-term health care plans have been made, as well as who will make financial decisions on your parents’ behalf if they lose the ability to safely handle their money. Proper planning gives you time to discuss your decisions with family members. This open communication can help to reduce, if not eliminate, the risk of family discord, resentment or conflict.




Having a hard time starting a conversation about family finances? Here are a few questions to make it easy for you.



 
Is it important to talk about money as a family?




 
At what age do you hope to retire?




 
When is it ok to borrow money?




 
What's your favorite charitable cause and why?




 
How is your generation different from the generations before you?




 
Should children give to charity?

A New Paradigm for Family Wealth Planning











Align Your Goals with Strategies for Reaching Them



Morgan Stanley’s goals-based wealth planning framework strives to guard against more than just market volatility. We believe that a successful planning strategy must meet the following criteria:
1. Your plan should be customized to reflect what you care about most. It should address both the goals you hope to achieve and the risk of outliving your assets.
2. Your plan should address the shifting nature of issues and unknowns you face at different stages of your life and consider risks beyond market volatility, like inflation.
3. Your plan should seek to mitigate judgment and behavioral risks such as panic selling in difficult markets or overspending.





Smash the Taboo



We know it’s hard. Sitting down to discuss your parents’ long-term health needs or checking in with your siblings to see if you are all on the same page relating to any inheritance isn’t easy. What about your children; do they value the same causes that have moved you all your life? Is your spouse prepared should something happen to you?
The tough part is getting started, and that’s where bringing in an objective financial professional can help. We understand that wealth is about much more than just money, and can guide the conversation down those difficult paths to uncover the things that matter most to you and your family. We don’t believe in having a single conversation, but rather a series of talks that shift as your life changes. It’s a road. And you don’t have to travel it alone.
It starts with family, but doesn’t have to end there. We are ready to provide the guidance, tools and information that can help you tackle these difficult topics and transform them into meaningful discussions for your future. Uncover what matters most to you and find a Morgan Stanley Financial Advisor to help guide the conversation. Because the road starts here.

There are so many different fee structures and specialties, knowing how to sort through your options is difficult. You trust your financial advisor with your money, so it is important to make the best possible decision.How to Choose a Financial AdvisorWhen you start your search for a financial advisor, you need to find someone whose skills matches your needs. That means you need to recognize what you are looking for before you start looking.Here are some common needs from financial advisors: Cash flow management Budgeting Retirement planning Investing Paying for children's education No financial advisor is perfect for every need, which is why it is so important to understand your needs before hiring anyone.How to Find a Financial AdvisorYour first step in choosing a financial advisor after examining your needs is to find potential advisors. You will want someone who is easy to reach, and ideally not too far from your home or office so it is easy to get to a meeting if needed.There are over 750,000 registered financial advisors in the United States. SmartAsset's financial advisor search tool can help you navigate to the best advisor for your needs. Answer questions about where you live, your plans for retirement, and other financial priorities. In just a few minutes, you'll be all set and SmartAsset will have an advisor contact you.Questions to Ask a Financial AdvisorOnce you have found a few advisors, you should interview them to decide who is the best fit for your needs. Here are some example questions to ask to make sure you end up with the right advisor.How many years of experience do you have as a professional financial advisor? Do you want someone new and inexperienced managing your money? It is best to find someone with plenty of experience. Advisors with a decade or more under their belt have seen multiple economic cycles and can better help you weather the storm.What is your strongest focus area in financial planning? Some advisors are experts in retirement. Others have expertise in estates and trusts. Others still are best suited to help you pay for your child's education. Some financial advisors focus on people who are self-employed. Be sure to choose someone who can help with what you need, not what someone else needs.What is your budgeting philosophy? Every family's budget is unique. Budgets can be very detailed or more general. Some advisors suggest living frugally to meet your goals, others take a more balanced approach. Find an advisor with a philosophy that matches yours.How are you compensated? Some financial advisors are “fee only.” This means that you pay your advisor a flat fee for their services. Many advisors charge based on the size of your portfolio. The worst situation is where advisors are paid a commission by mutual funds. In this case, a conflict of interest exists. The advisor is incentivized to put your money into those funds even if they are not the best for your needs.How much does it cost to work with you? After learning how they are paid, make sure you know how much you will pay. No one wants a giant surprise bill after your first meeting.Are you a fiduciary? Fiduciary means putting your needs first. Many financial advisors work as a fiduciary and have to put your needs first, even if it means they earn less money. However, many financial advisors are not fiduciaries, and can give you advice that is not in your best interest.Do you own the same investments you'll suggest to me? Do they put their money where their mouth is? Advisors who suggest one strategy to clients and use a different strategy for their own finances should be a big red flag.How have your client's portfolios performed? How did you handle their portfolios during the Great Recession in 2008? These questions get to the root of their performance. If the advisor does not readily share this information, they are probably hiding something that went wrong in the past.  Make Sure Your Financial Advisor is LicensedFinancial advisors are not allowed to give you specific investment advice unless they are licensed. The most common and important license for a financial advisor is the CFP, or Certified Financial Planner. CFPs are regulated and must take a course and pass a test proving their competence in financial topics.Series 7 and Series 63 licenses give finance professionals the ability to recommend and trade stocks, bonds, and other investments on your behalf. Make sure your financial advisor has successfully completed both of these exams and has an up-to-date license.Beware of Lofty PromisesIf an advisor makes promises that sound like something from the 2016 Presidential Campaign, proceed with caution. Promises to beat the market and outperform other advisors and funds are easier said than done. Further, no advisor can promise that they will beat the market.At the end of the day, many financial advisors have similar skills. They use comparable tools and reports to stay up-to-date on the markets and help find the best investments for you. If any advisor gives you a bad vibe, don't feel bad looking elsewhere.Choose an Advisor You Can TrustAfter you have met with a few advisors, it is time to make your decision. Asking about licenses, fees, and past performance is black and white. There are other parts of the decision that are a bit more subjective.Do you like the person? Do you trust them? Would you trust them with your daughter's education fund? Your retirement?If you have been able to limit your list down to your final few, it is time to trust your gut. It is important to have an advisor you like, trust, and enjoy interacting with. Your money is too important to put in the hands of someone you don't trust. Pick and advisor who feels like a partner who will stand beside you through your financial journey. If you do, you'll be on track for a great financial future.If you're ready to start, answer a few questions in SmartAsset's financial advisor selection tool and you'll be contacted by a few advisors in your area to choose from.

Unlike hiring a mechanic or hairstylist, financial advisors are usually long term relationships. They are also taking responsibility for your money. With your entire livelihood on the line, choosing the wrong advisor would be a big mistake. Avoid these 7 common blunders when choosing an advisor to ensure you are on track to meet your financial goals.1. Hiring the First Advisor You MeetDepending on where you live, you could have dozens of options for advisors. It is tempting to hire the closest advisor to home. Some people might just pick the first advisor in the yellow pages. This decision requires more time. Take the time to interview at least a few advisors before picking the best match for you.2. Choosing an Advisor with the Wrong SpecialtyAdvisors can have different focus area. Some specialize on retirement planning. Some are best for business owners or those with a high net worth. Others are best for young professionals starting a family. This type of focus does not make an advisor better or worse. It makes them better for certain people than others. Be sure to understand an advisor’s strengths and weaknesses. Do that before signing on the dotted line.3. Picking an Advisor with an Incompatible StrategyEach advisor has a unique strategy. Some advisors may suggest aggressive investments. Others are more conservative. Again, there is no right or wrong. However, there is a right and wrong for you. If you don’t feel comfortable with risk, don’t choose an advisor that prefers aggressive investments. If you prefer to go all in on stocks, an advisor that prefers bonds and index funds is not a great match for your style.4. Skipping Checking ReferencesMost advisors are happy to offer references to prospective clients. If you ask about references and they act nervous, that's a red flag! Quality advisors are happy to discuss past missteps and what they learned. This helps them keep from repeating the same mistake in the future. Calling references only takes a couple of minutes. It can help put you at ease when handing over the keys to your bank account.5. Not Asking about CredentialsTo give investment advice, financial advisors are required to pass a test. Ask your advisor about their licenses, tests, and credentials. This ensures they are qualified to meet your needs. Financial advisors tests include the Series 7 and Series 66 or Series 65. Some advisors go a step further and become a Certified Financial Planner, or CFP. Also ask where they went to school and what degree they earned. Some advisors have a finance degree from a top school. Others could have an English degree from a community college.6. Making Assumptions When They are Affiliated with a Reputable BrandAn advisor might appear qualified and professional due to an association with a major firm like J.P. Morgan or Morgan Stanley. However, that doesn’t make them a great advisor. Working with an advisor from a reputable firm is not a bad idea. It often leads to stability and better tools and information. However, they still have quite a bit of autonomy. Choose an advisor because they are the best fit, not because of their branding.7. Not Understanding How They are PaidThere are different payment models for financial advisors. Some are “fee only.” In this case, they charge a flat rate no matter what. Others charge a percentage of assets under management. Some advisors are paid by mutual funds. This is the worst situation for you. This is a serious conflict of interest. If the advisor earns more by ignoring your best interests, do not hire them.Do Your Research to Find the Perfect AdvisorChoosing a financial advisor is an important decision. It requires the best information available. Gathering information about financial advisors can be tough. That is why SmartAsset created a financial advisor match tool. Answering basic questions results in a list of local advisors to choose from. It doesn't matter if you need help with your finances or just want a second opinion.

 The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance for one year and under are cumulative, not annualized. Short term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. For additional information, see the fund(s) prospectus.
Each Direxion Fund share price is calculated as of the close of regular trading, usually as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, each day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Each fund seeks to meet its investment objective relative to the value of the target index or benchmark as of 4:00 p.m.
Shares of Direxion Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market Price returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 PM Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Fund returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV. Some performance results reflect expense subsidies and waivers in effect during certain periods shown. Absent these waivers, results would have been less favorable.
After-Tax and After-Tax, Post Sales Returns
Tax-adjusted returns and tax cost ratio are estimates of the impact taxes have had on a fund. We assume the highest tax rate in calculating these figures. These returns follow the SEC guidelines for calculating returns before sale of shares. Tax-adjusted returns show a fund’s annualized after tax total return for the one, three and five year periods, excluding any capital-gains effects that would result from selling the fund at the end of the period. To determine this figure, all income and short-term capital gains distributions are taxed at the maximum federal rate at the time of distribution. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a 15% rate. The after tax portion is then assumed to be reinvested in the fund. State and local taxes are not included in our calculations. For more information, please consult your tax consultant.
Distribution Dates

Payable and Ex-Date – With regard to mutual funds, this is the day on which declared distributions (dividends or capital gains) are deducted from the fund’s assets before it calculates its net asset value (NAV). The NAV per share will drop by the amount of the distribution per share.
Record Date – Date by which a shareholder must officially own shares in order to be entitled to a dividend.

Types of Distributions

Income Dividend – A portion of a company’s profit paid to common and preferred shareholders.
Long Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for more than one year.
Short Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for less than one year

Overview of the Direxion All Cap Insider Sentiment ETF | Direxion


























 






























Why KNOW? Why now?
Since inception, the Direxion All Cap Insider Sentiment Shares ETF (Ticker: KNOW) has outperfomed the major U.S. stock indexes including the: S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400, S&P SmallCap 600 and S&P1500 (source: Morningstar Direct). 
It makes sense. Corporate insiders− top officers, boards of directors, and major shareholders − have a natural edge over retail investors, and even financial analysts, because they typically know their businesses and industries better than anyone. That’s why, no matter how much research you do, or how much financial news you consume, you’re always a step behind those “in the know”.
The Direxion All Cap Insider Sentiment Shares (KNOW) is designed to help long term-investors pursue better portfolio outcomes by using insider sentiment to seek alpha relative to S&P 500® Index.
With a net expense ratio of just 0.65%, this strategic index-based ETF provides investors with cost-effective access to stocks that corporate officers, directors, and shareholders who own more than 5% of each company’s stock, are accumulating.
This insider sentiment selection uses a screening methodology based on public-company filings and positive earnings analysis that provides the basis for the funds’ quantitatively-weighted indexes. The ETF is comprised of 100 companies selected from the S&P 1500 Index.
