History[edit]
Main articles: PJSC VimpelCom and Beeline (brand)




Dmitry Zimin, the founder and honorary president


Russian PJSC VimpelCom was founded in 1992 in Moscow when VimpelCom's co-founders, Dmitry Zimin[9] and American Augie K. Fabela II came together to pioneer the Russian mobile industry.[10] Augie Fabela, who was then a young entrepreneur from the United States, and Zimin, who was a Russian scientist in his fifties, together launched the Beeline brand in 1993.
The company was one of the first mobile carriers in Russia. Its name derives from вымпел, the Russian word for pennon.
New York Stock Exchange[edit]




The old logo of OJSC VimpelCom during NYSE listing in 1996-2010


In 1996, PJSC VimpelCom, then the leader of Moscow cellular market (and automatically the largest mobile operator in Russia), became the first Russian company to have its shares listed on the New York Stock Exchange (with "VIP" as the ticker symbol).[11]
The company's main shareholders are Telenor, a Norwegian telecom conglomerate, and Alfa Group, a vehicle of Russian tycoon Mikhail Fridman. They have been locked in a years-long struggle for control of this enterprise as well as other telecommunication assets in Eastern Europe.[12][13]
In 2008, PJSC VimpelCom obtained a 49.9% stake in Euroset, the largest mobile retailer in Russia and the CIS, which formerly belonged to its founder Yevgeny Chichvarkin.[11]
United holding company[edit]
See also: Kyivstar




Alexander Izosimov was the CEO of VimpelCom Ltd. until May 2011


VimpelCom Ltd. holding company was founded in 2009. In 2009, Telenor and Alfa agreed to merge their assets in VimpelCom and Kyivstar (Ukraine's number one wireless operator) with the aim of creating VimpelCom Ltd. (incorporated in Bermuda).[14]
In October 2010, the united company acquired from Naguib Sawiris two assets:[citation needed]

Orascom Telecom Holding SAE, the largest mobile phone company in North Africa;
Wind Italy, the third largest mobile phone company in Italy.

As of 31 December 2011, the company had 205 million customers across 20 countries.[11]. After several divestments and a business transformation, by summer 2017, VEON had a combined subscriber base of more than 200 million across 12 markets.[15]
In February 2015, the government of Algeria acquired a 51% stake in Djezzy for US$2.6 billion.[16]
2015–present[edit]
In September 2014, VimpelCom agreed to sell its majority stake in Wind Mobile for $272 million to its minority owner Globalive.[17]
In the summer of 2015, the United States Justice Department claimed that VimpelCom used a network of shell companies and phony consulting contracts to funnel bribes to a close relative of the president of Uzbekistan, in exchange for access to that country’s telecommunications market.[18] The board of one part-owner, Norwegian telecom operator Telenor, has severed consulting ties with former VimpelCom chief executive Jon Fredrik Baksaas due to the continuing police investigation.[19]
In November 2015 the company CEO, Jo Lunder was arrested on corruption charges in Oslo, Norway. The case alleges that in exchange for an operating license, VimpelCom has funneled $57.5M to Takilant, a company linked to Gulnara Karimova, the daughter of Uzbek President Islam Karimov.[20]
The Securities and Exchange Commission announced 18-02-2016 a global settlement along with the U.S. Department of Justice and Dutch regulators that requires telecommunications provider VimpelCom Ltd. to pay more than $795 million to resolve its violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) to win business in Uzbekistan.[21][22]
On 27 February 2017, VimpelCom renamed itself Veon, named after the messaging platform that it had developed. The company explained that the re-branding was part of a shift towards marketing themselves as a technology company, and not solely a telecommunications firm.[23]

History[edit]
Main articles: PJSC VimpelCom and Beeline (brand)




Dmitry Zimin, the founder and honorary president


Russian PJSC VimpelCom was founded in 1992 in Moscow when VimpelCom's co-founders, Dmitry Zimin[9] and American Augie K. Fabela II came together to pioneer the Russian mobile industry.[10] Augie Fabela, who was then a young entrepreneur from the United States, and Zimin, who was a Russian scientist in his fifties, together launched the Beeline brand in 1993.
The company was one of the first mobile carriers in Russia. Its name derives from вымпел, the Russian word for pennon.
New York Stock Exchange[edit]




The old logo of OJSC VimpelCom during NYSE listing in 1996-2010


In 1996, PJSC VimpelCom, then the leader of Moscow cellular market (and automatically the largest mobile operator in Russia), became the first Russian company to have its shares listed on the New York Stock Exchange (with "VIP" as the ticker symbol).[11]
The company's main shareholders are Telenor, a Norwegian telecom conglomerate, and Alfa Group, a vehicle of Russian tycoon Mikhail Fridman. They have been locked in a years-long struggle for control of this enterprise as well as other telecommunication assets in Eastern Europe.[12][13]
In 2008, PJSC VimpelCom obtained a 49.9% stake in Euroset, the largest mobile retailer in Russia and the CIS, which formerly belonged to its founder Yevgeny Chichvarkin.[11]
United holding company[edit]
See also: Kyivstar




Alexander Izosimov was the CEO of VimpelCom Ltd. until May 2011


VimpelCom Ltd. holding company was founded in 2009. In 2009, Telenor and Alfa agreed to merge their assets in VimpelCom and Kyivstar (Ukraine's number one wireless operator) with the aim of creating VimpelCom Ltd. (incorporated in Bermuda).[14]
In October 2010, the united company acquired from Naguib Sawiris two assets:[citation needed]

Orascom Telecom Holding SAE, the largest mobile phone company in North Africa;
Wind Italy, the third largest mobile phone company in Italy.

As of 31 December 2011, the company had 205 million customers across 20 countries.[11]. After several divestments and a business transformation, by summer 2017, VEON had a combined subscriber base of more than 200 million across 12 markets.[15]
In February 2015, the government of Algeria acquired a 51% stake in Djezzy for US$2.6 billion.[16]
2015–present[edit]
In September 2014, VimpelCom agreed to sell its majority stake in Wind Mobile for $272 million to its minority owner Globalive.[17]
In the summer of 2015, the United States Justice Department claimed that VimpelCom used a network of shell companies and phony consulting contracts to funnel bribes to a close relative of the president of Uzbekistan, in exchange for access to that country’s telecommunications market.[18] The board of one part-owner, Norwegian telecom operator Telenor, has severed consulting ties with former VimpelCom chief executive Jon Fredrik Baksaas due to the continuing police investigation.[19]
In November 2015 the company CEO, Jo Lunder was arrested on corruption charges in Oslo, Norway. The case alleges that in exchange for an operating license, VimpelCom has funneled $57.5M to Takilant, a company linked to Gulnara Karimova, the daughter of Uzbek President Islam Karimov.[20]
The Securities and Exchange Commission announced 18-02-2016 a global settlement along with the U.S. Department of Justice and Dutch regulators that requires telecommunications provider VimpelCom Ltd. to pay more than $795 million to resolve its violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) to win business in Uzbekistan.[21][22]
On 27 February 2017, VimpelCom renamed itself Veon, named after the messaging platform that it had developed. The company explained that the re-branding was part of a shift towards marketing themselves as a technology company, and not solely a telecommunications firm.[23]

History[edit]
Main articles: PJSC VimpelCom and Beeline (brand)




Dmitry Zimin, the founder and honorary president


Russian PJSC VimpelCom was founded in 1992 in Moscow when VimpelCom's co-founders, Dmitry Zimin[9] and American Augie K. Fabela II came together to pioneer the Russian mobile industry.[10] Augie Fabela, who was then a young entrepreneur from the United States, and Zimin, who was a Russian scientist in his fifties, together launched the Beeline brand in 1993.
The company was one of the first mobile carriers in Russia. Its name derives from вымпел, the Russian word for pennon.
New York Stock Exchange[edit]

In 1996, PJSC VimpelCom, then the leader of Moscow cellular market (and automatically the largest mobile operator in Russia), became the first Russian company to have its shares listed on the New York Stock Exchange (with "VIP" as the ticker symbol).[11]
The company's main shareholders are Telenor, a Norwegian telecom conglomerate, and Alfa Group, a vehicle of Russian tycoon Mikhail Fridman. They have been locked in a years-long struggle for control of this enterprise as well as other telecommunication assets in Eastern Europe.[12][13]
In 2008, PJSC VimpelCom obtained a 49.9% stake in Euroset, the largest mobile retailer in Russia and the CIS, which formerly belonged to its founder Yevgeny Chichvarkin.[11]
United holding company[edit]
See also: Kyivstar




Alexander Izosimov was the CEO of VimpelCom Ltd. until May 2011


VimpelCom Ltd. holding company was founded in 2009. In 2009, Telenor and Alfa agreed to merge their assets in VimpelCom and Kyivstar (Ukraine's number one wireless operator) with the aim of creating VimpelCom Ltd. (incorporated in Bermuda).[14]
In October 2010, the united company acquired from Naguib Sawiris two assets:[citation needed]

Orascom Telecom Holding SAE, the largest mobile phone company in North Africa;
Wind Italy, the third largest mobile phone company in Italy.

As of 31 December 2011, the company had 205 million customers across 20 countries.[11]. After several divestments and a business transformation, by summer 2017, VEON had a combined subscriber base of more than 200 million across 12 markets.[15]
In February 2015, the government of Algeria acquired a 51% stake in Djezzy for US$2.6 billion.[16]
2015–present[edit]
In September 2014, VimpelCom agreed to sell its majority stake in Wind Mobile for $272 million to its minority owner Globalive.[17]
In the summer of 2015, the United States Justice Department claimed that VimpelCom used a network of shell companies and phony consulting contracts to funnel bribes to a close relative of the president of Uzbekistan, in exchange for access to that country’s telecommunications market.[18] The board of one part-owner, Norwegian telecom operator Telenor, has severed consulting ties with former VimpelCom chief executive Jon Fredrik Baksaas due to the continuing police investigation.[19]
In November 2015 the company CEO, Jo Lunder was arrested on corruption charges in Oslo, Norway. The case alleges that in exchange for an operating license, VimpelCom has funneled $57.5M to Takilant, a company linked to Gulnara Karimova, the daughter of Uzbek President Islam Karimov.[20]
The Securities and Exchange Commission announced 18-02-2016 a global settlement along with the U.S. Department of Justice and Dutch regulators that requires telecommunications provider VimpelCom Ltd. to pay more than $795 million to resolve its violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) to win business in Uzbekistan.[21][22]
On 27 February 2017, VimpelCom renamed itself Veon, named after the messaging platform that it had developed. The company explained that the re-branding was part of a shift towards marketing themselves as a technology company, and not solely a telecommunications firm.[23]

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

VimpelCom to Pay $795 Million in Global Settlement for FCPA Violations
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
          2016-34
        

          Washington D.C.,           Feb. 18, 2016—
        

	The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced a global settlement along with the U.S. Department of Justice and Dutch regulators that requires telecommunications provider VimpelCom Ltd. to pay more than $795 million to resolve its violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) to win business in Uzbekistan.



	The SEC alleges that VimpelCom offered and paid bribes to an Uzbek government official related to the President of Uzbekistan as the company entered the Uzbek telecommunications market and sought government-issued licenses, frequencies, channels, and number blocks.  At least $114 million in bribe payments were funneled through an entity affiliated with the Uzbek official, and approximately a half-million dollars in bribes were disguised as charitable donations made to charities directly affiliated with the Uzbek official.



	“VimpelCom made massive revenues in Uzbekistan by paying over $100 million to an official with significant influence over top leaders of the Uzbek government,” said Andrew J. Ceresney, Director of the SEC Enforcement Division.  “These old-fashioned bribes, hidden through sham contracts and charitable contributions, left the company’s books and records riddled with inaccuracies.”



	The settlement requires VimpelCom to pay $167.5 million to the SEC, $230.1 million to the U.S. Department of Justice, and $397.5 million to Dutch regulators.  The company must retain an independent corporate monitor for at least three years. 



	“International cooperation among regulators is critical to holding companies responsible for all facets of a bribery scheme.  This closely coordinated settlement is a product of the extraordinary efforts of the SEC, Department of Justice, and law enforcement partners around the globe to jointly pursue those who break the law to win business,” said Kara N. Brockmeyer, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division’s FCPA Unit.



	The SEC’s complaint was filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.  VimpelCom consented to the entry of a court order ordering the company to pay disgorgement and retain an independent monitor, and permanently enjoining the company from future violations of Sections 30A, 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 



	The SEC’s continuing investigation is being conducted by the FCPA Unit under the supervision of its Deputy Chief Charles Cain.  The SEC appreciates the significant assistance of the Department of Justice’s Criminal Division, Fraud and Asset Forfeiture Money Laundering Sections as well as the following agencies: Internal Revenue Service, Department of Homeland Security, Public Prosecution Service of the Netherlands (Openbaar Ministrie), National Authority for Investigation and Prosecution of Economic and Environmental Crime in Norway (ØKOKRIM), Swedish Prosecution Authority, Office of the Attorney General in Switzerland, and Corruption Prevention and Combating Bureau in Latvia.  Other valuable assistance was provided by the British Virgin Islands Financial Services Commission, Caymans Islands Monetary Authority, Bermuda Monetary Authority, and Central Bank of Ireland, Estonia Financial Supervisory Authority (Finantsinspektioon), Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores (Spain), Latvian Financial and Capital Market Commission, UAE Securities and Commodities Authority, Banking Commission of the Marshall Islands, and Gibraltar Financial Services Commission.

Telecommunications & Wireless Market Research Reports & Industry Analysis


The terminology wireless communication includes a wide range of products including handheld radios, PDAs, cell phones, and wireless networking. There are other examples of wireless technology that can be found in devices like Maritime VHF, garage door openers, computer mice, satellite television, GPS, keyboards, and cordless telephones.

Wireless communication has the ability to be limited to small distances, like it’s done with bluetooth communications, or also to thousand mile distances like with short wave radio communication. Very often wireless communication is applied where wires are not possible or costly.

Wireless communications can be found frequently within the telecommunication sector as a vehicle to transport data without the need to use wires. This transfer of data over large distances to communicate with complex, electrical products can be found in devices like telegraphs, teletypes, telephones, the use of microwave and radio waves, fiber optics and their corresponding electronics, in addition to its use in various orbiting satellites and the Internet.

While the focus of opportunity in the telecommunications industry continually changes from wired to wireless frameworks, the necessity to access a larger portion of the electromagnetic spectrum becomes increasingly valuable. There are many competing opinions of the best way to free up spectrum under the present power and control of the government bureaucracy’s around the world.
