Publication number:  20070169381
                                            

Abstract:  A shoe suited for walking or running includes a shoe sole, a shoe upper attached to the shoe sole, and a pedometer integrated into one of the shoe sole and the shoe upper. The pedometer includes structure configured for monitoring a remaining useful life of the shoe, and structure configured to alert a user when the remaining useful life is approaching or has reached an end. The shoe indicates when it should be replaced to protect against skeletal, bone, shin, internal and other user injury resulting from running/walking on shoes that have diminished shock absorbency.

A sealable stool receptacle is removably secured to the lip adjacent the opening section. After a sample is deposited, the receptacle can be easily removed from the disposable strip and sealed for subsequent processing. The strip, with or without a seat cover, can then be discarded.
