Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/25/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

The Lord’s Prayer (2007)





    Duration: 4 minutes
    Soloist(s): Tenor
    Chorus: SATB
    Published by: Novello & Co Ltd
Purchase / hire sheet music

Description


Reviews (0)




Description
This setting of The Lord’s Prayer alternates between Latin and English. The Latin words are sung to the original plainsong, with the ensuing choral phrases growing out of the plainsong’s contours. Interaction between tenor soloist and choir further emphasises the juxtaposition of the two languages.
