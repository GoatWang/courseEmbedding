Bass, at which time it established its longstanding approach as “principal-minded” investors and its core philosophy of partnership through alignment of interests.

of Interests








Oak Hill’s philosophy of alignment of interests has been a guiding principle of the Firm’s success. The Firm seeks to partner with exceptional entrepreneurs, management teams, and corporations that share a common vision for maximizing value creation and structures each investment to align the economic interests of all constituencies. Oak Hill believes that creating transaction structures and incentive programs that reward management teams for value creation and that align management’s economic outcomes with those of the Oak Hill team and Limited Partners significantly enhance its investment returns. In addition, Oak Hill has offered significant co-investment opportunities to Limited Partners, which further aligns these constituencies.

Leverage sector knowledge to develop actionable investment themes based on observable long-term trends
Proactively originate investment opportunities that align with Oak Hill’s investment themes
Partner with proven management teams and leverage in-house functional experts
