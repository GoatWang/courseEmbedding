History[edit]
Philips had been in the broadcast market for many years with a line of PC- and LDK- Norelco professional video cameras and other video products. By the 1980s, the Norelco name was dropped in favour of Philips. Robert Bosch GmbH's Fernseh Division also had a long history going back to the early days of Television (1929).
BTS's North America headquarters was at first located in Salt Lake City, Utah. This was later moved to Simi Valley, California, in 1991, later returning SLC. Also in 1991, BTS Latin America headed by Mario Castellanos entered into an agreement to provide Televisa SA of Mexico what was believed to be until that time, the largest equipment sale in history.
In 1995 Philips Electronics North America Corp. fully acquired BTS Inc., renaming it Philips Broadcast-Philips Digital Video Systems. The BTS Inc.'s Darmstadt factory in Germany was near the Darmstadt Train Station and European Space Operations Centre this was later moved a short distance to Weiterstadt, Germany.
In March 2001 Philips' broadcast video division was sold to Thomson SA, the current owner; the Division was call Thomson Multimedia. In 2002, the French electronics giant Thomson SA also acquired the Grass Valley Group from Terry Gooding of San Diego, CA, USA. Grass Valley, Inc., the Thomson, Grass Valley, a Thomson Brand is headquartered in Nevada City, California. Thomson Film Division, located in Weiterstadt including the product line of Spirit DataCine, Bones Work station and LUTher 3D Color Space converter, was sold to Parter Capital Group [1]. The sale was made public on Sept. 9, 2008 and completed on Dec. 1, 2008. New headquarters is in Weiterstadt, the former Bosch Fernseh - BTS factory. Parter Capital Group will continue to have worldwide offices to support products from Weiterstadt, Germany.[1][2] The new name of the company is Digital Film Technology. On October 1, 2012 Precision Mechatronics and DFT were acquired by Prasad Corp, part of Prasad Studios.[3][4] In 2013 DFT moved from Weiterstadt to Arheilgen-Darmstadt, Germany.

Grassvalley operated offices in the cities of all the former acquisitions:
Cergy, France (Thomson World Headquarters)
Salt Lake City, Utah, USA - from TeleMation Inc. -Bell and Howell - BTS
Beaverton, Oregon, USA - from Tektronix
Nevada City, California, USA - from Grassvalley Group
Breda, Netherlands - from Philips - Norelco - BTS

After the financial crisis of 2008, Thomson became upside-down in its financial covenants and was forced by its creditors to divest itself of Grass Valley and other manufacturing entities. On January 29, 2009, Thomson announced that they were putting the Grass Valley division up for sale.[5]
In 2010, the Grass Valley business unit, not including the head-end and transmission businesses, was acquired by private equity firm Francisco Partners and resumed operating as an independent company on January 1, 2011.[6] Grass Valley still maintains offices worldwide.[7] Grass Valley was sold to Belden on February 6, 2014, Belden also owns Miranda.[8]

History[edit]
Philips had been in the broadcast market for many years with a line of PC- and LDK- Norelco professional video cameras and other video products. By the 1980s, the Norelco name was dropped in favour of Philips. Robert Bosch GmbH's Fernseh Division also had a long history going back to the early days of Television (1929).
BTS's North America headquarters was at first located in Salt Lake City, Utah. This was later moved to Simi Valley, California, in 1991, later returning SLC. Also in 1991, BTS Latin America headed by Mario Castellanos entered into an agreement to provide Televisa SA of Mexico what was believed to be until that time, the largest equipment sale in history.
In 1995 Philips Electronics North America Corp. fully acquired BTS Inc., renaming it Philips Broadcast-Philips Digital Video Systems. The BTS Inc.'s Darmstadt factory in Germany was near the Darmstadt Train Station and European Space Operations Centre this was later moved a short distance to Weiterstadt, Germany.
In March 2001 Philips' broadcast video division was sold to Thomson SA, the current owner; the Division was call Thomson Multimedia. In 2002, the French electronics giant Thomson SA also acquired the Grass Valley Group from Terry Gooding of San Diego, CA, USA. Grass Valley, Inc., the Thomson, Grass Valley, a Thomson Brand is headquartered in Nevada City, California. Thomson Film Division, located in Weiterstadt including the product line of Spirit DataCine, Bones Work station and LUTher 3D Color Space converter, was sold to Parter Capital Group [1]. The sale was made public on Sept. 9, 2008 and completed on Dec. 1, 2008. New headquarters is in Weiterstadt, the former Bosch Fernseh - BTS factory. Parter Capital Group will continue to have worldwide offices to support products from Weiterstadt, Germany.[1][2] The new name of the company is Digital Film Technology. On October 1, 2012 Precision Mechatronics and DFT were acquired by Prasad Corp, part of Prasad Studios.[3][4] In 2013 DFT moved from Weiterstadt to Arheilgen-Darmstadt, Germany.

Grassvalley operated offices in the cities of all the former acquisitions:
Cergy, France (Thomson World Headquarters)
Salt Lake City, Utah, USA - from TeleMation Inc. -Bell and Howell - BTS
Beaverton, Oregon, USA - from Tektronix
Nevada City, California, USA - from Grassvalley Group
Breda, Netherlands - from Philips - Norelco - BTS

After the financial crisis of 2008, Thomson became upside-down in its financial covenants and was forced by its creditors to divest itself of Grass Valley and other manufacturing entities. On January 29, 2009, Thomson announced that they were putting the Grass Valley division up for sale.[5]
In 2010, the Grass Valley business unit, not including the head-end and transmission businesses, was acquired by private equity firm Francisco Partners and resumed operating as an independent company on January 1, 2011.[6] Grass Valley still maintains offices worldwide.[7] Grass Valley was sold to Belden on February 6, 2014, Belden also owns Miranda.[8]

Philips invented the plumbicon pick up video camera tube in 1965; almost all of their color cameras used this award-winning tube. Starting with the LDK 90 camera, Philips used their Frame transfer CCD - Charge-coupled device. Philips' patented Dynamic Pixel Management (DPM) FT-17 CCD technology won awards and was first used in the 1994 LDK10 and LDK10p camera.

History[edit]
Philips had been in the broadcast market for many years with a line of PC- and LDK- Norelco professional video cameras and other video products. By the 1980s, the Norelco name was dropped in favour of Philips. Robert Bosch GmbH's Fernseh Division also had a long history going back to the early days of Television (1929).
BTS's North America headquarters was at first located in Salt Lake City, Utah. This was later moved to Simi Valley, California, in 1991, later returning SLC. Also in 1991, BTS Latin America headed by Mario Castellanos entered into an agreement to provide Televisa SA of Mexico what was believed to be until that time, the largest equipment sale in history.
In 1995 Philips Electronics North America Corp. fully acquired BTS Inc., renaming it Philips Broadcast-Philips Digital Video Systems. The BTS Inc.'s Darmstadt factory in Germany was near the Darmstadt Train Station and European Space Operations Centre this was later moved a short distance to Weiterstadt, Germany.
In March 2001 Philips' broadcast video division was sold to Thomson SA, the current owner; the Division was call Thomson Multimedia. In 2002, the French electronics giant Thomson SA also acquired the Grass Valley Group from Terry Gooding of San Diego, CA, USA. Grass Valley, Inc., the Thomson, Grass Valley, a Thomson Brand is headquartered in Nevada City, California. Thomson Film Division, located in Weiterstadt including the product line of Spirit DataCine, Bones Work station and LUTher 3D Color Space converter, was sold to Parter Capital Group [1]. The sale was made public on Sept. 9, 2008 and completed on Dec. 1, 2008. New headquarters is in Weiterstadt, the former Bosch Fernseh - BTS factory. Parter Capital Group will continue to have worldwide offices to support products from Weiterstadt, Germany.[1][2] The new name of the company is Digital Film Technology. On October 1, 2012 Precision Mechatronics and DFT were acquired by Prasad Corp, part of Prasad Studios.[3][4] In 2013 DFT moved from Weiterstadt to Arheilgen-Darmstadt, Germany.

Grassvalley operated offices in the cities of all the former acquisitions:
Cergy, France (Thomson World Headquarters)
Salt Lake City, Utah, USA - from TeleMation Inc. -Bell and Howell - BTS
Beaverton, Oregon, USA - from Tektronix
Nevada City, California, USA - from Grassvalley Group
Breda, Netherlands - from Philips - Norelco - BTS

After the financial crisis of 2008, Thomson became upside-down in its financial covenants and was forced by its creditors to divest itself of Grass Valley and other manufacturing entities. On January 29, 2009, Thomson announced that they were putting the Grass Valley division up for sale.[5]
In 2010, the Grass Valley business unit, not including the head-end and transmission businesses, was acquired by private equity firm Francisco Partners and resumed operating as an independent company on January 1, 2011.[6] Grass Valley still maintains offices worldwide.[7] Grass Valley was sold to Belden on February 6, 2014, Belden also owns Miranda.[8]
