Plexus Corporation. (9/10/14). "Press Release: Microsaic Systems plc Selects Plexus for Commercial Manufacture of Microsaics 4000 MiD Scientific Instrument". Kelso & Woking.
Plexus Corp. (NASDAQ: PLXS), a global provider of optimised Product Realization solutions, and Microsaic Systems (AIM: MSYS), the developer of chip-based scientific instruments, have entered an agreement for Plexus to provide design and manufacturing solutions from its UK facilities.  Plexus will support Microsaic with the manufacture of its 4000 MiD® miniature, fully self-contained mass spectrometry (MS) system, which was launched in March 2013.

"We are delighted to have entered into this partnership with Microsaic Systems," stated Ronnie Darroch, Plexus Regional President in EMEA. "This decision by Microsaic represents a true testament of Plexus' experience and professionalism.  It is also a result of our continuing investment in our European operations in the UK, Romania and Germany, which enables us to deliver world-class solutions to our customers." 

Colin Jump, Chief Executive of Microsaic Systems, added, "Plexus represents an excellent strategic fit for Microsaic. Its track record and customer base are world class and through this agreement we gain the ability to optimise and scale our manufacturing to meet the increasing demand for our products now and in the future."

Microsaic was specifically looking for an experienced and credible UK partner to keep production close to its own facility in Surrey. Plexus was selected as a result of its expertise with complex sub-assemblies and its ability to provide engineering solutions for the long term support of current and future product developments.

Plexus has developed a broad service offering for product providers in the Healthcare/ Life Sciences industry and will continue to make further investments in this high growth market.
