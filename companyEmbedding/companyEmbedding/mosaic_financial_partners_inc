Build confidence
Take time for deep reflection
Get unstuck
Make meaningful connections
Learn to make wise decisions in the face of uncertainty
Become empowered to act boldly and purposefully
Better understand money-related emotions









Upcoming Circles
Topic:  Balancing Investment Risk

More about our Circles
A financial conversation for women is transformed into a Circle through the willingness of attendants to shift from informal socializing or opinionated discussion into a receptive attitude of thoughtful speaking and deep listening.

Here's what happened at a recent Circle discussing bag lady syndrome. 
Here's some key introductory estate planning takeaways the savvy Circle ladies discussed in the fall.

A circle is a meaningful symbol – in the cycles of life, in the changing of the seasons as years come and go, and in the wisdom we pass on as we share our experiences with those around us, so that they in turn may share. Women have gathered in circles throughout history. 
A little bit about your hosts
Liz Revenko, MA, MBA, CFP® and Mary Ballin, CFP® are financial planners and women's advocates who believe that financial decisions should be aligned with one's values.

Mary is the recipient of the Women's Choice Award in recognition of her passionate dedication to addressing the financial needs of women and their families.

Mary Ballin, CFP®Client Advisor







“The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.” Eleanor Roosevelt










  


























Mary L. Ballin, recipient of the Women's Choice Award, has over 15 years of experience in the financial services industry. She joined Mosaic Financial Partners, Inc. in 2003 and was an essential part of the team who founded the East Bay office. Prior to joining Mosaic, Mary spent several years with Charles Schwab and Co. Inc. as a trader in Denver, CO and then as a Investment Consultant in Castro Valley. Mary’s extensive experience also includes corporate retail management, where as a store executive she helped lead the company’s regional store growth.
Mary specializes in working with women who have experienced a life transition, such as divorce, widowhood, marriage, or an unexpected loss. The vast majority of women are, at some point in life, going to be put in a position where they have to take care of themselves financially. As a result, Mary has a passion for providing education to women about a wide variety of personal financial topics. She and colleague Liz Revenko founded Mosaic Women’s Circles, quarterly gatherings where women come together to explore their relationships with money and learn from each other’s experiences.  
Mary is a member of the East Bay chapter of the Financial Planning Association.  A native of the East Bay, Mary is very active in the community.  Currently, she volunteers her time with Girl Scouts both as a troop leader and as a member of the San Ramon Service Unit as Membership Support Manager and Registrar.
In December 2008, Mary completed the Certified Financial Planning Board required coursework through UC Berkeley’s Personal Financial Planning program and in May 2010, she earned the right to use the CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER™ designation. She received her Bachelor of Science from California State University, Hayward in Business Administration and Marketing.

Sheila Schroeder Director of Client Development







“Get it done by getting it started.”Anonymous










 

























As Director of Client Development at Mosaic, I focus on bringing together the needs of our clients with the resources and expertise the Mosaic team has to offer. I have over 25 years of financial services experience, with an emphasis on forging engaged relationships by tailoring products and ideas to client needs. 
I am passionate about reaching financial independence, empowering women financially, and teaching financial literacy.
As a senior institutional equity sales executive and team leader, my primary focus was on Asian/Japanese markets, in sectors including real estate, commodities, infrastructure, consumer and financials. I have served as lead salesperson on multiple IPO's and secondary offerings, including a number in excess of $1B. This experience helps me bring strong technical perspective on global markets and public equities. I have a deep understanding of how market trends and cycles impact investor portfolios.
I am involved with several non-profits in fundraising and organizational roles, including serving as President of the Board of Trustees for the San Francisco Waldorf School. I co-founded Electing Women San Francisco to further national campaigns of female democratic US Senate and Gubernatorial candidates. Currently I am serving on the Chautauqua Institution Promise campaign as a lead gifts volunteer.
In my free time, I am an avid runner and have been running since my teenage years. I also enjoy trying out the weekend recipes in the WSJ, Ravelry knitting, reading with my book club, and travel. Most of the time I also like to hang out with my 15-year-old twins.

In The News
NerdWallet / May 25, 2017
If at First You Miss a Financial Goal, Try, Try Again
Financial health begins with a self-aware, open mindset, reports Courtney Jespersen for NerdWallet. 
“If you ride a horse, you are sometimes going to fall off,” says Norman M. Boone, CFP, the founder and president of Mosaic Financial Partners Inc. in California, in an email. “The key to success is getting back on, resetting your goal and continuing to move forward.”
 
Investor’s Business Daily / April 28, 2017
What Would You Tell Trump About How To Improve Retirement In America? 
Morey Stettner surveyed financial advisors on financial advice for the new president.
In addition to addressing retirement savings, some advisors would tweak the tax system if they were running the country. Norman Boone, a certified financial planner in San Francisco, would make the cost of health insurance deductible for all individuals.“Corporations can deduct it as a business expense, so putting everybody on an equal footing would make sense,” he said. “If this happened, medical care would be more affordable to more people because it would be tax-deductible.”
 
US News & World Report / April 25, 2017
10 Questions Financial Planners Wish You'd Ask
Guess what: financial planners want you to grill them on their credentials. They want you to take an active interest in elements like their experience, specialties, and means of compensation, because it means you will be an engaged, responsive client. Susannah Snider has compiled a top ten list of questions to ask any prospective planner for US News & World Report, and Norm suggests that consumers should start by asking, “How do you get paid?”

“Money is still a taboo topic generally, so people assume it is  ‘rude’ to ask how (and how much) someone is going to be paid,” says Norman Boone, founder and president of Mosaic Financial Partners in San Francisco.
 

US News & World Report / April 25, 2017
Is Your Retirement Account Underfunded?
Reporter Brian O’Connell surveyed financial planning experts on how savers can guage whether they are underfunded in their retirement accounts. This is a critical step in retirement planning, one that confounds many laymen. Norm explained his strategy:

Another way to estimate any retirement cash shortage is to know how much you are going to be spending in retirement. “What you spend now is the best guide available,” says Norman M. Boone, founder and president of Mosaic Financial Partners in San Francisco. “Figure that number out and adjust it by expenses that will go away after retirement (such supporting the kids, Social Security taxes, disability insurance and your retirement contributions). That’s your retirement spending estimate.”
Then get clear about what your other sources of income are likely to be, like Social Security, a pension, an annuity, rent from an apartment building or other sources of income, Boone says. “Identify the total amount and subtract those known income items from the expense total, and the result is the amount you will need to get from your portfolio.”
 

Financial Planning / March 14, 2017
Advisers split on Morningstar's new mutual funds
Morningstar has long been known as an objective fund-rating firm. But that's about to change, as Jane Yi Zhang reports for Financial Planning. Norm weighs in:

Norman Boone, president and founder of San Francisco-based Mosaic Financial Partners, also called the offering a “poor move.”
“One of the reasons why Morningstar has been so successful is because of their independence,” Boone says. “Once they join the fray and become a competitor to those they judge and report on, they've given up their objectivity. I see this as a direct conflict of interest for them.”

 
InsuranceNewsNet / March 6, 2017
Your Clients Love ETFs and You Should, Too
Is this the age of the ETF? According to a recent study undertaken by BlackRock, it might just become so. Norm weighs in on what makes them increasingly attractive to investors and advisors in this article by Brian O'Connell for InsuranceNewsNet:
“The vehicle is not the opportunity, the part of the market that that particular ETF is choosing to focus on may be the opportunity,” said Norman M. Boone, founder and president at Mosaic Financial Partners in San Francisco.
That said, Boone does view ETFs as being “tax efficient” and being “easy to buy and sell.”
“You can also buy them at any time during the day, whereas mutual funds are priced and officially purchased at the end of the day, after the close of the market,” he said. “For those into trading on the ‘good idea of the day’ this makes ETFs attractive trading vehicles.”
 
Financial Planning / October 12, 2016
Should I... hire another planner?
Since founding the firm in 1987, Norm has strategically grown the team of what has become Mosaic Financial Partners to a staff of 18, and has seen his business thrive. He explains his motivation for hiring talent to Ingrid Case for Financial Planning magazine, noting:
“I... have a lot more flexibility, because I have other people I can rely on when a client calls. When I can get away from things, I refresh, and the quality and creativity of my eyes increases.”
 
Financial Advisor IQ / September 16, 2016
The Elevator Pitch, Part 2: Keep It Simple
Norm shared his take on the elevator pitch with writer Thomas Coyle for this two-part article in Financial Advisor IQ.

The head of Mosaic Financial Partners in San Francisco says he and his colleagues “help people navigate their lives and make good decisions about their money. This simple statement most often leads to other questions and a listing of their concerns, which obviously leads to more detailed discussion.”
 

NerdWallet / May 18, 2016
What You Gain - And Lose - With a 15-Year Mortgage
NerdWallet asked Norm Boone and Kyle Morgan for more information about the pros and cons of 15-year loans. 
“It still makes sense to get the lowest interest rate possible,” Norm said. “Whether for 15 or 30 years, why pay it to someone else if you don’t have to?”
Syndicated to the Austin-American Statesman, Journal News, and NewsOK.
 
NerdWallet / April 28, 2016
Prince Had No Will, Reports Say - But You Should
In mourning the creative loss of losing Prince unexpectedly, Norm sees a lesson to pass along about planning for all stages of your life. 
“In the absence of a will, any friends, organizations or causes that Prince cared about will most likely be left only with memories. The same could happen after you’re gone if you don’t prioritize estate planning.”
Syndicated to Nasdaq, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, NewsOK and the Palm Beach Post.

With apprehension in the air, Schwab invites its RIAs to a one-hour meeting about robo-advice
Norm shares some thoughts about drawbacks to robo advisor platforms.

“It’s not yet clear how this kind of offering is going to be able to fit into a service model we might consider,” says Norm Boone, president of Mosaic Financial Partners, Inc., which manages $575 million from San Francisco. “We know we won’t be able to compete on price because there will always be competition from other robo-advisors offering their services at basement prices.”
