Pipeline Highlights


      Merck made significant advances in the development program for KEYTRUDA
      (pembrolizumab), an anti-PD-1 therapy, receiving key regulatory
      approvals and a supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA)
      acceptance.
    


The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved KEYTRUDAunder
        its Accelerated Approval program:

        
            In combination with pemetrexed and carboplatin for the treatment
            of patients with metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer
            (NSCLC) regardless of PD-L1 expression. This is the first
            regulatory approval of KEYTRUDA in combination with another
            treatment. The National Cancer Care Network (NCCN) also
            recommended the combination for the treatment of patients with
            metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC.
          
            For the treatment
            of previously treated patients with advanced microsatellite
            instability-high cancers.
          
            For the treatment
            of certain patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial
            carcinoma, a type of bladder cancer, for first-line use in
            patients who are ineligible for cisplatin-containing therapy.
          

        The FDAapproved
        KEYTRUDA for the treatment of certain patients with locally advanced
        or metastatic urothelial carcinoma in the second-line setting for
        patients who have disease progression during or following
        platinum-containing chemotherapy.
      

        The European Commission approved KEYTRUDA
        for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory
        classical Hodgkin lymphoma who have failed autologous stem cell
        transplant and brentuximab vedotin (BV), or who are
        transplant-ineligible and have failed BV.
      

        The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European
        Medicines Agency (EMA) adopted
        a positive opinion recommending approval of KEYTRUDAfor
        the treatment of certain patients with locally advanced or metastatic
        urothelial carcinoma, with a final decision expected in the third
        quarter of 2017.
      

        The FDAaccepted
        for review the sBLA for KEYTRUDA for the treatment of patients with
        recurrent or advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction
        adenocarcinoma who have already received two or more lines of
        chemotherapy. The FDA granted Priority Review with a PDUFA action date
        of Sept. 22, 2017.
      

        The FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for KEYTRUDA in
        combination with axitnib as a first-line treatment for patients with
        advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
      


      The company previously announced that the pivotal Phase 3 KEYNOTE-040 trial
      investigating KEYTRUDA in previously treated patients with recurrent or
      metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma did not meet its
      primary endpoint of overall survival (HR, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.67-1.01];
      one-sided p = 0.03). The safety profile observed in KEYNOTE-040 was
      consistent with that observed in previously reported studies of KEYTRUDA
      without new safety signals identified. The final data from KEYNOTE-040
      will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting.
    

      At the 77th Scientific Sessions of the American Diabetes
      Association, Merck in partnership with Pfizer presented
      data from two Phase 3 studies of ertugliflozin, an investigational oral
      SGLT-2 inhibitor in development to help improve glycemic control in
      adults with type 2 diabetes, which met their primary endpoints. Three
      New Drug Applications for medicines containing ertugliflozin are
      currently under review with the FDA and EMA.
    

      Phase 3 results from the REVEAL (Randomized EValuation of the Effects of
      Anacetrapib through Lipid modification) outcomes study
      of anacetrapib met its primary endpoint, significantly reducing major
      coronary events (defined as the composite of coronary death, myocardial
      infarction, and coronary revascularization) compared to placebo in
      patients at risk for cardiac events who are already receiving an
      effective LDL-C lowering regimen. The safety profile of anacetrapib in
      the early analysis was generally consistent with that demonstrated in
      previous studies of the drug, including accumulation of anacetrapib in
      adipose tissue, as has been previously reported. Merck plans to review
      the results of the trial with external experts, and will consider
      whether to file new drug applications with the FDA and other regulatory
      agencies.
    

      New data from the company’s HIV portfolio and pipeline were presented at
      the 9th IAS Conference on HIV Science.
    


        Week 96 results
        from the pivotal Phase 3 ONCEMRK study evaluating the efficacy and
        safety of ISENTRESS HD, a 1200 mg once-daily dose of the company’s
        integrase inhibitor, ISENTRESS (raltegravir), met its primary efficacy
        endpoint of non-inferiority to twice-daily ISENTRESS, with a similar
        safety and tolerability profile, reaffirming the comparable efficacy
        and safety of ISENTRESS HD. ISENTRESS HD is now approved in the United
        States and European Union.
      

        48 week data
        from DRIVE-AHEAD, the second of two pivotal Phase 3 studies evaluating
        doravirine (MK-1439), an investigational non-nucleoside reverse
        transcriptase inhibitor, for the treatment of HIV-1 infection showed
        that a once-daily single tablet, fixed-dose combination of doravirine,
        lamivudine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate met its primary endpoint.
        Based on these findings the company plans to file regulatory
        applications in the fourth quarter of 2017.
      

        Results from a Phase 1 study of MK-8591, Merck’s investigational
        nucleoside reverse transcriptase translocation inhibitor in adult
        patients with HIV-1 infection.
      


      Merck entered into an exclusive worldwide license agreement
      with Teijin Pharma for the development, manufacture and
      commercialization of an investigational preclinical antibody candidate
      targeting the protein tau. Changes in tau are
      associated with a number of diseases affecting the nervous system,
      including Alzheimer’s disease.
    

Recent Developments


      Merck entered a global strategic oncology collaboration with AstraZeneca
      to co-develop and co-commercialize AstraZeneca’s Lynparza (olaparib), a
      PARP inhibitor, and investigational medicine selemetinib, a MEK
      inhibitor, as monotherapy and in combination treatments for multiple
      cancer types. Merck and AstraZeneca will independently develop and
      commercialize Lynparza and selumetinib in combinations with the
      companies’ respective PD-1 and PD-L1 immuno-oncology medicines KEYTRUDA
      and Imfinzi (durvalumab). The companies will share development and
      marketing costs equally, as well as gross profits from Lynparza and
      selumetinib.

Pharmaceutical Revenue


      Second-quarter pharmaceutical sales increased 1 percent to $8.8 billion,
      including a 1 percent negative impact from foreign exchange. The growth
      was primarily driven by product launches and vaccines, largely offset by
      the loss of market exclusivity for several products, as well as lower
      sales in the diabetes franchise.
    

      Growth in oncology was due to higher sales of KEYTRUDA as the company
      continues to launch the product with new indications globally. Strong
      momentum from NSCLC, as KEYTRUDA is the only anti-PD-1 approved in the
      first-line setting, contributed significantly to KEYTRUDA’s overall
      growth.
    

      Growth in hepatitis C was driven by ZEPATIER (elbasvir and grazoprevir),
      a medicine for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus genotypes 1 or
      4 infection, due to ongoing launches globally.
    

      Additionally, the ongoing launch of BRIDION (sugammadex) Injection 100
      mg/mL, a medicine for the reversal of neuromuscular blockade induced by
      rocuronium bromide or vecuronium bromide in adults undergoing surgery,
      generated sales of $163 million and also contributed to growth during
      the second quarter of 2017.
    

      Growth in vaccines was primarily driven by higher sales of GARDASIL
      [Human Papillomavirus Quadrivalent (Types 6, 11, 16 and 18) Vaccine,
      Recombinant] and GARDASIL 9 (Human Papillomavirus 9-valent Vaccine,
      Recombinant), vaccines to prevent certain cancers and other diseases
      caused by HPV, reflecting strong demand in Asia Pacific and the timing
      of sales in Brazil. Growth in vaccines also reflects higher sales of
      PNEUMOVAX 23 (pneumococcal vaccine polyvalent), a vaccine to help
      prevent pneumococcal disease, largely driven by volume growth and
      pricing in the United States. Additionally, vaccines sales growth
      reflects incremental sales of approximately $70 million, of which
      approximately $40 million relates to GARDASIL and GARDASIL 9, due to the
      recording of vaccine sales from 19 European countries that were part of
      the Sanofi Pasteur MSD (SPMSD) vaccines joint venture, which was
      terminated on Dec. 31, 2016.
    

      Pharmaceutical sales reflect a decrease in the diabetes franchise of
      JANUVIA and JANUMET (sitagliptin and metformin HCl), medicines that help
      lower blood sugar in adults with type 2 diabetes, primarily due to lower
      sales in the United States, reflecting continued pricing pressure and
      lower customer inventory levels that were partially offset by continued
      volume growth. Pharmaceutical sales growth also was offset by the loss
      of U.S. market exclusivity for ZETIA (ezetimibe) in late 2016 and
      VYTORIN (ezetimibe/simvastatin) in April 2017, medicines for lowering
      LDL cholesterol, and the ongoing impacts of generic competition for
      CUBICIN (daptomycin for injection), an I.V. antibiotic, and biosimilar
      competition for REMICADE (infliximab), a treatment for inflammatory
      diseases, in the company’s marketing territories in Europe. In the
      aggregate, sales of these products declined $830 million during the
      second quarter of 2017 compared to the second quarter of 2016.
    

Animal Health Revenue


Animal Health sales totaled $955 million for the second quarter of 2017,
      an increase of 6 percent compared with the second quarter of 2016,
      including a 1 percent negative impact from foreign exchange. Growth was
      primarily due to sales increases in companion animal products, driven by
      the BRAVECTO (fluralaner) line of products that kill fleas and ticks in
      dogs and cats for up to 12 weeks, and the NOBIVAC Canine Flu Bivalent
      vaccine, as well as sales increases in ruminants products, reflecting

GAAP Expense, EPS and Related Information


      On a GAAP basis, the gross margin was 69.0 percent for the second
      quarter of 2017 compared to 63.7 percent for the second quarter of 2016.
      The increase in gross margin for the second quarter of 2017 was
      primarily driven by lower acquisition- and divestiture-related costs and
      restructuring costs, which reduced gross margin by 8.6 percentage points
      in the second quarter of 2017 compared with 12.0 percentage points in
      the second quarter of 2016. The increase also reflects the favorable
      effects of product mix and lower inventory write-offs.
    

      Marketing and administrative expenses were $2.4 billion in the second
      quarter of 2017, a 1 percent decrease compared to the second quarter of
      2016. The decrease primarily reflects lower restructuring costs
      partially offset by higher administrative costs including costs
      associated with the company now operating its European vaccines business
      in the countries that were part of the SPMSD vaccines joint venture,
      which was terminated on Dec. 31, 2016, and higher promotion expenses
      related to product launches.
    

      Research and development (R&D) expenses were $1.7 billion in the second
      quarter of 2017, a 19 percent decrease compared to the second quarter of
      2016. The decrease primarily reflects lower intangible asset impairment
      charges and licensing costs.
    

      GAAP EPS was $0.71 for the second quarter of 2017 compared with $0.43
      for the second quarter of 2016.
    

Non-GAAP Expense, EPS and Related Information


      The non-GAAP gross margin was 77.6 percent for the second quarter of
      2017 compared to 75.7 percent for the second quarter of 2016. The
      increase in non-GAAP gross margin was largely driven by the favorable
      effects of product mix and lower inventory write-offs.
    

      Non-GAAP marketing and administrative expenses were $2.4 billion in the
      second quarter of 2017, an increase of 3 percent compared to the second
      quarter of 2016. The increase was driven primarily by higher
      administrative costs, including costs associated with the company now
      operating its European vaccines business in the countries that were
      previously part of the SPMSD vaccines joint venture, and higher
      promotion expenses related to product launches.
    

      Non-GAAP R&D expenses were $1.7 billion in the second quarter of 2017,
      an 8 percent decrease compared to the second quarter of 2016. The
      decrease primarily reflects lower licensing costs.
    

      Non-GAAP EPS was $1.01 for the second quarter of 2017 compared with
      $0.93 for the second quarter of 2016.

Financial Outlook


      On June 27, 2017, the company experienced a network cyber-attack that
      led to a disruption of its worldwide operations, including
      manufacturing, research and sales operations. While the company does not
      yet know the magnitude of the impact of the disruption, which remains
      ongoing in certain operations, it continues to work to minimize the
      effects.
    

      The company is in the process of restoring its manufacturing operations.
      To date, Merck has largely restored its packaging operations and has
      partially restored its formulation operations. The company is in the
      process of restoring its Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient operations but
      is not yet producing bulk product. The company’s external manufacturing
      was not impacted. Throughout this time, Merck has continued to fulfill
      orders and ship product.
    

      The company is confident in the continuous supply of key products such
      as KEYTRUDA, JANUVIA and ZEPATIER. In addition, Merck does not currently
      expect a significant impact to sales of its other top products; however,
      the company anticipates that it will have temporary delays in fulfilling
      orders for certain other products in certain markets.
    

      The financial outlook below reflects the current state of the company’s
      manufacturing operations as well as its plans to restore those
      operations and potential costs associated with the remediation efforts.
    

      Merck has reduced its full-year 2017 GAAP EPS range to be between $1.60
      and $1.72. The change in the GAAP EPS range reflects the inclusion of
      licensing expenses related to the collaboration with AstraZeneca. Merck
      has maintained its full-year 2017 non-GAAP EPS range to be between $3.76
      and $3.88, including an approximately 1 percent negative impact from
      foreign exchange at mid-July 2017 exchange rates. The non-GAAP range
      excludes acquisition- and divestiture-related costs, costs related to
      restructuring programs and certain other items, including licensing
      expenses related to the collaboration with AstraZeneca as shown in the
      table below.
    

      Merck has narrowed and raised its full-year 2017 revenue range to be
      between $39.4 billion and $40.4 billion, including an approximately 1
      percent negative impact from foreign exchange at mid-July 2017 exchange
      rates.
    

      The following table summarizes the company’s 2017 financial guidance.

1Net income attributable to Merck & Co., Inc.

2 Merck is providing certain 2017 and 2016 non-GAAP
      information that excludes certain items because of the nature of these
      items and the impact they have on the analysis of underlying business
      performance and trends. Management believes that providing this
      information enhances investors’ understanding of the company’s results
      as it permits investors to understand how management assesses
      performance. Management uses these measures internally for planning and
      forecasting purposes and to measure the performance of the company along
      with other metrics. Senior management’s annual compensation is derived
      in part using non-GAAP income and non-GAAP EPS. This information should
      be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior
      to, information prepared in accordance with GAAP. For a description of
      the items, see Table 2a attached to this release.
    

3 Includes expenses for the amortization of intangible assets
      and purchase accounting adjustments to inventories recognized as a
      result of acquisitions, intangible asset impairment charges and expense
      or income related to changes in the estimated fair value measurement of
      contingent consideration. Also includes integration, transaction and
      certain other costs related to business acquisitions and divestitures.
    

4 Represents the difference between calculated GAAP EPS and
      calculated non-GAAP EPS, which may be different than the amount
      calculated by dividing the impact of the excluded items by the
      weighted-average shares for the period.
    

5 Includes the estimated tax impact on the reconciling items
      based on applying the statutory rate of the originating territory of the
      non-GAAP adjustments, as well as a benefit of $88 million related to the
      settlement of a state income tax issue.

      Only the line items that are affected by non-GAAP adjustments are shown.
    

      Merck is providing certain non-GAAP information that excludes certain
      items because of the nature of these items and the impact they have on
      the analysis of underlying business performance and trends. Management
      believes that providing this information enhances investors’
      understanding of the company’s results as it permits investors to
      understand how management assesses performance. Management uses these
      measures internally for planning and forecasting purposes and to measure
      the performance of the company along with other metrics. Senior
      management’s annual compensation is derived in part using non-GAAP
      income and non-GAAP EPS. This information should be considered in
      addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, information
      prepared in accordance with GAAP.
    

      (1) Amounts included in materials and production costs primarily reflect
      $779 million of expenses for the amortization of intangible assets
      recognized as a result of acquisitions, as well as intangible asset
      impairment charges of $47 million. Amounts included in marketing and
      administrative expenses reflect integration, transaction and certain
      other costs related to business acquisitions and divestitures. Amounts
      included in research and development expenses reflect changes in the
      estimated fair value measurement of liabilities for contingent
      consideration. Amounts included in other (income) expense, net primarily
      reflect changes in the estimated fair value measurement of liabilities
      for contingent consideration related to the termination of the
      Sanofi-Pasteur MSD joint venture.
    

      (2) Amounts primarily include employee separation costs and accelerated
      depreciation associated with facilities to be closed or divested related
      to activities under the company's formal restructuring programs.
    

      (3) Represents the estimated tax impact on the reconciling items based
      on applying the statutory rate of the originating territory of the
      non-GAAP adjustments.
    

      (4) Represents a benefit related to the settlement of a state income tax
      issue.

Frame Size Information
If you look on the inside of the arm of your glasses you find will something that looks like: 52 [] 16 135.
This is information on the size of your glasses: the lens diameter, the bridge width and the arm length, all measured in millimetres.



The Eye Width, or Lens Diameter, is the width of the lens (in mm), measured from the bridge. (In this example, the Eye Width is 52.)
The Bridge Width is the gap above your nose between the lenses. It should be comfortable. Too tight, and the glasses could pinch your nose; too loose and the glasses will not be stable on your face. (In this example, the Bridge Width is 16.)
The Temple Length, or Arm Length, is usually one of three standards ďż˝ 135, 140 or 145mm. The arm should be long enough to sit comfortably over your ears. Glasses with straight arms do not always have this measurement indicated. (In this example, the Temple Length is 135.)

For the day of 07/28/2017 














Robert  Bancroft (Cleveland, Ohio)






 "I received the eyeglasses about 2 weeks after I ordered them, which is pretty reasonable.  I usually get them in the same amount of time from the eye Dr.  The frames look good and of course were a great price!  They also came with quite a nice eyeglass box and certificate of authenticity.  A+" 













Donald Davidson (Kansas)






 "I made an order for eyeglasses on Monday night.  They were in my post office box on Friday!  The lenses are perfect, and as far as I can tell, having done some research online, these Prada frames are authentic!  THANKS EZ Contacts!" 













Matthew Priebe (Minnesota)






 "The customer service is amazing. There was a delay in my sunglasses due to the manufacture and customer service out my order on high priority and gave me the fastest shipping with no charge to me. They also reimbursed 10% because of the waiting. Great company and I love my sunglasses. I have become a reoccurring customer. Thank you do much. "

35 Ft. Tape Measure

Measure materials and surfaces quickly and easily with the Milwaukee® 35-Foot Tape Measure. The integrated blueprint scale works with 1/4-inch and 1/8-inch drawings, letting you calculate the materials you need for projects. For durability and a longer tool life, the Milwaukee 35-foot tape measure has nylon bond blade protection and a five-point reinforced frame. Printing on the bottom and top of the tape lets you see measurements from above and below. A 360-degree hook attachment allows the tape to grip materials at any angle for precise measurements in tight spaces or on existing construction. With a standout of up to 9 feet, use the Milwaukee heavy-duty tape measure easily by yourself. A finger stop mechanism prevents accidental injuries to your fingers as the blade retracts.

Very good 35' tape
Bought to replace a few worn out tapes and works great and nice to have the extra 10' compared to a standard 25' tape

The best tape on the market. Period!
I have had just about every tape on the market. My old Stanley Fat Max with blade armor was my favorite for years until I got this Milwaukee for my birthday from a friend of mine. This is simply the best tape I have ever owned and used. Thanks Milwaukee for creating yet another outstanding product!

Excellent
I've only had the tape a couple of weeks, and found it to be an extremely well built tape. Its tape operations are very smooth. I extended the tape vertically 212 inches to measure the height of a ceiling in a mechanical room. The tape did not double over, not once. I found the blueprint scale very useful. Another terrific Milwaukee product.

 35 ft. Steel SAE Tape Measure, Black/Red is rated    3.7 out of    5 by    3.               Rated 5 out of            5  by        Anonymous from        The best tape on the market. Period! I have had just about every tape on the market. My old Stanley Fat Max with blade armor was my favorite for years until I got this Milwaukee for my birthday from a friend of mine. This is simply the best tape I have ever owned and used. Thanks Milwaukee for creating yet another outstanding product! Date published: 2015-11-21                 Rated 1 out of            5  by        Anonymous from        Refills are not available. Refills are not available. Date published: 2015-05-21                 Rated 5 out of            5  by        Anonymous from        Excellent I've only had the tape a couple of weeks, and found it to be an extremely well built tape. Its tape operations are very smooth. I extended the tape vertically 212 inches to measure the height of a ceiling in a mechanical room. The tape did not double over, not once. I found the blueprint scale very useful. Another terrific Milwaukee product.
