LOS ANGELES, CA, March 27, 2017 /PRNewswire/ - Red Mountain Capital Partners LLC ("Red Mountain"), an investment management firm owning approximately 3.3% of the outstanding shares of Deckers Outdoor Corporation ("Deckers") (NYSE:  DECK), today sent a letter to Deckers' Chairman of the Board, Angel Martinez, and Lead Independent Director, John Gibbons.

							 		Red Mountain sends letter to board of Deckers Outdoor Corporation (CNW Group/Red Mountain Capital Partners LLC)
							  



 

 
 



In its letter, Red Mountain references meetings and communications that they have had with the management and board of Deckers over the past two years with respect to Red Mountain's proposals to rationalize the Company's retail store network, streamline its brand portfolio, right-size its cost structure, optimize its balance sheet, and align its executive compensation with shareholder value creation.  Red Mountain is now calling upon the board to explore a sale of the Company because they believe that the value of a sale to a strategic or financial buyer is substantially higher than the risk-adjusted value of the standalone operating plan announced by management on February 2, 2017.  Red Mountain believes that a publicly announced sale process would address the full universe of potential buyers for the Company and restore shareholders' confidence that the board is acting in their best interests.
The full text of the letter can be found at:

About Red Mountain Capital Partners LLC
Red Mountain was established in January 2005 by Willem Mesdag, a former partner at Goldman, Sachs & Co., to invest primarily in undervalued small cap companies and to enhance and realize shareholder value through active ownership. Red Mountain's approach to such investments is to actively engage with management teams and boards of directors in a constructive manner to unlock value for the benefit of all shareholders. Red Mountain partners have extensive experience and a successful track record of enhancing value at portfolio companies through a combination of refocusing strategy, improving operational execution, more efficiently allocating capital and upgrading corporate governance, and currently serve on the boards of five public companies in which Red Mountain's managed funds have substantial ownership stakes.

Dec 1 15
In a letter to Colin Angle, the Chairman and Chief Executive Office of iRobot Corporation (NasdaqGS:IRBT), Red Mountain Capital Partners LLC suggested iRobot to explore strategic alternatives for the defense and security business, discontinue the remote presence business, focus on the high- growth Home Robots business and the consumer end-market, allocate capital with discipline and an intense focus on risk-adjusted returns and address significant lapses in corporate governance. In addition, Red Mountain said that the Board should consider all other paths to maximize shareholder value, including a sale of iRobot as an alternative to the implementation of the proposed value enhancement plan.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

                          Stock prices used are the "total returns" stock price and will include
                          dividends, spinoffs, splits, and other adjustments.  Because of this, stock
