Plante Moran Financial Advisors Adopt RiXtrema's IRAFiduciaryOptimizer Tool

							Financial Advisors Gearing Up to Address DOL Rule Compliance
						


Press Release

									updated: Jun 28, 2017							

 





			New York, NY, 
			June 28, 2017			(Newswire.com) -
	RiXtrema, the leading provider of risk management tools and analysis to the financial advisory and broker/dealer community to help ensure that investors get the analysis and advice they need, announced that Plante Moran Financial Advisors, LLC, one of the nation’s top independent registered investment advisors*, has adopted the use of the IRAFiduciaryOptimizer tool as a resource to help its team comply with the DOL Impartial Conduct Standard.
While Plante Moran Financial Advisors has always provided advice that puts the client’s interests first, like many in the industry gearing up for the new fiduciary era, they recognize the value of the IRAFiduciaryOptimizer suite of software solutions and have begun using the suite to provide additional comparison reporting and analytics to ensure compliance.
“For some time, we have seen the critical need for a tool advisors could use to help them comply with the DOL Rule that recently took effect on June 9,” said RiXtrema President Daniel Satchkov, CFA. “We prepared for this while many in the industry took a ‘watch and wait’ attitude, expressing doubt the rule would actually be enacted and hope that it would not. But hope is not a strategy and many advisors realized this and reached out to us for access to the IRAFiduciaryOptimizer suite.”

"In the past few weeks, advisors have been signing up for the IRAFiduciaryOptimizer suite at a remarkable rate — 68 new user firms since June 1. Clearly, there was a lot of confusion holding advisors back, but many now understand that their effective ERISA fiduciary status must be taken very seriously. We congratulate the firms that are proactively embracing the new fiduciary standard."

The software suite quantitatively compares existing retirement portfolios to proposed new, compliant portfolios and services proposed by the independent financial advisor or broker/dealer. The comparison highlights a variety of measures such as fees, track record of the investments, risk vs. risk tolerance, and best fiduciary practices. These might include investing in the best share class, as well as additional services provided by the advisor to the client. The IRAFiduciaryOptimizer produces a report summarizing why a rollover is in the best interest of the client based on the abovementioned measures. Reports can be generated by individual advisors, or by a home office compliance team using an administrator portal to manage outcomes for all advisors/representatives with the firm.

Business continuity




Plante Moran Financial Advisors, (“the firm”) has developed a business continuity plan (“the plan” or “our plan”) on how we will respond to events that significantly disrupt our business. Since the timing and impact of disasters and disruptions is unpredictable, we will have to be flexible in responding to actual events as they occur. With that in mind, we are providing you with this information on our plan.
Contacting us — If after a significant business disruption you cannot contact us as you usually do at our main number in Southfield, Michigan, (248.352.2500) you should call our alternative number (269-567-4500), or go to our web site wealth.plantemoran.com for additional contact information.
Our business continuity plan — We plan to quickly recover and resume business operations after a significant business disruption and respond by safeguarding our employees and property, making a financial and operational assessment, protecting the firm’s books and records, and allowing our personnel to continue to service client engagements from alternate locations, if necessary. Additionally, the plan addresses: data backup and recovery; all mission-critical systems; alternative communications with clients, employees, and regulators; critical supplier, contractor, and bank impact; regulatory reporting; and assuring our clients of ongoing service with regard to their Plante Moran Financial Advisor services or engagements. In short, our business continuity plan is designed to permit our firm to resume operations as quickly as possible, given the scope and severity of the significant business disruption.
Varying disruptions — Significant business disruptions can vary in their scope, such as only our firm, a single building housing our firm, the business district where our firm is located, the city where we are located, or the whole region. Within each of these areas, the severity of the disruption can also vary from minimal to severe. In a disruption to only our firm or a building housing our firm, we will transfer our operations to a local site when needed and expect to recover and resume business within 48 hours. In a disruption affecting our business district, city, or region, our response relies more heavily on other organizations and systems. We will transfer our operations to a site outside of the affected area in an effort to recover and resume business; however, this recovery objective may be negatively affected by the unavailability of external resources and circumstances beyond our control. In either situation, we plan to continue in business as quickly as possible and notify you through this web site or via alternative communication.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
