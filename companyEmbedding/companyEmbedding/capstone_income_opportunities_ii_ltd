How did we calculate this?
 To calculate how many years it might take to spend your guessed amount 
              in retirement, we used your age, years until retirement, and inflation rate 
              of 3%, and average spending data from the 2012 Expenditure Survey. 

Got it >



Based on national spending averages,
$1,500,000 will likely be spent by the age of 76.
How did we calculate this?
 Come up a little short? Guessing how much money you might
            need 
            to save for retirement that could last 30 or 40 years
            is pretty hard. 
            A good place to start: Think about how
            many years you may live in 
            retirement and how much income
            you'll need each year.

There are two steps you can take to help
            make sure your money lasts.

How did we calculate this?
 To calculate how many years it might take to spend your guessed amount 
              in retirement, we used your age, years until retirement, and inflation rate

$1,500,000 will likely be spent by the age of 76.
How did we calculate this?
 Come up a little short? Guessing how much money you might
            need 
            to save for retirement that could last 30 or 40 years
            is pretty hard. 
            A good place to start: Think about how

Big Tobacco Coughs Up a Lung: A $206 Billion Payout Opportunity - Money Morning























 
































HOME


























Big Tobacco Coughs Up a Lung: A $206 Billion Payout Opportunity 

In a landmark settlement, the Big Four Tobacco companies were sued for using false advertising and research.
It’s no secret. Big Tobacco destroyed countless lives.
But you know what is a secret? An underreported clause in the fine print. That few people know about.
Because of this clause, you could use a backdoor strategy to claim 100% tax-free income thanks to the big boys in tobacco. Even if you’ve never smoked.
And there is no limit to how many payments investors can claim. 
Or how big the checks can grow.
I estimate Big Tobacco has been paying out about $686 million a month to the states—but the window of opportunity is closing quickly.
Read my briefing on the next page to see the 156 lucrative deals you can choose from.
