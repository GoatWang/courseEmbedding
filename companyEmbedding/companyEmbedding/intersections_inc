Intersections, Inc.'s product Identity Guard is advertising at the Huffington Post whose religious propaganda is offensive to Christians and Jews.





				 

The email for this article was deactivated after Intersections, Inc. stopped advertising.




The Huffington Post published an article on Apri1 26, 2016 titled Did Jesus Predict Muhammad? A Biblical Portal Between Christianity and Islam.  The article states in part:

The time has come for Christians and Muslims to make peace between our communities. 

Our planet simply cannot afford another century of misunderstanding and violence between these two communities.

In an earlier blog on the Huffington Post about the problem of Christian Islamophobia, I argue that Christians have the opportunity to transform the way we see Islam and Muslims by accepting Muhammad as “Spirit of Truth.” 

Historically, most Christian theologians—including John of Damascus, Thomas Aquinas, Dante, Nicholas of Cusa, and Martin Luther—have seen Muhammad not as a “Spirit of Truth” but as a “Spirit of Error,” a false prophet or heretic. There are many Christians today who respect the Islamic tradition and would never make such an offensive statement about Muhammad. 

However, the majority of Christians still maintain a fundamentally Islamophobic position on Muhammad. So I believe that the time has come for peacemaking Christians to contradict this position directly. Changing our view of Muhammad—so that we recognize him as a true prophet rather than discredit him as a false prophet—would effectively inoculate Christians against Islamophobia and would help to establish a new paradigm of cooperative Christian-Muslim relations. 
….

There is no better candidate than Muhammad, no one in fact that comes even close, in terms of fulfilling Jesus’s promise of the Spirit of Truth who would bring forth a new revelation from God. I do not have space in this article to explore the many Qur’anic verses directly addressed to Christians, but if we were to receive them our religion would be transformed for the better and would come into balance with Judaism and Islam.

The Huffington Post article:

	•    Erroneously blames alleged Christian Islamophobia for the worldwide conflict between Muslims and infidels.

	•    Dangerously perverts the Holy Scriptures of the Bible to falsely elevate Muhammad to a Judaic Christian status.

	•    Tragically ignores the millions of Muslims around the world who support the killing of hundreds of thousands of Christians.  The Religionofpeace.com provides a detailed report of Muslims killing Christians.  While Muslims are killing hundreds of thousands of Christians around the world the Huffington Post article has the audacity to write “Our planet simply cannot afford another century of misunderstanding and violence between these two communities.”

	WHAT violence do Christians appear to be committing against Muslims suggested by the Huffington Post article?  That would be Islamophobia which is the term that is used to harshly label and intimidate people out of their rational, fact based concern that Islamists use violence and Sharia law to advance their political agenda.

TheReligionofPeace.com reported on May 18, 2016:

	Yet, the Huffington Post article has the audacity to blame Islamophobic Christians for the worldwide conflict between Muslims and Infidels.

Jihadwatch.org reports the following regarding this issue:

Jesus is not the Son of God, belief in the Trinity is “excess”: “O People of the Scripture, do not commit excess in your religion or say about Allah except the truth. The Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary, was but a messenger of Allah and His word which He directed to Mary and a soul from Him. So believe in Allah and His messengers. And do not say, ‘Three’; desist — it is better for you. Indeed, Allah is but one God. Exalted is He above having a son. To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. And sufficient is Allah as Disposer of affairs.” — Qur’an 4:171“It is not befitting to (the majesty of) Allah that He should beget a son. Glory be to Him! when He determines a matter, He only says to it, ‘Be,’ and it is.” — Qur’an 19:35

Jesus was not crucified: “And because of their saying: We slew the Messiah, Jesus son of Mary, Allah’s messenger — they slew him not nor crucified him, but it appeared so unto them; and lo! those who disagree concerning it are in doubt thereof; they have no knowledge thereof save pursuit of a conjecture; they slew him not for certain.” — Qur’an 4:157

Those who believe in the divinity of Christ are “disbelievers”: “They have certainly disbelieved who say that Allah is Christ, the son of Mary.” — Qur’an 5:17

Christians “forgot a good part” of the divine revelations they received: “From those, too, who call themselves Christians, We did take a covenant, but they forgot a good part of the message that was sent them: so we estranged them, with enmity and hatred between the one and the other, to the day of judgment. And soon will Allah show them what it is they have done.” — Qur’an 5:14

Muslims should not take Jews or Christians as friends: “O you who believe! do not take the Jews and the Christians for friends; they are friends of each other; and whoever amongst you takes them for a friend, then surely he is one of them; surely Allah does not guide the unjust people.” — Qur’an 5:51

Those who believe that Jesus is God’s Son are accursed: “The Jews call Ezra a son of Allah, and the Christians call Christ the son of Allah. That is a saying from their mouth; they but imitate what the unbelievers of old used to say. Allah’s curse be on them: how they are deluded away from the Truth! ” — Qur’an 9:30

Christians who do not become Muslims “are the most vile of created beings”: “Nor did those who were given the Scripture become divided until after there had come to them clear evidence. And they were not commanded except to worship Allah, sincere to Him in religion, inclining to truth, and to establish prayer and to give zakah. And that is the correct religion. Indeed, they who disbelieved among the People of the Scripture and the polytheists will be in the fire of Hell, abiding eternally therein. Those are the most vile of created beings.” — Qur’an 98:6

Jesus’ mission was to proclaim the coming of Muhammad: “And when Jesus, the son of Mary, said, ‘O children of Israel, indeed I am the messenger of Allah to you confirming what came before me of the Torah and bringing good tidings of a messenger to come after me, whose name is Ahmad.’ But when he came to them with clear evidences, they said, ‘This is obvious magic.’” — Qur’an 61:6

Muslims must fight against and subjugate Christians: “Fight those who believe not in Allah nor the Last Day, nor hold that forbidden which hath been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger, nor acknowledge the religion of Truth, even if they are of the People of the Book, until they pay the Jizya with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued.” — Qur’an 9:29

	Christianity is incompatible with Islam.  The Huffington Post article perverts bible scriptures and hides what the Qur’an states about Christians and Jews.

                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

May 11, 2017 04:30 PM Eastern Daylight Time



CHANTILLY, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Intersections Inc. (NASDAQ: INTX) today announced financial results for 
      the quarter ended March 31, 2017.
    


      “We have made very good progress on a number of fronts during this 
      quarter. We managed to significantly advance the exit of all businesses 
      which are not aligned to our core business of providing identity and 
      privacy protection products and services to discerning consumers in the 
      U.S. and Canada,” said Johan Roets, Chief Executive Officer. “We also 
      refinanced our term loan with PEAK6 Investments, L.P., on more favorable 
      terms than our prior term loan. Additionally, PEAK6 purchased a warrant 
      to purchase 1,500,000 shares of our common stock, immediately 
      exercisable at $5 per share, over 5 years. We have had important wins in 
      our partner sales strategy (business-to-business-to-consumer) and have 
      contracted with a very substantial U.S.-based global company to 
      distribute our products and services to their subscriber base, starting 
      in the third quarter of 2017.
    

      “Additionally,” continued Mr. Roets, “we are in final contract 
      negotiations with two important distribution partners in Canada, with 
      whom we expect to launch marketing to their consumer bases as early as 
      the beginning of the third quarter of 2017. We have a healthy business 
      development pipeline with a substantial number of partner and other 
      distribution prospects. Our new Identity Guard® with Watson™ 
      product is expected to be launched at the end of the summer and will be 
      the first identity theft monitoring product that uses artificial 
      intelligence and machine learning to help our subscribers and their 
      families comprehensively protect themselves against the misuse of their 
      personal information. Our partnership with IBM is growing and they are 
      very excited about our application of their IBM Watson technology to 
      fight identity theft. We aim to have our revenue from new subscribers 
      exceed that of our run-off base by the end of 2017 – another key 
      milestone for us to demonstrate our renewed success.”
    

      Consolidated revenue for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 was $40.4 
      million, compared to $45.6 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2016. 
      Loss before income taxes for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 was $(4.8) 
      million, compared to $(4.3) million for the quarter ended March 31, 
      2016. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA (loss) before share related 
      compensation and non-cash impairment charges (“Adjusted EBITDA”) for the 
      quarter ended March 31, 2017 was $(1.6) million, compared to $(1.0) 
      million for the quarter ended March 31, 2016. Diluted loss per share for 
      the quarter ended March 31, 2017 was $(0.20), compared to $(0.19) for 
      the quarter ended March 31, 2016.
    

      The Company’s strategic focus is on identity and privacy protection 
      services for consumers. In December, the Company began a process to 
      monetize the intellectual property of its Pet Health Monitoring business 
      (“Voyce”) through a strategic partnership or other transaction rather 
      than pursuing revenue through commercial operations. Effective January 
      31, 2017, the Company sold its Bail Bonds Industry Solutions business 
      (“Captira”) and on March 31, 2017, the Company signed a definitive 
      agreement to sell its Habits at Work insurance consulting business 
      (“Habits at Work”). Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter ended 
      March 31, 2017 included approximately $1.4 million of costs consisting 
      primarily of severance associated with the sale of Habits at Work 
      business and headcount adjustments in the Core Business, and the $598 
      thousand loss before income taxes ($669 thousand Adjusted EBITDA loss) 
      associated with the wind-down of the Voyce business.
    

      As of March 31, 2017, the Company had a cash balance of $5.2 million, 
      and an outstanding principal balance of $13.4 million under its term 
      loan with Crystal Financial SPV LLC (“Prior Credit Agreement”). As 
      previously announced, on April 20, 2017, the Company refinanced its 
      senior secured indebtedness under the Prior Credit Agreement with a new 
      $20 million term loan facility (which was fully funded at closing) with 
      PEAK6 Investments, L.P. (“New Credit Agreement”). The New Credit 
      Agreement provided the Company with approximately $6.1 million of net 
      cash proceeds to use to accelerate both subscriber acquisition and 
      product development, and also extends the maturity date, reduces and 
      defers mandatory quarterly principal payments, and carries a lower 
      interest rate compared to the Prior Credit Agreement. In connection with 
      the new credit agreement, PEAK6 purchased, for $1.5 million in cash, a 
      warrant to purchase 1.5 million shares of the Company’s common stock at 
      an exercise price of $5.00 per share. The warrant is immediately 
      exercisable and has a five-year term. The Company used the proceeds from 
      the sale of the warrant to repurchase 419,498 shares of the Company’s 
      common stock from PEAK6 Capital Management, LLC, at a price of $3.60 per 
      share. The repurchase was made pursuant to the Company’s previously 
      announced share repurchase program; however, the Company is prohibited 
      from repurchasing additional shares of common stock under the new credit 
      agreement. For additional information, Please see “Item 7. Management’s 
      Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of 
      Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources” in our most recent Form 10-Q.
    

First Quarter Results:
    


        Revenue from the Company’s Identity Guard® subscriber base 
        was $13.3 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, compared to 
        $14.1 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2016. The Identity Guard® 
        subscriber base was 367 thousand subscribers as of March 31, 2017, 
        compared to 398 thousand subscribers as of March 31, 2016. These 
        decreases were primarily the result of decreases in subscribers 
        acquired through a former partner that is no longer marketing the 
        Company’s products and to a lesser extent, the trailing impact of 
        lower marketing spending and related subscriber acquisitions in 2016 
        compared to the prior year.
      

        Revenue from the Company’s U.S. financial institution clients was 
        $21.9 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 with a base of 682 
        thousand subscribers as of March 31, 2017. The subscriber base 
        decreased by 1.1% per month during the first quarter, which the 
        Company believes is representative of normal attrition given the 
        discontinuation of marketing and retention efforts for this population.
      

        Core Business (the aggregate of all businesses of Intersections Inc. 
        except for Voyce) income (loss) before income taxes for the quarter 
        ended March 31, 2017 was $(4.2) million, compared to $870 thousand for 
        the quarter ended March 31, 2016.
      

        Core Business Adjusted EBITDA (loss) for the quarter ended March 31, 
        2017 was $(932) thousand, compared to $3.7 million for the quarter 
        ended March 31, 2016. Core Business Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter 
        ended March 31, 2017 was negatively impacted compared to the prior 
        year by $1.8 million related to lower revenue, $1.4 million related to 
        severance charges and other costs associated with the agreement to 
        sell Habits at Work, and approximately $1.4 million related to new 
        product development and new business development costs.
      

        Voyce loss before income taxes for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 
        was $(598) thousand, compared to $(5.1) million for the quarter ended 
        March 31, 2016. Voyce Adjusted EBITDA (loss) for the quarter ended 
        March 31, 2017 was $(669) thousand, compared to $(4.7) million for the 
        quarter ended March 31, 2016. The Voyce results include the costs 
        associated with winding down its primary business operations in the 
        first quarter and continuing efforts to monetize its remaining assets.

      forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and 
      uncertainties and are subject to change based on various factors and 
      uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from

      our strategic objectives, our ability to generate revenue from our 
      partner sales strategy and business development pipeline with our 
      distribution partners; the impact of shutting down our Pet Health 
      Monitoring segment; the timing and success of new product launches and 
      other growth initiatives, including our new Identity Guard® with Watson™ 
      product; the continuing impact of the regulatory environment on our 
      business; the continued dependence on a small number of financial 
      institutions for a majority of our revenue and to service our U.S. 
      financial institution customer base; our ability to execute our strategy 
      and previously announced transformation plan; our incurring additional 
      restructuring charges; our incurring additional impairment costs or 
      charges on goodwill and/or assets; our ability to control costs; our 
      ability to maintain sufficient liquidity and produce sufficient cash 
      flow to fund our business, growth strategy and debt service obligations; 
      and our needs for additional capital to grow our business, including our 
      ability to maintain compliance with the covenants under our term loan or 
      seek additional sources of debt and/or equity financing. Factors and 
      uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ include but are 
      not limited to the risks disclosed under “Forward-Looking Statements,” 
      “Item 1. Business—Government Regulation” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in 
      the Company’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly

          We periodically refine the criteria used to calculate and report our 
          subscriber data. In the year ended December 31, 2016, we 
          reclassified certain subscribers that receive our breach response 
          services, and the associated revenue, from the Financial Institution 
          category to the Identity Guard® category.
        







           
        



INTERSECTIONS INC.OTHER DATA, continued(unaudited)


      Intersections Inc.Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
    

      The table below includes financial information prepared in accordance 
      with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, 
      (“GAAP”), as well as other financial measures referred to as non-GAAP 
      financial measures. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA before share related 
      compensation and non-cash impairment charges (“Adjusted EBITDA”) is 
      presented in a manner consistent with the way management evaluates 
      operating results and which management believes is useful to investors 
      and others. Share related compensation includes non-cash share based 
      compensation. An explanation regarding the Company’s use of non-GAAP 
      financial measures and a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures 
      used by the Company to GAAP measures is provided below. These non-GAAP 
      financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a 
      substitute for, net income (loss) and the other information prepared in 
      accordance with GAAP, and may not be comparable to similarly titled 
      measures reported by other companies. Management strongly encourages 
      shareholders to review our financial statements and publicly-filed 
      reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial 
      measure.
    

      Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA represents consolidated loss before income 
      taxes plus: share related compensation; non-cash impairment of goodwill, 
      intangibles and other assets; (gain) loss on disposal of fixed assets; 
      adjustment for surplus and obsolete inventories; depreciation and 
      amortization; and interest (income) expense. We believe that the 
      consolidated Adjusted EBITDA calculation provides useful information to 
      investors because they are indicators of our operating performance, and 
      we use these measures in communications with our board of directors, 
      creditors, investors and others concerning our financial performance. 
      Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is commonly used as a basis for investors 
      and analysts to evaluate and compare the periodic and future operating 
      performance and value of companies within our industry. Our Board of 
      Directors and management use consolidated Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate 
      the operating performance of the Company. In addition, consolidated 
      Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in our Prior Credit Agreement with Crystal 
      financial LLC and our New Credit Agreement with PEAK6 Investments, L.P., 
      is used to measure covenant compliance.
    

      We provide this information to show the impact of share related 
      compensation on our operating results, as it is excluded from our 
      internal operating and budgeting plans and measurements of financial 
      performance; however, we do consider the dilutive impact to our 
      shareholders when awarding share related compensation and consider both 
      the Black-Scholes value and GAAP value (to the extent applicable) in 
      connection therewith, and value such awards accordingly.
    

INTERSECTIONS INC.OTHER DATA, continued(unaudited)


      We do not consider share related compensation charges when we evaluate 
      the performance of our individual business groups or formulate our short 
      and long-term operating plans. Due to its nature, individual managers 
      generally are unable to project the impact of share related compensation 
      and accordingly we do not hold them accountable for the impact of equity 
      award grants. When we consider making share related compensation grants, 
      we primarily take into account the need to attract and retain high 
      quality employees, overall shareholder dilution and the Black-Scholes 
      values of the equity grant to the recipient, rather than the potential 
      accounting charges associated with such grants. For comparability 
      purposes, we believe it is useful to provide a non-GAAP financial 
      measure that excludes share related compensation in order to better 
      understand the long-term performance of our core business and to compare 
      our results to the results of our peer companies because of varying 
      available valuation methodologies and the variety of award types that 
      companies can use under GAAP. Furthermore, the value of share related 
      compensation is determined using a complex formula that incorporates 
      factors, such as market volatility, that are beyond our control. 
      Accordingly, we believe that the presentation of consolidated Adjusted 
      EBITDA when read in conjunction with our reported GAAP results can 
      provide useful supplemental information to our management, to investors 
      and to our lenders regarding financial and business trends relating to 
      our financial condition and results of operations.
    

      Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA has limitations due to the fact it does not 
      include all compensation related expenses. For example, if we only paid 
      cash based compensation as opposed to a portion in share related 
      compensation, the cash compensation expense included in our general and 
      administrative expenses would be higher. We compensate for this 
      limitation by providing information required by GAAP about outstanding 
      share based awards in the footnotes to our financial statements in our 
      SEC filings. We believe equity based compensation is an important 
      element of our compensation program and all forms of share related 
      awards are valued and included as appropriate in our operating results.
    

      The following table reconciles Core Business, Voyce and consolidated 
      income (loss) before income taxes to consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, as 
      defined, for the previous five quarters through March 31, 2017. In 
      managing our business, we analyze our performance quarterly on a 
      consolidated income (loss) before income tax basis.
    

      In the second quarter of 2016, we ceased adding other expense (income) 
      to consolidated loss before income taxes as part of our calculation of 
      Adjusted EBITDA, to be consistent with the definition of Adjusted EBITDA 
      in our Prior Credit Agreement. Prior periods have been recast to reflect 
      the new presentation. For additional information, Please see “Item 7. 
      Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results 
      of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources” in our most recent Form 
      10-Q.
