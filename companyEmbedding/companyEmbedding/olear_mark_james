 What Is a Markup on a Product? | Chron.com              Skip to main content.  What Is a Markup on a Product?  by M. Scilly        A product markup can be represented as a percent. Hemera Technologies/PhotoObjects.net/Getty Images   Related Articles  1 Excel Functions for Adding a Percentage Markup 2 How to Calculate Markup Cost 3 How to Do Percent Markup in Excel 4 How to Add a Markup Percent to a Product    If you're in the retail business you've likely heard mention of product markups. Product markups are a means of pricing products based on their costs. Calculate the markup as a percent or as a dollar value to see what your markup is and use a predetermined markup percentage to set your own prices.        Markup in Dollars When markup is expressed in dollars, it is simply the difference between the cost to acquire a product and the price that you can sell it for. Assume, for example, that you purchase a product for $3 and sell it for $5. To calculate the markup in dollars you would simply subtract the $3 cost from the $5 selling price, giving you a markup of $2. Markup as a Percentage Markup can also be expressed as a percentage. You need to divide the sale price by the cost and then subtract 1 to calculate markup as a percentage. Assume once again that you have a product that costs $3 for you to purchase and that you sell it for $5. To calculate the markup as a percentage, divide 5 by 3 to get 1.67, and subtract 1 to get 0.67 or 67 percent. Using Markup Pricing Markup pricing can be a simple way to ensure that your products make a certain profit if they sell. To calculate a price using a markup, simply multiply the cost of the product by the desired markup percentage and add the total to the product's sales cost. For example, if you have a product that costs $5 and you want to mark it up by 50 percent, multiply $5 by 50 percent to get $2.50, and then add $2.50 to $5 to get a $7.50 sales price. Determining Your Markup There is no hard and fast way to determine the appropriate markup for a product. In general, you should choose a markup that is in line with competitors in your industry. For instance, if the typical markup in your industry is between 70 and 80 percent, you might select 75 percent as your markup. Always take into account how that will affect your sales price, however, and adjust it if your price is too high or low based on demand for your product.
