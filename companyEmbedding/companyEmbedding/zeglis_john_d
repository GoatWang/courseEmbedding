Early life and education[edit]
Zeglis grew up in the farming community of Momence, Illinois. His father, Donald, worked as a lawyer. Zeglis played basketball and golf in high school and graduated as valedictorian.[1]
He attended the University of Illinois College of Business. Both parents attended the University of Illinois and Zeglis thought the school was a natural fit. While there, he served as the house president of Beta Theta Pi and was a member of Sigma Iota Epsilon. He was admitted to Beta Gamma Sigma and Phi Kappa Phi. He graduated in 1969, with a bachelor of science degree in finance.[1]
After attending the University of Illinois, he attended Harvard Law School, where he served as the senior editor of the Harvard Law Review and graduated magna cum laude with a juris doctorate, in 1972.[1]
Law career[edit]
Zeglis began his career, in 1973, at the law firm now known as Sidley Austin, in Chicago, Illinois. He became a partner five years later. While there, he worked on the defense of the AT&T account during the antitrust lawsuit United States v. AT&T — and when the case resulted in the breakup of the AT&T/Bell System, he helped restructure the system. By 1984, AT&T had successfully broken up into the "baby Bells". Soon after, he joined AT&T as a vice-president and general counsel.[1]
NBA D-League[edit]
In 2007, Zeglis helped found the Fort Wayne Mad Ants,[2] an NBA D-League Team. When created, they were the first minor league basketball team in Fort Wayne since the Fort Wayne Fury of the Continental Basketball Association. The Mad Ants play at the Allen County War Memorial Coliseum in Fort Wayne, Indiana. Zeglis served as the president of the Mad Ants. The team won an NBA D-League Championship title in 2014. In September 2015, the Indiana Pacers bought the Mad Ants, and they became the Pacers' one-on-one affiliate.
Board service[edit]
Zeglis has served on a number of corporate, educational and philanthropic boards of trustees and directors. The list includes the Sara Lee Corporation, Helmerich and Payne Corporation, Illinova, the Brookings Institution, Culver Education Foundation, the Kellogg School of Management, State Farm, the UIUC College of Business, Mutual Automobile Insurance and chairman of the board of trustees at George Washington University.[3]

      Born: 1947, in Momence, Illinois.
    

      Education: University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, BS, 1969; Harvard
      University, JD, 1972.
    

      Family: Son of Donald D. (lawyer) and Dorothy Ann Joost Zeglis (English
      teacher); married Carol Jane Hamm; children: three.
    

      Career: Sidley and Austin, 1973–1978, associate; 1978–1984,
      partner; AT&T, 1984–1996, general counsel; 1997–1999,
      vice chairman and president; AT–T Wireless, 1999–2004,
      chairman and chief executive officer.
    

      Address: AT&T Wireless, 7277 164th Avenue NE, Building 1, Redmond,
      Washington 98052; http://www.att wireless.com.
    

      ■ A seasoned telecommunications attorney, John D. Zeglis was
      appointed president of AT&T in 1997 and chairman and CEO of
      AT&T Wireless in 1999. Despite his lack of formal business
      training, Zeglis rose to the top ranks of AT&T management owing to
      his vast knowledge of regulatory policy and long acquaintance with the
      company's executive inner circle. Zeglis drafted the momentous
      divestiture plan that broke up AT&T in 1984, and he masterminded
      the company's legal strategy during the telecommunications
      revolution of the 1990s.
    

      EARLY LIFE AND EDUCATION
    

      Zeglis was born and reared in Momence, Illinois, a small farming town
      where his father was a respected local attorney for more than five
      decades. The eldest of three boys, all of whom followed their father into
      law, Zeglis distinguished himself as a basketball player and golfer in
      high school. After graduating at the top of his class, Zeglis enrolled at
      his parents'

          . 
        


      alma mater, the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign, where he
      earned a business degree in 1969. He then went to Harvard University to
      study law, graduating magna cum laude in 1972 and serving as senior editor
      of the prestigious 
      
        Harvard Law Review
      
      . Zeglis then spent a year studying antitrust law and economics in Europe
      on a postgraduate Knox Memorial fellowship.
    

      BEGINS CAREER AS ATTORNEY
    

      Zeglis's impressive credentials and intelligence attracted the
      attention of partners at Sidley and Austin, a prominent Chicago law firm
      whose clients included AT&T. Zeglis was hired as an associate in
      1973 and made partner in 1978. During his early years at the firm Zeglis
      gained valuable experience in telecommunications legislation while working
      on an important Federal Communications Commission rate case.
    

      In 1982, when AT&T acted to settle a massive antitrust suit brought
      by the U.S. Department of Justice, Zeglis was placed in charge of writing
      the court-ordered divestiture plan that broke AT&T into seven
      regional, or "baby Bell," telephone companies. AT&T
      (American Telephone and Telegraph) was the parent company of the monopoly
      Bell telephone system, making it one of the nation's largest
      corporations. Zeglis's key role in devising the complex breakup
      plan, implemented in 1984, was regarded as an ingenuous feat that
      solidified his relationship with AT&T, a company he had served for
      many years as outside counsel.
    

      JOINS AT&T
    

      In 1984, after the breakup took effect, Zeglis was hired by AT&T to
      work on its legal staff and within 10 months became the company's
      general counsel. During the next decade Zeglis was intimately involved in
      the formulation of AT&T's government and regulatory policies
      as the company defended itself against new long-distance competitors and
      reorganized its corporate structure in the face of a rapidly changing
      telecommunications industry. While working behind the scenes as
      AT&T's chief legal advisor, Zeglis gained access to the
      company's power center as a trusted and indispensable witness to
      high-level strategy sessions and board meetings. Zeglis also formed a
      close relationship with Robert E. Allen, who became the CEO of AT&T
      in 1988.
    

      As Allen's right-hand man, Zeglis took on an increasingly vital
      role in the company's business planning and management activities.
      During the mid-1990s Allen placed Zeglis in charge of orchestrating a
      second AT&T divestiture, at the time the largest voluntary
      corporate breakup in U.S. history. The result was the creation of two
      publicly traded spin-offs, Lucent Technologies in 1996 and NCR Corporation
      in 1997. Zeglis was also a key decision maker behind AT&T's
      purchase of McCaw Cellular Communications Corporation in 1994 and
      AT&T's failed bid to merge with SBC Communications in 1997.
    

      ASSUMES TOP LEADERSHIP AT AT&T
    

      When Allen resigned as CEO in 1997, it was widely speculated that Zeglis
      would be tapped as his successor. However, concern over Zeglis's
      lack of experience, as well as his leading role in the SBC Communications
      debacle, caused him to be passed over in favor of C. Michael Armstrong,
      the former CEO of Hughes Electronics Corporation. As consolation, and in
      an effort to keep Zeglis from accepting an offer to become the CEO of the
      power company Illinova, Zeglis was named the vice chairman of AT&T
      in June 1997. Later that year, in a gesture of confidence, Zeglis was
      promoted by Armstrong to president of AT&T. Over the next two years
      Zeglis presided over AT&T's wireless, consumer, and
      international operations and helped manage AT&T's newly
      acquired cable television assets with the 1998 purchase of
      Tele-Communications Incorporated (TCI).
    

      In 1999 Zeglis assumed a new position as the chairman and CEO of
      AT&T Wireless. Under Zeglis's guidance, AT&T Wireless
      upgraded its networks, improved customer service, and went public as a
      tracking stock in 2000, a move that raised $10.6 billion. In 2001, with
      AT&T stock plunging, AT&T Wireless was spun off from its
      parent company, leaving Zeglis to head one of the largest independently
      owned and operated mobile phone companies in North America, with 22
      million subscribers.
    

      By 2004 AT&T Wireless had become the third largest U.S. mobile
      service provider, behind Verizon Wireless and Cingular Wireless, and had
      begun to lose customers as a result of botched upgrades and a new federal
      regulation that permitted cellular customers to switch services without
      changing their phone numbers. After posting first-quarter losses in 2004,
      the company was sold to Cingular Wireless for $41 billion. With the
      dissolution of AT&T Wireless, Zeglis indicated that he would leave
      the telecommunications business to pursue other interests.
    

      Well liked and praised for his brilliant legal mind, Zeglis was an avid
      hiker and sports fan who won many friends during two decades of loyal
      service to AT&T. What he lacked in star-power charisma Zeglis made
      up with his good-natured personality and wry sense of humor. He was known
      to carry 
      
        Trivial Pursuit
      
       game cards in his pocket for recreational quizzing and, if needed, to
      defuse tense business meetings. Zeglis described himself as "the
      Forrest Gump of the telecommunications industry." Recalling his
      central position amid the regulatory and technological upheavals that
      transformed AT&T, Zeglis told 
      
        Commerce InSight
      
      , "By sheer dumb luck, I've been right in the eye of the
      storm of every major controversy in telecommunications in the last quarter
      of the twentieth century."

 John D. Zeglis           
 

John D. Zeglis, retired Chairman and CEO of AT&T Wireless Services, and President of AT&T prior
 to the spin-off of AT&T Wireless in year 2000;  also . 


He is also a brother of David Zeglis of the South Shore of Lake Maxinkuckee.
 
John was born   in Momence, Illinois and reared there. He is the son of Donald D. and Dorothy Ann Joost Zeglis   He married 
Carol Jane Hamm who also graduated from the University of Illinois in 1969 and has three children. 

He was  a distinguished basketball player and golfer in high school, graduating at the top of his class. 

Spending his undergraduate years at the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign, where he member of the Illio staff, committee 
chairman for Illini Union Student Activities; and valedictorian of his 1969 class in the College of Commerce and Business 
Administration,   as a Bronze Tablet Scholar with a B.S. in finance. In 1972 he graduated  magna cum laude graduate from  Harvard 
Law School, with a J.D. and was a senior editor of the prestigious Harvard Law Review. Winning the Knox Memorial Fellowship for a
 year of postgraduate studies in antitrust law and economics in Europe.  He was also a member of such honoraries as Phi Eta Sigma, 
 Sachem, and Omicron Delta Kappa. A member of Beta Theta Pi social fraternity, serving as  house president in his senior year. Other 
 organizations to which he belonged included Beta Gamma Sigma, Phi Kappa Phi, and Sigma Iota Epsilon.   
            
Beginning his career in 1973 as an associate with Sidley & Austin, a prominent Chicago law firm whose clients included AT&T; and  was 
made a partner of the  firm in 1978. There he  gained valuable experience in telecommunications legislation while working on an 
important Federal Communications Commission rate case.

In 1982, when AT&T acted to settle a massive antitrust suit brought by the U.S. Department of Justice, Zeglis was placed in charge of 
writing the court-ordered divestiture plan that broke AT&T into seven regional, or "baby Bell," telephone companies. AT&T being  the 
parent company of the monopoly Bell telephone system, which made it one of the nation's largest corporations. This complex breakup 
plan, implemented in 1984, was regarded as an ingenuous feat that solidified his relationship with AT&T.

On January 1, 1984, he joined AT&T as corporate vice president - law and in 1986  was named  executive vice president and general 
counsel.  Becoming  involved in the form  ulation of AT&T's government and reg  ulatory policies while the company defended itself 
against new long-distance competitors and reorganized its corporate structure in the face of a rapidly changing telecommunications 
industry. While working behind the scenes as AT&T's chief legal advisor, Zeglis gained access to the company's power center as a 
trusted and indispensable witness to high-level strategy sessions and board meetings. 

During the  mid-1990s Zeglis  was given charge of orchestrating the second AT&T  divestiture, the largest voluntary corporate breakup in U.S. history at that time. IRes  ulting was the creation of  Lucent Technologies in 1996 and NCR Corporation in 1997. Zeglis was also a key decision maker behind AT&T's  $11.5 billion acquisition of McCaw Cell  ular Communications Corporation in 1994,  overseeing AT&T's lobbying strategy for the Telecommunications Act of 1996 and AT&T's failed bid to merge with SBC Communications in 1997

Being passed over  for the appointment of CEO when Robert E. Allen resigned that post in favor of C. Michael Armstrong; he was 
appointed Vice Chairman June 1997 in an effort to keep him from accepting the position as CEO of Illiova. In October 1997, he was 
named the new president and chief operating officer of AT&T by Armstrong.  He presided over AT&T's wireless, consumer, and 
international operations and helped manage AT&T's newly acquired cable television assets with the 1998 purchase of Tele-Communications 
Incorporated. 

In December 1999, Zeglis was elected Chairman & CEO of the AT&T Wireless Group. Under Zeglis's guidance, AT&T Wireless upgraded its 
networks, improved customer service, and went public as a tracking stock in 2000, a move that raised $10.6 billion. 

April 2000, AT&T Wireless debuted on the stock market, selling $10.6 billion in stock. The shares were the most active of the day and
 the fifth-most-traded stock in history, closing at $31.81 a share and employees were thrilled to buy stock at a designated $29.50 a 
 share.

In June 2001 he was appointed chairman of the board in addition to his duties as chief executive.  When  the split-off was completed 
John Zeglis,  Walter Elisha, Donald Fites and Ralph Larsen, left the AT&T board and immediately join the AT&T Wireless board - rounding 
out the board were: Nobuharu Ono, an executive at NTT DoCoMo, John Madigan, CEO of the Tribune Company, Barry Rand, a retired 
executive from Avis Holdings, and Carolyn Ticknor, a retired executive from Hewlett-Packard.  The move from corporate AT&T headquarters 
in New Jersey to AT&T Wireless headquarters in Redmond, was made. In July of 2001, AT&T distributed the remaining 1.16 billion shares
 of stock in AT&T Wirelessto  the existing AT&T shareholders and they were to receicve roughly one-third of a share of AT&T Wireless
  for each share of AT&T stock - making Wireless a fully independent company.  Thus  Zeglis  became CEO of the largest independently 
  owned and operated mobile phone companies in North America, with 22 million subscribers.

The company Zeglis inherited had a major technology problem. Its networks were based on an older technology known as "TDMA" - 
time-division m  ultiple access -  with limited capacity. The scope of its network was another problem, it covered only about 100
 million people; only about half the reach of Cing  ular. With the influx of new data and m  ultimedia services coming down the pike, 
 AT&T Wireless was faced with the prospect of seeing its capacity exhausted within a few years and the only solution was to proceed 
 with a costly technology overha  ul to the international standard known as "GSM" - - global system for mobile communication. Over two 
 years, AT&T Wireless spent $5 billion annually upgrading its systems for GSM.

During this time Zeglis was talking with potential merger partners of which he also wanted to be a buyer. With the wireless industry 
consolidating, hoping he could expand as AT&T had expanded its cable-TV business by doing a couple of big acquisitions. But nobody 
was interested in selling, thus Plan B was put into place - sell AT&T Wireless.  By late 2003, Zeglis had managed to rounded up a 
half-dozen bidders. They included Nextel, Cing  ular and Vodafone. 

By 2004 AT&T Wireless was the third largest U.S. mobile service provider, behind Verizon Wireless and Cing  ular Wireless, but lost   
customers due to  botched upgrades and the  new federal reg  ulation permitting cell  ular customers to switch services without changing 
their phone numbers. After the decision to put AT&T Wireless on the block January 2004 shareholders picked up around US$15 a share 
following a fierce bidding war between Vodafone and Cing  ular. After posting first-quarter losses in 2004, the company was sold to 
Atlanta-based Cing  ular Wireless for  $US41 billion ($53.56 billion) on Feb. 18 at 2:30 a.m., AT&T Wireless Chief Executive John 
Zeglis shook hands with top Cing  ular executives. Employees will benefit from the deal: Zeglis  will get $21.7 million and more than 
$86 million will be split among AT&T Wireless executives and directors.   In May 2004 AT&T Wireless shareholders on  approved 
the $41 billion buyout by  Cing  ular Wireless. The shareholders who actually voted during the annual meeting, 98 percent approved the 
merger but when  accounting  for the missing voting block, the merger proposal was approved by 65 percent of all shareholders.

 With the finalization of Cing  ular's acquisition of AT&T Wireless on 26 October 2004 came the dissolution of AT&T Wireless,and  Zeglis 
 indicated that he would leave the telecommunications business to pursue other interests,  retiring in November, 2004, following the 
 company's sale to Cing  ular Wireless (largest cash transaction ever).  The Zeglis's  also sold their home in Madison, N.J., where 
 they lived for 20 years, a few miles from AT&T's old Basking Ridge headquarters; packed up and moved to Lake Maxinkuckee at Culver , 
 Indiana.


The Seattle Times  states that a  survey found that Zeglis was the 10th-highest paid CEO last year with a total compensation package 
of $8.4 million, not including his windfall from the merger. Also that he received $19.1 million for his stock and options and $8 
million in severance five years after becoming chief executive and before the company's public offering.

 After Zeglis retired and relocated,  he and his son-in-law, Jeff Potter, began talking about creating a professional sports team. 
 After settling on basketball over baseball and indoor football, Zeglis' thoughts quickly turned to the NBA Development League.  John 
 Zeglis, founding member of the Ft. Wayne Basketball Group and the primary investor of group of 11  that will bring an NBA Development 
 League team to Fort Wayne in the fall,  announced in Ft. Wayne at the Allen County War Memorial Coliseum April 10, 2007 that a new 
 D-League franchise, the 16th was awarded to Ft. Wayne, Indiana    The unnamed team will play in  Memorial Coliseum and  has an 
 affiliation with an NBA team, it's expected that Fort Wayne will be probably be affiliated with the Indiana Pacers and perhaps 
 another team in the Midwest, perhaps Chicago, Detroit or Cleveland, this will be announced in May. The team will play a 50-game 
 sched  ule beginning in November 2007. The team will play several games on Thursdays, as well as some on Fridays and Saturdays. But 
 he said the team's big game day will be Sunday. Start times still are unknown. He and  son-in-law, Jeff Potter, the franchise's 
 president and a former player at the University of Oregon a three-year starter  from 1993 to '95at the University of Oregon, was 
 named the team's president, looked long and hard before settling on Fort Wayne.  Potter is also a former county prosecutor in 
 Illinois.

John is a member of the board of trustees of the Culver  Educational Foundation, Culver , Indiana; the Marshall County Community Fund;
  and the St. Joseph Medical Center of Plymouth, Indiana. He has served as Chairman of the board of trustees of George Washington 
  University, Washington D.C.   Other past associations include:  trustee of the United Negro College Fund; a trustee of the

Early life and education[edit]
Zeglis grew up in the farming community of Momence, Illinois. His father, Donald, worked as a lawyer. Zeglis played basketball and golf in high school and graduated as valedictorian.[1]
He attended the University of Illinois College of Business. Both parents attended the University of Illinois and Zeglis thought the school was a natural fit. While there, he served as the house president of Beta Theta Pi and was a member of Sigma Iota Epsilon. He was admitted to Beta Gamma Sigma and Phi Kappa Phi. He graduated in 1969, with a bachelor of science degree in finance.[1]
After attending the University of Illinois, he attended Harvard Law School, where he served as the senior editor of the Harvard Law Review and graduated magna cum laude with a juris doctorate, in 1972.[1]
Law career[edit]
Zeglis began his career, in 1973, at the law firm now known as Sidley Austin, in Chicago, Illinois. He became a partner five years later. While there, he worked on the defense of the AT&T account during the antitrust lawsuit United States v. AT&T — and when the case resulted in the breakup of the AT&T/Bell System, he helped restructure the system. By 1984, AT&T had successfully broken up into the "baby Bells". Soon after, he joined AT&T as a vice-president and general counsel.[1]
NBA D-League[edit]
In 2007, Zeglis helped found the Fort Wayne Mad Ants,[2] an NBA D-League Team. When created, they were the first minor league basketball team in Fort Wayne since the Fort Wayne Fury of the Continental Basketball Association. The Mad Ants play at the Allen County War Memorial Coliseum in Fort Wayne, Indiana. Zeglis served as the president of the Mad Ants. The team won an NBA D-League Championship title in 2014. In September 2015, the Indiana Pacers bought the Mad Ants, and they became the Pacers' one-on-one affiliate.
Board service[edit]
Zeglis has served on a number of corporate, educational and philanthropic boards of trustees and directors. The list includes the Sara Lee Corporation, Helmerich and Payne Corporation, Illinova, the Brookings Institution, Culver Education Foundation, the Kellogg School of Management, State Farm, the UIUC College of Business, Mutual Automobile Insurance and chairman of the board of trustees at George Washington University.[3]

Early life and education[edit]
Zeglis grew up in the farming community of Momence, Illinois. His father, Donald, worked as a lawyer. Zeglis played basketball and golf in high school and graduated as valedictorian.[1]
He attended the University of Illinois College of Business. Both parents attended the University of Illinois and Zeglis thought the school was a natural fit. While there, he served as the house president of Beta Theta Pi and was a member of Sigma Iota Epsilon. He was admitted to Beta Gamma Sigma and Phi Kappa Phi. He graduated in 1969, with a bachelor of science degree in finance.[1]
After attending the University of Illinois, he attended Harvard Law School, where he served as the senior editor of the Harvard Law Review and graduated magna cum laude with a juris doctorate, in 1972.[1]
Law career[edit]
Zeglis began his career, in 1973, at the law firm now known as Sidley Austin, in Chicago, Illinois. He became a partner five years later. While there, he worked on the defense of the AT&T account during the antitrust lawsuit United States v. AT&T — and when the case resulted in the breakup of the AT&T/Bell System, he helped restructure the system. By 1984, AT&T had successfully broken up into the "baby Bells". Soon after, he joined AT&T as a vice-president and general counsel.[1]
NBA D-League[edit]
In 2007, Zeglis helped found the Fort Wayne Mad Ants,[2] an NBA D-League Team. When created, they were the first minor league basketball team in Fort Wayne since the Fort Wayne Fury of the Continental Basketball Association. The Mad Ants play at the Allen County War Memorial Coliseum in Fort Wayne, Indiana. Zeglis served as the president of the Mad Ants. The team won an NBA D-League Championship title in 2014. In September 2015, the Indiana Pacers bought the Mad Ants, and they became the Pacers' one-on-one affiliate.
Board service[edit]
Zeglis has served on a number of corporate, educational and philanthropic boards of trustees and directors. The list includes the Sara Lee Corporation, Helmerich and Payne Corporation, Illinova, the Brookings Institution, Culver Education Foundation, the Kellogg School of Management, State Farm, the UIUC College of Business, Mutual Automobile Insurance and chairman of the board of trustees at George Washington University.[3]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
