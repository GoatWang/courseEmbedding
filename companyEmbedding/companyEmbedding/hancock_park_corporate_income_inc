Note
1. Organization and Basis of Presentation

 

Organization

 

Hancock
Park Corporate Income, Inc. (the “Company”) is a
Maryland corporation formed on December 8, 2015. The Company
was formed primarily to lend to, and selectively invest in,
middle-market companies in the United States, and operate as an
externally managed, non-diversified, closed-end investment company.
The Company has elected to be regulated as a business development
company (“BDC”) under the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended (“1940 Act”); and intends to elect to
be treated for federal income tax purposes, and to qualify annually
thereafter, as a regulated investment company (“RIC”)
under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(“Code”).

 

OFS
Capital Management, LLC (“OFS Advisor”), an affiliate
of the Company, a registered investment adviser, and a subsidiary
of Orchard First Source Asset Management, LLC
(“OFSAM”), serves as investment adviser to the Company,
and Evolv Capital Advisors LLC (“Evolv” and, together
with OFS Advisor, the “Advisors”), a registered
investment adviser, serves as sub-adviser to the Company. OFS
Advisor also serves as the investment adviser to collateral loan
obligation ("CLO") funds and other assets, including OFS Capital
Corporation ("OFS Capital"). OFS Capital is a publicly-traded BDC
with an investment strategy similar to the Company's.

 

The
Company intends to raise up to $200,000,000 through offering shares
of its common stock to investors in a continuous offering (the
“Offering”) in reliance on exemptions from the
registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as
amended ("Securities Act"). On August 30, 2016, OFS Funding I, LLC
(“Funding I”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of OFSAM and
an affiliate of OFS Advisor, purchased 74,074 shares of the
Company’s common stock in the Offering for gross proceeds of
$1,000,000 (the "Minimum Offering Requirement"), or $13.50 per
share. No selling commissions or dealer manager fees were paid in
connection with this purchase.

 

The
Company intends to provide debt and equity financing to
middle-market private, U.S. companies. The term
“middle-market” refers to companies which may exhibit
one or more of the following characteristics: number of employees
less than 2,000; revenues between $15 million and $300 million;
annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization between $3 million and $50 million; generally, private
companies owned by private equity firms or owners/operators; and
enterprise value between $10 million and $500 million. The
Company’s investment objective is to provide its shareholders
with current income and, to a lesser extent, capital
appreciation.

 

The
Company anticipates that its portfolio will be comprised primarily
of investments in senior secured loans, which includes first-lien,
second-lien and unitranche loans, as well as subordinated loans
and, to a lesser extent, warrants and other equity securities, of
private, middle-market companies. In connection with the
Company’s debt investments, the Company may receive equity
securities, such as warrants, as additional consideration. The
Company's investments may also include common or preferred equity
securities in its portfolio companies, either in conjunction with
one of its debt investments or through a co-investment with a
financial sponsor.

 

Through
September 30, 2016 , the Company's activities have been
limited to administrative activities, organization and registration
of the Company under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (the
“Exchange Act”), the cost of which has been borne by
OFS Advisor and its affiliates, the purchase by OFSAM and Funding I
of 74,084 shares of common stock at an aggregate purchase price of
$1,000,150, and activities related to the Offering. The
Company’s activities are subject to significant risks and
uncertainties, including failure to secure the necessary capital
above the Minimum Offering Requirement to effectively execute the
Company’s investment strategy.

 

Basis of
Presentation

 

The
Company prepares its financial statements in accordance with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”),
including Accounting Standards Codification Topic 946, Financial
Services–Investment Companies , (“ASC Topic
946”) and the requirements for reporting on Form 10-Q, the
1940 Act, and Articles 6 or 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they
do not include all of the information and notes required by GAAP
for annual financial statements. In the opinion of management, the
financial statements include all adjustments, consisting only of
normal and recurring accruals and adjustments, necessary for fair
presentation in accordance with GAAP. These financial statements
should be read in conjunction with the financial statements
contained in the Company's Registration Statement filed on
Amendment No. 1 to Form 10, dated July 6, 2016. Operating
results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016
, are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be
expected for the year ending December 31, 2016 .

Note
2.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

 

Use of
Estimates

 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ significantly
from those estimates.

 

Cash and
Cash Equivalents

 

Cash and
cash equivalents consist of cash and highly liquid investments with
original maturities of three months or less at the time of
acquisition. The Company’s cash and cash equivalents are
maintained with a member bank of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation (“FDIC”) and, at times, such balances may
exceed the FDIC insurance limits.

 

Organization
Costs

 

Organization
costs include, among other things, legal fees related to the
organization of the Company, its related documents of organization,
and its initial operating agreements; independent audit of the
Company’s seed-stage financial statements; and expenses
related to its election to be treated as a BDC. Organization costs
are charged to expense as incurred. The investment and management
agreement dated July 15, 2016, between the Company and OFS
Advisor ("Investment Advisory Agreement") limits the Company's
liability for organization costs, and the related expense, as
discussed below and in Note 3.

 

Offering
Costs

 

Offering
costs include legal, accounting, printing and other expenses
pertaining to the preparation of the Offering; the related
dealer-manager agreement; and other underwriting expenses, which
include permissible due diligence reimbursements to the dealer
manager and participating broker-dealers. Offering costs are
deferred until the continuous offering period commences and then
amortized on a straight-line basis over twelve months. The
Investment Advisory Agreement limits the Company's liability for
organization costs, and the related expense, as discussed below and
in Note 3.

 

Deferred
offering costs as of September 30, 2016 , and
December 31, 2015 , are as follows.

Expense
Limitation Agreements and Contractual Issuer
Expenses

 

The
Company benefits from two expense limitation agreements with OFS
Advisor: (i) portions of the Investment Advisory Agreement, and
(ii) an expense support and conditional reimbursement agreement
dated July 15, 2016 ("Expense Support Agreement"), which
limits all other operating expenses. The Investment Advisor
Agreement contains provisions limiting the Company's obligation to
recognize and pay (i) organization and offering costs, and (ii)
other contractually-defined costs pertaining to the Company's
organization and the Offering, including (a) costs associated with
technology integration between the Company’s systems and
those of its participating broker-dealers; (b) marketing expenses,
which includes development of marketing materials and marketing
presentations, training and educational meetings, and generally
coordinating the marketing process for the Company; and (c) the
salaries and direct expenses of OFS Advisor’s employees,
employees of their affiliates and others while engaged in
organization, offering, and these other contractually-defined
activities ("Contractual Issuer Expenses").

The
Expense Support Agreement limits all other operating expenses not
separately limited under the Investment Advisory Agreement such
that no distribution by the Company is deemed to be a return of
capital contributed by its shareholders. See
Note 3.

Hancock
Park Corporate Income, Inc.

Notes to
Financial Statements (unaudited)

 

The
initial effect of expense limitation agreements are recognized
reductions in gross expenses in the statement of operations, and
elimination of associated assets and liabilities in the balance
sheet in the period of limitation. Liability for the reimbursement
of amounts, and the associated expense or deferred expense, are
recognized as the substantive conditions for reimbursement are
satisfied.

 

Income
Taxes

 

The
Company intends to qualify and elect to be treated as a RIC under
Subchapter M of the Code as soon as practicable. Once qualified as
a RIC, and so long as the Company maintains its RIC status, it
generally will not pay corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on
ordinary income or capital gains that it distributes at least
annually to its shareholders as dividends. The Company is subject
to corporate-level taxes under Subchapter C of the Code until it
qualifies and elects to be treated as a RIC.

 

The
Company evaluates tax positions taken in the course of preparing
its tax returns to determine whether they are
“more-likely-than-not” to be sustained by the
applicable tax authority. The benefits of positions not deemed to
meet the more-likely-than-not threshold could result in greater
taxable income resulting in undistributed taxable income, income
and excise tax expense, and, if involving multiple years, a
re-assessment of the Company’s RIC status. GAAP requires
recognition of accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain
tax benefits as income tax expense. There were no uncertain income
tax positions at September 30, 2016 , and December 31,
2015 .

 

Common
Stock Subscriptions

 

Common
stock subscriptions received in cash prior to the issuance of the
Company’s financial statements are reported as subscription
receivable with corresponding amounts reported in common stock and
paid-in capital in excess of par.


Note 3.
 Transactions with the Advisers

 

Investment
Advisory and Management Agreement

 

OFS
Advisor acts as the Company’s investment adviser pursuant to
the Investment Advisory Agreement, which became effective on August
30, 2016, when the Company satisfied the Minimum Offering
Requirement. OFS Advisor manages the investment and reinvestment of
the assets of, and provides investment advisory services to, the
Company. Under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement and
subject to the overall supervision of the Board, OFS Advisor is
responsible for sourcing potential investments, conducting research
and diligence on potential investments and equity sponsors,
analyzing investment opportunities, structuring investments, and
monitoring investments and portfolio companies on an ongoing
basis.

 

OFS
Advisor’s services under the Investment Advisory Agreement
are not exclusive to the Company and OFS Advisor is free to furnish
similar services to other entities, including other BDCs affiliated
with OFS Advisor, so long as its services to the Company are not
impaired. OFS Advisor also serves as the investment adviser to CLO
funds and other assets,including OFS Capital. OFS Capital is a
publicly-traded BDC with an investment strategy similar to the
Company.

 

OFS
Advisor will receive fees for services provided under the
Investment Advisory Agreement, consisting of two components: a base
management fee and incentive fees. The base management fee will be
calculated at an annual rate of 2.0% based on the average value of
the Company’s total assets (other than cash and cash
equivalents but including assets purchased with borrowed amounts
and including assets owned by any consolidated entity), at the end
of the two most recently completed calendar quarters. The base
management fee will be payable quarterly in arrears. Base
management fees for any partial quarter will be prorated based on
the number of days in the quarter.

 

The
incentive fee will have two parts. The first part (part one) will
be calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based on the
Company’s pre-incentive fee net investment income for the
quarter. For this purpose, pre-incentive fee net investment income
means interest income, dividend income and any other income
(including any other fees such as commitment, origination and
sourcing, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees
that the Company receives from portfolio companies but excluding
fees for providing managerial assistance) accrued during the
calendar quarter, minus operating expenses for the quarter
(including the base management fee, any expenses payable under the
Administration Agreement and any interest expense and dividends
paid on any outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the
incentive fee). Pre-incentive fee net investment income will
include, in the case of investments with a deferred interest
feature (such as original issue discount, debt instruments with
paid-in-kind (“PIK”) interest and zero coupon
securities), accrued income that the Company has not yet received
in cash.

Hancock
Park Corporate Income, Inc.

Notes to
Financial Statements (unaudited)

 

Pre-incentive
fee net investment income will be expressed as a rate of return on
the value of the Company’s net assets (defined as total
assets less indebtedness and before taking into account any
incentive fees payable during the period) at the end of the
immediately preceding calendar quarter. The incentive fee with
respect to pre-incentive fee net income is 100% of the amount, if
any, by which the pre-incentive fee net investment income for the
immediately preceding calendar quarter exceeds a 1.75% (which is
7.0% annualized) “hurdle rate” but is less than 2.1875%
(or 8.75% annually), referred to as the “catch-up”
provision, and 20.0% of the amount of pre-incentive fee net
investment income, if any, that exceeds 2.1875%. The
“catch-up” is meant to provide OFS Advisor with 20.0%
of the pre-incentive fee net investment income as if a hurdle rate
did not apply if this pre-incentive fee net investment income
exceeds 2.1875% in any calendar quarter.

 

Pre-incentive
fee net investment income will not include any realized gains,
realized losses, unrealized capital appreciation or unrealized
capital depreciation. Given the structure of the incentive fee, it
is possible that the Company may pay an incentive fee in a quarter
where it incurs a loss. For example, if the Company receives
pre-incentive fee net investment income in excess of the hurdle
rate (as defined above) for a quarter, the Company will pay the
applicable incentive fee even if the Company incurred a loss in
that quarter due to realized capital losses and unrealized capital
depreciation. The Company’s pre-incentive fee net investment
income used to calculate this part of the incentive fee is also
included in the amount of the Company’s gross assets used to
calculate the base management fee.

 

The second
part (part two) of the incentive fee (the “Capital Gain
Fee”) will be determined and payable in arrears as of the end
of each calendar year (or upon termination of the Investment
Advisory Agreement, as of the termination date), and will equal
20.0% of the Company’s aggregate realized capital gains, if
any, on a cumulative basis through the end of each calendar year,
computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital
depreciation through the end of such year, less all previous
amounts paid in respect of the Capital Gain Fee.

 

The
Company will accrue the Capital Gain Fee if, on a cumulative basis,
the sum of net realized capital gains and (losses) plus net
unrealized appreciation and (depreciation) is positive. If, on a
cumulative basis, the sum of net realized capital gains (losses)
plus net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) decreases during a
period, the Company will reverse any excess Capital Gain Fee
previously accrued such that the amount of Capital Gains Fee
accrued is no more than 20% of the sum of net realized capital
gains (losses) plus net unrealized appreciation
(depreciation).

 

The fees
that are payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement for any
partial period will be appropriately prorated. As of
September 30, 2016 , no fees have been paid or accrued under
the Investment Advisory Agreement.

 

Unless
terminated earlier as described below, the Investment Advisory
Agreement will remain in effect for a period of two years from
August 30, 2016, and will remain in effect from year-to-year
thereafter if approved annually by the Company’s board of
directors or by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority
of the Company’s outstanding voting securities, and, in
either case, if also approved by a majority of the Company’s
directors who are not “interested persons” as defined
in the 1940 Act. The Investment Advisory Agreement will
automatically terminate in the event of its assignment, as defined
in the 1940 Act, and may be terminated by the Company or OFS
Advisor without penalty upon not less than 60 days’ written
notice to the other. The holders of a majority of our outstanding
voting securities may also terminate the Investment Advisory
Agreement without penalty upon not less than 60 days’ written
notice.

 

Investment
Sub-Advisory Agreement

 

Evolv
serves as the Company’s sub-adviser pursuant to an investment
sub-advisory agreement dated July 15, 2016
(‘‘Sub-Advisory Agreement’’) among Evolv,
OFS Advisor, and the Company, which became effective on August 30,
2016, when the Minimum Offering Requirement was satisfied. Evolv
assists OFS Advisor with the management of the Company’s
activities and operations. On an annualized basis, Evolv earns 20%
of the fees paid by the Company to OFS Advisor under the Investment
Advisory Agreement with respect to each year, which, when due, are
payable by OFS Advisor to Evolv quarterly in arrears. In addition,
certain registered representatives of Evolv are also
representatives of the dealer manager of the Offering.

Unless
terminated earlier as described below, the Sub-Advisory Agreement
will remain in effect for a period of two years from August 30,
2016, and will remain in effect from year-to-year thereafter if
approved annually by the Company’s board of directors,
including a majority of the Company’s directors who are not
interested persons, or by the affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of the Company’s outstanding voting securities. The
Sub-Advisory Agreement may be terminated at any time by Evolv upon
not less than 60 days’ prior written notice to the Company
and OFS Advisor, or by the Company or OFS Advisor upon not less
than 60 days’ prior written notice to Evolv and upon (i) the
vote of a majority of the Company's outstanding voting securities
or (ii) the vote of a majority of the Company’s board of
directors, including a majority of the independent directors. The
Sub-Advisory Agreement will automatically terminate in the event of
its assignment. For the three year period following
termination

defined in the Sub-Advisory Agreement, Evolv will be entitled to

Administrative
Agreement

 

OFS
Capital Services, LLC (“OFS Services”), an affiliate
and a subsidiary of OFSAM, serves as the Company’s
administrator pursuant to an administration services agreement
dated July 15, 2016 (“Administration Agreement”). OFS
Services performs, or oversees the performance of, required
administrative services, including maintenance of financial
records, and preparation of reports to shareholders and all other
reports and materials required to be filed with the SEC or any
other regulatory authority. In addition, OFS Services will assist
in the determination and publication of the Company’s net
asset value, its tax compliance, and publication and dissemination
of reports to its shareholders, and generally oversee the payment
of its expenses and the performance of administrative and
professional services rendered to the Company by others. Under the
Administration Agreement, OFS Services will provide managerial
assistance on the Company’s behalf to certain portfolio
companies that accept the Company’s offer to provide such
assistance. Payments under the Administration Agreement (subject to
the review and approval of the Board) are equal to the
Company’s allocable portion of OFS Services’ cost for
the Company’s officers—including its chief executive
officer, chief financial officer, chief compliance officer, chief
accounting officer, and corporate secretary—and their
respective staffs, and the Company’s allocable portion of OFS
Services’ overhead in performing these services. To the
extent that OFS Services outsources any of its functions, the
Company will pay the fees associated with such functions on a
direct basis without profit to OFS Services. Amounts charged under
the Administration Agreement exclude Contractual Issuer
Expenses.

Advisor limits the Company's incurred expenses under two

Expense
Support Agreement

 

The
Expense Support Agreement is designed to ensure no portion of the
Company’s distribution to shareholders will be paid from its
Offering proceeds, and provides for expense-reduction payments from
OFS Advisor to the Company in any quarterly period in which the
Company’s cumulative distributions to shareholders exceeds
its cumulative distributable ordinary income and net realized
gains. The Expense Support Agreement provides for reimbursement of
these payments by the Company to OFS Advisor, however, such
liability shall only accrue (i) to the extent they do not cause the
then-current "Other Operating Expense Ratio" (defined below) to
exceed such ratio for period for which period the Company will
reimburse OFS Advisor and (ii) if the then-current annualized rate
of distribution per share equals or exceeds the annualized rate of
distribution per share for period for which period the Company will
reimburse OFS Advisor. The Other Operating Expense Ratio is defined
as total operating expenses reporting in the statement of
operations excluding interest expense, management fees, incentive
fees, organization cost, amortization of deferred offering costs,
and Contractual Issuer Expenses as a percentage of net assets.
Payments under the Expense Support Agreement will be eligible for
reimbursement for three years from the date incurred.

 

OFS
Advisor voluntarily agreed to provide expense support for operating
expenses, excluding organization and operating expenses, which are
separately supported under the Investment Advisory Agreement,
incurred from inception through September 30, 2016, and to only
seek reimbursement for such voluntary expense support in accordance
with the Expense Support Agreement as if such expense support had
been required by the Expense Support Agreement in connection with a
distribution at an annualized rate of 7.0% per share.

support provided under the Expense Support Agreement as of
September 30, 2016 , is summarized below.

Operations

 

Forward-Looking
Statements

 

This
quarterly report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements
that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. These
forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but rather are
based on current expectations, estimates and projections about us,
our prospective portfolio investments, our industry, our beliefs,
and our assumptions. Words such as “anticipates,”
“expects,” “intends,” “plans,”
“believes,” “seeks,”
“estimates,” “would,” “should,”
“targets,” “projects,” and variations of
these words and similar expressions are intended to identify
forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of
future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and
other factors, some of which are beyond our control and difficult
to predict and could cause actual results to differ materially from
those expressed or forecasted in the forward-looking statements,
including without limitation:

 




 



 





•



our lack
of long-term and extensive experience operating a BDC or
maintaining our status as a RIC under the Code;





 



 


 





•



our
dependence on key personnel;


 





 



 


 





•



our
ability to maintain or develop referral relationships;


 





 



 





•



the
ability of OFS Advisor, to identify, invest in and monitor
companies that meet our investment criteria;





 



 





•



actual and
potential conflicts of interest with OFS Advisor and other
affiliates of OFSAM, which is the holding company of OFS Advisor
and OFS Services;





 



 


 





•



constraint
on investment due to access to material nonpublic
information;


 





 



 


 





•



restrictions
on our ability to enter into transactions with our
affiliates;


 





 



 


 





•



the use of
borrowed money to finance a portion of our investments;


 





 



 


 





•



competition
for investment opportunities;


 














 

13


  


 




 



 


 





•



our
ability to qualify and maintain our qualification as a RIC and as a
BDC;


 





 



 


 





•



our
ability to raise capital as a BDC;


 





 



 


 





•



the
timing, form and amount of any distributions from our portfolio
companies;


 





 



 





•



the impact
of a protracted decline in the liquidity of credit markets on our
business;





 



 


 





•



the
general economy and its impact on the industries in which we
invest;


 





 



 


 





•



uncertain
valuations of our portfolio investments; and


 





 



 


 





•



the effect
of new or modified laws or regulations governing our
operations.


 














 

Although
we believe that the assumptions on which these forward-looking
statements are based are reasonable, any of those assumptions could
prove to be inaccurate, and as a result, the forward-looking
statements based on those assumptions also could be inaccurate. In
light of these and other uncertainties, the inclusion of a
projection or forward-looking statement in this quarterly report on
Form 10-Q should not be regarded as a representation by us that our
plans and objectives will be achieved. These risks and
uncertainties include, among others, those described or identified
in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our registration
statement on Form 10. You should not place undue reliance on these
forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this
quarterly report on Form 10-Q.

 

We have
based the forward-looking statements on information available to us
on the date of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Except as
required by the federal securities laws, we undertake no obligation
to revise or update any forward-looking statements, whether as a
result of new information, future events or otherwise. You are
advised to consult any additional disclosures that we may make
directly to you or through reports that we may file with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) in the
future, including annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on
Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. The forward-looking
statements and projections contained in this quarterly report on
Form 10-Q are excluded from the safe harbor protection provided by
Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

The
following should be read in conjunction with our financial
statements and the related notes thereto contained elsewhere in
this quarterly report on Form 10-Q.

	In particular, the relief requested in this application (the
	“

	Application

	”) would permit one or more Regulated Funds


	2


	and/or one or more Affiliated Funds


	3


	to participate in the same investment opportunities through a proposed co-investment program (the “

	Co-Investment Program

	”)
	where such participation would otherwise be prohibited under Section 57(a)(4) and Rule 17d–1 by (a) co-investing
	with each other in securities issued by issuers in private placement transactions in which an Adviser negotiates terms in addition
	to price (“

	Private Placement Securities

	”);

	and (b) making additional investments in securities of such issuers, including through the exercise of warrants, conversion

	OFS BDC has formed, and any of the Regulated Funds may, from
	time to time, form a special purpose subsidiary (a “

	Wholly-Owned Investment Sub

	”) (i) that is wholly-owned
	by a Regulated Fund (with the Regulated Fund at all times holding, beneficially and of record, 100% of the voting and economic
	interests); (ii) whose sole business purpose is to hold one or more investments on behalf of the Regulated Fund (and, in the
	case of an SBIC Subsidiary,


	6


	maintain
	a license under the SBA Act and issue debentures guaranteed by the SBA); (iii) with respect to which the Regulated Fund’s
	Board has the sole authority to make all determinations with respect to the entity’s participation under the conditions to
	this Application; and (iv) that would be an investment company but for Section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the 1940
	Act. All subsidiaries of the Regulated Funds participating in Co-Investment Transactions will be Wholly-Owned Investment Subs and
	will have Objectives and Strategies (as defined below) that are either the same as, or a subset of, the Regulated Fund’s
	Objectives and Strategies.


	 





	2

	to be regulated as a BDC (as defined below), (b) whose investment adviser is an Adviser, and (c) that intends to participate
	in the Co-Investment Program. The term “

	Adviser

	” means (a) OFS Adviser and (b) any future investment
	adviser that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with OFS Adviser and is registered as an investment adviser
	under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the “

	Advisers Act

	”).


	 




	3


	“

	Affiliated Fund

	” means the Existing Affiliated Funds and any Future Affiliated Fund. “

	Future Affiliated
	Fund

	” means any entity (a) whose investment adviser is an Adviser, (b) that would be an investment company
	but for Section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the 1940 Act, and (c) that intends to participate in the Co-Investment Program.


	 




	4


	The term “private placement transactions” means transactions in which the offer and sale of securities by the issuer
	are exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “

	1933 Act

	”).


	 




	5


	No Non-Interested Director (as defined below) of a Regulated Fund will have a financial interest in any Co-Investment Transaction,

	II.

	Background



	 



	OFS BDC



	 


	OFS BDC is a Delaware corporation organized as a closed-end
	management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a business development company (“

	BDC

	”) under
	Section 54(a) of the 1940 Act.


	8


	 On
	November 7, 2012, OFS Capital, LLC converted into a Delaware corporation, OFS BDC, and the outstanding limited liability company
	interest in OFS Capital, LLC was converted into 2,912,024 shares of common stock in OFS BDC. As of September 30, 2015, OFS BDC
	had net assets of approximately $140.1 million. OFS BDC’s Objectives and Strategies


	9


	 are
	to generate both current income and capital appreciation primarily through debt investments and, to a lesser extent, equity investments.
	OFS BDC’s investment strategy, which includes SBIC I, focuses primarily on investments in middle-market companies in the
	United States, including senior secured loans, which includes first-lien, second-lien and unitranche loans as well as subordinated
	loans and, to a lesser extent, warrants and other minority equity securities.


	 


	The board of directors of OFS BDC (the “

	OFS BDC Board

	”)
	is comprised of five directors, three of whom are not “interested persons,” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(19)
	of the 1940 Act (the “

	Non-Interested Directors

	”). The boards of directors of Hancock BDC (the “

	Hancock
	BDC Board

	”), Hancock BDC II (the “

	Hancock BDC II Board

	”), and any Future Regulated Fund (together
	with the OFS BDC Board, the “

	Boards

	” and each a “

	Board,

	” as applicable) is comprised of no
	fewer than three directors, a majority of whom are Non-Interested Directors.  The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee
	of each Board selects and nominates any additional Non-Interested Directors who may be selected to serve on a Board.


	 


	In addition, for income tax purposes, OFS BDC, other than any
	tax blocker entity it may form, has elected to be treated as a regulated investment company (“

	RIC

	”) under Subchapter
	M of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “

	Code

	”).

	Section 2(a)(48) defines a BDC to be any closed-end investment company that operates for the purpose of making investments
	in securities described in Section 55(a)(1) through 55(a)(3) of the 1940 Act and makes available significant managerial
	assistance with respect to the issuers of such securities.

	Hancock BDC



	 


	Hancock BDC was organized as a corporation under the General
	Corporate Laws of the State of Maryland on December 8, 2015 for the purpose of operating as an externally-managed, non-diversified,
	closed-end management investment company which will elect to be regulated as a BDC under Section 2(a)(48)  of the 1940
	Act. Structured as a private BDC, Hancock BDC is offering shares of its common stock on a best efforts, continuous basis.
	Hancock BDC’s Objectives and Strategies are to generate current income and, to a lesser extent, capital appreciation
	primarily through debt investments and, to a lesser extent, equity investments. Hancock BDC’s investment strategy focuses
	primarily on investments in middle-market companies in the United States, including senior secured loans, which includes first-lien,
	second-lien and unitranche loans as well as subordinated loans and, to a lesser extent, warrants and other minority equity securities.


	 


	The Hancock BDC Board is comprised of three directors, two of
	whom are Non-Interested Directors of Hancock BDC. 


	 


	Hancock BDC intends to make an election to be treated for tax
	purposes as a RIC under the Code and intends to continue to make such election in the future.


	 



	Hancock BDC II




	 



	Hancock BDC II was organized as a corporation under the General
	Corporate Laws of the State of Maryland on December 8, 2015 for the purpose of operating as an externally-managed, non-diversified,
	closed-end management investment company which will elect to be regulated as a BDC under Section 2(a)(48)  of the 1940
	Act.  Hancock BDC II is structured as a non-traded BDC. Hancock BDC II’s Objectives and Strategies are to
	generate current income and, to a lesser extent, capital appreciation primarily through debt investments and, to a lesser extent,
	equity investments. Hancock BDC II’s investment strategy focuses primarily on investments in middle-market companies in the
	United States, including senior secured loans, which includes first-lien, second-lien and unitranche loans as well as subordinated
	loans and, to a lesser extent, warrants and other minority equity securities.


	 


	The Hancock BDC II Board will be comprised of three directors,
	two of whom will be Non-Interested Directors of Hancock Park. 


	 


	Hancock BDC II intends to make an election to be treated for
	tax purposes as a RIC under the Code and intends to continue to make such election in the future.



	 




	OFS Adviser



	 


	OFS Adviser is a Delaware limited liability company and an investment
	adviser registered with the Commission under the Advisers Act. OFS Adviser serves as investment adviser to the Existing Regulated
	Funds and manages the respective portfolios of each Existing Regulated Fund in accordance with the Existing Regulated Fund’s
	Objectives and Strategies.  The investment professionals of OFS Adviser are responsible for determining the composition of
	each Existing Regulated Fund’s portfolio, the nature and timing of the changes to the portfolio






	 



	5



	 







	 




	and the manner of implementing such changes; assisting each
	Existing Regulated Fund in determining what securities it should purchase, retain or sell; identifying, evaluating, and negotiating
	the structure of the investments that each Existing Regulated Fund makes (including performing due diligence on prospective portfolio
	companies); and executing, closing, servicing and monitoring the investments that each Existing Regulated Fund makes. OFS Adviser
	is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Orchard First Source Asset Management, LLC.


	 


	OFS Adviser’s investment committee for each Existing Regulated
	Fund, which is comprised of Richard Ressler (Chairman), Jeffrey Cerny, Peter Fidler, Mark Hauser, Bilal Rashid, and Peter Rothschild,
	(the “

	Regulated Fund’s Investment Committee

	”) is responsible for overall asset allocation decisions, as
	well as approval of all of investments made directly by each Existing Regulated Fund.


	10


	OFS Adviser has a separate investment committee for the Existing Affiliated Funds.


	 



	Existing SBIC Subsidiary




	 



	OFS BDC’s investment strategy includes the Existing SBIC
	Subsidiary, which is a Wholly-Owned Investment Sub of OFS BDC. The Existing SBIC Subsidiary received an SBIC license from the SBA
	in May 2012. The SBIC license allows the Existing SBIC Subsidiary to receive SBA-guaranteed debenture funding, subject to the issuance
	of a leverage commitment by the SBA and other customary procedures. SBA leverage funding is subject to the Existing SBIC Subsidiary’s
	payment of certain fees to the SBA, and the ability of the Existing SBIC Fund to draw on the leverage commitment is subject to
	its compliance with SBA regulations and policies, including an audit by the SBA.


	 


	On November 26, 2013, OFS BDC obtained an exemptive order from
	the SEC to permit OFS BDC to exclude the debt of the Existing SBIC Subsidiary guaranteed by the SBA from the definition of senior
	securities in the statutory 200% asset coverage ratio under the 1940 Act, allowing for greater capital deployment.


	 



	Existing Affiliated Funds




	 



	Each of the Existing Affiliated Funds is a Cayman “collateralized
	loan obligation” (“

	CLO

	”) fund for which OFS Adviser acts as collateral manager pursuant to a collateral
	management agreement between the relevant Existing Affiliated Fund and OFS Adviser. The Existing Affiliated Funds’ portfolios
	are comprised predominantly of senior secured “club” and syndicated loans made to U.S. companies (both public and private).
	Each Existing Affiliated Fund is subject to restrictions on investing in certain companies (or other issuers) and types of securities
	under the terms of a note indenture (individually, a “

	CLO Indenture

	”, and, collectively, the “

	CLO Indentures

	”).
	The loans and synthetic securities in which the Existing Affiliated Funds invest must meet stringent criteria set forth in the
	CLO Indentures, including, but not limited to (i) a requirement of periodic payments of interest in cash, (ii) a minimum Moody’s
	Rating, and (iii) numerous other asset and portfolio criteria.


	 





	10


	Investment decisions for the Existing SBIC Subsidiary are initially made by an investment committee comprised of Peter Fidler,
	Mark Hauser, Bilal Rashid, and Peter Rothschild, and are subsequently reviewed by the Regulated Fund’s Investment Committee.






	 



	6



	 







	 






	Each of the Affiliated Funds is, or will be, a separate and
	distinct legal entity. In reliance on the exclusion from the definition of “investment company” provided by Section
	3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the 1940 Act,


	none of the Affiliated Funds are, or will be, registered under the 1940 Act.


	 


	 


	III.

	Order Requested



	 


	The Applicants request the Order of the Commission under Sections 17(d)
	and 57(i) under the 1940 Act, and Rule 17d-l under the 1940 Act to permit, subject to the terms and conditions
	set forth below in this Application (the “

	Conditions

	”), one or more Regulated Funds to be able to participate
	in Co-Investment Transactions with one or more other Regulated Funds and/or one or more Affiliated Funds.


	 


	The Regulated Funds and the Affiliated Funds seek relief to
	invest in Co-Investment Transactions because such Co-Investment Transactions would otherwise be prohibited by Sections 17(d)
	and 57(a)(4) of the 1940 Act and Rule 17d-l under the 1940 Act. This Application seeks relief in order to (i) enable
	the Regulated Funds and the Affiliated Funds to avoid the practical difficulties of trying to structure, negotiate and persuade
	counterparties to enter into transactions while awaiting the granting of the relief requested in individual applications with respect
	to each Co-Investment Transaction that arises in the future, and (ii) enable the Regulated Funds and the Affiliated Funds
	to avoid the significant legal and other expenses that would be incurred in preparing such individual applications.


	 


	A. Section 17(d) and Section 57(a)(4)


	 


	Section 17(d) of the 1940 Act generally prohibits
	an affiliated person (as defined in Section 2(a)(3) of the 1940 Act), or an affiliated person of such affiliated person,
	of a registered closed-end investment company acting as principal, from effecting any transaction in which the registered closed-end
	investment company is a joint or a joint and several participant, in contravention of such rules as the Commission may prescribe
	for the purpose of limiting or preventing participation by the registered closed-end investment company on a basis different from
	or less advantageous than that of such other participant. Rule 17d–1 under the 1940 Act generally prohibits participation
	by a registered investment company and an affiliated person (as defined in Section 2(a)(3) of the 1940 Act) or principal
	underwriter for that investment company, or an affiliated person of such affiliated person or principal underwriter, in any “joint
	enterprise or other joint arrangement or profit-sharing plan,” as defined in the rule, without prior approval by the Commission
	by order upon application.


	 


	Similarly, with regard to BDCs, Section 57(a)(4) of the 1940
	Act prohibits certain persons specified in Section 57(b) of the 1940 Act from participating in a joint transaction with
	a BDC or a company controlled by a BDC in contravention of rules as prescribed by the Commission. In particular Section 57(a)(4)
	of the 1940 Act applies to:


	 







	·



	Any director, officer, employee, or member of an advisory board of a BDC, or any person (other than the BDC itself) who is
	an affiliated person of the foregoing pursuant to Section 2(a)(3)(C) of the 1940 Act; or




	 


	 


	 









	·



	Any investment adviser or promoter of, general partner in, principal underwriter for, or person directly or indirectly either
	controlling, controlled by, or under common control with, a BDC,


	11


	or any person who is an affiliated person of any of the foregoing within the meaning of Section 2(a)(3)(C) or (D) of
	the 1940 Act.




	 





	11


	Excluded from this category are the BDC itself and any person who, if it were not directly or indirectly controlled by the BDC,
	would not otherwise be under common control with the BDC.






	 



	7



	 







	 




	Section 2(a)(3)(C) of the 1940 Act defines an “affiliated
	person” of another person to include any person directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common control
	with, such other person. Section 2(a)(9) of the 1940 Act defines “control” as the power to exercise a controlling
	influence over the management or policies of a company, unless such power is solely the result of an official position with that
	company. Under Section 2(a)(9) of the 1940 Act a person who beneficially owns, either directly or through one or more
	controlled companies, more than 25% of the voting securities of a company is presumed to control such company. The Commission
	and its staff have indicated on a number of occasions their belief that an investment adviser controls the fund that it advises,
	absent compelling evidence to the contrary.


	12




	 


	OFS Adviser is the investment adviser to the Existing Regulated
	Funds, and an Adviser will be the investment adviser to each of the Future Regulated Funds. OFS Adviser may be deemed to control
	the Existing Regulated Funds, and any other Adviser will be controlling, controlled by, or under common control with OFS Adviser.
	In addition, an Adviser will be the investment adviser to each Affiliated Fund. The Regulated Funds may be deemed to be under common
	control, and thus affiliated persons of each other under Section 2(a)(3)(C) of the 1940 Act. In addition, the Affiliated
	Funds may be deemed to be under common control with the Regulated Funds, and thus affiliated persons of each Regulated Fund under
	Section 2(a)(3)(C) of the 1940 Act. As a result, these relationships might cause a Regulated Fund and one or more other
	Regulated Funds and/or one or more Affiliated Funds participating in Co-Investment Transactions to be subject to Sections 17(d)
	or 57(a)(4) of the 1940 Act, and thus subject to the provisions of Rule 17d-l of the 1940 Act.


	 


	B. Rule 17d–1


	 


	Rule 17d–l under the 1940 Act generally prohibits
	participation by a registered investment company and an affiliated person (as defined in Section 2(a)(3) of the 1940
	Act) or principal underwriter for that investment company, or an affiliated person of such affiliated person or principal underwriter,
	in any “joint enterprise or other joint arrangement or profit-sharing plan,” as defined in the rule, without prior
	approval by the Commission by order upon application.


	 


	Rule 17d–1 was promulgated by the Commission pursuant
	to Section 17(d) of the 1940 Act and made applicable to BDCs by Section 57(i) of the 1940 Act. Section 57(i)
	of the 1940 Act provides that, until the Commission prescribes rules under Section 57(a)(4) of the 1940 Act, the
	Commission’s rules under Section 17(d) of the 1940 Act applicable to registered closed-end investment companies
	will be deemed to apply. Because the Commission has not adopted any rules under Section 57(a)(4) of the 1940 Act, Rule 17d–I
	under the 1940 Act applies.

	See, e.g.,

	In re Investment Company Mergers

	, SEC Rel. No. IC–25259 (Nov. 8, 2001);

	In re Steadman Security Corp

	.,
	46 S.E.C. 896, 920 n.81 (1977) (“[T]he investment adviser almost always controls the fund. Only in the very rare case
	where the adviser’s role is simply that of advising others who may or may not elect to be guided by his advice…can
	the adviser realistically be deemed not in control.”).

	Applicants seek relief pursuant to Rule 17d-l under the 1940
	Act, which permits the Commission to authorize joint transactions upon application. In passing upon applications filed pursuant
	to Rule I7d–l under the 1940 Act, the Commission is directed by Rule 17d–1(b) under the 1940 Act
	to consider whether the participation of a registered investment company or controlled company thereof in the joint enterprise
	or joint arrangement under scrutiny is consistent with provisions, policies and purposes of the 1940 Act and the extent to
	which such participation is on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other participants.


	 


	The Commission has stated that Section 17(d) of the 1940
	Act, upon which Rule 17d–1 under the 1940 Act is based, and upon which Section 57(a)(4) of the 1940 Act
	was modeled, was designed to protect investment companies from self-dealing and overreaching by insiders. The Commission has also
	taken notice that there may be transactions subject to these prohibitions that do not present the dangers of overreaching. See

	Protecting Investors: A Half-Century of Investment Company Regulation

	, 1504 Fed. Sec. L. Rep., Extra Edition (May 29,
	1992) at 488

	et seq

	. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has enunciated a like rationale for the purpose behind
	Section 17(d): “The objective of [Section] 17(d) . . . is to prevent . . . injuring the interest of stockholders of
	registered investment companies by causing the company to participate on a basis different from or less advantageous than that
	of such other participants.”

	Securities and Exchange Commission v. Talley Industries. Inc.

	, 399 F.2d 396, 405
	(2d Cir. 1968),

	cert. denied

	393 U.S. 1015 (1969). Furthermore, Congress acknowledged that the protective system established
	by the enactment of Section 57 is “similar to that applicable to registered investment companies under section 17
	of the 1940 Act, and rules thereunder, but is modified to address concerns relating to unique characteristics presented by
	business development companies.” H.Rep. No. 96-1341, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 45 (1980) 

	reprinted in

	 1980
	U.S.C.C.A.N. 4827.


	 


	Applicants believe that the terms and conditions of this Application
	would ensure that the conflicts of interest that Section 17(d) and Section 57(a)(4) of the 1940 Act were designed
	to prevent would be addressed and the standards for an order under Rule 17d–1 under the 1940 Act are met.


	 


	C. Protection Provided by the Proposed Conditions


	 


	Applicants believe that the proposed conditions, as discussed
	more fully in Section III.D. of this Application (the “

	Conditions

	”), will ensure the protection of shareholders
	of the Regulated Funds and compliance with the purposes and policies of the 1940 Act with respect to the Co-Investment Transactions.
	In particular, the Conditions, as outlined below, would ensure that each Regulated Fund would only invest in investments that are
	appropriate to the interests of shareholders and the investment needs and abilities of that Regulated Fund. In addition, each Regulated
	Fund would be able to invest on equal footing with each other Regulated Fund and the Affiliated Funds, including identical terms,
	conditions, price, class of securities purchased, settlement date, and registration rights. Each Regulated Fund would have the
	ability to engage in Follow-On Investments in a fair manner consistent with the protections of the other conditions. Each Regulated
	Fund would have the ability to participate on a proportionate basis, at the same price and on the same terms and conditions in
	any sale of a security purchased in a Co-Investment Transaction. Fees and expenses of Co-Investment Transactions would be borne
	by the applicable Adviser, or shared pro-rata among the Regulated Funds and Affiliated Funds who participate in the Co-Investment
	Transactions. The conditions would also prevent a Regulated






	 



	9



	 







	 




	Fund from investing in any current investments of an affiliated
	person, which eliminates the possibility of a Regulated Fund from being forced to invest in a manner that would benefit an affiliated
	person’s existing investment. Also, sufficient records of the transactions would be maintained to permit the examination
	staff of the Commission to monitor compliance with the terms of the requested order.


	 


	The Conditions impose a variety of duties on the Advisers with
	respect to Co-Investment Transactions and Potential Co-Investment Transactions by the Regulated Funds. These duties include determinations
	regarding investment appropriateness, the appropriate level of investment, and the provision of information to the Board of any
	Regulated Fund. In addition, when considering Potential Co-Investment Transactions for any Regulated Fund, the applicable Adviser
	will consider only the Objectives and Strategies, investment policies, investment positions, Available Capital (defined below),
	and other pertinent factors applicable to that Regulated Fund. Each Adviser, as applicable, undertakes to perform these duties
	consistently for each Regulated Fund, as applicable, regardless of which of them serves as investment adviser to these entities.
	The participation of a Regulated Fund in a Potential Co-Investment Transaction may only be approved by a required majority, as
	defined in Section 57(o) (a “

	Required Majority

	”), of the directors of the Board eligible to vote on that
	Co-Investment Transaction under Section 57(o) (the “

	Eligible Directors

	”).


	13






	 




	The amount of each Regulated Fund’s capital available
	for investment (“

	Available Capital

	”) will be determined based on the amount of cash on hand, existing commitments
	and reserves, if any, the targeted leverage level, targeted asset mix and other investment policies and restrictions set from time
	to time by the Board of the applicable Regulated Fund or imposed by applicable laws, rules, regulations or interpretations. Likewise,
	an Affiliated Fund’s capital available for investment will be determined based on the amount of cash on hand, existing commitments
	and reserves, if any, the targeted leverage level, targeted asset mix and other investment policies and restrictions set by the
	Affiliated Fund’s directors, general partners or adviser or imposed by applicable laws, rules, regulations or interpretations.


	 


	If the Advisers, the principals of any of the Advisers (the
	“

	Principals

	”), or any person controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Advisers or the Principals,
	and the Affiliated Funds (collectively, the “

	Holders

	”) own in the aggregate more than 25 percent of the outstanding
	voting shares of a Regulated Fund (the “

	Shares

	”), then the Holders will vote such Shares as directed by an independent
	third party (such as the trustee of a voting trust or a proxy adviser) when voting on (1) the election of directors; (2) the removal
	of one or more directors; or (3) any matters requiring approval by the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities,
	as defined in section 2(a)(42) of the 1940 Act.


	 


	Applicants believe that this condition will ensure that the
	Non-Interested Directors will act independently in evaluating the Co-Investment Program, because the ability of the Advisers or
	the Principals to influence the Non-Interested Directors by a suggestion, explicit or implied, that the Non-Interested Directors
	can be removed will be limited significantly. The Non-Interested Directors shall evaluate and approve any such voting trust or
	proxy adviser, taking into account its qualifications, reputation for independence, cost to the
	shareholders, and other factors that they deem relevant.


	 





	13


	In the case of a Regulated Fund that is a registered closed-end fund, the Board members that make up the Required Majority will
	be determined as if the Regulated Fund were a BDC subject to Section 57(o).






	 



	10



	 







	 






	In sum, the Applicants believe that the proposed conditions
	would ensure that each Regulated Fund that participates in a Co-Investment Transaction does not participate on a basis different
	from, or less advantageous than, that of such other participants. As a result, the Applicants believe that the participation of
	the Regulated Funds in Co-Investment Transactions done in accordance with the Conditions would be consistent with the provisions,
	policies, and purposes of the 1940 Act, and would be done in a manner that was not different from, or less advantageous than,
	the other participants.


	 


	With respect to each Wholly-Owned Investment Sub, such a subsidiary
	would be prohibited from investing in a Co-Investment Transaction with an Affiliated Fund or Regulated Fund because it would be
	a company controlled by its parent Regulated Fund for purposes of Section 57(a)(4) of the 1940 Act and Rule 17d-l
	under the 1940 Act. Applicants request that each Wholly-Owned Investment Sub be permitted to participate in Co-Investment
	Transactions in lieu of its parent Regulated Fund and that the Wholly-Owned Investment Sub’s participation in any such transaction
	be treated, for purposes of the Order, as though the parent Regulated Fund were participating directly. Applicants represent that
	this treatment is justified because a Wholly-Owned Investment Sub would have no purpose other than serving as a holding vehicle
	for the Regulated Fund’s investments and, therefore, no conflicts of interest could arise between the Regulated Fund and
	the Wholly-Owned Investment Sub. The Regulated Fund’s Board would make all relevant determinations under the conditions with
	regard to a Wholly-Owned Investment Sub’s participation in a Co-Investment Transaction, and the Regulated Fund’s Board
	would be informed of, and take into consideration, any proposed use of a Wholly-Owned Investment Sub in the Regulated Fund’s
	place. If the Regulated Fund proposes to participate in the same Co-Investment Transaction with any of its Wholly-Owned Investment
	Subs, the Board will also be informed of, and take into consideration, the relative participation of the Regulated Fund and the
	Wholly-Owned Investment Sub.


	 


	D. Proposed Conditions


	 


	Applicants agree that any Order granting the requested relief
	shall be subject to the following Conditions:


	 


	1. Each time an Adviser considers a Potential Co-Investment
	Transaction for an Affiliated Fund or another Regulated Fund that falls within a Regulated Fund’s then-current Objectives
	and Strategies, the Regulated Fund’s Adviser will make an independent determination of the appropriateness of the investment
	for such Regulated Fund in light of the Regulated Fund’s then-current circumstances.


	 


	2. (a) If the Adviser deems a Regulated Fund’s participation
	in any Potential Co-Investment Transaction to be appropriate for the Regulated Fund, it will then determine an appropriate level
	of investment for the Regulated Fund.


	 


	(b) If the aggregate amount recommended by the applicable Adviser
	to be invested by the applicable Regulated Fund in the Potential Co-Investment Transaction, together with the amount proposed to
	be invested by the other participating Regulated Funds and Affiliated Funds, collectively, in the same transaction, exceeds the
	amount of the investment opportunity, the






	 



	11



	 







	 




	investment opportunity will be allocated among them pro rata
	based on each participant’s Available Capital, up to the amount proposed to be invested by each. The applicable Adviser will
	provide the Eligible Directors of each participating Regulated Fund with information concerning each participating party’s
	Available Capital to assist the Eligible Directors with their review of the Regulated Fund’s investments for compliance with
	these allocation procedures.


	 


	(c) After making the determinations required in conditions 1
	and 2(a), the applicable Adviser will distribute written information concerning the Potential Co-Investment Transaction (including
	the amount proposed to be invested by each participating Regulated Fund and Affiliated Fund) to the Eligible Directors of each
	participating Regulated Fund for their consideration. A Regulated Fund will co-invest with one or more other Regulated Funds and/or
	one or more Affiliated Funds only if, prior to the Regulated Fund’s participation in the Potential Co-Investment Transaction,
	a Required Majority concludes that:


	 


	(i) the terms of the Potential Co-Investment Transaction, including
	the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to the Regulated Fund and its shareholders and do not involve overreaching
	in respect of the Regulated Fund or its shareholders on the part of any person concerned;


	 


	(ii) the Potential Co-Investment Transaction is consistent with:


	 


	(A) the interests of the shareholders of the Regulated Fund;
	and


	 


	(B) the Regulated Fund’s then-current Objectives and Strategies;


	 


	(iii) the investment by any other Regulated Funds or Affiliated
	Funds would not disadvantage the Regulated Fund, and participation by the Regulated Fund would not be on a basis different from
	or less advantageous than that of other Regulated Funds or Affiliated Funds;

	provided that

	, if any other Regulated Fund
	or Affiliated Fund, but not the Regulated Fund itself, gains the right to nominate a director for election to a portfolio company’s
	board of directors or the right to have a board observer or any similar right to participate in the governance or management of
	the portfolio company, such event shall not be interpreted to prohibit the Required Majority from reaching the conclusions required
	by this condition (2)(c)(iii), if:


	 


	(A) the Eligible Directors will have the right to ratify the
	selection of such director or board observer, if any;


	 


	(B) the applicable Adviser agrees to, and does, provide periodic
	reports to the Regulated Fund’s Board with respect to the actions of such director or the information received by such board
	observer or obtained through the exercise of any similar right to participate in the governance or management of the portfolio
	company; and


	 


	(C) any fees or other compensation that any Affiliated Fund
	or any Regulated Fund or any affiliated person of any Affiliated Fund or any Regulated Fund receives in connection with the right
	of the Affiliated Fund or a Regulated Fund to nominate a director or appoint a board observer or otherwise to participate in the
	governance or management of the portfolio company will be shared proportionately among the participating Affiliated Funds (who
	each may, in turn, share its portion with its affiliated persons) and the participating Regulated Funds in accordance with the
	amount of each party’s investment; and


	 


	(iv) the proposed investment by the Regulated Fund will not
	benefit the Advisers, the Affiliated Funds or the other Regulated Funds or any affiliated person of any of them (other than the
	parties






	 



	12



	 







	 




	to the Co-Investment Transaction), except (A) to the extent
	permitted by condition 13, (B) to the extent permitted by Section 17(e) or 57(k) of the 1940 Act, as applicable,
	(C) indirectly, as a result of an interest in the securities issued by one of the parties to the Co-Investment Transaction,
	or (D) in the case of fees or other compensation described in condition 2(c)(iii)(C).


	 


	3. Each Regulated Fund has the right to decline to participate
	in any Potential Co-Investment Transaction or to invest less than the amount proposed.


	 


	4. The applicable Adviser will present to the Board of each
	Regulated Fund, on a quarterly basis, a record of all investments in Potential Co-Investment Transactions made by any of the other
	Regulated Funds or Affiliated Funds during the preceding quarter that fell within the Regulated Fund’s then-current Objectives
	and Strategies that were not made available to the Regulated Fund, and an explanation of why the investment opportunities were
	not offered to the Regulated Fund. All information presented to the Board pursuant to this condition will be kept for the life
	of the Regulated Fund and at least two years thereafter, and will be subject to examination by the Commission and its staff.


	 


	5. Except for Follow-On Investments made in accordance with
	condition 8,


	14


	a Regulated Fund
	will not invest in reliance on the Order in any issuer in which another Regulated Fund, Affiliated Fund, or any affiliated person
	of another Regulated Fund or Affiliated Fund is an existing investor.


	 


	6. A Regulated Fund will not participate in any Potential Co-Investment
	Transaction unless the terms, conditions, price, class of securities to be purchased, settlement date, and registration rights
	will be the same for each participating Regulated Fund and Affiliated Fund. The grant to an Affiliated Fund or another Regulated
	Fund, but not the Regulated Fund, of the right to nominate a director for election to a portfolio company’s board of directors,
	the right to have an observer on the board of directors or similar rights to participate in the governance or management of the
	portfolio company will not be interpreted so as to violate this condition 6, if conditions 2(c)(iii)(A), (B) and
	(C) are met.


	 


	7. (a) If any Affiliated Fund or any Regulated Fund elects to
	sell, exchange or otherwise dispose of an interest in a security that was acquired in a Co-Investment Transaction, the applicable
	Advisers will:


	 


	(i)
	notify each Regulated Fund that participated in the Co-Investment Transaction of the proposed disposition at the earliest practical
	time; and


	 


	(ii) formulate a recommendation as to participation by each
	Regulated Fund in the disposition.


	 


	(b) Each Regulated Fund will have the right to participate in
	such disposition on a proportionate basis, at the same price and on the same terms and conditions as those applicable to the participating
	Affiliated Funds and Regulated Funds.


	 


	(c) A Regulated Fund may participate in such disposition without
	obtaining prior approval of the Required Majority if: (i) the proposed participation of each Regulated Fund and each Affiliated
	Fund in such disposition is proportionate to its outstanding investments in the issuer immediately preceding the disposition; (ii) the
	Board of the Regulated Fund has approved as being in the best interests of the Regulated Fund the ability to participate in
	such dispositions on a pro rata basis (as described in greater detail in this application); and


	 





	14


	This exception applies only to Follow-On Investments by a Regulated Fund in issuers in which the Regulated Fund already holds investments.






	 



	13



	 







	 




	(iii) the Board of the Regulated
	Fund is provided on a quarterly basis with a list of all dispositions made in accordance with this condition. In all other cases,
	the Adviser will provide its written recommendation as to the Regulated Fund’s participation to the Eligible Directors, and
	the Regulated Fund will participate in such disposition solely to the extent that a Required Majority determines that it is in
	the Regulated Fund’s best interests.


	 


	(d) Each Affiliated Fund and each Regulated Fund will bear its
	own expenses in connection with any such disposition.


	 


	8. (a) If any Affiliated Fund or any Regulated Fund desires
	to make a Follow-On Investment in a portfolio company whose securities were acquired in a Co-Investment Transaction, the applicable
	Advisers will:


	 


	(i) notify each Regulated Fund that participated in the Co-Investment
	Transaction of the proposed transaction at the earliest practical time; and


	 


	(ii) formulate a recommendation as to the proposed participation,
	including the amount of the proposed Follow-On Investment, by each Regulated Fund.


	 


	(b) A Regulated Fund may participate in such Follow-On Investment
	without obtaining prior approval of the Required Majority if: (i) the proposed participation of each Regulated Fund and each
	Affiliated Fund in such investment is proportionate to its outstanding investments in the issuer immediately preceding the Follow-On
	Investment; and (ii) the Board of the Regulated Fund has approved as being in the best interests of the Regulated Fund the
	ability to participate in Follow-On Investments on a pro rata basis (as described in greater detail in this application). In all
	other cases, the Adviser will provide its written recommendation as to the Regulated Fund’s participation to the Eligible
	Directors, and the Regulated Fund will participate in such Follow-On Investment solely to the extent that a Required Majority determines
	that it is in the Regulated Fund’s best interests.


	 


	(c) If, with respect to any Follow-On Investment:


	 


	(i) the amount of the opportunity is not based on the Regulated
	Funds’ and the Affiliated Funds’ outstanding investments immediately preceding the Follow-On Investment; and


	 


	(ii) the aggregate amount recommended by the applicable Adviser
	to be invested by the applicable Regulated Fund in the Follow-On Investment, together with the amount proposed to be invested by
	the other participating Regulated Funds and Affiliated Funds, collectively, in the same transaction, exceeds the amount of the
	investment opportunity, then the investment opportunity will be allocated among them pro rata based on each participant’s
	Available Capital, up to the maximum amount proposed to be invested by each.


	 


	(d) The acquisition of Follow-On Investments as permitted by
	this condition will be considered a Co-Investment Transaction for all purposes and subject to the other conditions set forth in
	this application.


	 


	9. The Non-Interested Directors of each Regulated Fund will
	be provided quarterly for review all information concerning Potential Co-Investment Transactions and Co-Investment Transactions,
	including investments made by other Regulated Funds or Affiliated Funds that the Regulated Fund considered but declined to participate
	in, so that the Non-Interested Directors may






	 



	14



	 







	 




	determine whether all investments made during the preceding
	quarter, including those investments that the Regulated Fund considered but declined to participate in, comply with the conditions
	of the Order. In addition, the Non-Interested Directors will consider at least annually the continued appropriateness for the Regulated
	Fund of participating in new and existing Co-Investment Transactions.


	 


	10. Each Regulated Fund will maintain the records required by
	Section 57(f)(3) of the 1940 Act as if each of the Regulated Funds were a BDC and each of the investments permitted under
	these conditions were approved by the Required Majority under Section 57(f) of the 1940 Act.


	 


	11. No Non-Interested Director of a Regulated Fund will also
	be a director, general partner, managing member or principal, or otherwise an “affiliated person” (as defined in the 1940
	Act) of an Affiliated Fund.


	 


	12. The expenses, if any, associated with acquiring, holding
	or disposing of any securities acquired in a Co-Investment Transaction (including, without limitation, the expenses of the distribution
	of any such securities registered for sale under the 1933 Act) will, to the extent not payable by the Advisers under their
	respective investment advisory agreements with Affiliated Funds and the Regulated Funds, be shared by the Regulated Funds and the
	Affiliated Funds in proportion to the relative amounts of the securities held or to be acquired or disposed of, as the case may
	be.


	 


	13. Any transaction fee (including break-up or commitment fees
	but excluding broker’s fees contemplated Section 17(e) or 57(k) of the 1940 Act, as applicable), received
	in connection with a Co-Investment Transaction will be distributed to the participating Regulated Funds and Affiliated Funds on
	a pro rata basis based on the amounts they invested or committed, as the case may be, in such Co-Investment Transaction. If any
	transaction fee is to be held by an Adviser pending consummation of the transaction, the fee will be deposited into an account
	maintained  by such Adviser at a bank or banks having the qualifications prescribed in Section 26(a)(1) of the 1940
	Act, and the account will earn a competitive rate of interest that will also be divided pro rata among the participating Regulated
	Funds and Affiliated Funds based on the amounts they invest in such Co-Investment Transaction. None of the Affiliated Funds, the
	Advisers, the other Regulated Funds or any affiliated person of the Regulated Funds or Affiliated Funds will receive additional
	compensation or remuneration of any kind as a result of or in connection with a Co-Investment Transaction (other than (a) in
	the case of the Regulated Funds and the Affiliated Funds, the pro rata transaction fees described above and fees or other compensation
	described in condition 2(c)(iii)(C); and (b) in the case of an Adviser, investment advisory fees paid in accordance
	with the agreement between the Adviser and the Regulated Fund or Affiliated Fund.


	 


	14. If the Holders own in the aggregate more than 25% of the
	Shares of a Regulated Fund, then the Holders will vote such Shares as directed by an independent third party (such as the trustee
	of a voting trust or a proxy adviser) when voting on (1) the election of directors; (2) the removal of one or more directors; or
	(3) any matters requiring approval by the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities, as defined in section 2(a)(42)
	of the 1940 Act.






	 



	15



	 







	 




	IV.

	Statement in Support of Relief Requested



	 


	Applicants submit that allowing the Co-Investment Transactions
	described by this Application is justified on the basis of (i) the potential benefits to the Regulated Funds and the shareholders
	thereof and (ii) the protections found in the terms and conditions set forth in this Application.


	 


	A. Potential Benefits


	 


	In the absence of the relief sought hereby, in some circumstances
	the Regulated Funds would be limited in their ability to participate in attractive and appropriate investment opportunities. Section 17(d)
	and Section 57(a)(4) of the 1940 Act and Rule 17d–1 under the 1940 Act should not prevent BDCs and registered
	closed–end investment companies from making investments that are in the best interests of their shareholders.


	 


	In cases where the Advisers identify investment opportunities
	requiring larger capital commitments, they must seek the participation of other entities with similar investment styles. The ability
	to participate in Co-Investment Transactions that involve committing larger amounts of financing would enable each Regulated Fund
	to participate with one or more of the Affiliated Funds and the other Regulated Funds in larger financing commitments, which would,
	in turn, be expected to obtain discounted prices and increase income, expand investment opportunities and provide better access
	to due diligence information for the Regulated Funds. Indeed, each Regulated Fund’s inability to co-invest with one or more
	of the Affiliated Funds and the other Regulated Funds could potentially result in the loss of beneficial investment opportunities
	for such Regulated Fund and, in turn, adversely affect such Regulated Fund’s shareholders. For example, a Regulated Fund
	may lose investment opportunities if the Adviser cannot provide “one-stop” financing to a potential portfolio company.
	Portfolio companies may reject an offer of funding arranged by an Adviser due to a Regulated Fund’s inability to commit the
	full amount of financing required by the portfolio company in a timely manner (i.e., without the delay that typically would be
	associated with obtaining single-transaction exemptive relief from the Commission). The Regulated Fund Advisers expect that any
	portfolio company that is an appropriate investment for a Regulated Fund should also be an appropriate investment for one or more
	other Regulated Funds and/or one or more Affiliated Funds, with certain exceptions based on available capital or diversification.
	The Regulated Funds, however, will not be obligated to invest, or co-invest, when investment opportunities are referred to them.


	 


	Each Regulated Fund and its shareholders will benefit from the
	ability to participate in Co-Investment Transactions. The Board of each Regulated Fund, including the Non-Interested Directors,
	has (or will have prior to relying on the requested Order) determined that it is in the best interests of the Regulated Fund to
	participate in Co-Investment Transactions because, among other matters, (i) the Regulated Fund will be able to participate
	in a larger number and greater variety of transactions; (ii) the Regulated Fund will be able to participate in larger transactions;
	(iii) the Regulated Fund will be able to participate in all opportunities approved by a Required Majority or otherwise permissible
	under the Order rather than risk underperformance through rotational allocation of opportunities among the Regulated Funds; (iv) the
	Regulated Fund and any other Regulated Funds participating in the proposed investment will have greater bargaining power, more
	control over the investment and less need to bring in other external investors or structure investments to satisfy the different
	needs of external investors; (v) the Regulated Fund will be able to obtain greater attention and better deal flow from investment
	bankers and others who act as sources of investments; and (vi) the general terms and conditions






	 



	16



	 







	 




	of the proposed Order are fair to the Regulated Funds and their
	shareholders. The Board of each of the Existing Regulated Funds, including the Non-Interested Directors, also determined that it
	is in the best interests of the Existing Regulated Funds and their shareholders to obtain the Order at the earliest possible time
	and instructed the officers of the Existing Regulated Funds, the Advisers and counsel to use all appropriate efforts to accomplish
	such goal. For these reasons, the respective Boards of the Existing Regulated Funds have determined (or will have prior to relying
	on the requested Order) that it is proper and desirable for OFS BDC, Hancock BDC and Hancock BDC II to participate in Co-Investment
	Transactions with one or more other Regulated Funds and/or one or more Affiliated Funds.


	 


	B. Protective Representations and Conditions


	 


	The terms and conditions set forth in this application ensure
	that the proposed Co-Investment Transactions are consistent with the protection of each Regulated Fund’s shareholders and
	with the purposes intended by the policies and provisions of the 1940 Act. Specifically, the Conditions incorporate the following
	critical protections: (i) in each Co-Investment Transaction, all Regulated Funds and Affiliated Funds participating in the
	Co-Investment Transactions will invest at the same time for the same price and with the same terms, conditions, class, registration
	rights and any other rights, so that none of them receives terms more favorable than any other; (ii) a Required Majority of
	each Regulated Fund must approve various investment decisions with respect to such Regulated Fund in accordance with the Conditions;
	and (iii) the Regulated Funds are required to retain and maintain certain records.


	 


	Other than pro rata dispositions and Follow-On Investments as
	provided in conditions 7 and 8, and after making the determinations required in conditions 1 and 2(a), the
	Adviser will present each Potential Co-Investment Transaction and the proposed allocation to the Eligible Directors, and the Required
	Majority will approve each Co-Investment Transaction prior to any investment by the participating Regulated Fund. With respect
	to the pro rata dispositions and Follow-On Investments provided in conditions 7 and 8, a Regulated Fund may participate
	in a pro rata disposition or Follow-On Investment without obtaining prior approval of the Required Majority if, among other things:
	(i) the proposed participation of each Regulated Fund and Affiliated Fund in such disposition is proportionate to its outstanding
	investments in the issuer immediately preceding the disposition or Follow-On Investment, as the case may be; and (ii) the
	Board of the Regulated Fund has approved that Regulated Fund’s participation in pro rata dispositions and Follow-On Investments
	as being in the best interests of the Regulated Fund. If the Board does not so approve, any such disposition or Follow-On Investment
	will be submitted to the Regulated Fund’s Eligible Directors. The Board of any Regulated Fund may at any time rescind, suspend
	or qualify its approval of pro rata dispositions and Follow-On Investments with the result that all dispositions and/or Follow-On
	Investments must be submitted to the Eligible Directors.


	 


	The Applicants believe that participation by the Regulated Funds
	in pro rata dispositions and Follow-On Investments, as provided in conditions 7 and 8, is consistent with the provisions,
	policies and purposes of the 1940 Act and will not be made on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other
	participants. A formulaic approach, such as pro rata dispositions and Follow-On Investments, eliminates the discretionary ability
	to make allocation determinations, and in turn eliminates the possibility for overreaching and promotes fairness. The Applicants
	note that the Commission has adopted a similar pro rata approach in the context of






	 



	17



	 







	 




	Rule 23c-2 under the 1940 Act, which relates to the
	redemption by a closed-end investment company of less than all of a class of its securities, indicating the general fairness and
	lack of overreaching that such approach provides.


	 


	The foregoing analysis applies equally where a Wholly-Owned
	Investment Sub is involved in a Co-Investment Transaction as each Wholly-Owned Investment Sub will be treated as one company with
	its parent for purposes of this Application.
