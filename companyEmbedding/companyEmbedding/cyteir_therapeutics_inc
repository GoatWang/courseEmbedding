Cyteir Therapeutics, Inc. Key Developments

Cyteir Therapeutics, Inc. Announces Publication of Pre-Clinical in Vivo Data Demonstrating
Jun 1 17
Cyteir Therapeutics, Inc. announced the publication of pre-clinical in vivo data demonstrating that therapeutic targeting of the AID/RAD51 axis in B cells may block development of type 1 diabetes (T1D) in the June issue of The Journal of Immunology. This work was carried out in collaboration with The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, Maine), and Virginia Tech (Blacksburg, Virginia). Cyteir’s approach leverages activation induced cytidine deaminase (AID) as both a biomarker and driver of DNA damage. By modulating the DNA repair protein RAD51 in AID-positive cells, Cyteir seeks to induce selective self-destruction of cancer cells or specific B-cells in autoimmune diseases. Preclinical studies to date have demonstrated Cyteir’s early RAD51 modulators to be potent, selective for AID-positive cells, effective against cancer cells in vitro and in vivo, and well tolerated in preclinical animal models. In autoimmune diseases, AID is directly implicated in disease development and progression, thus the use of a RAD51 modulator may have utility in mitigating autoimmune diseases as exemplified in the data presented in The Journal of Immunology peer reviewed scientific article. The preclinical data presented are from a series of experiments using non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice, a preclinical model of human type 1/juvenile diabetes. The study showed that treatment with a RAD51 modulator, which blocks the transport of RAD51 into the nucleus of AID+ cells, greatly reduced the incidence of T1D in these animals. The study also found that targeting RAD51 significantly increased CD73+ B cells in the spleen pancreatic lymph nodes and pancreatic islets in treated mice. These cells were capable of suppressing diabetogenic T cell responses thus enhancing the therapeutic effect of the RAD51 targeted compound. These results were achieved with intermittent and long term dosing which appeared well tolerated by the animals.


Cyteir Therapeutics Presents Preclinical Data on Use of Dna Repair Modulators for Lymphoid Malignancies at American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting
Nov 29 16
Cyteir Therapeutics, Inc. announced that it will present preclinical data elucidating a mechanism of cell death response that can be utilized to preferentially target lymphoid malignancies at the American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting in San Diego, California. These data demonstrate that the DNA mutase activation induced cytidine deaminase (AID) can be leveraged to effectively target AID-expressing cancers, and has shown promise in a xenograft cancer model. These exciting findings support the notion that modulation of the DNA repair protein RAD51 in AID-expressing malignancies could be an effective new therapeutic approach in oncology. The results of these studies validate the promise of approach and provide momentum for the continued development of novel RAD51 modulators for use in lymphoid cancers, a program that the company plan to expand into solid tumor indications.

Cyteir Therapeutics, Inc.




Cyteir Therapeutics, Inc.Cyteir is revolutionizing the concept of DNA damage and repair. Conventional therapies focus on reversal of cancer cell properties and DNA damage to restore the normal state. Cyteir takes a contrarian approach by enhancing – not reducing – DNA damage to achieve rapid and selective elimination of only the diseased cells. On this basis Cyteir has developed and is now leveraging an integrated drug development platform to deliver a pipeline of small molecule therapeutics with a broad range of potential disease state applications.

Cyteir Therapeutics is a leader in the discovery and development of novel therapeutics based on the biology of DNA repair and synthetic lethality for the treatment of cancer and autoimmune diseases. Our initial approach takes advantage of DNA damage overload to induce selective self-destruction of cells by targeting disease-induced RAD51 transport



Synthetic LethalityBy precisely modulating DNA, disease cells are overwhelmed by their own DNA damage and undergo cell death 
RAD51Our lead program targets RAD51, a DNA repair protein that is important in cancer and autoimmune diseases
CancerLeveraging the synthetic lethal paradigm we are developing drugs for use in a range of cancer types 
Autoimmune DiseaseBy precision targeting of specific DNA repair proteins, we aim to change the way many autoimmune diseases are treated
TechnologyCyteir has developed a screening technology to discover novel DNA repair modulators that induce synthetic lethality in diseases with genetically defined gain-of-function abnormalities 








Cancer
There are newly discovered roles for DNA repair in the development of autoimmune diseases. Precision targeting of DNA repair mechanisms promises a differentiated synthetic lethal approach to treating a range of autoimmune disorders.










Autoimmune
Cancer cells rely on DNA repair for their survival, their ablity for rapid and unrestricted growth, and their capacity to rapidly mutate. Because DNA repair is at the center of so many cancer processes, synthetic lethality is a key to Improving treatments for a wide range of cancers.
