The rest is up to them.Click through on the puzzle piece to learn more.ProcessOur disciplined, time-tested investment process helps us to implement our investment philosophy consistently across global markets and over multiple generations of decision-makers.Click through on the puzzle piece to learn more.OwnershipOur structure is more akin to a partnership than a corporation.

All of our fee structures are performance related and each person is rewarded for the value they create for clients.Click through on the puzzle piece to learn more.PerformanceInvestment performance doesn’t come in a straight line. We view periods of short-term underperformance, some of which can be painfully long, as the inevitable price one must pay for seeking pleasing long-term returns.Click through on the puzzle piece to learn more.                                Your job is tougher than ours. As hard as it may be to pick stocks, it’s even tougher                                to find good stockpickers.                                At Orbis, we seek to generate superior returns by buying shares that are out of                                favour, overlooked or misunderstood. As such, it can be easy for us to look foolish                                in the short term and for our clients to feel uncomfortable. But our experience                                has shown that the rewards that come with contrarian thinking, discipline and patience                                can be substantial over the long term.                                As important as performance may be, it never tells the whole story. To really understand                                a manager, you need to dig deeper. How do they make decisions? What are their incentives?                                What are their values? How have they structured their firm?                                We recognise that our approach isn’t for everyone. Only you can decide if Orbis                                is the right fit for your needs, but hopefully we can make that decision a little                                easier.Start due diligence »

Working at Orbis is not for everyoneIt is imperative that our people can thrive in an environment of individual accountability and our flat management structure emphasises contribution over seniority.At Orbis, we seek to attract highly motivated individuals who share our Core Values. This applies not only in investment management but in everything that we do, from client service to back-office operations. We aim to give our people the resources they need to succeed and the rest is up to them. While we expect our people to have outstanding academic credentials we also look for evidence of success outside the classroom in whatever they have done. We also place great value in demonstrated courage to think independently, even if it means disagreeing with the rest of the team. Our flat management structure emphasises contribution over seniority meaning that an individual’s progression and reward is completely dependent on their ability to add value.Meet Our People to watch more profiles.Contact OrbisOrbis AccessMedia EnquiriesAccessibilityOrbis Investment Management Limited © 2017

In particular, we have established powerful incentives against making decisions that are at the expense of future investment performance.Download Our Organisational Philosophy in PDF »
1. Continuity of Private OwnershipBeing a contrarian investor requires being out of sync with conventional thinking and being painfully wrong at times. That creates career risk for individual decision-makers and pressure for the owners of a firm. As a firm that is owned by the key investment decision-makers, our ownership structure is designed to give our people the freedom to make tough, unpopular decisions and stick with them. This is also true from an operational perspective. We believe our ability, as a firm and as individuals, to focus on the very long term without the pressure to produce short-term results is an enduring competitive advantage in this industry.  For more information on our ownership structure, please click here.William GrayInvestment Team
2. Alignment of InterestsPerformance fees and co-investment help to ensure that our success is aligned with that of our clients. Our fees have always been designed to reward us for superior performance as well as penalise us for underperformance, making the firm’s profitability much more sensitive to investment performance than growth in assets under management. Under our Refundable Reserve Fee structure, we refund performance fees to our clients in periods of underperformance. We also offer larger investors a pure refundable performance fee structure—in other words, we only get paid if we outperform. Co-investment further reinforces this focus on performance. Orbis’ founders, owners, management and employees invest alongside clients, and pay the same fees. Indeed, as a group they are the largest single investor in our funds. We therefore have powerful incentives to behave as responsible stewards of our clients’ capital.Jimmy ChanQuantitative Analyst
3. Individual AccountabilityWe believe contrarian investment decisions are best made by individuals, not groups. Our investment process has therefore always been designed to encourage individual thinking and accountability. For all members of the firm, individual performance is evaluated in terms of value added for clients. Our detailed performance attribution systems track the results of individual investment decisions, allowing an objective assessment of each person's contribution, in addition to acting as an early warning system and helping to highlight areas of improvement.Ben PrestonEquity Analyst
4. Building SustainabilitySince inception, we have recognised that assets under management will inevitably grow if we are successful on behalf of our clients. Such growth presents both opportunities and challenges. To maximise the likelihood that we can meet those challenges, we have chosen to invest heavily in maintaining and developing our investment and operational capabilities. Our ownership structure provides the foundation that enables us to prioritise such long-term investments over short-term profitability, while our performance-based fee structures act as a powerful incentive against gathering assets at the expense of investment performance.Dan BrocklebankEquity AnalystWilliam Gray - Investment Team

Working at Orbis is not for everyoneIt is imperative that our people can thrive in an environment of individual accountability and our flat management structure emphasises contribution over seniority.At Orbis, we seek to attract highly motivated individuals who share our Core Values. This applies not only in investment management but in everything that we do, from client service to back-office operations. We aim to give our people the resources they need to succeed and the rest is up to them. While we expect our people to have outstanding academic credentials we also look for evidence of success outside the classroom in whatever they have done. We also place great value in demonstrated courage to think independently, even if it means disagreeing with the rest of the team. Our flat management structure emphasises contribution over seniority meaning that an individual’s progression and reward is completely dependent on their ability to add value.Meet Our People to watch more profiles.Contact OrbisOrbis AccessMedia EnquiriesAccessibilityOrbis Investment Management Limited © 2017

Investment Team



Our analysts pick the stocks that make up the Orbis Funds. They survey more than 16,000 stocks – with only a handful ever making the cut. Analysts spend months, and sometimes years, looking at a business before putting our clients’ money on the line.

Equity Analyst




‘I enjoy the intellectual challenge of analysing very different stocks and finding potential which the market has missed. Sometimes the best opportunities are found in the most unlikely places.’
