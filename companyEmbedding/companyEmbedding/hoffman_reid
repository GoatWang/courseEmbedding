"Be embarrassed by your product launch" doesn't mean be deeply ashamed or alienate all your users.Steve Jennings/Getty Images
LinkedIn cofounder and chairman and Greylock Partners investor Reid Hoffman has a reputation as one of Silicon Valley's wisest thought leaders.
And one of his most repeated entrepreneurial insights of the last decade is, "If you're not embarrassed by your first product release, you've released it too late."
It's got all the right elements of a good quote: It's pithy, controversial, and has fans like Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, whose own signature motto is, "Move fast and break things." But these characteristics also make it easy to misinterpret.
"Over the years, some people have have interpreted my theory as permission to cut corners, act recklessly, or proceed without a clear plan," Hoffman said in the Zuckerberg episode of his podcast "Masters of Scale."
"But notice, I said if you're not embarrassed by your product. I didn't say if you're not indicted, or if you're not deeply ashamed by your product. Indeed, if you launch so fast that it generates lawsuits, alienates users, or burns through capital without any apparent gain, you did in fact launch too soon."
The core of Hoffman's message is the embrace of fast experimentation. As he wrote on his blog, when he was an entrepreneur in the 1990s, it was very difficult to do this because not only was the production of technology slower and more expensive, but customers had to pay premium prices for software that they downloaded to their computers from a disc they purchased in a brick-and-mortar store.
With the spread of internet access and an improved consumer experience, Hoffman and other entrepreneurs were then able to move faster and see what their audience liked and didn't like.
He said in his podcast that entrepreneurs should feel embarrassment, a feeling that their vision is not fully realized, for every new product release, whether they have 100 users or 1 billion users.
Zuckerberg explained to Hoffman the way he has made peace with the idea that he doesn't need his vision perfected in new releases at Facebook: "I'm much more motivated by making sure that we have the biggest impact on the world than by building a business or making sure we don't fail. I have more fear in my life that we aren't going to maximize the opportunity that we have than that we mess something up and the business goes badly."
You need to be comfortable as an entrepreneur with upsetting a portion of your target audience — whether you introduce a new social media site or a new kitchen appliance — so that you can learn what the majority wants, according to Hoffman.
"The opportunity to build an enduring product far outweighs the cost of alienating a few users along the way," he said. "And the sooner you internalize that trade-off, the faster you'll move along the path to scale."
You can listen to the full episode of "Masters of Scale" on Stitcher or wherever you get podcasts.

Early life and education[edit]
Hoffman was born in Palo Alto, California, to Deanna Ruth (Rutter) and William Parker Hoffman, Jr., and grew up in Berkeley, California. His paternal great-great-great-grandfather was Theophilus Adam Wylie, a Christian Presbyterian minister and Indiana University president pro tempore.[5][6][7] Reid's uncle Eric Hoffman is a writer.[8][9]
Hoffman himself describes how he was an avid tabletop roleplaying gamer as a child.[10] His first paid job (at age 12) was as an editor at the game company Chaosium, then based in Oakland near his home.[11] Although 14 years old at the time, Hoffman's name features on the box of Chaosium's RuneQuest role-playing game release 'Borderlands' (1982), receiving equal billing with such prominent game designers as Steve Perrin, Sandy Petersen and Greg Stafford.[12]
Hoffman attended high school at The Putney School,[13] where he farmed maple syrup, drove oxen and studied epistemology.[14] He graduated from Stanford University in 1990, where he won both a Marshall Scholarship and a Dinkelspiel Award, with a B.S. in Symbolic Systems and Cognitive Science.[15] He went on to earn an M.A. in Philosophy from Wolfson College, Oxford University in 1993 as a Marshall Scholar.
Career[edit]
Early years[edit]
While in college, according to Hoffman, he formed a conviction that he wanted to try to influence the state of the world on a large scale.[14] He saw academia as an opportunity to make an "impact", but later realized that an entrepreneurial career would provide him with a larger platform. "When I graduated from Stanford my plan was to become a professor and public intellectual. That is not about quoting Kant. It's about holding up a lens to society and asking 'who are we?' and 'who should we be, as individuals and a society?' But I realised academics write books that 50 or 60 people read and I wanted more impact."[16]
With that in mind, Hoffman pursued a career in business and entrepreneurship. He joined Apple Computer in 1994, where he worked on eWorld, an early attempt at creating a social network. eWorld was acquired by AOL in 1996.[17] He later worked at Fujitsu before co-founding his first company – SocialNet.com in 1997. It focused “on online dating and matching up people with similar interests, like golfers who were looking for partners in their neighborhood.”[18] Peter Thiel has said SocialNet.com was “literally an idea before its time. It was a social network 7 or 8 years before that became a trend.”[17]
PayPal[edit]
While at SocialNet, Hoffman was a member of the board of directors during the founding of PayPal, an electronic money transmission service. In January 2000, he left SocialNet and joined PayPal full-time as the company's COO.[18] Allen Blue, whom Hoffman hired at PayPal, said that “PayPal had to scratch and claw for every advantage it had, and Reid became an expert at competing effectively in an extremely competitive environment."[17] Hoffman was responsible for all external relationships for PayPal, including payments infrastructure (VISA, MasterCard, ACH, WellsFargo), business development (eBay, Intuit, and others), government (regulatory, judicial), and legal. Peter Thiel, Hoffman's boss at PayPal, has said that Hoffman “was the firefighter-in-chief at PayPal. Though that diminishes his role because there were many, many fires.”[18] At the time of PayPal's acquisition by eBay for $1.5B in 2002, he was executive vice president of PayPal.
LinkedIn[edit]




Hoffman speaks at an event.


Hoffman co-founded LinkedIn in December 2002 with two former colleagues from SocialNet (including Allen Blue), a former college classmate and a former colleague from his time at Fujitsu.[14] It launched on May 5, 2003, as one of the first business-oriented online social networks.[19] Peter Thiel and Keith Rabois, colleagues of Hoffman's at PayPal, invested in LinkedIn.[14] By November 2014, LinkedIn had over 332 million members in more than 200 countries and territories.[19] The site allows registered users to create professional profiles and connect with each other. Users can invite anyone (whether a site user or not) to become a connection. According to Forbes, “LinkedIn is, far and away, the most advantageous social networking tool available to job seekers and business professionals today."[20]
Hoffman was LinkedIn's founding CEO for the first four years before becoming chairman and President, Products in February 2007. He became Executive chairman in June 2009.[21] With the IPO of LinkedIn on May 19, 2011, Hoffman owns a stake worth an estimated $2.34 billion, not including any potential benefits from Greylock Partners, where he was named a Partner in 2009.[22] Hoffman believes that many people still do not know how to use its service and it is LinkedIn's job to help them out. In an interview, Hoffman said that “you have to think proactively about how to use a tool that enables your ability to move in ways that you weren’t able to move before, and most of people are not very good at that”.[23]
Microsoft proposed to acquire LinkedIn on June 13, 2016 for $26.2 billion in cash.[24] Hoffman became a board member of Microsoft on March 14, 2017.[25]
Investing[edit]
After the PayPal sale to eBay, Hoffman became one of Silicon Valley's most prolific and successful angel investors. According to venture capitalist David Sze, Hoffman "is arguably the most successful angel investor in the past decade."[26] Dave Goldberg, former CEO of SurveyMonkey, said that Hoffman “is the person you want to talk to when you are starting a company.”[17] In 2010 Hoffman joined Greylock Partners and runs their $20 million Discovery Fund.[27] His areas of focus at Greylock include consumer and services, enterprise software, consumer Internet, enterprise 2.0, mobile, social gaming, online marketplaces, payments, and social networks.[28]
According to David Kirkpatrick's book The Facebook Effect, Hoffman arranged the first meeting between Mark Zuckerberg and Peter Thiel, which led to Thiel's initial $500,000 angel investment in Facebook. Hoffman invested alongside Thiel in Facebook's very first financing round.[29][30]
Hoffman’s current investments include Airbnb, One Kings Lane, Swipely, Viki, Coupons.com, Edmodo, Wrapp, TrialPay, Xapo, Change.org, Gixo, Blockstream,[31] Convoy, Segovia, Crowdpac[32] and Talko.[33][34] Past investments include 3DSolve, Flickr, Digg, shopkick, SixApart, Wikia, Permuto, thesixtyone, Tagged, IronPort, Ping.fm, Nanosolar, Care.com, Knewton, Kongregate, Last.fm, Technetto, Vendio and VigLink.[34] He served on Zynga’s board of directors from March 2008 to June 2014, and on shopkick's board of directors from its foundation in July 2009 until its acquisition by SK Telecom in October 2014.
Public intellectual work[edit]
Speaking[edit]
Hoffman has spoken at the XPrize Foundation's conference and the TED conference in Long Beach in 2012. He is a frequent lecturer at Stanford University, Oxford University, Harvard University, MIT's Media Lab, and others. He has appeared on The Charlie Rose Show, Fareed Zakaria's Global Public Square on CNN and other current affairs television programs.
Writing[edit]
Hoffman has published a variety of posts as a “LinkedIn Influencer” on LinkedIn. He published an essay proposing a new form of credentialing for university students and professionals entitled “Disrupting the Diploma.”[35] On his personal website, he published “LinkedIn’s Series B Pitch to Greylock: Pitch Advice for Entrepreneurs,” in which he analyzed LinkedIn’s 2004 Series B venture funding pitch deck and offered advice to prospective entrepreneurs on how to formulate a pitch deck.[36]
Hoffman has also written op-eds in the Washington Post, including one published in 2009 entitled “Let Startups Bail Us Out”[37] encouraging funding for grassroots innovation in the wake of the financial crisis and another in June 2013 entitled “Immigration promotes entrepreneurship and prosperity” advocating for immigration reform.[38] He has written for Strategy+Business on professional networking and is an "Influencer" on LinkedIn where he posts original written content.[39][40]
The Start-Up of You[edit]
Hoffman is co-author, with Ben Casnocha, of the career book The Start-Up of You: Adapt to the Future, Invest in Yourself, and Transform your Career.[14]
The book was released in the United States on February 14, 2012. It argues that individuals should think of themselves as businesses-of-one – the “CEO of their own career” – and draws many parallels between lessons learned from the stories of successful Silicon Valley technology companies and an individual’s career.[41]
Publishers Weekly reviewed the book positively, saying, “with plenty of valuable guidance relevant to any career stage, this book will help readers not only survive professionally in times of uncertainty but stand out from the pack and flourish.”[42] The Economist said that “Hoffman and Casnocha make a number of astute observations about shifts in the world of work.”[43]
As of September 2012 it had sold more than 100,000 copies.[44] It became both a New York Times and Wall Street Journal bestseller.[45][46] Business Insider republished visual summaries of The Start-Up of You, which have received over 13 million views.[47]
The Alliance[edit]
Hoffman is co-author, with Ben Casnocha and Chris Yeh, of the management book The Alliance: Managing Talent in the Networked Age.[48]
The book was released in the United States on July 8, 2014. It argues that previous career models of lifetime employment and free agency no longer work in a business world defined by continuous change. Instead, it proposes that employers and employees should think of each other as “allies” and move from a transactional approach to employment to a “relational” one. It proposes a new framework for managers and employers to organize their work, described as “tours of duty.” Further, it argues why managers should encourage their employees to gather “network intelligence” and why companies and managers should maintain a lifelong relationship with former employees via a corporate alumni network.[49]
The book became a New York Times bestseller.[50] Arianna Huffington named The Alliance “the must-read book of the summer” in 2014.[51]
Masters of scale[edit]
On 25 April 2017 Reid Hoffman announced the launch of a new podcast "Masters of scale" to promote a new form of leadership based on gender equality in the workplace.[52]
Honors and awards[edit]

In September 2014, the Academy of Achievement awarded Hoffman with the annual Golden Plate award, which honors accomplished individuals “for significant achievement in their fields.”[53]
In April 2014, President Barack Obama named Hoffman as a Presidential Ambassador for Global Entrepreneurship “to help develop the next generation of entrepreneurs.”[54]
In April 2014, Hoffman received the Distinguished Citizen Award from the Commonwealth Club.[55]
In May 2012, Hoffman was ranked third on the Forbes Midas List of the top tech investors.[56] Forbes described Hoffman as “Silicon Valley's uber-investor” and said Hoffman “has had a hand in creating nearly every lucrative social media startup.”[56]
In 2012, The Martin Luther King Jr. Center honored Hoffman with their "Salute to Greatness" award which "recognizes individuals and corporations or organizations that exemplify excellence in leadership and a commitment to social responsibility in the spirit of Martin Luther King, Jr."[57]
In 2012, Newsweek and The Daily Beast released their first "Digital Power Index," a list of the 100 most significant people in the digital world that year (plus 10 additional "Lifetime Achievement" winners), and Hoffman was ranked No. 3 in the "Angels" category.[58]
In 2012, Hoffman, along with Salman Khan of Khan Academy, was honored by the World Affairs Council and Global Philanthropy Forum in 2012. The council recognizes and honors remarkable leaders who have effected and will continue to effect social change through their private enterprise and social action. The awards in 2012 were dedicated to celebrating Technology for Social Impact.[59]
Hoffman was awarded the 2012 David Packard Medal of Achievement Award by TechAmerica for his contributions and advances within the high-tech industry, his community, and humankind.[60]
Hoffman received an Honorary Doctor of Laws from Babson in 2012.[61]
In 2011, Hoffman and Jeff Weiner of LinkedIn shared the EY U.S. Entrepreneur of the Year Award.[62]
In 2010, Hoffman was named No. 17 on Fast Company 's list of the 100 Most Creative People in Business.[63]

Personal life[edit]
In 2001, Hoffman married Michelle Yee. The couple has resided in Palo Alto, CA for 10 years.
Philanthropy[edit]
Jeff Weiner, LinkedIn's CEO, has said that “Reid's true worth is making a positive and lasting impact on the world, in a very profound way.”[17] Hoffman serves on the boards of Kiva.org (peer-peer microlending pioneer that allows people to lend money via the internet to low-income/underserved entrepreneurs and students), Mozilla (creator of Firefox),[64] Endeavor Global (an organization that finds and supports high-impact entrepreneurs in emerging markets) and Do Something (an organization motivating young people to take action around social changes). Hoffman also serves on the Advisory Council of the MIT Media Lab (an interdisciplinary research laboratory), and is a supporter and Chair of the Advisory Board for QuestBridge (a provider of talented low-income students to top colleges/universities).[65] Hoffman is one of the financial backers of OpenAI, a non-profit company aimed at the safe development of artificial general intelligence.[66] Hoffman is also a primary funder of Crisis Text Line, a free, 24/7 crisis service via SMS in the US.[67] In November 2016, Hoffman and his wife, Michelle Yee, donated $20 million to the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, a charity dedicated to eradicating disease by 2100. Hoffman and Yee's donation was for the Biohub, the Initiative's San Francisco laboratory. Hoffman also joined the board of the Biohub project.[68]
Politics[edit]
Hoffman is a member of the Bilderberg Group, which gathers 120-150 North American and European "political leaders and experts from industry, finance, academia and the media"[69] for an annual invitation-only closed-door conference that Hoffman attended in 2011 and 2012,[70] as well as every year since 2014.[71] Hoffman is also listed as a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, to which he was elected in 2015.[72][73]
In April 2013, a pro-immigration lobbying group called FWD.us was launched, with Reid Hoffman listed as one of the founders.[74]
In 2014, Hoffman donated $150,000 to the Mayday PAC[75]
In 2014 Hoffman contributed $500,000 toward David Chiu's State Assembly campaign by funding an independent expenditure committee devoted to negative campaigning against his opponent: San Franciscans to Hold Campos Accountable — Vote No for Campos for State Assembly 2014.[76]
In 2016, Hoffman contributed $220,000 in support of Democratic candidate for Vermont governor Matt Dunne, according to a mass-media disclosure filed at the Vermont Secretary of State’s Office.[77]
In 2016, Hoffman created Trumped Up Cards, a card game modeled after Cards Against Humanity intended to poke fun at US presidential candidate Donald Trump.[78]

Early life and education[edit]
Hoffman was born in Palo Alto, California, to Deanna Ruth (Rutter) and William Parker Hoffman, Jr., and grew up in Berkeley, California. His paternal great-great-great-grandfather was Theophilus Adam Wylie, a Christian Presbyterian minister and Indiana University president pro tempore.[5][6][7] Reid's uncle Eric Hoffman is a writer.[8][9]
Hoffman himself describes how he was an avid tabletop roleplaying gamer as a child.[10] His first paid job (at age 12) was as an editor at the game company Chaosium, then based in Oakland near his home.[11] Although 14 years old at the time, Hoffman's name features on the box of Chaosium's RuneQuest role-playing game release 'Borderlands' (1982), receiving equal billing with such prominent game designers as Steve Perrin, Sandy Petersen and Greg Stafford.[12]
Hoffman attended high school at The Putney School,[13] where he farmed maple syrup, drove oxen and studied epistemology.[14] He graduated from Stanford University in 1990, where he won both a Marshall Scholarship and a Dinkelspiel Award, with a B.S. in Symbolic Systems and Cognitive Science.[15] He went on to earn an M.A. in Philosophy from Wolfson College, Oxford University in 1993 as a Marshall Scholar.
Career[edit]
Early years[edit]
While in college, according to Hoffman, he formed a conviction that he wanted to try to influence the state of the world on a large scale.[14] He saw academia as an opportunity to make an "impact", but later realized that an entrepreneurial career would provide him with a larger platform. "When I graduated from Stanford my plan was to become a professor and public intellectual. That is not about quoting Kant. It's about holding up a lens to society and asking 'who are we?' and 'who should we be, as individuals and a society?' But I realised academics write books that 50 or 60 people read and I wanted more impact."[16]
With that in mind, Hoffman pursued a career in business and entrepreneurship. He joined Apple Computer in 1994, where he worked on eWorld, an early attempt at creating a social network. eWorld was acquired by AOL in 1996.[17] He later worked at Fujitsu before co-founding his first company – SocialNet.com in 1997. It focused “on online dating and matching up people with similar interests, like golfers who were looking for partners in their neighborhood.”[18] Peter Thiel has said SocialNet.com was “literally an idea before its time. It was a social network 7 or 8 years before that became a trend.”[17]
PayPal[edit]
While at SocialNet, Hoffman was a member of the board of directors during the founding of PayPal, an electronic money transmission service. In January 2000, he left SocialNet and joined PayPal full-time as the company's COO.[18] Allen Blue, whom Hoffman hired at PayPal, said that “PayPal had to scratch and claw for every advantage it had, and Reid became an expert at competing effectively in an extremely competitive environment."[17] Hoffman was responsible for all external relationships for PayPal, including payments infrastructure (VISA, MasterCard, ACH, WellsFargo), business development (eBay, Intuit, and others), government (regulatory, judicial), and legal. Peter Thiel, Hoffman's boss at PayPal, has said that Hoffman “was the firefighter-in-chief at PayPal. Though that diminishes his role because there were many, many fires.”[18] At the time of PayPal's acquisition by eBay for $1.5B in 2002, he was executive vice president of PayPal.
LinkedIn[edit]




Hoffman speaks at an event.


Hoffman co-founded LinkedIn in December 2002 with two former colleagues from SocialNet (including Allen Blue), a former college classmate and a former colleague from his time at Fujitsu.[14] It launched on May 5, 2003, as one of the first business-oriented online social networks.[19] Peter Thiel and Keith Rabois, colleagues of Hoffman's at PayPal, invested in LinkedIn.[14] By November 2014, LinkedIn had over 332 million members in more than 200 countries and territories.[19] The site allows registered users to create professional profiles and connect with each other. Users can invite anyone (whether a site user or not) to become a connection. According to Forbes, “LinkedIn is, far and away, the most advantageous social networking tool available to job seekers and business professionals today."[20]
Hoffman was LinkedIn's founding CEO for the first four years before becoming chairman and President, Products in February 2007. He became Executive chairman in June 2009.[21] With the IPO of LinkedIn on May 19, 2011, Hoffman owns a stake worth an estimated $2.34 billion, not including any potential benefits from Greylock Partners, where he was named a Partner in 2009.[22] Hoffman believes that many people still do not know how to use its service and it is LinkedIn's job to help them out. In an interview, Hoffman said that “you have to think proactively about how to use a tool that enables your ability to move in ways that you weren’t able to move before, and most of people are not very good at that”.[23]
Microsoft proposed to acquire LinkedIn on June 13, 2016 for $26.2 billion in cash.[24] Hoffman became a board member of Microsoft on March 14, 2017.[25]
Investing[edit]
After the PayPal sale to eBay, Hoffman became one of Silicon Valley's most prolific and successful angel investors. According to venture capitalist David Sze, Hoffman "is arguably the most successful angel investor in the past decade."[26] Dave Goldberg, former CEO of SurveyMonkey, said that Hoffman “is the person you want to talk to when you are starting a company.”[17] In 2010 Hoffman joined Greylock Partners and runs their $20 million Discovery Fund.[27] His areas of focus at Greylock include consumer and services, enterprise software, consumer Internet, enterprise 2.0, mobile, social gaming, online marketplaces, payments, and social networks.[28]
According to David Kirkpatrick's book The Facebook Effect, Hoffman arranged the first meeting between Mark Zuckerberg and Peter Thiel, which led to Thiel's initial $500,000 angel investment in Facebook. Hoffman invested alongside Thiel in Facebook's very first financing round.[29][30]
Hoffman’s current investments include Airbnb, One Kings Lane, Swipely, Viki, Coupons.com, Edmodo, Wrapp, TrialPay, Xapo, Change.org, Gixo, Blockstream,[31] Convoy, Segovia, Crowdpac[32] and Talko.[33][34] Past investments include 3DSolve, Flickr, Digg, shopkick, SixApart, Wikia, Permuto, thesixtyone, Tagged, IronPort, Ping.fm, Nanosolar, Care.com, Knewton, Kongregate, Last.fm, Technetto, Vendio and VigLink.[34] He served on Zynga’s board of directors from March 2008 to June 2014, and on shopkick's board of directors from its foundation in July 2009 until its acquisition by SK Telecom in October 2014.
Public intellectual work[edit]
Speaking[edit]
Hoffman has spoken at the XPrize Foundation's conference and the TED conference in Long Beach in 2012. He is a frequent lecturer at Stanford University, Oxford University, Harvard University, MIT's Media Lab, and others. He has appeared on The Charlie Rose Show, Fareed Zakaria's Global Public Square on CNN and other current affairs television programs.
Writing[edit]
Hoffman has published a variety of posts as a “LinkedIn Influencer” on LinkedIn. He published an essay proposing a new form of credentialing for university students and professionals entitled “Disrupting the Diploma.”[35] On his personal website, he published “LinkedIn’s Series B Pitch to Greylock: Pitch Advice for Entrepreneurs,” in which he analyzed LinkedIn’s 2004 Series B venture funding pitch deck and offered advice to prospective entrepreneurs on how to formulate a pitch deck.[36]
Hoffman has also written op-eds in the Washington Post, including one published in 2009 entitled “Let Startups Bail Us Out”[37] encouraging funding for grassroots innovation in the wake of the financial crisis and another in June 2013 entitled “Immigration promotes entrepreneurship and prosperity” advocating for immigration reform.[38] He has written for Strategy+Business on professional networking and is an "Influencer" on LinkedIn where he posts original written content.[39][40]
The Start-Up of You[edit]
Hoffman is co-author, with Ben Casnocha, of the career book The Start-Up of You: Adapt to the Future, Invest in Yourself, and Transform your Career.[14]
The book was released in the United States on February 14, 2012. It argues that individuals should think of themselves as businesses-of-one – the “CEO of their own career” – and draws many parallels between lessons learned from the stories of successful Silicon Valley technology companies and an individual’s career.[41]
Publishers Weekly reviewed the book positively, saying, “with plenty of valuable guidance relevant to any career stage, this book will help readers not only survive professionally in times of uncertainty but stand out from the pack and flourish.”[42] The Economist said that “Hoffman and Casnocha make a number of astute observations about shifts in the world of work.”[43]
As of September 2012 it had sold more than 100,000 copies.[44] It became both a New York Times and Wall Street Journal bestseller.[45][46] Business Insider republished visual summaries of The Start-Up of You, which have received over 13 million views.[47]
The Alliance[edit]
Hoffman is co-author, with Ben Casnocha and Chris Yeh, of the management book The Alliance: Managing Talent in the Networked Age.[48]
The book was released in the United States on July 8, 2014. It argues that previous career models of lifetime employment and free agency no longer work in a business world defined by continuous change. Instead, it proposes that employers and employees should think of each other as “allies” and move from a transactional approach to employment to a “relational” one. It proposes a new framework for managers and employers to organize their work, described as “tours of duty.” Further, it argues why managers should encourage their employees to gather “network intelligence” and why companies and managers should maintain a lifelong relationship with former employees via a corporate alumni network.[49]
The book became a New York Times bestseller.[50] Arianna Huffington named The Alliance “the must-read book of the summer” in 2014.[51]
Masters of scale[edit]
On 25 April 2017 Reid Hoffman announced the launch of a new podcast "Masters of scale" to promote a new form of leadership based on gender equality in the workplace.[52]
Honors and awards[edit]

In September 2014, the Academy of Achievement awarded Hoffman with the annual Golden Plate award, which honors accomplished individuals “for significant achievement in their fields.”[53]
In April 2014, President Barack Obama named Hoffman as a Presidential Ambassador for Global Entrepreneurship “to help develop the next generation of entrepreneurs.”[54]
In April 2014, Hoffman received the Distinguished Citizen Award from the Commonwealth Club.[55]
In May 2012, Hoffman was ranked third on the Forbes Midas List of the top tech investors.[56] Forbes described Hoffman as “Silicon Valley's uber-investor” and said Hoffman “has had a hand in creating nearly every lucrative social media startup.”[56]
In 2012, The Martin Luther King Jr. Center honored Hoffman with their "Salute to Greatness" award which "recognizes individuals and corporations or organizations that exemplify excellence in leadership and a commitment to social responsibility in the spirit of Martin Luther King, Jr."[57]
In 2012, Newsweek and The Daily Beast released their first "Digital Power Index," a list of the 100 most significant people in the digital world that year (plus 10 additional "Lifetime Achievement" winners), and Hoffman was ranked No. 3 in the "Angels" category.[58]
In 2012, Hoffman, along with Salman Khan of Khan Academy, was honored by the World Affairs Council and Global Philanthropy Forum in 2012. The council recognizes and honors remarkable leaders who have effected and will continue to effect social change through their private enterprise and social action. The awards in 2012 were dedicated to celebrating Technology for Social Impact.[59]
Hoffman was awarded the 2012 David Packard Medal of Achievement Award by TechAmerica for his contributions and advances within the high-tech industry, his community, and humankind.[60]
Hoffman received an Honorary Doctor of Laws from Babson in 2012.[61]
In 2011, Hoffman and Jeff Weiner of LinkedIn shared the EY U.S. Entrepreneur of the Year Award.[62]
In 2010, Hoffman was named No. 17 on Fast Company 's list of the 100 Most Creative People in Business.[63]

Personal life[edit]
In 2001, Hoffman married Michelle Yee. The couple has resided in Palo Alto, CA for 10 years.
Philanthropy[edit]
Jeff Weiner, LinkedIn's CEO, has said that “Reid's true worth is making a positive and lasting impact on the world, in a very profound way.”[17] Hoffman serves on the boards of Kiva.org (peer-peer microlending pioneer that allows people to lend money via the internet to low-income/underserved entrepreneurs and students), Mozilla (creator of Firefox),[64] Endeavor Global (an organization that finds and supports high-impact entrepreneurs in emerging markets) and Do Something (an organization motivating young people to take action around social changes). Hoffman also serves on the Advisory Council of the MIT Media Lab (an interdisciplinary research laboratory), and is a supporter and Chair of the Advisory Board for QuestBridge (a provider of talented low-income students to top colleges/universities).[65] Hoffman is one of the financial backers of OpenAI, a non-profit company aimed at the safe development of artificial general intelligence.[66] Hoffman is also a primary funder of Crisis Text Line, a free, 24/7 crisis service via SMS in the US.[67] In November 2016, Hoffman and his wife, Michelle Yee, donated $20 million to the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, a charity dedicated to eradicating disease by 2100. Hoffman and Yee's donation was for the Biohub, the Initiative's San Francisco laboratory. Hoffman also joined the board of the Biohub project.[68]
Politics[edit]
Hoffman is a member of the Bilderberg Group, which gathers 120-150 North American and European "political leaders and experts from industry, finance, academia and the media"[69] for an annual invitation-only closed-door conference that Hoffman attended in 2011 and 2012,[70] as well as every year since 2014.[71] Hoffman is also listed as a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, to which he was elected in 2015.[72][73]
In April 2013, a pro-immigration lobbying group called FWD.us was launched, with Reid Hoffman listed as one of the founders.[74]
In 2014, Hoffman donated $150,000 to the Mayday PAC[75]
In 2014 Hoffman contributed $500,000 toward David Chiu's State Assembly campaign by funding an independent expenditure committee devoted to negative campaigning against his opponent: San Franciscans to Hold Campos Accountable — Vote No for Campos for State Assembly 2014.[76]
In 2016, Hoffman contributed $220,000 in support of Democratic candidate for Vermont governor Matt Dunne, according to a mass-media disclosure filed at the Vermont Secretary of State’s Office.[77]
In 2016, Hoffman created Trumped Up Cards, a card game modeled after Cards Against Humanity intended to poke fun at US presidential candidate Donald Trump.[78]

LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman joins Microsoft’s board

Next Story

Interactive fiction and the origins of the conversational interface












LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman announced today that he’s joined the board of directors at Microsoft.
This follows Microsoft’s $26.2 billion acquisition of LinkedIn last year. When the deal closed, LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner said the company’s day-to-day operations would “essentially remain unchanged,” but he also noted a number of areas (like integrating LinkedIn into Microsoft Outlook and Office products) where the two organizations would work together.
In a LinkedIn post, Hoffman said his primary job is still as a partner at Greylock, but he’s “maintained an office next to Jeff Weiner’s at LinkedIn for the last nine years” — so he’s remained very involved. (Officially, he was chairman of the LinkedIn board.)

 As a Microsoft board member, Hoffman said his focus will remain on LinkedIn itself, while also working to help Microsoft build more connections in Silicon Valley.
“And following the combination with Microsoft, LinkedIn now has new resources and technology assets to deploy as it moves forward,” he wrote. “Imagine a Cortana-like intelligent assistant helping you determine which third-degree connections make the most sense for you to pursue. Or LinkedIn Learning courseware that incorporates Microsoft’s HoloLens mixed reality technology for more immersive learning experiences.”
Microsoft also named LinkedIn’s Kevin Scott as its chief technology officer earlier this year.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Early life and education[edit]
Hoffman was born in Palo Alto, California, to Deanna Ruth (Rutter) and William Parker Hoffman, Jr., and grew up in Berkeley, California. His paternal great-great-great-grandfather was Theophilus Adam Wylie, a Christian Presbyterian minister and Indiana University president pro tempore.[5][6][7] Reid's uncle Eric Hoffman is a writer.[8][9]
Hoffman himself describes how he was an avid tabletop roleplaying gamer as a child.[10] His first paid job (at age 12) was as an editor at the game company Chaosium, then based in Oakland near his home.[11] Although 14 years old at the time, Hoffman's name features on the box of Chaosium's RuneQuest role-playing game release 'Borderlands' (1982), receiving equal billing with such prominent game designers as Steve Perrin, Sandy Petersen and Greg Stafford.[12]
Hoffman attended high school at The Putney School,[13] where he farmed maple syrup, drove oxen and studied epistemology.[14] He graduated from Stanford University in 1990, where he won both a Marshall Scholarship and a Dinkelspiel Award, with a B.S. in Symbolic Systems and Cognitive Science.[15] He went on to earn an M.A. in Philosophy from Wolfson College, Oxford University in 1993 as a Marshall Scholar.
Career[edit]
Early years[edit]
While in college, according to Hoffman, he formed a conviction that he wanted to try to influence the state of the world on a large scale.[14] He saw academia as an opportunity to make an "impact", but later realized that an entrepreneurial career would provide him with a larger platform. "When I graduated from Stanford my plan was to become a professor and public intellectual. That is not about quoting Kant. It's about holding up a lens to society and asking 'who are we?' and 'who should we be, as individuals and a society?' But I realised academics write books that 50 or 60 people read and I wanted more impact."[16]
With that in mind, Hoffman pursued a career in business and entrepreneurship. He joined Apple Computer in 1994, where he worked on eWorld, an early attempt at creating a social network. eWorld was acquired by AOL in 1996.[17] He later worked at Fujitsu before co-founding his first company – SocialNet.com in 1997. It focused “on online dating and matching up people with similar interests, like golfers who were looking for partners in their neighborhood.”[18] Peter Thiel has said SocialNet.com was “literally an idea before its time. It was a social network 7 or 8 years before that became a trend.”[17]
PayPal[edit]
While at SocialNet, Hoffman was a member of the board of directors during the founding of PayPal, an electronic money transmission service. In January 2000, he left SocialNet and joined PayPal full-time as the company's COO.[18] Allen Blue, whom Hoffman hired at PayPal, said that “PayPal had to scratch and claw for every advantage it had, and Reid became an expert at competing effectively in an extremely competitive environment."[17] Hoffman was responsible for all external relationships for PayPal, including payments infrastructure (VISA, MasterCard, ACH, WellsFargo), business development (eBay, Intuit, and others), government (regulatory, judicial), and legal. Peter Thiel, Hoffman's boss at PayPal, has said that Hoffman “was the firefighter-in-chief at PayPal. Though that diminishes his role because there were many, many fires.”[18] At the time of PayPal's acquisition by eBay for $1.5B in 2002, he was executive vice president of PayPal.
LinkedIn[edit]




Hoffman speaks at an event.


Hoffman co-founded LinkedIn in December 2002 with two former colleagues from SocialNet (including Allen Blue), a former college classmate and a former colleague from his time at Fujitsu.[14] It launched on May 5, 2003, as one of the first business-oriented online social networks.[19] Peter Thiel and Keith Rabois, colleagues of Hoffman's at PayPal, invested in LinkedIn.[14] By November 2014, LinkedIn had over 332 million members in more than 200 countries and territories.[19] The site allows registered users to create professional profiles and connect with each other. Users can invite anyone (whether a site user or not) to become a connection. According to Forbes, “LinkedIn is, far and away, the most advantageous social networking tool available to job seekers and business professionals today."[20]
Hoffman was LinkedIn's founding CEO for the first four years before becoming chairman and President, Products in February 2007. He became Executive chairman in June 2009.[21] With the IPO of LinkedIn on May 19, 2011, Hoffman owns a stake worth an estimated $2.34 billion, not including any potential benefits from Greylock Partners, where he was named a Partner in 2009.[22] Hoffman believes that many people still do not know how to use its service and it is LinkedIn's job to help them out. In an interview, Hoffman said that “you have to think proactively about how to use a tool that enables your ability to move in ways that you weren’t able to move before, and most of people are not very good at that”.[23]
Microsoft proposed to acquire LinkedIn on June 13, 2016 for $26.2 billion in cash.[24] Hoffman became a board member of Microsoft on March 14, 2017.[25]
Investing[edit]
After the PayPal sale to eBay, Hoffman became one of Silicon Valley's most prolific and successful angel investors. According to venture capitalist David Sze, Hoffman "is arguably the most successful angel investor in the past decade."[26] Dave Goldberg, former CEO of SurveyMonkey, said that Hoffman “is the person you want to talk to when you are starting a company.”[17] In 2010 Hoffman joined Greylock Partners and runs their $20 million Discovery Fund.[27] His areas of focus at Greylock include consumer and services, enterprise software, consumer Internet, enterprise 2.0, mobile, social gaming, online marketplaces, payments, and social networks.[28]
According to David Kirkpatrick's book The Facebook Effect, Hoffman arranged the first meeting between Mark Zuckerberg and Peter Thiel, which led to Thiel's initial $500,000 angel investment in Facebook. Hoffman invested alongside Thiel in Facebook's very first financing round.[29][30]
Hoffman’s current investments include Airbnb, One Kings Lane, Swipely, Viki, Coupons.com, Edmodo, Wrapp, TrialPay, Xapo, Change.org, Gixo, Blockstream,[31] Convoy, Segovia, Crowdpac[32] and Talko.[33][34] Past investments include 3DSolve, Flickr, Digg, shopkick, SixApart, Wikia, Permuto, thesixtyone, Tagged, IronPort, Ping.fm, Nanosolar, Care.com, Knewton, Kongregate, Last.fm, Technetto, Vendio and VigLink.[34] He served on Zynga’s board of directors from March 2008 to June 2014, and on shopkick's board of directors from its foundation in July 2009 until its acquisition by SK Telecom in October 2014.
Public intellectual work[edit]
Speaking[edit]
Hoffman has spoken at the XPrize Foundation's conference and the TED conference in Long Beach in 2012. He is a frequent lecturer at Stanford University, Oxford University, Harvard University, MIT's Media Lab, and others. He has appeared on The Charlie Rose Show, Fareed Zakaria's Global Public Square on CNN and other current affairs television programs.
Writing[edit]
Hoffman has published a variety of posts as a “LinkedIn Influencer” on LinkedIn. He published an essay proposing a new form of credentialing for university students and professionals entitled “Disrupting the Diploma.”[35] On his personal website, he published “LinkedIn’s Series B Pitch to Greylock: Pitch Advice for Entrepreneurs,” in which he analyzed LinkedIn’s 2004 Series B venture funding pitch deck and offered advice to prospective entrepreneurs on how to formulate a pitch deck.[36]
Hoffman has also written op-eds in the Washington Post, including one published in 2009 entitled “Let Startups Bail Us Out”[37] encouraging funding for grassroots innovation in the wake of the financial crisis and another in June 2013 entitled “Immigration promotes entrepreneurship and prosperity” advocating for immigration reform.[38] He has written for Strategy+Business on professional networking and is an "Influencer" on LinkedIn where he posts original written content.[39][40]
The Start-Up of You[edit]
Hoffman is co-author, with Ben Casnocha, of the career book The Start-Up of You: Adapt to the Future, Invest in Yourself, and Transform your Career.[14]
The book was released in the United States on February 14, 2012. It argues that individuals should think of themselves as businesses-of-one – the “CEO of their own career” – and draws many parallels between lessons learned from the stories of successful Silicon Valley technology companies and an individual’s career.[41]
Publishers Weekly reviewed the book positively, saying, “with plenty of valuable guidance relevant to any career stage, this book will help readers not only survive professionally in times of uncertainty but stand out from the pack and flourish.”[42] The Economist said that “Hoffman and Casnocha make a number of astute observations about shifts in the world of work.”[43]
As of September 2012 it had sold more than 100,000 copies.[44] It became both a New York Times and Wall Street Journal bestseller.[45][46] Business Insider republished visual summaries of The Start-Up of You, which have received over 13 million views.[47]
The Alliance[edit]
Hoffman is co-author, with Ben Casnocha and Chris Yeh, of the management book The Alliance: Managing Talent in the Networked Age.[48]
The book was released in the United States on July 8, 2014. It argues that previous career models of lifetime employment and free agency no longer work in a business world defined by continuous change. Instead, it proposes that employers and employees should think of each other as “allies” and move from a transactional approach to employment to a “relational” one. It proposes a new framework for managers and employers to organize their work, described as “tours of duty.” Further, it argues why managers should encourage their employees to gather “network intelligence” and why companies and managers should maintain a lifelong relationship with former employees via a corporate alumni network.[49]
The book became a New York Times bestseller.[50] Arianna Huffington named The Alliance “the must-read book of the summer” in 2014.[51]
Masters of scale[edit]
On 25 April 2017 Reid Hoffman announced the launch of a new podcast "Masters of scale" to promote a new form of leadership based on gender equality in the workplace.[52]
Honors and awards[edit]

In September 2014, the Academy of Achievement awarded Hoffman with the annual Golden Plate award, which honors accomplished individuals “for significant achievement in their fields.”[53]
In April 2014, President Barack Obama named Hoffman as a Presidential Ambassador for Global Entrepreneurship “to help develop the next generation of entrepreneurs.”[54]
In April 2014, Hoffman received the Distinguished Citizen Award from the Commonwealth Club.[55]
In May 2012, Hoffman was ranked third on the Forbes Midas List of the top tech investors.[56] Forbes described Hoffman as “Silicon Valley's uber-investor” and said Hoffman “has had a hand in creating nearly every lucrative social media startup.”[56]
In 2012, The Martin Luther King Jr. Center honored Hoffman with their "Salute to Greatness" award which "recognizes individuals and corporations or organizations that exemplify excellence in leadership and a commitment to social responsibility in the spirit of Martin Luther King, Jr."[57]
In 2012, Newsweek and The Daily Beast released their first "Digital Power Index," a list of the 100 most significant people in the digital world that year (plus 10 additional "Lifetime Achievement" winners), and Hoffman was ranked No. 3 in the "Angels" category.[58]
In 2012, Hoffman, along with Salman Khan of Khan Academy, was honored by the World Affairs Council and Global Philanthropy Forum in 2012. The council recognizes and honors remarkable leaders who have effected and will continue to effect social change through their private enterprise and social action. The awards in 2012 were dedicated to celebrating Technology for Social Impact.[59]
Hoffman was awarded the 2012 David Packard Medal of Achievement Award by TechAmerica for his contributions and advances within the high-tech industry, his community, and humankind.[60]
Hoffman received an Honorary Doctor of Laws from Babson in 2012.[61]
In 2011, Hoffman and Jeff Weiner of LinkedIn shared the EY U.S. Entrepreneur of the Year Award.[62]
In 2010, Hoffman was named No. 17 on Fast Company 's list of the 100 Most Creative People in Business.[63]

Personal life[edit]
In 2001, Hoffman married Michelle Yee. The couple has resided in Palo Alto, CA for 10 years.
Philanthropy[edit]
Jeff Weiner, LinkedIn's CEO, has said that “Reid's true worth is making a positive and lasting impact on the world, in a very profound way.”[17] Hoffman serves on the boards of Kiva.org (peer-peer microlending pioneer that allows people to lend money via the internet to low-income/underserved entrepreneurs and students), Mozilla (creator of Firefox),[64] Endeavor Global (an organization that finds and supports high-impact entrepreneurs in emerging markets) and Do Something (an organization motivating young people to take action around social changes). Hoffman also serves on the Advisory Council of the MIT Media Lab (an interdisciplinary research laboratory), and is a supporter and Chair of the Advisory Board for QuestBridge (a provider of talented low-income students to top colleges/universities).[65] Hoffman is one of the financial backers of OpenAI, a non-profit company aimed at the safe development of artificial general intelligence.[66] Hoffman is also a primary funder of Crisis Text Line, a free, 24/7 crisis service via SMS in the US.[67] In November 2016, Hoffman and his wife, Michelle Yee, donated $20 million to the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, a charity dedicated to eradicating disease by 2100. Hoffman and Yee's donation was for the Biohub, the Initiative's San Francisco laboratory. Hoffman also joined the board of the Biohub project.[68]
Politics[edit]
Hoffman is a member of the Bilderberg Group, which gathers 120-150 North American and European "political leaders and experts from industry, finance, academia and the media"[69] for an annual invitation-only closed-door conference that Hoffman attended in 2011 and 2012,[70] as well as every year since 2014.[71] Hoffman is also listed as a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, to which he was elected in 2015.[72][73]
In April 2013, a pro-immigration lobbying group called FWD.us was launched, with Reid Hoffman listed as one of the founders.[74]
In 2014, Hoffman donated $150,000 to the Mayday PAC[75]
In 2014 Hoffman contributed $500,000 toward David Chiu's State Assembly campaign by funding an independent expenditure committee devoted to negative campaigning against his opponent: San Franciscans to Hold Campos Accountable — Vote No for Campos for State Assembly 2014.[76]
In 2016, Hoffman contributed $220,000 in support of Democratic candidate for Vermont governor Matt Dunne, according to a mass-media disclosure filed at the Vermont Secretary of State’s Office.[77]
In 2016, Hoffman created Trumped Up Cards, a card game modeled after Cards Against Humanity intended to poke fun at US presidential candidate Donald Trump.[78]

Early life and education[edit]
Hoffman was born in Palo Alto, California, to Deanna Ruth (Rutter) and William Parker Hoffman, Jr., and grew up in Berkeley, California. His paternal great-great-great-grandfather was Theophilus Adam Wylie, a Christian Presbyterian minister and Indiana University president pro tempore.[5][6][7] Reid's uncle Eric Hoffman is a writer.[8][9]
Hoffman himself describes how he was an avid tabletop roleplaying gamer as a child.[10] His first paid job (at age 12) was as an editor at the game company Chaosium, then based in Oakland near his home.[11] Although 14 years old at the time, Hoffman's name features on the box of Chaosium's RuneQuest role-playing game release 'Borderlands' (1982), receiving equal billing with such prominent game designers as Steve Perrin, Sandy Petersen and Greg Stafford.[12]
Hoffman attended high school at The Putney School,[13] where he farmed maple syrup, drove oxen and studied epistemology.[14] He graduated from Stanford University in 1990, where he won both a Marshall Scholarship and a Dinkelspiel Award, with a B.S. in Symbolic Systems and Cognitive Science.[15] He went on to earn an M.A. in Philosophy from Wolfson College, Oxford University in 1993 as a Marshall Scholar.
Career[edit]
Early years[edit]
While in college, according to Hoffman, he formed a conviction that he wanted to try to influence the state of the world on a large scale.[14] He saw academia as an opportunity to make an "impact", but later realized that an entrepreneurial career would provide him with a larger platform. "When I graduated from Stanford my plan was to become a professor and public intellectual. That is not about quoting Kant. It's about holding up a lens to society and asking 'who are we?' and 'who should we be, as individuals and a society?' But I realised academics write books that 50 or 60 people read and I wanted more impact."[16]
With that in mind, Hoffman pursued a career in business and entrepreneurship. He joined Apple Computer in 1994, where he worked on eWorld, an early attempt at creating a social network. eWorld was acquired by AOL in 1996.[17] He later worked at Fujitsu before co-founding his first company – SocialNet.com in 1997. It focused “on online dating and matching up people with similar interests, like golfers who were looking for partners in their neighborhood.”[18] Peter Thiel has said SocialNet.com was “literally an idea before its time. It was a social network 7 or 8 years before that became a trend.”[17]
PayPal[edit]
While at SocialNet, Hoffman was a member of the board of directors during the founding of PayPal, an electronic money transmission service. In January 2000, he left SocialNet and joined PayPal full-time as the company's COO.[18] Allen Blue, whom Hoffman hired at PayPal, said that “PayPal had to scratch and claw for every advantage it had, and Reid became an expert at competing effectively in an extremely competitive environment."[17] Hoffman was responsible for all external relationships for PayPal, including payments infrastructure (VISA, MasterCard, ACH, WellsFargo), business development (eBay, Intuit, and others), government (regulatory, judicial), and legal. Peter Thiel, Hoffman's boss at PayPal, has said that Hoffman “was the firefighter-in-chief at PayPal. Though that diminishes his role because there were many, many fires.”[18] At the time of PayPal's acquisition by eBay for $1.5B in 2002, he was executive vice president of PayPal.
LinkedIn[edit]




Hoffman speaks at an event.


Hoffman co-founded LinkedIn in December 2002 with two former colleagues from SocialNet (including Allen Blue), a former college classmate and a former colleague from his time at Fujitsu.[14] It launched on May 5, 2003, as one of the first business-oriented online social networks.[19] Peter Thiel and Keith Rabois, colleagues of Hoffman's at PayPal, invested in LinkedIn.[14] By November 2014, LinkedIn had over 332 million members in more than 200 countries and territories.[19] The site allows registered users to create professional profiles and connect with each other. Users can invite anyone (whether a site user or not) to become a connection. According to Forbes, “LinkedIn is, far and away, the most advantageous social networking tool available to job seekers and business professionals today."[20]
Hoffman was LinkedIn's founding CEO for the first four years before becoming chairman and President, Products in February 2007. He became Executive chairman in June 2009.[21] With the IPO of LinkedIn on May 19, 2011, Hoffman owns a stake worth an estimated $2.34 billion, not including any potential benefits from Greylock Partners, where he was named a Partner in 2009.[22] Hoffman believes that many people still do not know how to use its service and it is LinkedIn's job to help them out. In an interview, Hoffman said that “you have to think proactively about how to use a tool that enables your ability to move in ways that you weren’t able to move before, and most of people are not very good at that”.[23]
Microsoft proposed to acquire LinkedIn on June 13, 2016 for $26.2 billion in cash.[24] Hoffman became a board member of Microsoft on March 14, 2017.[25]
Investing[edit]
After the PayPal sale to eBay, Hoffman became one of Silicon Valley's most prolific and successful angel investors. According to venture capitalist David Sze, Hoffman "is arguably the most successful angel investor in the past decade."[26] Dave Goldberg, former CEO of SurveyMonkey, said that Hoffman “is the person you want to talk to when you are starting a company.”[17] In 2010 Hoffman joined Greylock Partners and runs their $20 million Discovery Fund.[27] His areas of focus at Greylock include consumer and services, enterprise software, consumer Internet, enterprise 2.0, mobile, social gaming, online marketplaces, payments, and social networks.[28]
According to David Kirkpatrick's book The Facebook Effect, Hoffman arranged the first meeting between Mark Zuckerberg and Peter Thiel, which led to Thiel's initial $500,000 angel investment in Facebook. Hoffman invested alongside Thiel in Facebook's very first financing round.[29][30]
Hoffman’s current investments include Airbnb, One Kings Lane, Swipely, Viki, Coupons.com, Edmodo, Wrapp, TrialPay, Xapo, Change.org, Gixo, Blockstream,[31] Convoy, Segovia, Crowdpac[32] and Talko.[33][34] Past investments include 3DSolve, Flickr, Digg, shopkick, SixApart, Wikia, Permuto, thesixtyone, Tagged, IronPort, Ping.fm, Nanosolar, Care.com, Knewton, Kongregate, Last.fm, Technetto, Vendio and VigLink.[34] He served on Zynga’s board of directors from March 2008 to June 2014, and on shopkick's board of directors from its foundation in July 2009 until its acquisition by SK Telecom in October 2014.
Public intellectual work[edit]
Speaking[edit]
Hoffman has spoken at the XPrize Foundation's conference and the TED conference in Long Beach in 2012. He is a frequent lecturer at Stanford University, Oxford University, Harvard University, MIT's Media Lab, and others. He has appeared on The Charlie Rose Show, Fareed Zakaria's Global Public Square on CNN and other current affairs television programs.
Writing[edit]
Hoffman has published a variety of posts as a “LinkedIn Influencer” on LinkedIn. He published an essay proposing a new form of credentialing for university students and professionals entitled “Disrupting the Diploma.”[35] On his personal website, he published “LinkedIn’s Series B Pitch to Greylock: Pitch Advice for Entrepreneurs,” in which he analyzed LinkedIn’s 2004 Series B venture funding pitch deck and offered advice to prospective entrepreneurs on how to formulate a pitch deck.[36]
Hoffman has also written op-eds in the Washington Post, including one published in 2009 entitled “Let Startups Bail Us Out”[37] encouraging funding for grassroots innovation in the wake of the financial crisis and another in June 2013 entitled “Immigration promotes entrepreneurship and prosperity” advocating for immigration reform.[38] He has written for Strategy+Business on professional networking and is an "Influencer" on LinkedIn where he posts original written content.[39][40]
The Start-Up of You[edit]
Hoffman is co-author, with Ben Casnocha, of the career book The Start-Up of You: Adapt to the Future, Invest in Yourself, and Transform your Career.[14]
The book was released in the United States on February 14, 2012. It argues that individuals should think of themselves as businesses-of-one – the “CEO of their own career” – and draws many parallels between lessons learned from the stories of successful Silicon Valley technology companies and an individual’s career.[41]
Publishers Weekly reviewed the book positively, saying, “with plenty of valuable guidance relevant to any career stage, this book will help readers not only survive professionally in times of uncertainty but stand out from the pack and flourish.”[42] The Economist said that “Hoffman and Casnocha make a number of astute observations about shifts in the world of work.”[43]
As of September 2012 it had sold more than 100,000 copies.[44] It became both a New York Times and Wall Street Journal bestseller.[45][46] Business Insider republished visual summaries of The Start-Up of You, which have received over 13 million views.[47]
The Alliance[edit]
Hoffman is co-author, with Ben Casnocha and Chris Yeh, of the management book The Alliance: Managing Talent in the Networked Age.[48]
The book was released in the United States on July 8, 2014. It argues that previous career models of lifetime employment and free agency no longer work in a business world defined by continuous change. Instead, it proposes that employers and employees should think of each other as “allies” and move from a transactional approach to employment to a “relational” one. It proposes a new framework for managers and employers to organize their work, described as “tours of duty.” Further, it argues why managers should encourage their employees to gather “network intelligence” and why companies and managers should maintain a lifelong relationship with former employees via a corporate alumni network.[49]
The book became a New York Times bestseller.[50] Arianna Huffington named The Alliance “the must-read book of the summer” in 2014.[51]
Masters of scale[edit]
On 25 April 2017 Reid Hoffman announced the launch of a new podcast "Masters of scale" to promote a new form of leadership based on gender equality in the workplace.[52]
Honors and awards[edit]

In September 2014, the Academy of Achievement awarded Hoffman with the annual Golden Plate award, which honors accomplished individuals “for significant achievement in their fields.”[53]
In April 2014, President Barack Obama named Hoffman as a Presidential Ambassador for Global Entrepreneurship “to help develop the next generation of entrepreneurs.”[54]
In April 2014, Hoffman received the Distinguished Citizen Award from the Commonwealth Club.[55]
In May 2012, Hoffman was ranked third on the Forbes Midas List of the top tech investors.[56] Forbes described Hoffman as “Silicon Valley's uber-investor” and said Hoffman “has had a hand in creating nearly every lucrative social media startup.”[56]
In 2012, The Martin Luther King Jr. Center honored Hoffman with their "Salute to Greatness" award which "recognizes individuals and corporations or organizations that exemplify excellence in leadership and a commitment to social responsibility in the spirit of Martin Luther King, Jr."[57]
In 2012, Newsweek and The Daily Beast released their first "Digital Power Index," a list of the 100 most significant people in the digital world that year (plus 10 additional "Lifetime Achievement" winners), and Hoffman was ranked No. 3 in the "Angels" category.[58]
In 2012, Hoffman, along with Salman Khan of Khan Academy, was honored by the World Affairs Council and Global Philanthropy Forum in 2012. The council recognizes and honors remarkable leaders who have effected and will continue to effect social change through their private enterprise and social action. The awards in 2012 were dedicated to celebrating Technology for Social Impact.[59]
Hoffman was awarded the 2012 David Packard Medal of Achievement Award by TechAmerica for his contributions and advances within the high-tech industry, his community, and humankind.[60]
Hoffman received an Honorary Doctor of Laws from Babson in 2012.[61]
In 2011, Hoffman and Jeff Weiner of LinkedIn shared the EY U.S. Entrepreneur of the Year Award.[62]
In 2010, Hoffman was named No. 17 on Fast Company 's list of the 100 Most Creative People in Business.[63]

Personal life[edit]
In 2001, Hoffman married Michelle Yee. The couple has resided in Palo Alto, CA for 10 years.
Philanthropy[edit]
Jeff Weiner, LinkedIn's CEO, has said that “Reid's true worth is making a positive and lasting impact on the world, in a very profound way.”[17] Hoffman serves on the boards of Kiva.org (peer-peer microlending pioneer that allows people to lend money via the internet to low-income/underserved entrepreneurs and students), Mozilla (creator of Firefox),[64] Endeavor Global (an organization that finds and supports high-impact entrepreneurs in emerging markets) and Do Something (an organization motivating young people to take action around social changes). Hoffman also serves on the Advisory Council of the MIT Media Lab (an interdisciplinary research laboratory), and is a supporter and Chair of the Advisory Board for QuestBridge (a provider of talented low-income students to top colleges/universities).[65] Hoffman is one of the financial backers of OpenAI, a non-profit company aimed at the safe development of artificial general intelligence.[66] Hoffman is also a primary funder of Crisis Text Line, a free, 24/7 crisis service via SMS in the US.[67] In November 2016, Hoffman and his wife, Michelle Yee, donated $20 million to the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, a charity dedicated to eradicating disease by 2100. Hoffman and Yee's donation was for the Biohub, the Initiative's San Francisco laboratory. Hoffman also joined the board of the Biohub project.[68]
Politics[edit]
Hoffman is a member of the Bilderberg Group, which gathers 120-150 North American and European "political leaders and experts from industry, finance, academia and the media"[69] for an annual invitation-only closed-door conference that Hoffman attended in 2011 and 2012,[70] as well as every year since 2014.[71] Hoffman is also listed as a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, to which he was elected in 2015.[72][73]
In April 2013, a pro-immigration lobbying group called FWD.us was launched, with Reid Hoffman listed as one of the founders.[74]

In 2014 Hoffman contributed $500,000 toward David Chiu's State Assembly campaign by funding an independent expenditure committee devoted to negative campaigning against his opponent: San Franciscans to Hold Campos Accountable — Vote No for Campos for State Assembly 2014.[76]
In 2016, Hoffman contributed $220,000 in support of Democratic candidate for Vermont governor Matt Dunne, according to a mass-media disclosure filed at the Vermont Secretary of State’s Office.[77]
In 2016, Hoffman created Trumped Up Cards, a card game modeled after Cards Against Humanity intended to poke fun at US presidential candidate Donald Trump.[78]

Early life and education[edit]
Hoffman was born in Palo Alto, California, to Deanna Ruth (Rutter) and William Parker Hoffman, Jr., and grew up in Berkeley, California. His paternal great-great-great-grandfather was Theophilus Adam Wylie, a Christian Presbyterian minister and Indiana University president pro tempore.[5][6][7] Reid's uncle Eric Hoffman is a writer.[8][9]
Hoffman himself describes how he was an avid tabletop roleplaying gamer as a child.[10] His first paid job (at age 12) was as an editor at the game company Chaosium, then based in Oakland near his home.[11] Although 14 years old at the time, Hoffman's name features on the box of Chaosium's RuneQuest role-playing game release 'Borderlands' (1982), receiving equal billing with such prominent game designers as Steve Perrin, Sandy Petersen and Greg Stafford.[12]
Hoffman attended high school at The Putney School,[13] where he farmed maple syrup, drove oxen and studied epistemology.[14] He graduated from Stanford University in 1990, where he won both a Marshall Scholarship and a Dinkelspiel Award, with a B.S. in Symbolic Systems and Cognitive Science.[15] He went on to earn an M.A. in Philosophy from Wolfson College, Oxford University in 1993 as a Marshall Scholar.
Career[edit]
Early years[edit]
While in college, according to Hoffman, he formed a conviction that he wanted to try to influence the state of the world on a large scale.[14] He saw academia as an opportunity to make an "impact", but later realized that an entrepreneurial career would provide him with a larger platform. "When I graduated from Stanford my plan was to become a professor and public intellectual. That is not about quoting Kant. It's about holding up a lens to society and asking 'who are we?' and 'who should we be, as individuals and a society?' But I realised academics write books that 50 or 60 people read and I wanted more impact."[16]
With that in mind, Hoffman pursued a career in business and entrepreneurship. He joined Apple Computer in 1994, where he worked on eWorld, an early attempt at creating a social network. eWorld was acquired by AOL in 1996.[17] He later worked at Fujitsu before co-founding his first company – SocialNet.com in 1997. It focused “on online dating and matching up people with similar interests, like golfers who were looking for partners in their neighborhood.”[18] Peter Thiel has said SocialNet.com was “literally an idea before its time. It was a social network 7 or 8 years before that became a trend.”[17]
PayPal[edit]
While at SocialNet, Hoffman was a member of the board of directors during the founding of PayPal, an electronic money transmission service. In January 2000, he left SocialNet and joined PayPal full-time as the company's COO.[18] Allen Blue, whom Hoffman hired at PayPal, said that “PayPal had to scratch and claw for every advantage it had, and Reid became an expert at competing effectively in an extremely competitive environment."[17] Hoffman was responsible for all external relationships for PayPal, including payments infrastructure (VISA, MasterCard, ACH, WellsFargo), business development (eBay, Intuit, and others), government (regulatory, judicial), and legal. Peter Thiel, Hoffman's boss at PayPal, has said that Hoffman “was the firefighter-in-chief at PayPal. Though that diminishes his role because there were many, many fires.”[18] At the time of PayPal's acquisition by eBay for $1.5B in 2002, he was executive vice president of PayPal.
LinkedIn[edit]




Hoffman speaks at an event.


Hoffman co-founded LinkedIn in December 2002 with two former colleagues from SocialNet (including Allen Blue), a former college classmate and a former colleague from his time at Fujitsu.[14] It launched on May 5, 2003, as one of the first business-oriented online social networks.[19] Peter Thiel and Keith Rabois, colleagues of Hoffman's at PayPal, invested in LinkedIn.[14] By November 2014, LinkedIn had over 332 million members in more than 200 countries and territories.[19] The site allows registered users to create professional profiles and connect with each other. Users can invite anyone (whether a site user or not) to become a connection. According to Forbes, “LinkedIn is, far and away, the most advantageous social networking tool available to job seekers and business professionals today."[20]
Hoffman was LinkedIn's founding CEO for the first four years before becoming chairman and President, Products in February 2007. He became Executive chairman in June 2009.[21] With the IPO of LinkedIn on May 19, 2011, Hoffman owns a stake worth an estimated $2.34 billion, not including any potential benefits from Greylock Partners, where he was named a Partner in 2009.[22] Hoffman believes that many people still do not know how to use its service and it is LinkedIn's job to help them out. In an interview, Hoffman said that “you have to think proactively about how to use a tool that enables your ability to move in ways that you weren’t able to move before, and most of people are not very good at that”.[23]
Microsoft proposed to acquire LinkedIn on June 13, 2016 for $26.2 billion in cash.[24] Hoffman became a board member of Microsoft on March 14, 2017.[25]
Investing[edit]
After the PayPal sale to eBay, Hoffman became one of Silicon Valley's most prolific and successful angel investors. According to venture capitalist David Sze, Hoffman "is arguably the most successful angel investor in the past decade."[26] Dave Goldberg, former CEO of SurveyMonkey, said that Hoffman “is the person you want to talk to when you are starting a company.”[17] In 2010 Hoffman joined Greylock Partners and runs their $20 million Discovery Fund.[27] His areas of focus at Greylock include consumer and services, enterprise software, consumer Internet, enterprise 2.0, mobile, social gaming, online marketplaces, payments, and social networks.[28]
According to David Kirkpatrick's book The Facebook Effect, Hoffman arranged the first meeting between Mark Zuckerberg and Peter Thiel, which led to Thiel's initial $500,000 angel investment in Facebook. Hoffman invested alongside Thiel in Facebook's very first financing round.[29][30]
Hoffman’s current investments include Airbnb, One Kings Lane, Swipely, Viki, Coupons.com, Edmodo, Wrapp, TrialPay, Xapo, Change.org, Gixo, Blockstream,[31] Convoy, Segovia, Crowdpac[32] and Talko.[33][34] Past investments include 3DSolve, Flickr, Digg, shopkick, SixApart, Wikia, Permuto, thesixtyone, Tagged, IronPort, Ping.fm, Nanosolar, Care.com, Knewton, Kongregate, Last.fm, Technetto, Vendio and VigLink.[34] He served on Zynga’s board of directors from March 2008 to June 2014, and on shopkick's board of directors from its foundation in July 2009 until its acquisition by SK Telecom in October 2014.
Public intellectual work[edit]
Speaking[edit]
Hoffman has spoken at the XPrize Foundation's conference and the TED conference in Long Beach in 2012. He is a frequent lecturer at Stanford University, Oxford University, Harvard University, MIT's Media Lab, and others. He has appeared on The Charlie Rose Show, Fareed Zakaria's Global Public Square on CNN and other current affairs television programs.
Writing[edit]
Hoffman has published a variety of posts as a “LinkedIn Influencer” on LinkedIn. He published an essay proposing a new form of credentialing for university students and professionals entitled “Disrupting the Diploma.”[35] On his personal website, he published “LinkedIn’s Series B Pitch to Greylock: Pitch Advice for Entrepreneurs,” in which he analyzed LinkedIn’s 2004 Series B venture funding pitch deck and offered advice to prospective entrepreneurs on how to formulate a pitch deck.[36]
Hoffman has also written op-eds in the Washington Post, including one published in 2009 entitled “Let Startups Bail Us Out”[37] encouraging funding for grassroots innovation in the wake of the financial crisis and another in June 2013 entitled “Immigration promotes entrepreneurship and prosperity” advocating for immigration reform.[38] He has written for Strategy+Business on professional networking and is an "Influencer" on LinkedIn where he posts original written content.[39][40]
The Start-Up of You[edit]
Hoffman is co-author, with Ben Casnocha, of the career book The Start-Up of You: Adapt to the Future, Invest in Yourself, and Transform your Career.[14]
The book was released in the United States on February 14, 2012. It argues that individuals should think of themselves as businesses-of-one – the “CEO of their own career” – and draws many parallels between lessons learned from the stories of successful Silicon Valley technology companies and an individual’s career.[41]
Publishers Weekly reviewed the book positively, saying, “with plenty of valuable guidance relevant to any career stage, this book will help readers not only survive professionally in times of uncertainty but stand out from the pack and flourish.”[42] The Economist said that “Hoffman and Casnocha make a number of astute observations about shifts in the world of work.”[43]
As of September 2012 it had sold more than 100,000 copies.[44] It became both a New York Times and Wall Street Journal bestseller.[45][46] Business Insider republished visual summaries of The Start-Up of You, which have received over 13 million views.[47]
The Alliance[edit]
Hoffman is co-author, with Ben Casnocha and Chris Yeh, of the management book The Alliance: Managing Talent in the Networked Age.[48]
The book was released in the United States on July 8, 2014. It argues that previous career models of lifetime employment and free agency no longer work in a business world defined by continuous change. Instead, it proposes that employers and employees should think of each other as “allies” and move from a transactional approach to employment to a “relational” one. It proposes a new framework for managers and employers to organize their work, described as “tours of duty.” Further, it argues why managers should encourage their employees to gather “network intelligence” and why companies and managers should maintain a lifelong relationship with former employees via a corporate alumni network.[49]
The book became a New York Times bestseller.[50] Arianna Huffington named The Alliance “the must-read book of the summer” in 2014.[51]
Masters of scale[edit]
On 25 April 2017 Reid Hoffman announced the launch of a new podcast "Masters of scale" to promote a new form of leadership based on gender equality in the workplace.[52]
Honors and awards[edit]

In September 2014, the Academy of Achievement awarded Hoffman with the annual Golden Plate award, which honors accomplished individuals “for significant achievement in their fields.”[53]
In April 2014, President Barack Obama named Hoffman as a Presidential Ambassador for Global Entrepreneurship “to help develop the next generation of entrepreneurs.”[54]
In April 2014, Hoffman received the Distinguished Citizen Award from the Commonwealth Club.[55]
In May 2012, Hoffman was ranked third on the Forbes Midas List of the top tech investors.[56] Forbes described Hoffman as “Silicon Valley's uber-investor” and said Hoffman “has had a hand in creating nearly every lucrative social media startup.”[56]
In 2012, The Martin Luther King Jr. Center honored Hoffman with their "Salute to Greatness" award which "recognizes individuals and corporations or organizations that exemplify excellence in leadership and a commitment to social responsibility in the spirit of Martin Luther King, Jr."[57]
In 2012, Newsweek and The Daily Beast released their first "Digital Power Index," a list of the 100 most significant people in the digital world that year (plus 10 additional "Lifetime Achievement" winners), and Hoffman was ranked No. 3 in the "Angels" category.[58]
In 2012, Hoffman, along with Salman Khan of Khan Academy, was honored by the World Affairs Council and Global Philanthropy Forum in 2012. The council recognizes and honors remarkable leaders who have effected and will continue to effect social change through their private enterprise and social action. The awards in 2012 were dedicated to celebrating Technology for Social Impact.[59]
Hoffman was awarded the 2012 David Packard Medal of Achievement Award by TechAmerica for his contributions and advances within the high-tech industry, his community, and humankind.[60]
Hoffman received an Honorary Doctor of Laws from Babson in 2012.[61]
In 2011, Hoffman and Jeff Weiner of LinkedIn shared the EY U.S. Entrepreneur of the Year Award.[62]
In 2010, Hoffman was named No. 17 on Fast Company 's list of the 100 Most Creative People in Business.[63]

Personal life[edit]
In 2001, Hoffman married Michelle Yee. The couple has resided in Palo Alto, CA for 10 years.
Philanthropy[edit]
Jeff Weiner, LinkedIn's CEO, has said that “Reid's true worth is making a positive and lasting impact on the world, in a very profound way.”[17] Hoffman serves on the boards of Kiva.org (peer-peer microlending pioneer that allows people to lend money via the internet to low-income/underserved entrepreneurs and students), Mozilla (creator of Firefox),[64] Endeavor Global (an organization that finds and supports high-impact entrepreneurs in emerging markets) and Do Something (an organization motivating young people to take action around social changes). Hoffman also serves on the Advisory Council of the MIT Media Lab (an interdisciplinary research laboratory), and is a supporter and Chair of the Advisory Board for QuestBridge (a provider of talented low-income students to top colleges/universities).[65] Hoffman is one of the financial backers of OpenAI, a non-profit company aimed at the safe development of artificial general intelligence.[66] Hoffman is also a primary funder of Crisis Text Line, a free, 24/7 crisis service via SMS in the US.[67] In November 2016, Hoffman and his wife, Michelle Yee, donated $20 million to the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, a charity dedicated to eradicating disease by 2100. Hoffman and Yee's donation was for the Biohub, the Initiative's San Francisco laboratory. Hoffman also joined the board of the Biohub project.[68]
Politics[edit]
Hoffman is a member of the Bilderberg Group, which gathers 120-150 North American and European "political leaders and experts from industry, finance, academia and the media"[69] for an annual invitation-only closed-door conference that Hoffman attended in 2011 and 2012,[70] as well as every year since 2014.[71] Hoffman is also listed as a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, to which he was elected in 2015.[72][73]
In April 2013, a pro-immigration lobbying group called FWD.us was launched, with Reid Hoffman listed as one of the founders.[74]

In 2014 Hoffman contributed $500,000 toward David Chiu's State Assembly campaign by funding an independent expenditure committee devoted to negative campaigning against his opponent: San Franciscans to Hold Campos Accountable — Vote No for Campos for State Assembly 2014.[76]
In 2016, Hoffman contributed $220,000 in support of Democratic candidate for Vermont governor Matt Dunne, according to a mass-media disclosure filed at the Vermont Secretary of State’s Office.[77]
In 2016, Hoffman created Trumped Up Cards, a card game modeled after Cards Against Humanity intended to poke fun at US presidential candidate Donald Trump.[78]

First episode out May 3! This is from WaitWhat - a content incubator founded by former TED executives June Cohen and Deron Triff, in association with Stitcher.

You can read more on Entrepreneur magazine here and as the official media partner, they have a special online hub where the conversation continues with Reid, inviting entrepreneurs to write and speak about their own experiences, and to react to Hoffman’s theories

Reminds me of the series  7Share·3 months agoTim Knowles@timrknowles · Product Guy@bentossell Based on the Blitzscaling series (and of course, Reid's CV)  it's safe to say that this is going to be next level!

I think I recall hearing that Reid was putting together a book on the topic of Blitzscaling, so perhaps this is the precursor to that?

The Stanford CS183 class has become synonymous with tech entrepreneurship. Peter Thiel taught CS183 there in 2012, which served as the foundations for his book Zero to One.  Sam Altman followed it up in 2014 with a series called "How to Start a Startup". And then Greylock/Reid Hoffman, John Lilly, Chris Yeh, and Allen Blue taught a class called Blitscaling (Stanford CS183c) in fall 2015.  I wonder what'll be next?

For anyone interested in Masters of Scale, head over to the Greylock Youtube Channel and check out the Blitzscaling videos, you won't be disappointed. 1Share·3 months ago⚡️ Deandre Durr☀️@dredurr · Growth HackerHuge Fan of Reid Hoffman

Reid Hoffman: A.I. Is Going to Change Everything About Managing Teams


Imagine a spider chart mapping a complex web of interactions, sentiments, and workflow within an office. What would your company look like?

When most of us think of artificial intelligence in the workplace, we imagine automated assembly lines of robots managed by an algorithm. LinkedIn's Reid Hoffman has a different idea.
In an essay for MIT Sloan Management Review, Hoffman describes human applications for the technology. Among other things, it would help to use data science to improve the way we onboard new team members, organize workflow, and communicate about performance. Addressing the question of how technology will change management practices over the next five years, Hoffman explains how the use of a "knowledge graph" will become standard management practice.
Imagine a spider chart mapping the complex web of interactions and data transfers within your company. A.I. can process large amounts of files, emails, and data providing unprecedented access to information about how we delegate work, tackle assignments, and deliver results.
This kind of oversight can sound intimidating, and many skeptics worry about invasion of privacy and worker displacement with the rise of A.I. But Hoffman, like tech-industry colleagues including Sam Altman, Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, and Jessica Livingston, is a proponent of the OpenAI project, which seeks to develop technology that will help, not harm, humanity. Here are three ways he thinks A.I. could help your office run more smoothly.
1. Faster onboarding
New hires spend weeks getting up to speed--meeting with new colleagues, reading through files, and navigating internal processes. Hoffman says a knowledge graph, full of information gathered before the new employee was hired, can answer questions like "Who do I need to work with on the new office move? What were the meetings where it was discussed? When is our next status meeting?" Simple questions, perhaps, but with dozens of such hurdles and no knowledge of company processes, a new employee would save time having a digital repository for the minutiae of orientation.
2. More efficient workflow
Forget emailed meeting recaps. A.I., as Hoffman sees it, will process decisions and assignments made in the conference room and integrate them into the knowledge graph. He points out that the technology for classification and pattern matching already exists, as demonstrated by Google's search box autocomplete and Amazon's product recommendations. In addition to linking decisions with assignments and steps needed to complete a project, Hoffman thinks A.I. has the potential to measure less tangible workplace influences. He envisions a dashboard that combs internal communication to assess workplace sentiment. Knowing what issues are being discussed most frequently, what concerns are most often analyzed, and how financial and emotional capital are used could provide a valuable layer of insight for managers. Hoffman credits Joi Ito, director of the MIT Media Lab, for the term "extended intelligence," or "treating intelligence as a network phenomenon and using A.I. to enhance, rather than replace, human intelligence."
3. Objective performance reviews
Hoffman cites a staggering figure from a Deloitte study that found only 8 percent of organizations said annual performance reviews were worth the effort they require. While some jobs are easier to measure--widgets sold, new customers acquired--what counts as success in most positions is more subjective. Differing opinions, workplace politics, and unconscious bias take their toll on performance reviews. A knowledge web could capture every tiny detail of who proposed a key idea in a long-ago meeting and who managed the tasks to make it happen. "If performance management were a movie, it will become less Gladiator, and more Moneyball," Hoffman writes. To be clear, he doesn't see an end to the need for people skills at work and human judgment in reviews, but he argues A.I. can help managers objectively identify patterns in workers' strengths and weaknesses. That can then help managers make assignment decisions.

Editor’s Note: In the new podcast Masters of Scale, LinkedIn co-founder and Greylock partner Reid Hoffman explores his philosophy on how to scale a business -- and at Entrepreneur.com, entrepreneurs are responding with their own ideas and experiences on our hub.Waiting to launch your product? Don’t.Launching early -- earlier than you think you should -- is a major lesson from Masters of Scale a 10-episode podcast about scaling a company hosted by Reid Hoffman, the co-founder of LinkedIn and partner at Greylock.In the series, Hoffman talks to big-name leaders such as Mark Zuckerberg and Marc Pincus of Zynga. They explain that every moment you delay your launch is another moment you can’t grow your customer base, get needed feedback and drive revenue. And as you wait, you give your competitors one of the most valuable assets early-stage companies have: a head start.Related: Why Mark Zuckerberg Runs 10,000 Facebook Versions a Day“Your assumptions about what your users want are never exactly right,” Hoffman says in the fourth episode, Imperfect is Perfect. “You need to test a real product with real customers as soon as possible. It’s the fastest way to build something users can’t resist.”Related: When It Makes Sense to Release an Imperfect ProductWatch this short video and get more hard-won insights on launching early from other top leaders.

Early life and education[edit]
Hoffman was born in Palo Alto, California, to Deanna Ruth (Rutter) and William Parker Hoffman, Jr., and grew up in Berkeley, California. His paternal great-great-great-grandfather was Theophilus Adam Wylie, a Christian Presbyterian minister and Indiana University president pro tempore.[5][6][7] Reid's uncle Eric Hoffman is a writer.[8][9]
Hoffman himself describes how he was an avid tabletop roleplaying gamer as a child.[10] His first paid job (at age 12) was as an editor at the game company Chaosium, then based in Oakland near his home.[11] Although 14 years old at the time, Hoffman's name features on the box of Chaosium's RuneQuest role-playing game release 'Borderlands' (1982), receiving equal billing with such prominent game designers as Steve Perrin, Sandy Petersen and Greg Stafford.[12]
Hoffman attended high school at The Putney School,[13] where he farmed maple syrup, drove oxen and studied epistemology.[14] He graduated from Stanford University in 1990, where he won both a Marshall Scholarship and a Dinkelspiel Award, with a B.S. in Symbolic Systems and Cognitive Science.[15] He went on to earn an M.A. in Philosophy from Wolfson College, Oxford University in 1993 as a Marshall Scholar.
Career[edit]
Early years[edit]
While in college, according to Hoffman, he formed a conviction that he wanted to try to influence the state of the world on a large scale.[14] He saw academia as an opportunity to make an "impact", but later realized that an entrepreneurial career would provide him with a larger platform. "When I graduated from Stanford my plan was to become a professor and public intellectual. That is not about quoting Kant. It's about holding up a lens to society and asking 'who are we?' and 'who should we be, as individuals and a society?' But I realised academics write books that 50 or 60 people read and I wanted more impact."[16]
With that in mind, Hoffman pursued a career in business and entrepreneurship. He joined Apple Computer in 1994, where he worked on eWorld, an early attempt at creating a social network. eWorld was acquired by AOL in 1996.[17] He later worked at Fujitsu before co-founding his first company – SocialNet.com in 1997. It focused “on online dating and matching up people with similar interests, like golfers who were looking for partners in their neighborhood.”[18] Peter Thiel has said SocialNet.com was “literally an idea before its time. It was a social network 7 or 8 years before that became a trend.”[17]
PayPal[edit]
While at SocialNet, Hoffman was a member of the board of directors during the founding of PayPal, an electronic money transmission service. In January 2000, he left SocialNet and joined PayPal full-time as the company's COO.[18] Allen Blue, whom Hoffman hired at PayPal, said that “PayPal had to scratch and claw for every advantage it had, and Reid became an expert at competing effectively in an extremely competitive environment."[17] Hoffman was responsible for all external relationships for PayPal, including payments infrastructure (VISA, MasterCard, ACH, WellsFargo), business development (eBay, Intuit, and others), government (regulatory, judicial), and legal. Peter Thiel, Hoffman's boss at PayPal, has said that Hoffman “was the firefighter-in-chief at PayPal. Though that diminishes his role because there were many, many fires.”[18] At the time of PayPal's acquisition by eBay for $1.5B in 2002, he was executive vice president of PayPal.
LinkedIn[edit]




Hoffman speaks at an event.


Hoffman co-founded LinkedIn in December 2002 with two former colleagues from SocialNet (including Allen Blue), a former college classmate and a former colleague from his time at Fujitsu.[14] It launched on May 5, 2003, as one of the first business-oriented online social networks.[19] Peter Thiel and Keith Rabois, colleagues of Hoffman's at PayPal, invested in LinkedIn.[14] By November 2014, LinkedIn had over 332 million members in more than 200 countries and territories.[19] The site allows registered users to create professional profiles and connect with each other. Users can invite anyone (whether a site user or not) to become a connection. According to Forbes, “LinkedIn is, far and away, the most advantageous social networking tool available to job seekers and business professionals today."[20]
Hoffman was LinkedIn's founding CEO for the first four years before becoming chairman and President, Products in February 2007. He became Executive chairman in June 2009.[21] With the IPO of LinkedIn on May 19, 2011, Hoffman owns a stake worth an estimated $2.34 billion, not including any potential benefits from Greylock Partners, where he was named a Partner in 2009.[22] Hoffman believes that many people still do not know how to use its service and it is LinkedIn's job to help them out. In an interview, Hoffman said that “you have to think proactively about how to use a tool that enables your ability to move in ways that you weren’t able to move before, and most of people are not very good at that”.[23]
Microsoft proposed to acquire LinkedIn on June 13, 2016 for $26.2 billion in cash.[24] Hoffman became a board member of Microsoft on March 14, 2017.[25]
Investing[edit]
After the PayPal sale to eBay, Hoffman became one of Silicon Valley's most prolific and successful angel investors. According to venture capitalist David Sze, Hoffman "is arguably the most successful angel investor in the past decade."[26] Dave Goldberg, former CEO of SurveyMonkey, said that Hoffman “is the person you want to talk to when you are starting a company.”[17] In 2010 Hoffman joined Greylock Partners and runs their $20 million Discovery Fund.[27] His areas of focus at Greylock include consumer and services, enterprise software, consumer Internet, enterprise 2.0, mobile, social gaming, online marketplaces, payments, and social networks.[28]
According to David Kirkpatrick's book The Facebook Effect, Hoffman arranged the first meeting between Mark Zuckerberg and Peter Thiel, which led to Thiel's initial $500,000 angel investment in Facebook. Hoffman invested alongside Thiel in Facebook's very first financing round.[29][30]
Hoffman’s current investments include Airbnb, One Kings Lane, Swipely, Viki, Coupons.com, Edmodo, Wrapp, TrialPay, Xapo, Change.org, Gixo, Blockstream,[31] Convoy, Segovia, Crowdpac[32] and Talko.[33][34] Past investments include 3DSolve, Flickr, Digg, shopkick, SixApart, Wikia, Permuto, thesixtyone, Tagged, IronPort, Ping.fm, Nanosolar, Care.com, Knewton, Kongregate, Last.fm, Technetto, Vendio and VigLink.[34] He served on Zynga’s board of directors from March 2008 to June 2014, and on shopkick's board of directors from its foundation in July 2009 until its acquisition by SK Telecom in October 2014.
Public intellectual work[edit]
Speaking[edit]
Hoffman has spoken at the XPrize Foundation's conference and the TED conference in Long Beach in 2012. He is a frequent lecturer at Stanford University, Oxford University, Harvard University, MIT's Media Lab, and others. He has appeared on The Charlie Rose Show, Fareed Zakaria's Global Public Square on CNN and other current affairs television programs.
Writing[edit]
Hoffman has published a variety of posts as a “LinkedIn Influencer” on LinkedIn. He published an essay proposing a new form of credentialing for university students and professionals entitled “Disrupting the Diploma.”[35] On his personal website, he published “LinkedIn’s Series B Pitch to Greylock: Pitch Advice for Entrepreneurs,” in which he analyzed LinkedIn’s 2004 Series B venture funding pitch deck and offered advice to prospective entrepreneurs on how to formulate a pitch deck.[36]
Hoffman has also written op-eds in the Washington Post, including one published in 2009 entitled “Let Startups Bail Us Out”[37] encouraging funding for grassroots innovation in the wake of the financial crisis and another in June 2013 entitled “Immigration promotes entrepreneurship and prosperity” advocating for immigration reform.[38] He has written for Strategy+Business on professional networking and is an "Influencer" on LinkedIn where he posts original written content.[39][40]
The Start-Up of You[edit]
Hoffman is co-author, with Ben Casnocha, of the career book The Start-Up of You: Adapt to the Future, Invest in Yourself, and Transform your Career.[14]
The book was released in the United States on February 14, 2012. It argues that individuals should think of themselves as businesses-of-one – the “CEO of their own career” – and draws many parallels between lessons learned from the stories of successful Silicon Valley technology companies and an individual’s career.[41]
Publishers Weekly reviewed the book positively, saying, “with plenty of valuable guidance relevant to any career stage, this book will help readers not only survive professionally in times of uncertainty but stand out from the pack and flourish.”[42] The Economist said that “Hoffman and Casnocha make a number of astute observations about shifts in the world of work.”[43]
As of September 2012 it had sold more than 100,000 copies.[44] It became both a New York Times and Wall Street Journal bestseller.[45][46] Business Insider republished visual summaries of The Start-Up of You, which have received over 13 million views.[47]
The Alliance[edit]
Hoffman is co-author, with Ben Casnocha and Chris Yeh, of the management book The Alliance: Managing Talent in the Networked Age.[48]
The book was released in the United States on July 8, 2014. It argues that previous career models of lifetime employment and free agency no longer work in a business world defined by continuous change. Instead, it proposes that employers and employees should think of each other as “allies” and move from a transactional approach to employment to a “relational” one. It proposes a new framework for managers and employers to organize their work, described as “tours of duty.” Further, it argues why managers should encourage their employees to gather “network intelligence” and why companies and managers should maintain a lifelong relationship with former employees via a corporate alumni network.[49]
The book became a New York Times bestseller.[50] Arianna Huffington named The Alliance “the must-read book of the summer” in 2014.[51]
Masters of scale[edit]
On 25 April 2017 Reid Hoffman announced the launch of a new podcast "Masters of scale" to promote a new form of leadership based on gender equality in the workplace.[52]
Honors and awards[edit]

In September 2014, the Academy of Achievement awarded Hoffman with the annual Golden Plate award, which honors accomplished individuals “for significant achievement in their fields.”[53]
In April 2014, President Barack Obama named Hoffman as a Presidential Ambassador for Global Entrepreneurship “to help develop the next generation of entrepreneurs.”[54]
In April 2014, Hoffman received the Distinguished Citizen Award from the Commonwealth Club.[55]
In May 2012, Hoffman was ranked third on the Forbes Midas List of the top tech investors.[56] Forbes described Hoffman as “Silicon Valley's uber-investor” and said Hoffman “has had a hand in creating nearly every lucrative social media startup.”[56]
In 2012, The Martin Luther King Jr. Center honored Hoffman with their "Salute to Greatness" award which "recognizes individuals and corporations or organizations that exemplify excellence in leadership and a commitment to social responsibility in the spirit of Martin Luther King, Jr."[57]
In 2012, Newsweek and The Daily Beast released their first "Digital Power Index," a list of the 100 most significant people in the digital world that year (plus 10 additional "Lifetime Achievement" winners), and Hoffman was ranked No. 3 in the "Angels" category.[58]
In 2012, Hoffman, along with Salman Khan of Khan Academy, was honored by the World Affairs Council and Global Philanthropy Forum in 2012. The council recognizes and honors remarkable leaders who have effected and will continue to effect social change through their private enterprise and social action. The awards in 2012 were dedicated to celebrating Technology for Social Impact.[59]
Hoffman was awarded the 2012 David Packard Medal of Achievement Award by TechAmerica for his contributions and advances within the high-tech industry, his community, and humankind.[60]
Hoffman received an Honorary Doctor of Laws from Babson in 2012.[61]
In 2011, Hoffman and Jeff Weiner of LinkedIn shared the EY U.S. Entrepreneur of the Year Award.[62]
In 2010, Hoffman was named No. 17 on Fast Company 's list of the 100 Most Creative People in Business.[63]

Personal life[edit]

Philanthropy[edit]
Jeff Weiner, LinkedIn's CEO, has said that “Reid's true worth is making a positive and lasting impact on the world, in a very profound way.”[17] Hoffman serves on the boards of Kiva.org (peer-peer microlending pioneer that allows people to lend money via the internet to low-income/underserved entrepreneurs and students), Mozilla (creator of Firefox),[64] Endeavor Global (an organization that finds and supports high-impact entrepreneurs in emerging markets) and Do Something (an organization motivating young people to take action around social changes). Hoffman also serves on the Advisory Council of the MIT Media Lab (an interdisciplinary research laboratory), and is a supporter and Chair of the Advisory Board for QuestBridge (a provider of talented low-income students to top colleges/universities).[65] Hoffman is one of the financial backers of OpenAI, a non-profit company aimed at the safe development of artificial general intelligence.[66] Hoffman is also a primary funder of Crisis Text Line, a free, 24/7 crisis service via SMS in the US.[67] In November 2016, Hoffman and his wife, Michelle Yee, donated $20 million to the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, a charity dedicated to eradicating disease by 2100. Hoffman and Yee's donation was for the Biohub, the Initiative's San Francisco laboratory. Hoffman also joined the board of the Biohub project.[68]
Politics[edit]
Hoffman is a member of the Bilderberg Group, which gathers 120-150 North American and European "political leaders and experts from industry, finance, academia and the media"[69] for an annual invitation-only closed-door conference that Hoffman attended in 2011 and 2012,[70] as well as every year since 2014.[71] Hoffman is also listed as a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, to which he was elected in 2015.[72][73]

In 2016, Hoffman contributed $220,000 in support of Democratic candidate for Vermont governor Matt Dunne, according to a mass-media disclosure filed at the Vermont Secretary of State’s Office.[77]
In 2016, Hoffman created Trumped Up Cards, a card game modeled after Cards Against Humanity intended to poke fun at US presidential candidate Donald Trump.[78]

Early life and education[edit]
Hoffman was born in Palo Alto, California, to Deanna Ruth (Rutter) and William Parker Hoffman, Jr., and grew up in Berkeley, California. His paternal great-great-great-grandfather was Theophilus Adam Wylie, a Christian Presbyterian minister and Indiana University president pro tempore.[5][6][7] Reid's uncle Eric Hoffman is a writer.[8][9]
Hoffman himself describes how he was an avid tabletop roleplaying gamer as a child.[10] His first paid job (at age 12) was as an editor at the game company Chaosium, then based in Oakland near his home.[11] Although 14 years old at the time, Hoffman's name features on the box of Chaosium's RuneQuest role-playing game release 'Borderlands' (1982), receiving equal billing with such prominent game designers as Steve Perrin, Sandy Petersen and Greg Stafford.[12]
Hoffman attended high school at The Putney School,[13] where he farmed maple syrup, drove oxen and studied epistemology.[14] He graduated from Stanford University in 1990, where he won both a Marshall Scholarship and a Dinkelspiel Award, with a B.S. in Symbolic Systems and Cognitive Science.[15] He went on to earn an M.A. in Philosophy from Wolfson College, Oxford University in 1993 as a Marshall Scholar.
Career[edit]
Early years[edit]
While in college, according to Hoffman, he formed a conviction that he wanted to try to influence the state of the world on a large scale.[14] He saw academia as an opportunity to make an "impact", but later realized that an entrepreneurial career would provide him with a larger platform. "When I graduated from Stanford my plan was to become a professor and public intellectual. That is not about quoting Kant. It's about holding up a lens to society and asking 'who are we?' and 'who should we be, as individuals and a society?' But I realised academics write books that 50 or 60 people read and I wanted more impact."[16]
With that in mind, Hoffman pursued a career in business and entrepreneurship. He joined Apple Computer in 1994, where he worked on eWorld, an early attempt at creating a social network. eWorld was acquired by AOL in 1996.[17] He later worked at Fujitsu before co-founding his first company – SocialNet.com in 1997. It focused “on online dating and matching up people with similar interests, like golfers who were looking for partners in their neighborhood.”[18] Peter Thiel has said SocialNet.com was “literally an idea before its time. It was a social network 7 or 8 years before that became a trend.”[17]
PayPal[edit]
While at SocialNet, Hoffman was a member of the board of directors during the founding of PayPal, an electronic money transmission service. In January 2000, he left SocialNet and joined PayPal full-time as the company's COO.[18] Allen Blue, whom Hoffman hired at PayPal, said that “PayPal had to scratch and claw for every advantage it had, and Reid became an expert at competing effectively in an extremely competitive environment."[17] Hoffman was responsible for all external relationships for PayPal, including payments infrastructure (VISA, MasterCard, ACH, WellsFargo), business development (eBay, Intuit, and others), government (regulatory, judicial), and legal. Peter Thiel, Hoffman's boss at PayPal, has said that Hoffman “was the firefighter-in-chief at PayPal. Though that diminishes his role because there were many, many fires.”[18] At the time of PayPal's acquisition by eBay for $1.5B in 2002, he was executive vice president of PayPal.
LinkedIn[edit]




Hoffman speaks at an event.


Hoffman co-founded LinkedIn in December 2002 with two former colleagues from SocialNet (including Allen Blue), a former college classmate and a former colleague from his time at Fujitsu.[14] It launched on May 5, 2003, as one of the first business-oriented online social networks.[19] Peter Thiel and Keith Rabois, colleagues of Hoffman's at PayPal, invested in LinkedIn.[14] By November 2014, LinkedIn had over 332 million members in more than 200 countries and territories.[19] The site allows registered users to create professional profiles and connect with each other. Users can invite anyone (whether a site user or not) to become a connection. According to Forbes, “LinkedIn is, far and away, the most advantageous social networking tool available to job seekers and business professionals today."[20]
Hoffman was LinkedIn's founding CEO for the first four years before becoming chairman and President, Products in February 2007. He became Executive chairman in June 2009.[21] With the IPO of LinkedIn on May 19, 2011, Hoffman owns a stake worth an estimated $2.34 billion, not including any potential benefits from Greylock Partners, where he was named a Partner in 2009.[22] Hoffman believes that many people still do not know how to use its service and it is LinkedIn's job to help them out. In an interview, Hoffman said that “you have to think proactively about how to use a tool that enables your ability to move in ways that you weren’t able to move before, and most of people are not very good at that”.[23]
Microsoft proposed to acquire LinkedIn on June 13, 2016 for $26.2 billion in cash.[24] Hoffman became a board member of Microsoft on March 14, 2017.[25]
Investing[edit]
After the PayPal sale to eBay, Hoffman became one of Silicon Valley's most prolific and successful angel investors. According to venture capitalist David Sze, Hoffman "is arguably the most successful angel investor in the past decade."[26] Dave Goldberg, former CEO of SurveyMonkey, said that Hoffman “is the person you want to talk to when you are starting a company.”[17] In 2010 Hoffman joined Greylock Partners and runs their $20 million Discovery Fund.[27] His areas of focus at Greylock include consumer and services, enterprise software, consumer Internet, enterprise 2.0, mobile, social gaming, online marketplaces, payments, and social networks.[28]
According to David Kirkpatrick's book The Facebook Effect, Hoffman arranged the first meeting between Mark Zuckerberg and Peter Thiel, which led to Thiel's initial $500,000 angel investment in Facebook. Hoffman invested alongside Thiel in Facebook's very first financing round.[29][30]
Hoffman’s current investments include Airbnb, One Kings Lane, Swipely, Viki, Coupons.com, Edmodo, Wrapp, TrialPay, Xapo, Change.org, Gixo, Blockstream,[31] Convoy, Segovia, Crowdpac[32] and Talko.[33][34] Past investments include 3DSolve, Flickr, Digg, shopkick, SixApart, Wikia, Permuto, thesixtyone, Tagged, IronPort, Ping.fm, Nanosolar, Care.com, Knewton, Kongregate, Last.fm, Technetto, Vendio and VigLink.[34] He served on Zynga’s board of directors from March 2008 to June 2014, and on shopkick's board of directors from its foundation in July 2009 until its acquisition by SK Telecom in October 2014.
Public intellectual work[edit]
Speaking[edit]
Hoffman has spoken at the XPrize Foundation's conference and the TED conference in Long Beach in 2012. He is a frequent lecturer at Stanford University, Oxford University, Harvard University, MIT's Media Lab, and others. He has appeared on The Charlie Rose Show, Fareed Zakaria's Global Public Square on CNN and other current affairs television programs.
Writing[edit]
Hoffman has published a variety of posts as a “LinkedIn Influencer” on LinkedIn. He published an essay proposing a new form of credentialing for university students and professionals entitled “Disrupting the Diploma.”[35] On his personal website, he published “LinkedIn’s Series B Pitch to Greylock: Pitch Advice for Entrepreneurs,” in which he analyzed LinkedIn’s 2004 Series B venture funding pitch deck and offered advice to prospective entrepreneurs on how to formulate a pitch deck.[36]
Hoffman has also written op-eds in the Washington Post, including one published in 2009 entitled “Let Startups Bail Us Out”[37] encouraging funding for grassroots innovation in the wake of the financial crisis and another in June 2013 entitled “Immigration promotes entrepreneurship and prosperity” advocating for immigration reform.[38] He has written for Strategy+Business on professional networking and is an "Influencer" on LinkedIn where he posts original written content.[39][40]
The Start-Up of You[edit]
Hoffman is co-author, with Ben Casnocha, of the career book The Start-Up of You: Adapt to the Future, Invest in Yourself, and Transform your Career.[14]
The book was released in the United States on February 14, 2012. It argues that individuals should think of themselves as businesses-of-one – the “CEO of their own career” – and draws many parallels between lessons learned from the stories of successful Silicon Valley technology companies and an individual’s career.[41]
Publishers Weekly reviewed the book positively, saying, “with plenty of valuable guidance relevant to any career stage, this book will help readers not only survive professionally in times of uncertainty but stand out from the pack and flourish.”[42] The Economist said that “Hoffman and Casnocha make a number of astute observations about shifts in the world of work.”[43]
As of September 2012 it had sold more than 100,000 copies.[44] It became both a New York Times and Wall Street Journal bestseller.[45][46] Business Insider republished visual summaries of The Start-Up of You, which have received over 13 million views.[47]
The Alliance[edit]
Hoffman is co-author, with Ben Casnocha and Chris Yeh, of the management book The Alliance: Managing Talent in the Networked Age.[48]
The book was released in the United States on July 8, 2014. It argues that previous career models of lifetime employment and free agency no longer work in a business world defined by continuous change. Instead, it proposes that employers and employees should think of each other as “allies” and move from a transactional approach to employment to a “relational” one. It proposes a new framework for managers and employers to organize their work, described as “tours of duty.” Further, it argues why managers should encourage their employees to gather “network intelligence” and why companies and managers should maintain a lifelong relationship with former employees via a corporate alumni network.[49]
The book became a New York Times bestseller.[50] Arianna Huffington named The Alliance “the must-read book of the summer” in 2014.[51]
Masters of scale[edit]
On 25 April 2017 Reid Hoffman announced the launch of a new podcast "Masters of scale" to promote a new form of leadership based on gender equality in the workplace.[52]
Honors and awards[edit]

In September 2014, the Academy of Achievement awarded Hoffman with the annual Golden Plate award, which honors accomplished individuals “for significant achievement in their fields.”[53]
In April 2014, President Barack Obama named Hoffman as a Presidential Ambassador for Global Entrepreneurship “to help develop the next generation of entrepreneurs.”[54]
In April 2014, Hoffman received the Distinguished Citizen Award from the Commonwealth Club.[55]
In May 2012, Hoffman was ranked third on the Forbes Midas List of the top tech investors.[56] Forbes described Hoffman as “Silicon Valley's uber-investor” and said Hoffman “has had a hand in creating nearly every lucrative social media startup.”[56]
In 2012, The Martin Luther King Jr. Center honored Hoffman with their "Salute to Greatness" award which "recognizes individuals and corporations or organizations that exemplify excellence in leadership and a commitment to social responsibility in the spirit of Martin Luther King, Jr."[57]
In 2012, Newsweek and The Daily Beast released their first "Digital Power Index," a list of the 100 most significant people in the digital world that year (plus 10 additional "Lifetime Achievement" winners), and Hoffman was ranked No. 3 in the "Angels" category.[58]
In 2012, Hoffman, along with Salman Khan of Khan Academy, was honored by the World Affairs Council and Global Philanthropy Forum in 2012. The council recognizes and honors remarkable leaders who have effected and will continue to effect social change through their private enterprise and social action. The awards in 2012 were dedicated to celebrating Technology for Social Impact.[59]
Hoffman was awarded the 2012 David Packard Medal of Achievement Award by TechAmerica for his contributions and advances within the high-tech industry, his community, and humankind.[60]
Hoffman received an Honorary Doctor of Laws from Babson in 2012.[61]
In 2011, Hoffman and Jeff Weiner of LinkedIn shared the EY U.S. Entrepreneur of the Year Award.[62]
In 2010, Hoffman was named No. 17 on Fast Company 's list of the 100 Most Creative People in Business.[63]

Personal life[edit]
In 2001, Hoffman married Michelle Yee. The couple has resided in Palo Alto, CA for 10 years.
Philanthropy[edit]
Jeff Weiner, LinkedIn's CEO, has said that “Reid's true worth is making a positive and lasting impact on the world, in a very profound way.”[17] Hoffman serves on the boards of Kiva.org (peer-peer microlending pioneer that allows people to lend money via the internet to low-income/underserved entrepreneurs and students), Mozilla (creator of Firefox),[64] Endeavor Global (an organization that finds and supports high-impact entrepreneurs in emerging markets) and Do Something (an organization motivating young people to take action around social changes). Hoffman also serves on the Advisory Council of the MIT Media Lab (an interdisciplinary research laboratory), and is a supporter and Chair of the Advisory Board for QuestBridge (a provider of talented low-income students to top colleges/universities).[65] Hoffman is one of the financial backers of OpenAI, a non-profit company aimed at the safe development of artificial general intelligence.[66] Hoffman is also a primary funder of Crisis Text Line, a free, 24/7 crisis service via SMS in the US.[67] In November 2016, Hoffman and his wife, Michelle Yee, donated $20 million to the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, a charity dedicated to eradicating disease by 2100. Hoffman and Yee's donation was for the Biohub, the Initiative's San Francisco laboratory. Hoffman also joined the board of the Biohub project.[68]
Politics[edit]
Hoffman is a member of the Bilderberg Group, which gathers 120-150 North American and European "political leaders and experts from industry, finance, academia and the media"[69] for an annual invitation-only closed-door conference that Hoffman attended in 2011 and 2012,[70] as well as every year since 2014.[71] Hoffman is also listed as a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, to which he was elected in 2015.[72][73]
In April 2013, a pro-immigration lobbying group called FWD.us was launched, with Reid Hoffman listed as one of the founders.[74]
In 2014, Hoffman donated $150,000 to the Mayday PAC[75]
In 2014 Hoffman contributed $500,000 toward David Chiu's State Assembly campaign by funding an independent expenditure committee devoted to negative campaigning against his opponent: San Franciscans to Hold Campos Accountable — Vote No for Campos for State Assembly 2014.[76]
In 2016, Hoffman contributed $220,000 in support of Democratic candidate for Vermont governor Matt Dunne, according to a mass-media disclosure filed at the Vermont Secretary of State’s Office.[77]
In 2016, Hoffman created Trumped Up Cards, a card game modeled after Cards Against Humanity intended to poke fun at US presidential candidate Donald Trump.[78]

Early life and education[edit]
Hoffman was born in Palo Alto, California, to Deanna Ruth (Rutter) and William Parker Hoffman, Jr., and grew up in Berkeley, California. His paternal great-great-great-grandfather was Theophilus Adam Wylie, a Christian Presbyterian minister and Indiana University president pro tempore.[5][6][7] Reid's uncle Eric Hoffman is a writer.[8][9]
Hoffman himself describes how he was an avid tabletop roleplaying gamer as a child.[10] His first paid job (at age 12) was as an editor at the game company Chaosium, then based in Oakland near his home.[11] Although 14 years old at the time, Hoffman's name features on the box of Chaosium's RuneQuest role-playing game release 'Borderlands' (1982), receiving equal billing with such prominent game designers as Steve Perrin, Sandy Petersen and Greg Stafford.[12]
Hoffman attended high school at The Putney School,[13] where he farmed maple syrup, drove oxen and studied epistemology.[14] He graduated from Stanford University in 1990, where he won both a Marshall Scholarship and a Dinkelspiel Award, with a B.S. in Symbolic Systems and Cognitive Science.[15] He went on to earn an M.A. in Philosophy from Wolfson College, Oxford University in 1993 as a Marshall Scholar.
Career[edit]
Early years[edit]
While in college, according to Hoffman, he formed a conviction that he wanted to try to influence the state of the world on a large scale.[14] He saw academia as an opportunity to make an "impact", but later realized that an entrepreneurial career would provide him with a larger platform. "When I graduated from Stanford my plan was to become a professor and public intellectual. That is not about quoting Kant. It's about holding up a lens to society and asking 'who are we?' and 'who should we be, as individuals and a society?' But I realised academics write books that 50 or 60 people read and I wanted more impact."[16]
With that in mind, Hoffman pursued a career in business and entrepreneurship. He joined Apple Computer in 1994, where he worked on eWorld, an early attempt at creating a social network. eWorld was acquired by AOL in 1996.[17] He later worked at Fujitsu before co-founding his first company – SocialNet.com in 1997. It focused “on online dating and matching up people with similar interests, like golfers who were looking for partners in their neighborhood.”[18] Peter Thiel has said SocialNet.com was “literally an idea before its time. It was a social network 7 or 8 years before that became a trend.”[17]
PayPal[edit]
While at SocialNet, Hoffman was a member of the board of directors during the founding of PayPal, an electronic money transmission service. In January 2000, he left SocialNet and joined PayPal full-time as the company's COO.[18] Allen Blue, whom Hoffman hired at PayPal, said that “PayPal had to scratch and claw for every advantage it had, and Reid became an expert at competing effectively in an extremely competitive environment."[17] Hoffman was responsible for all external relationships for PayPal, including payments infrastructure (VISA, MasterCard, ACH, WellsFargo), business development (eBay, Intuit, and others), government (regulatory, judicial), and legal. Peter Thiel, Hoffman's boss at PayPal, has said that Hoffman “was the firefighter-in-chief at PayPal. Though that diminishes his role because there were many, many fires.”[18] At the time of PayPal's acquisition by eBay for $1.5B in 2002, he was executive vice president of PayPal.
LinkedIn[edit]




Hoffman speaks at an event.


Hoffman co-founded LinkedIn in December 2002 with two former colleagues from SocialNet (including Allen Blue), a former college classmate and a former colleague from his time at Fujitsu.[14] It launched on May 5, 2003, as one of the first business-oriented online social networks.[19] Peter Thiel and Keith Rabois, colleagues of Hoffman's at PayPal, invested in LinkedIn.[14] By November 2014, LinkedIn had over 332 million members in more than 200 countries and territories.[19] The site allows registered users to create professional profiles and connect with each other. Users can invite anyone (whether a site user or not) to become a connection. According to Forbes, “LinkedIn is, far and away, the most advantageous social networking tool available to job seekers and business professionals today."[20]
Hoffman was LinkedIn's founding CEO for the first four years before becoming chairman and President, Products in February 2007. He became Executive chairman in June 2009.[21] With the IPO of LinkedIn on May 19, 2011, Hoffman owns a stake worth an estimated $2.34 billion, not including any potential benefits from Greylock Partners, where he was named a Partner in 2009.[22] Hoffman believes that many people still do not know how to use its service and it is LinkedIn's job to help them out. In an interview, Hoffman said that “you have to think proactively about how to use a tool that enables your ability to move in ways that you weren’t able to move before, and most of people are not very good at that”.[23]
Microsoft proposed to acquire LinkedIn on June 13, 2016 for $26.2 billion in cash.[24] Hoffman became a board member of Microsoft on March 14, 2017.[25]
Investing[edit]
After the PayPal sale to eBay, Hoffman became one of Silicon Valley's most prolific and successful angel investors. According to venture capitalist David Sze, Hoffman "is arguably the most successful angel investor in the past decade."[26] Dave Goldberg, former CEO of SurveyMonkey, said that Hoffman “is the person you want to talk to when you are starting a company.”[17] In 2010 Hoffman joined Greylock Partners and runs their $20 million Discovery Fund.[27] His areas of focus at Greylock include consumer and services, enterprise software, consumer Internet, enterprise 2.0, mobile, social gaming, online marketplaces, payments, and social networks.[28]
According to David Kirkpatrick's book The Facebook Effect, Hoffman arranged the first meeting between Mark Zuckerberg and Peter Thiel, which led to Thiel's initial $500,000 angel investment in Facebook. Hoffman invested alongside Thiel in Facebook's very first financing round.[29][30]
Hoffman’s current investments include Airbnb, One Kings Lane, Swipely, Viki, Coupons.com, Edmodo, Wrapp, TrialPay, Xapo, Change.org, Gixo, Blockstream,[31] Convoy, Segovia, Crowdpac[32] and Talko.[33][34] Past investments include 3DSolve, Flickr, Digg, shopkick, SixApart, Wikia, Permuto, thesixtyone, Tagged, IronPort, Ping.fm, Nanosolar, Care.com, Knewton, Kongregate, Last.fm, Technetto, Vendio and VigLink.[34] He served on Zynga’s board of directors from March 2008 to June 2014, and on shopkick's board of directors from its foundation in July 2009 until its acquisition by SK Telecom in October 2014.
Public intellectual work[edit]
Speaking[edit]
Hoffman has spoken at the XPrize Foundation's conference and the TED conference in Long Beach in 2012. He is a frequent lecturer at Stanford University, Oxford University, Harvard University, MIT's Media Lab, and others. He has appeared on The Charlie Rose Show, Fareed Zakaria's Global Public Square on CNN and other current affairs television programs.
Writing[edit]
Hoffman has published a variety of posts as a “LinkedIn Influencer” on LinkedIn. He published an essay proposing a new form of credentialing for university students and professionals entitled “Disrupting the Diploma.”[35] On his personal website, he published “LinkedIn’s Series B Pitch to Greylock: Pitch Advice for Entrepreneurs,” in which he analyzed LinkedIn’s 2004 Series B venture funding pitch deck and offered advice to prospective entrepreneurs on how to formulate a pitch deck.[36]
Hoffman has also written op-eds in the Washington Post, including one published in 2009 entitled “Let Startups Bail Us Out”[37] encouraging funding for grassroots innovation in the wake of the financial crisis and another in June 2013 entitled “Immigration promotes entrepreneurship and prosperity” advocating for immigration reform.[38] He has written for Strategy+Business on professional networking and is an "Influencer" on LinkedIn where he posts original written content.[39][40]
The Start-Up of You[edit]
Hoffman is co-author, with Ben Casnocha, of the career book The Start-Up of You: Adapt to the Future, Invest in Yourself, and Transform your Career.[14]
The book was released in the United States on February 14, 2012. It argues that individuals should think of themselves as businesses-of-one – the “CEO of their own career” – and draws many parallels between lessons learned from the stories of successful Silicon Valley technology companies and an individual’s career.[41]
Publishers Weekly reviewed the book positively, saying, “with plenty of valuable guidance relevant to any career stage, this book will help readers not only survive professionally in times of uncertainty but stand out from the pack and flourish.”[42] The Economist said that “Hoffman and Casnocha make a number of astute observations about shifts in the world of work.”[43]
As of September 2012 it had sold more than 100,000 copies.[44] It became both a New York Times and Wall Street Journal bestseller.[45][46] Business Insider republished visual summaries of The Start-Up of You, which have received over 13 million views.[47]
The Alliance[edit]
Hoffman is co-author, with Ben Casnocha and Chris Yeh, of the management book The Alliance: Managing Talent in the Networked Age.[48]
The book was released in the United States on July 8, 2014. It argues that previous career models of lifetime employment and free agency no longer work in a business world defined by continuous change. Instead, it proposes that employers and employees should think of each other as “allies” and move from a transactional approach to employment to a “relational” one. It proposes a new framework for managers and employers to organize their work, described as “tours of duty.” Further, it argues why managers should encourage their employees to gather “network intelligence” and why companies and managers should maintain a lifelong relationship with former employees via a corporate alumni network.[49]
The book became a New York Times bestseller.[50] Arianna Huffington named The Alliance “the must-read book of the summer” in 2014.[51]
Masters of scale[edit]
On 25 April 2017 Reid Hoffman announced the launch of a new podcast "Masters of scale" to promote a new form of leadership based on gender equality in the workplace.[52]
Honors and awards[edit]

In September 2014, the Academy of Achievement awarded Hoffman with the annual Golden Plate award, which honors accomplished individuals “for significant achievement in their fields.”[53]
In April 2014, President Barack Obama named Hoffman as a Presidential Ambassador for Global Entrepreneurship “to help develop the next generation of entrepreneurs.”[54]
In April 2014, Hoffman received the Distinguished Citizen Award from the Commonwealth Club.[55]
In May 2012, Hoffman was ranked third on the Forbes Midas List of the top tech investors.[56] Forbes described Hoffman as “Silicon Valley's uber-investor” and said Hoffman “has had a hand in creating nearly every lucrative social media startup.”[56]
In 2012, The Martin Luther King Jr. Center honored Hoffman with their "Salute to Greatness" award which "recognizes individuals and corporations or organizations that exemplify excellence in leadership and a commitment to social responsibility in the spirit of Martin Luther King, Jr."[57]
In 2012, Newsweek and The Daily Beast released their first "Digital Power Index," a list of the 100 most significant people in the digital world that year (plus 10 additional "Lifetime Achievement" winners), and Hoffman was ranked No. 3 in the "Angels" category.[58]
In 2012, Hoffman, along with Salman Khan of Khan Academy, was honored by the World Affairs Council and Global Philanthropy Forum in 2012. The council recognizes and honors remarkable leaders who have effected and will continue to effect social change through their private enterprise and social action. The awards in 2012 were dedicated to celebrating Technology for Social Impact.[59]
Hoffman was awarded the 2012 David Packard Medal of Achievement Award by TechAmerica for his contributions and advances within the high-tech industry, his community, and humankind.[60]
Hoffman received an Honorary Doctor of Laws from Babson in 2012.[61]
In 2011, Hoffman and Jeff Weiner of LinkedIn shared the EY U.S. Entrepreneur of the Year Award.[62]
In 2010, Hoffman was named No. 17 on Fast Company 's list of the 100 Most Creative People in Business.[63]

Personal life[edit]
In 2001, Hoffman married Michelle Yee. The couple has resided in Palo Alto, CA for 10 years.
Philanthropy[edit]
Jeff Weiner, LinkedIn's CEO, has said that “Reid's true worth is making a positive and lasting impact on the world, in a very profound way.”[17] Hoffman serves on the boards of Kiva.org (peer-peer microlending pioneer that allows people to lend money via the internet to low-income/underserved entrepreneurs and students), Mozilla (creator of Firefox),[64] Endeavor Global (an organization that finds and supports high-impact entrepreneurs in emerging markets) and Do Something (an organization motivating young people to take action around social changes). Hoffman also serves on the Advisory Council of the MIT Media Lab (an interdisciplinary research laboratory), and is a supporter and Chair of the Advisory Board for QuestBridge (a provider of talented low-income students to top colleges/universities).[65] Hoffman is one of the financial backers of OpenAI, a non-profit company aimed at the safe development of artificial general intelligence.[66] Hoffman is also a primary funder of Crisis Text Line, a free, 24/7 crisis service via SMS in the US.[67] In November 2016, Hoffman and his wife, Michelle Yee, donated $20 million to the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, a charity dedicated to eradicating disease by 2100. Hoffman and Yee's donation was for the Biohub, the Initiative's San Francisco laboratory. Hoffman also joined the board of the Biohub project.[68]
Politics[edit]
Hoffman is a member of the Bilderberg Group, which gathers 120-150 North American and European "political leaders and experts from industry, finance, academia and the media"[69] for an annual invitation-only closed-door conference that Hoffman attended in 2011 and 2012,[70] as well as every year since 2014.[71] Hoffman is also listed as a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, to which he was elected in 2015.[72][73]
In April 2013, a pro-immigration lobbying group called FWD.us was launched, with Reid Hoffman listed as one of the founders.[74]

In 2014 Hoffman contributed $500,000 toward David Chiu's State Assembly campaign by funding an independent expenditure committee devoted to negative campaigning against his opponent: San Franciscans to Hold Campos Accountable — Vote No for Campos for State Assembly 2014.[76]
In 2016, Hoffman contributed $220,000 in support of Democratic candidate for Vermont governor Matt Dunne, according to a mass-media disclosure filed at the Vermont Secretary of State’s Office.[77]
In 2016, Hoffman created Trumped Up Cards, a card game modeled after Cards Against Humanity intended to poke fun at US presidential candidate Donald Trump.[78]

Early life and education[edit]
Hoffman was born in Palo Alto, California, to Deanna Ruth (Rutter) and William Parker Hoffman, Jr., and grew up in Berkeley, California. His paternal great-great-great-grandfather was Theophilus Adam Wylie, a Christian Presbyterian minister and Indiana University president pro tempore.[5][6][7] Reid's uncle Eric Hoffman is a writer.[8][9]
Hoffman himself describes how he was an avid tabletop roleplaying gamer as a child.[10] His first paid job (at age 12) was as an editor at the game company Chaosium, then based in Oakland near his home.[11] Although 14 years old at the time, Hoffman's name features on the box of Chaosium's RuneQuest role-playing game release 'Borderlands' (1982), receiving equal billing with such prominent game designers as Steve Perrin, Sandy Petersen and Greg Stafford.[12]
Hoffman attended high school at The Putney School,[13] where he farmed maple syrup, drove oxen and studied epistemology.[14] He graduated from Stanford University in 1990, where he won both a Marshall Scholarship and a Dinkelspiel Award, with a B.S. in Symbolic Systems and Cognitive Science.[15] He went on to earn an M.A. in Philosophy from Wolfson College, Oxford University in 1993 as a Marshall Scholar.
Career[edit]
Early years[edit]
While in college, according to Hoffman, he formed a conviction that he wanted to try to influence the state of the world on a large scale.[14] He saw academia as an opportunity to make an "impact", but later realized that an entrepreneurial career would provide him with a larger platform. "When I graduated from Stanford my plan was to become a professor and public intellectual. That is not about quoting Kant. It's about holding up a lens to society and asking 'who are we?' and 'who should we be, as individuals and a society?' But I realised academics write books that 50 or 60 people read and I wanted more impact."[16]
With that in mind, Hoffman pursued a career in business and entrepreneurship. He joined Apple Computer in 1994, where he worked on eWorld, an early attempt at creating a social network. eWorld was acquired by AOL in 1996.[17] He later worked at Fujitsu before co-founding his first company – SocialNet.com in 1997. It focused “on online dating and matching up people with similar interests, like golfers who were looking for partners in their neighborhood.”[18] Peter Thiel has said SocialNet.com was “literally an idea before its time. It was a social network 7 or 8 years before that became a trend.”[17]
PayPal[edit]
While at SocialNet, Hoffman was a member of the board of directors during the founding of PayPal, an electronic money transmission service. In January 2000, he left SocialNet and joined PayPal full-time as the company's COO.[18] Allen Blue, whom Hoffman hired at PayPal, said that “PayPal had to scratch and claw for every advantage it had, and Reid became an expert at competing effectively in an extremely competitive environment."[17] Hoffman was responsible for all external relationships for PayPal, including payments infrastructure (VISA, MasterCard, ACH, WellsFargo), business development (eBay, Intuit, and others), government (regulatory, judicial), and legal. Peter Thiel, Hoffman's boss at PayPal, has said that Hoffman “was the firefighter-in-chief at PayPal. Though that diminishes his role because there were many, many fires.”[18] At the time of PayPal's acquisition by eBay for $1.5B in 2002, he was executive vice president of PayPal.
LinkedIn[edit]




Hoffman speaks at an event.


Hoffman co-founded LinkedIn in December 2002 with two former colleagues from SocialNet (including Allen Blue), a former college classmate and a former colleague from his time at Fujitsu.[14] It launched on May 5, 2003, as one of the first business-oriented online social networks.[19] Peter Thiel and Keith Rabois, colleagues of Hoffman's at PayPal, invested in LinkedIn.[14] By November 2014, LinkedIn had over 332 million members in more than 200 countries and territories.[19] The site allows registered users to create professional profiles and connect with each other. Users can invite anyone (whether a site user or not) to become a connection. According to Forbes, “LinkedIn is, far and away, the most advantageous social networking tool available to job seekers and business professionals today."[20]
Hoffman was LinkedIn's founding CEO for the first four years before becoming chairman and President, Products in February 2007. He became Executive chairman in June 2009.[21] With the IPO of LinkedIn on May 19, 2011, Hoffman owns a stake worth an estimated $2.34 billion, not including any potential benefits from Greylock Partners, where he was named a Partner in 2009.[22] Hoffman believes that many people still do not know how to use its service and it is LinkedIn's job to help them out. In an interview, Hoffman said that “you have to think proactively about how to use a tool that enables your ability to move in ways that you weren’t able to move before, and most of people are not very good at that”.[23]
Microsoft proposed to acquire LinkedIn on June 13, 2016 for $26.2 billion in cash.[24] Hoffman became a board member of Microsoft on March 14, 2017.[25]
Investing[edit]
After the PayPal sale to eBay, Hoffman became one of Silicon Valley's most prolific and successful angel investors. According to venture capitalist David Sze, Hoffman "is arguably the most successful angel investor in the past decade."[26] Dave Goldberg, former CEO of SurveyMonkey, said that Hoffman “is the person you want to talk to when you are starting a company.”[17] In 2010 Hoffman joined Greylock Partners and runs their $20 million Discovery Fund.[27] His areas of focus at Greylock include consumer and services, enterprise software, consumer Internet, enterprise 2.0, mobile, social gaming, online marketplaces, payments, and social networks.[28]
According to David Kirkpatrick's book The Facebook Effect, Hoffman arranged the first meeting between Mark Zuckerberg and Peter Thiel, which led to Thiel's initial $500,000 angel investment in Facebook. Hoffman invested alongside Thiel in Facebook's very first financing round.[29][30]
Hoffman’s current investments include Airbnb, One Kings Lane, Swipely, Viki, Coupons.com, Edmodo, Wrapp, TrialPay, Xapo, Change.org, Gixo, Blockstream,[31] Convoy, Segovia, Crowdpac[32] and Talko.[33][34] Past investments include 3DSolve, Flickr, Digg, shopkick, SixApart, Wikia, Permuto, thesixtyone, Tagged, IronPort, Ping.fm, Nanosolar, Care.com, Knewton, Kongregate, Last.fm, Technetto, Vendio and VigLink.[34] He served on Zynga’s board of directors from March 2008 to June 2014, and on shopkick's board of directors from its foundation in July 2009 until its acquisition by SK Telecom in October 2014.
Public intellectual work[edit]
Speaking[edit]
Hoffman has spoken at the XPrize Foundation's conference and the TED conference in Long Beach in 2012. He is a frequent lecturer at Stanford University, Oxford University, Harvard University, MIT's Media Lab, and others. He has appeared on The Charlie Rose Show, Fareed Zakaria's Global Public Square on CNN and other current affairs television programs.
Writing[edit]
Hoffman has published a variety of posts as a “LinkedIn Influencer” on LinkedIn. He published an essay proposing a new form of credentialing for university students and professionals entitled “Disrupting the Diploma.”[35] On his personal website, he published “LinkedIn’s Series B Pitch to Greylock: Pitch Advice for Entrepreneurs,” in which he analyzed LinkedIn’s 2004 Series B venture funding pitch deck and offered advice to prospective entrepreneurs on how to formulate a pitch deck.[36]
Hoffman has also written op-eds in the Washington Post, including one published in 2009 entitled “Let Startups Bail Us Out”[37] encouraging funding for grassroots innovation in the wake of the financial crisis and another in June 2013 entitled “Immigration promotes entrepreneurship and prosperity” advocating for immigration reform.[38] He has written for Strategy+Business on professional networking and is an "Influencer" on LinkedIn where he posts original written content.[39][40]
The Start-Up of You[edit]
Hoffman is co-author, with Ben Casnocha, of the career book The Start-Up of You: Adapt to the Future, Invest in Yourself, and Transform your Career.[14]
The book was released in the United States on February 14, 2012. It argues that individuals should think of themselves as businesses-of-one – the “CEO of their own career” – and draws many parallels between lessons learned from the stories of successful Silicon Valley technology companies and an individual’s career.[41]
Publishers Weekly reviewed the book positively, saying, “with plenty of valuable guidance relevant to any career stage, this book will help readers not only survive professionally in times of uncertainty but stand out from the pack and flourish.”[42] The Economist said that “Hoffman and Casnocha make a number of astute observations about shifts in the world of work.”[43]
As of September 2012 it had sold more than 100,000 copies.[44] It became both a New York Times and Wall Street Journal bestseller.[45][46] Business Insider republished visual summaries of The Start-Up of You, which have received over 13 million views.[47]
The Alliance[edit]
Hoffman is co-author, with Ben Casnocha and Chris Yeh, of the management book The Alliance: Managing Talent in the Networked Age.[48]
The book was released in the United States on July 8, 2014. It argues that previous career models of lifetime employment and free agency no longer work in a business world defined by continuous change. Instead, it proposes that employers and employees should think of each other as “allies” and move from a transactional approach to employment to a “relational” one. It proposes a new framework for managers and employers to organize their work, described as “tours of duty.” Further, it argues why managers should encourage their employees to gather “network intelligence” and why companies and managers should maintain a lifelong relationship with former employees via a corporate alumni network.[49]
The book became a New York Times bestseller.[50] Arianna Huffington named The Alliance “the must-read book of the summer” in 2014.[51]
Masters of scale[edit]
On 25 April 2017 Reid Hoffman announced the launch of a new podcast "Masters of scale" to promote a new form of leadership based on gender equality in the workplace.[52]
Honors and awards[edit]

In September 2014, the Academy of Achievement awarded Hoffman with the annual Golden Plate award, which honors accomplished individuals “for significant achievement in their fields.”[53]
In April 2014, President Barack Obama named Hoffman as a Presidential Ambassador for Global Entrepreneurship “to help develop the next generation of entrepreneurs.”[54]
In April 2014, Hoffman received the Distinguished Citizen Award from the Commonwealth Club.[55]
In May 2012, Hoffman was ranked third on the Forbes Midas List of the top tech investors.[56] Forbes described Hoffman as “Silicon Valley's uber-investor” and said Hoffman “has had a hand in creating nearly every lucrative social media startup.”[56]
In 2012, The Martin Luther King Jr. Center honored Hoffman with their "Salute to Greatness" award which "recognizes individuals and corporations or organizations that exemplify excellence in leadership and a commitment to social responsibility in the spirit of Martin Luther King, Jr."[57]
In 2012, Newsweek and The Daily Beast released their first "Digital Power Index," a list of the 100 most significant people in the digital world that year (plus 10 additional "Lifetime Achievement" winners), and Hoffman was ranked No. 3 in the "Angels" category.[58]
In 2012, Hoffman, along with Salman Khan of Khan Academy, was honored by the World Affairs Council and Global Philanthropy Forum in 2012. The council recognizes and honors remarkable leaders who have effected and will continue to effect social change through their private enterprise and social action. The awards in 2012 were dedicated to celebrating Technology for Social Impact.[59]
Hoffman was awarded the 2012 David Packard Medal of Achievement Award by TechAmerica for his contributions and advances within the high-tech industry, his community, and humankind.[60]
Hoffman received an Honorary Doctor of Laws from Babson in 2012.[61]
In 2011, Hoffman and Jeff Weiner of LinkedIn shared the EY U.S. Entrepreneur of the Year Award.[62]
In 2010, Hoffman was named No. 17 on Fast Company 's list of the 100 Most Creative People in Business.[63]

Personal life[edit]
In 2001, Hoffman married Michelle Yee. The couple has resided in Palo Alto, CA for 10 years.
Philanthropy[edit]
Jeff Weiner, LinkedIn's CEO, has said that “Reid's true worth is making a positive and lasting impact on the world, in a very profound way.”[17] Hoffman serves on the boards of Kiva.org (peer-peer microlending pioneer that allows people to lend money via the internet to low-income/underserved entrepreneurs and students), Mozilla (creator of Firefox),[64] Endeavor Global (an organization that finds and supports high-impact entrepreneurs in emerging markets) and Do Something (an organization motivating young people to take action around social changes). Hoffman also serves on the Advisory Council of the MIT Media Lab (an interdisciplinary research laboratory), and is a supporter and Chair of the Advisory Board for QuestBridge (a provider of talented low-income students to top colleges/universities).[65] Hoffman is one of the financial backers of OpenAI, a non-profit company aimed at the safe development of artificial general intelligence.[66] Hoffman is also a primary funder of Crisis Text Line, a free, 24/7 crisis service via SMS in the US.[67] In November 2016, Hoffman and his wife, Michelle Yee, donated $20 million to the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, a charity dedicated to eradicating disease by 2100. Hoffman and Yee's donation was for the Biohub, the Initiative's San Francisco laboratory. Hoffman also joined the board of the Biohub project.[68]
Politics[edit]
Hoffman is a member of the Bilderberg Group, which gathers 120-150 North American and European "political leaders and experts from industry, finance, academia and the media"[69] for an annual invitation-only closed-door conference that Hoffman attended in 2011 and 2012,[70] as well as every year since 2014.[71] Hoffman is also listed as a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, to which he was elected in 2015.[72][73]

In 2016, Hoffman contributed $220,000 in support of Democratic candidate for Vermont governor Matt Dunne, according to a mass-media disclosure filed at the Vermont Secretary of State’s Office.[77]
In 2016, Hoffman created Trumped Up Cards, a card game modeled after Cards Against Humanity intended to poke fun at US presidential candidate Donald Trump.[78]
