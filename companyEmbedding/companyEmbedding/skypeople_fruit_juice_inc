World's best overall value for natural products!


                        Since 1996, iHerb has made great efforts to enhance your online shopping experience.  Initially, our
                        company promoted the benefits of St. John's Wort; hence the name: iHerb.  We carry one of the
                        largest selections of high-quality natural products at the best overall value.  Consider iHerb your own
                        California-based natural products store!
                    










Top 10 reasons to make iHerb your number one choice!




1. Shop directly and save!

            iHerb.com is one of the world's largest online stores for natural products.
            We have been in business since 1996 and have two distribution centers, based
            in California and Kentucky.
        

            Browse our site and you'll find over 1,200 brands and 35,000 brand name products that you may also find at health food stores and natural
            pharmacies -- with one important difference: Our prices are typically 30 - 40% less. Also, don't forget to check our  Specials page for
            additional discounts on some best-selling products.
        


2. Free or discounted shipping

            Every iHerb order is eligible to receive discounted or free shipping! In general, the more products you add to your cart, the greater the likelihood that you will receive free shipping. In some cases you’ll even find that ordering one product alone may result in free shipping. We encourage you to experiment with different product combinations in order to find the best value, and share your cart with others! iHerb is the world's leader in bringing the best overall value in natural products to its customers.
        


3. Honest customer product reviews

            Unlike retailers that display third-party reviews, all of our reviews are written by iHerb customers. In order to write a review, you must
            have ordered the product from iHerb first. This means you receive honest and candid reviews, thereby helping you make a smarter buying decision.
        


4. Assurance of freshness with expiration dates

            Because we have one of the highest product turnover rates in the industry, iHerb is able to offer you the FRESHEST products possible!
            Our inventory turnover rate averages to 8.1 times per year; among the highest turnover rates, if not the highest, in our industry. This means that iHerb products are on the shelf an average of only 45 days!
        

            Plus, most products we carry have expiration or best-by dates, which can be accessed on the product page. It's like holding the real bottle or package in your hand, as you would in a typical "brick and mortar" store.
        


5. Air-conditioned, super clean warehouses

            iHerb’s distribution centers  are entirely climate-controlled, which protects the products from such conditions as humidity, heat and cold. This level of quality control is employed by iHerb to ensure product effectiveness for the customer.
            In addition, our distribution centers are industry certified by NSF International, earning Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) certification.
        


6. Solid personal privacy commitment

            Personal privacy is critically important to us. Since 1996, iHerb has never sold, leased or shared any customer information with third parties. Your personal information remains entirely confidential.
        


7. Enhanced 256-bit encryption with tokenization

            Simply put, we only store the last 4 digits and the expiration date of your credit card, so you can identify what card you are using.
        


8. 24 hour/7 day customer service

            One of the ways iHerb can offer such low prices is by automating the whole ordering process. While our customer service agents don't
            actually take orders, they do offer live  customer support from our California facility, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. (Pacific Time), Monday - Friday.
            We are also reachable 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, by chat and email to answer questions and resolve issues with your order. Of course,
            nobody's perfect. We may get quite busy at times and we ask for a little patience. We'll do our best to take care of things promptly, efficiently
            and courteously -- this is what our customers deserve!
        


9. Save even more by helping others save!

            As an iHerb customer, share your favorite iHerb products or categories, or even a shopping cart containing multiple products with others via simple Rewards links, and you will save even more!



10. A greener way to shop

            When you shop with us, you're part of a global solution. iHerb uses 100% post-consumer recycled paper for 90% of all shipping boxes. Our bubble wrap is 40% recyclable, and we recycle virtually all packing materials received 
            from manufacturers. All in the interest of a healthier, more sustainable planet!  Read more.

SkyPeople Q3 Revenue Up 79% to $34.8 Million, Net Income Increases 45% to $4.7 Million
Download PDF


XI'AN, China, Nov. 14, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- SkyPeople Fruit Juice, Inc. (NasdaqGM: SPU), ("SkyPeople" or "the Company"), a producer of fruit juice concentrates, fruit juice beverages and other fruit-related products, today announced financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2014.
Third Quarter 2014 Summary:

Revenue was $34.8 million, an increase of 79% year-over-year 
Gross profit was $10.2 million, an increase of 41% year-over-year 
Income from operations was $7.2 million, an increase of 57% year-over-year 
Net income was $4.7 million, an increase of 45% year-over-year 
Cash and cash equivalents were $52.7 million as of September 30, 2014 

"We are very pleased to report these strong financial results, highlighted by a balanced contribution to revenue among our core products due to the general availability of fresh fruit raw materials during the quarter," said Mr. Hongke Xue, chief executive officer of SkyPeople. "These quarterly results confirm our strategy for procuring sufficient quantities of fresh fruit by locating our production facilities near fruit growing centers in large fruit producing provinces.
"In terms of our major project initiatives, our project to develop a manufacturing base for kiwi products in Mei County has shown progress with the construction of a kiwi fruit and fruit-related materials trading zone now mostly completed.  Our orange development project in Hubei Province is also making progress with the goal of these two projects to meaningfully expand our processing capabilities.
"SkyPeople now sells its fruit juice beverages to more than 20,000 retail stores in some 20 provinces in China," said Mr. Xue, and he expects these figures to continue to improve in the quarters ahead. 
"China's rising incomes, we believe, are speeding the transition in consumer tastes towards healthy living, including the increased consumption of high-quality fruit juice beverages. We are therefore well positioned to capitalize on this trend and to continue to capture additional market share," said Mr. Xue.
Third Quarter 2014 Financial Results
Revenue.  Revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2014 was $34.8 million, an increase of 79% compared to $19.5 million for the same period of 2013. This increase was due to an increase in sales in almost all of our product lines, offset by the decrease of revenue from the other products segment.

The company's gross profit was $10.2 million in Q3 2014, an increase of 41% from $7.2 million for the same period in 2013.  The increase was primarily due to the increase in gross profit generated from apple-related products, concentrated pear juice, fruit juice beverages, fresh fruits and vegetables and other products segments, which was partially offset by a lesser amount of gross profit generated from kiwi-related products..

SkyPeople Fruit Juice Reports Third Quarter 2013 Financial Results
Download PDF


XI'AN, China, Nov. 13, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- SkyPeople Fruit Juice, Inc. (NASDAQ: SPU) ("SkyPeople" or "the Company"), a producer of fruit juice concentrates, fruit juice beverages and other fruit-related products, today announced its financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2013.
Third Quarter 2013 Summary:

Revenue was $19.5 million, a decrease of 32% year-over-year 
Gross profit was $7.2 million, a decrease of 15% year-over-year 
Gross profit margin was 37% as compared to 30% for the same period of 2012 
Income from operations was $4.6 million, a decrease of 31% year-over-year 
Net income attributable to the Company was $3.0 million, a decrease of 40% year-over-year 
Revenue from the fruit juice beverage segment was $12.8 million, an increase of 23% year-over-year 
Cash and cash equivalents were $87.2 million as of September 30, 2013 

"We recorded disappointing financial results for the third quarter of 2013 attributable to the limited supply of fresh fruit needed for the production of our products. As each of our manufacturing facilities generally focus on fruit products made from specific fruit grown in those proximities, we have been able to lock-in supply when possible. However, difficult growing seasons that limited raw materials for several of our product lines made this a challenge in the current quarter," said Mr. Hongke Xue, Chief Executive Officer of SkyPeople.
"Our fruit juice beverages segment continued to perform well in the quarter and is a key growth area that we intend to expand even further. For the third quarter, revenue from our fruit juice beverages segment grew 23% year over year which contributed substantially to the quarter's aggregate gross profit level. We currently sell our fruit juices to over 100 distributors and more than 20,000 retail stores in approximately 20 provinces in China. 
"We are making progress with all of our new and exciting projects so as to ensure the company's future growth. Our projects to establish facilities to produce kiwi fruit in Mei County, develop an orange processing zone in Yidu, Hubei Province and to establish a vegetable and fruit processing facility in Suizhong, Liaoning Province are all on track. These growth initiatives are a key element of our strategic plan to diversify our product platform, leverage our core competencies and secure future cash flow.
"With rising incomes and younger demographics, we continue to believe that a transition in consumer tastes in China towards healthier lifestyles and improved nutrition will occur. Given the relatively low domestic consumption rate of fruit juice beverages, we believe that our branded fruit juice beverages are very well positioned to meet this potentially fast growing market demand," Mr. Hongke Xue concluded.
Third Quarter 2013 Financial Results
Revenue.  Revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2013 was $19.5 million, a decrease of 32% from $28.6 million for the same period in 2012. This was primarily due a decrease in sales from product lines except fruit juice beverages. The fruit juice beverages segment rose 23% in the third quarter of 2013 as compared to the year ago quarter in 2012. The fruit juice beverage and concentrated pear juice segments comprised substantially all of the Company's revenue for the third quarter.

Gross Profit. The consolidated gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2013 was $7.2 million, a decrease of 15% from $8.5 million generated for the same period of 2012 primarily due to lower gross profit generated from our concentrated pear juice and apple-related products segments.
The consolidated gross profit margin for the three months ended September 30, 2013 was 37% as compared to 30% for the same period of 2012, primarily due the fruit beverage and concentrated pear juice segments, which comprised substantially all of the Company's total gross profit for the third quarter.

Gross Profit by Segment. The gross profit margin of the concentrated pear juice segment rose to 36% in the third quarter of 2013 from 30% in the year-ago period of 2012 mainly due to the lower cost of raw materials for the current period as compared to the same period of 2012. The gross profit margin of the fruit juice segment of 38% had remained stable in the third quarter of 2013 from the year-ago quarter. These two product segments comprised substantially all of the Company's gross profit for the third quarter of 2013, resulting in an increase in the overall gross margin for the Company.
The gross profit margin of the concentrated kiwifruit juice and kiwifruit puree increased to 70% for the third quarter of 2013 from 47% for the comparable period of 2012, primarily due to the lower cost of fresh kiwi purchased in the current quarter as compared to the same period of 2012.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Financial Statements and Notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-Q.  DISCLAIMER REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  The following discussion and analysis of the condensed consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and notes in Item I above and with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes, and with the information under the headings "Risk Factors" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed in this report and under the heading "Risk Factors" in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Overview of Our Business  We are engaged in the production and sales of fruit juice concentrates (including fruit purees, concentrated fruit purees and concentrated fruit juices), fruit beverages (including fruit juice beverages and fruit cider beverages), and other fruit related products (including organic and non-organic fresh fruits) in and outside of the PRC. Our fruit juice concentrates, which include apple, pear and kiwifruit concentrates, are sold to domestic customers and exported directly or via distributors. We sell our Hedetang branded bottled fruit beverages domestically primarily to supermarkets in the PRC. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, sales of our fruit concentrates, fruit beverages, fresh fruits and other fruit related products represented 72%, 28% and 0% of our revenue, respectively, compared to 100%, 0% and 0% respectively, for the same period of 2016.  In addition to our domestic sales, we also export our products. We sell our products either through distributors with good credit or to end users directly. Our main export markets are Asia, North America, Europe, Russia and the Middle East. We sell our other fruit related products to domestic customers.  We currently market our Hedetang brand fruit beverages in only certain regions of the PRC. We plan to expand the market presence of Hedetang over a broader geographic area in the PRC. In particular, we plan to expand our glass bottle production line to produce higher margin portable fruit juice beverages targeting consumers in more populated Chinese cities. Currently we produce six flavors of fruit beverages in 280 ml glass bottles, 418 ml glass and 500 ml glass bottles and BIB packages, including apple juice, pear juice, kiwifruit juice, mulberry juice, peach juice and pomegranate juice. We currently sell our fruit beverages to over 100 distributors and more than 20,000 retail stores in approximately 20 provinces. Our products are sold through distributors in stores such as Hualian Supermarket in Beijing, RT-Mart in Shenyang, WOWO in Chengdu, the Quanjia convenient store chain, Vanguard in Xi'an, Carrefour in Chongqing and Shenyang and Lianhua Supermarket in Shanghai.  We plan to continue to focus on creating new products with high margins to supplement our current product offering.  Our business is highly seasonal and can be greatly affected by weather because of the seasonal nature in the growing and harvesting of fruits and vegetables. Our core products are apple, pear and kiwifruit juice concentrates, which are produced from July or August to April of the following year. The squeezing season for (i) apples is from August to January or February; (ii) pears is from July or August until April of next year; and (iii) kiwifruit is from September through December. Typically, a substantial portion of our revenues is earned during our first and fourth quarters. To minimize the seasonality of our business, we make continued efforts in identifying new products with harvesting seasons complementary to our current product mix. Our goal is to lengthen our squeezing season, thus increasing our annual production of fruit juice concentrates and fruit beverages. Unlike fruit juice concentrates, which can only be produced during the squeezing season, our fruit beverages are made out of fruit juice concentrates and can be produced and sold in all seasons. With continuous efforts in marketing of our beverages in domestic market, we believe that our seasonality will be reduced.  Fresh fruits are the primary raw materials needed for the production of our products. Our raw materials mainly consist of apples, pears and kiwifruits. Other raw materials used in our business include pectic enzyme, amylase, auxiliary power fuels and other power sources such as coal, electricity and water.  We purchase raw materials from local markets and fruit growers that deliver directly to our plants. We have implemented a fruit-purchasing program in areas surrounding our factories. In addition, we organize purchasing centers in rich fruit production areas, helping farmers deliver fruit to our purchasing agents easily and in a timely manner. We are then able to deliver the fruit directly to our factory for production. We have assisted local farmers in their development of kiwifruit fields to help ensure a high quality product throughout the production channel. Our raw material supply chain is highly fragmented and raw fruit prices are highly volatile in China. Fruit concentrate and fruit juice beverage companies generally do not enter into purchasing agreements with raw fruit suppliers. In addition to raw materials, we purchase various ingredients and packaging materials such as sweeteners, glass and plastic bottles, cans and packing barrels. We generally purchase our materials or supplies from multiple suppliers. We are not dependent on any one supplier or group of suppliers.  Shaanxi and Liaoning Provinces, where our manufacturing facilities are located, are large fruit producing provinces. We own and operate four manufacturing facilities in the PRC, all of which are strategically located near fruit growing centers so that we can better preserve the freshness of the fruits and lower our transportation costs. To take advantage of economies of scale and to enhance our production efficiency, generally, each of our manufacturing facilities has a focus on products made from one particular fruit according to the proximity of such manufacturing to the sources of supply for that fruit. Our kiwifruit processing facilities are located in Zhouzhi County of Shaanxi Province, which has the largest planting area of apples and kiwifruit in the PRC. Our pear processing facilities are located in Shaanxi Province, which is the main pear-producing province in the PRC. Our apple processing facilities are located in Liaoning Province, a region that abounds with high acidity apples. As we use the same production line for concentrated apple juice and concentrated pear juice and both Shaanxi Province and Liaoning Province are rich in fresh apple and pear production, our Liaoning facilities can also produce concentrated pear juice and our Shaanxi Province facilities can also produce concentrated apple juice based on customer need. According to the data provided by the Chinese Customs, the amount of exported concentrated apple juice from China continued to drop in the past few years. As most of our concentrated apple juice was sold directly or indirectly to the international market, our two facilities in Liaoning stopped operations in the past two years. Our Huludao Wonder operation suffered continued operating losses in the three fiscal years ended December 31, 2016 and the cash flows were minimal during the same three fiscal years. Thus, in December 2016, we established a restructuring plan to close the Huludao Wonder Operation. In the first quarter of 2017, this discontinued operation reported a loss of $48,685. Our Yingkou factory in Liaoning also did not produce any concentrated apple juice in the past two years. We believe that these regions provide adequate supply of raw materials for our production needs in the foreseeable future.  On August 3, 2016, Shaanxi Guoweimei Kiwi Deep Processing Company, an indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, signed a lease agreement for 20,000 mu (approximately 3,292 acres) of kiwifruits orchard located in Mei County, Shaanxi Province, with the Di'erpo Committe of Jinqu Village, Mei County, Shaanxi for a term of 30 years, from August 5, 2016 to August 4, 2046. On August 15, 2016, Hedetang Agricultural Plantations (Yidu) Co., Ltd., an indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, signed a lease agreement for 8000 mu (approximately 1,317 acres) of orange orchard located in the city of Yidu, Hubei Province, with the Yidu Sichang Farmers Association, Hubei Province, for a term of 20 years, from September 22, 2016 to September 21, 2036. The Company believes that the leasing of the orchards will help ensure the quality and safety of its products and lower its costs.  On August 30, 2010, we closed the public offering of 5,181,285 shares of our Common Stock at a price of $5.00 per share for approximately $25.9 million. We received an aggregate of approximately $24 million as net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. As of March 31, 2017, we had spent approximately $18.6 million on various capital projects in Huludao Wonder and $5.4 million on projects in SkyPeople Suizhong, as described in project (1) below using the proceeds from our public offering. The following table presents the capital projects on which we currently plan to use the proceeds from this offering. We review these projects and capital expenditures on a quarterly basis based on the market conditions and associated costs of these projects.  Capital Investment Projects  Investment/Service Agreement with Yidu Municipal People's Government  On October 29, 2012, SkyPeople (China) entered into an investment/service agreement (the "Investment Agreement") with Yidu Municipal People's Government in Hubei Province of China.  Under the Investment Agreement, the parties agreed to invest and establish an orange comprehensive deep processing zone in Yidu.  The Company is responsible for the establishment, construction and financing of the project with a total investment of RMB 300 million (approximately $48 million), in fixed assets and the purchase of land use rights, while the Yidu government agreed to provide a parcel of land for the project that is approximately 280 mu (approximately 46 acres) in size located at Gaobazhou Town of Yidu for a fee payable by the Company. The consideration for transferring the land use right for the project land shall be RMB 0.3 million per mu.  The main scope of the Yidu project includes the establishment of:  1. one modern orange distribution and sales center (the "distribution center");  2. one orange comprehensive utilization deep processing zone (the "deep processing zone"), including:  a) one 45 ton/hour concentrated orange juice and byproduct deep processing production line;  b) one bottled juice drink production line with a capacity to produce 6,000 glass bottles per hour;  c) one storage freezer facility with a capacity to store 20,000 tons of concentrated orange juice; and  d) general purpose facilities within the zone, office space, general research and development facilities, service area, living quarters and other ancillary support areas  3. one research and development center for orange varietal improvement and engineering technology (the "R&D center") and  4. one standardized orange plantation (the "orange plantation").  The total amount of RMB 300 million (approximately $48 million) will mainly be used to establish the distribution center and the deep processing zone on the project land of approximately 280 mu. The Company and Yidu Municipal People's Government agreed to discuss the investment amount and location for establishing the R&D center and the orange plantation in the future.  On November 23, 2015, the Company started the construction of the Yidu project. The Company plan to finish the construction of the infrastructure of office building, R&D center, fruit juice production facility and cold storage, and other areas in the second quarter of 2017.  The distribution center is planned to be completed by the fourth quarter of 2017, and the orange plantation is planned to be operational in the second quarter of 2017.  Investment/Service Agreement with Mei County National Kiwi Fruit Wholesale Trading Center  On April 3, 2013, SkyPeople (China) entered into an Investment Agreement (the "Agreement") with the Managing Committee of Mei County National Kiwi Fruit Wholesale Trading Center (the "Committee"). The Committee has been authorized by the People's Government of Mei County to be responsible for the construction and administration of the Mei County National Kiwi Fruit Wholesale Trading Center (the "Trading Center").  Under the Agreement, the parties agreed to invest and establish a kiwi fruit comprehensive deep processing zone and kiwi fruit and fruit-related materials trading zone in Yangjia Village, Changxing Town of Mei County with a total planned area of total planned area of 286 mu (approximately 47 acres) (the "Project").  Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company is responsible for the construction and financing of the Project with a total investment of RMB 445.6 million (approximately $71.9 million) in buildings and equipment, which also includes a fee for the land use rights for the Project land in the amount of RMB 0.3 million per mu. The Committee is responsible for financing and constructing the basic infrastructure surrounding the Project, such as the main water supply, main water drainage, natural gas, electricity, sewage, access roads to the Project, natural gas and communications networks. As of the date of this report, the Company is in the process of building fruit juice production lines, a vegetable and fruit flash freeze facility, an R&D center and an office building. The Company plans to complete the construction of these facilities in the second quarter of 2017.  As of the date of this report, Mei County National Kiwi Fruit Wholesale Trading Center has started normal operations. There are a number of enterprises operating in the trading center including 12 express delivery companies, 4 logistic companies, four on-line sales companies, two packing companies and three agriculture companies. In addition, all government departments that are relevant to the operations of the Mei County National Kiwi Fruit Wholesale Trading Center have moved into the trading center. The Company expects to complete its investment in the trading center in the second quarter of 2017, and believes that it will generate income from the trading center through various means, such as rental income from cold storage and shops, and income from logistic services.  As part of the Mei County National Kiwi Fruit Wholesale Trading Center project, on April 19, 2013, we established Shaanxi Guoweimei Kiwi Deep Processing Co., Ltd. ("Guo Wei Mei") to engage in the business of producing kiwi fruit juice, kiwi puree, cider beverages, and related products. The estimated investment was RMB 294 million, which is a part of total investment of RMB445.6 million mentioned above. We are now building fruit juice production lines, vegetable and fruit flash freeze facility, the R&D center and office building. We plan to complete the construction in the second quarter of 2017.  Suizhong Project  On July 15, 2011, SkyPeople entered into a Letter of Intent with the People's Government of Suizhong County, Liaoning Province, to establish a fruit and vegetable industry chain and further processing demonstration zone in Suizhong County, Liaoning Province (the "Suizhong project").  The Suizhong project was intended to include one or more of the following: the construction and operation of fruit juice production lines, vegetable and fruit flash freeze facility, refrigeration storage facility and warehouse, a world class food safety testing center, fruit and vegetable modern supply chain and e-commerce platform, fruit and vegetable finished products processing center and exhibition center.  The Company has made partial payment to acquire land use rights from the local government, purchase equipment and build facilities. The Company is currently in the process of building up facilities and purchasing equipment. As of date of this report, the Company has finished construction of an office building, dormitory, refrigeration storage facility and warehouse. However, due to heavy competition in the concentrated apple juice business in China, our Huludao Wonder and Yingkou facilities in Liaonng have had no production in the past two years, and the construction work on Suizhong project is also currently suspended.  Letter of Intent of Purchase of Biological Assets  In April 2016, the Company signed a letter of intent with Mei County Kiwifruits Investment and Development Corporation to purchase 833.5 mu (approximately 137 acres) of kiwifruits orchard in Mei County. The purchase price will be determined by a third party valuation company appointed by both parties. As of the date of this report, the valuation has not been completed and purchase price has not been settled. The Company paid RMB 200 million (approximately $30 million) as a deposit in the second quarter of 2016. The purchase is subject to government approval, approval by the Company's Board of Directors and definitive agreement negotiated and signed by the parties. Pursuant to the letter of intent, the Deposit shall be returned to the Company within 10 working days upon the request of the Company if the kiwifruits orchard cannot be transferred to the Company according to the schedule. The Company expects to complete the purchase process in the third quarter of 2017. This deposit was recorded as other receivables in the Company's balance sheet as of March 31, 2017.  Leasing of Orchard  On August 3, 2016, Shaanxi Guoweimei Kiwi Deep Processing Company, an indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, signed a lease agreement for 20,000 mu (approximately 3,292 acres) of kiwifruits orchard located in Mei County, Shaanxi Province, with the Di'erpo Committe of Jinqu Village, Mei County, Shaanxi for a term of 30 years, from August 5, 2016 to August 4, 2046. The annual leasing fee is RMB1,250 (approximately $189) per mu, and payment of 10 years' of leasing fees shall be made on each of September 25, 2016, 2026 and 2036. The Company made a payment of RMB 250 million (approximately $37.4 million) for the first 10 years' leasing fees on August 15, 2016, which is recorded as prepayment in the Company's balance sheet.  On August 15, 2016, Hedetang Agricultural Plantations (Yidu) Co., Ltd., an indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, signed a lease agreement for 8000 mu (approximately 1,317 square acres) of orange orchard located in city of Yidu, Hubei Province, with the Yidu Sichang Farmers Association, Hubei Province, for a term of 20 years, from September 22, 2016 to September 21, 2036.

Highlights during the Quarter  ? On January 20, 2017, the Company's Board of Directors approved the termination of the Agreement with NSR because the local government authority had not approved the transaction contemplated thereby and the Company had not received the required payment within six months of the effective date of the Agreement. On January 26, 2017, Hedetang executed a Termination Agreement for the Share Transfer Agreement with NSR. Pursuant to the Termination Agreement, Hedetang agreed not to claim any compensation or penalty against NSR under the Agreement and NSR agreed to cooperate with Hedetang to complete the process to transfer share ownership back to the Hedetang within 60 days of the date of the Termination Agreement. On March 15, 2017, NSR transferred back the share ownership to Hedetang.  ? On March 1, 2017, Hedetang Foods, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, signed a one-year business agreement with China Aigo O2O Technology Inc. (Beijing) and joined the latter's Aigo Integrity Alliance.

With over six million currently registered users and hundreds of millions of members anticipated in the next three years, Aigo Integrity Alliance is one of the largest free integrity platforms formed by Chinese enterprises.

("Quangoutong"), an e-commerce company and a wholly owned subsidiary of SkyPeople International Holdings Group Limited, which is the major shareholder of the Company, by Future World Trading (Hong Kong) Limited's, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The relevant agreement was signed on March 16, 2017. Quangoutong owns certain permits and licenses from local governments in China to conduct certain on-line financial service businesses in China. The purchase price for Quangoutong will be nominal as it has divested itself of several of its traditional businesses and all of its assets and debts. The FinTech industry is an emerging sector that utilizes computer programs and innovative technology to support the delivery of payment and financial services. This transaction is in the process of registration with Chinese government, which is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2017.  ? On March 13, 2017, Xi'an Hedetang E-Commerce Co., Ltd.

The platform mainly works with county-level local food production and processing enterprises that produce famous specialty agricultural goods. Nongmuren anticipates having hundreds of millions of registered users in the next three years. Hedetang E-Commerce plans to sell the Company's products through this platform, which will expand the Company's distribution channels.  ? On March 20, 2017, Hedetang Foods and Hedetang Farm Products Trading Market (Mei County) Co. Ltd. ("Trading Market Mei County"), two wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company, entered into a Cooperation Framework Agreement of the Spot Trading Company (the "Agreement") with Xi'an Taizhan Financial Management Co., Ltd. ("Taizhan"). Pursuant to the Agreement, Hedetang Foods, Trading Market Mei County and Taizhan will jointly establish a new company currently named as China Agricultural Commodity Trading Market Co., Ltd. ("China Agricultural Commodity Trading Center") in Mei County, Shaanxi Province, China.

Each shareholder of China Agricultural Commodity Trading Center shall be able to enjoy the profits and assume the losses of China Agricultural Commodity Trading Center based upon the percentages of their respective capital contribution. As of the date of this report, the new company has not yet been registered.  ? On March 30, 2017, the Company's Board approved and adopted the Second and Restated Articles of Incorporation (the "A&R Articles") of the Company, which were approved by shareholders holding a majority of the Company's issued and outstanding common stock on March 31, 2017. Pursuant to the A&R Articles, the Company's name will change to "Future FinTech Group Inc." following the filing of the A&R Articles at least 20 days following the mailing of the Definitive Information Statement filed with the SEC on April 28, 2017 (the "Name Change") to the Company's shareholders. The Company expects to complete the Name Change in the second quarter of 2017.  Results of Operations Comparison of Three Months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016: Revenue The following table presents our consolidated revenues for each of our main products for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively (in thousands for the revenue): Three month ended March 31, Change 2017 2016 Amount % Concentrated apple juice and apple aroma $ 1,019 $ 5,259 $ (4,240 ) (81 %) Concentrated kiwifruit juice and kiwifruit puree 195 16 179 1119 % Concentrated pear juice 923 157 766 488 % Fruit juice beverages 822 2 820 41000 % Others - 2 (2 ) (100 %) Total $ 2,959 $ 5,436 $ (2,477 ) (46 %)  The decrease in gross revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was primarily due to decreased sales in concentrated apple juice and apple aroma, which were partially offset by increased revenues from concentrated kiwifruit juice and kiwifruit puree, concentrated pear juice and fruit juice beverages.  Sales from apple-related products decreased for the three months ended March 31, 2017, as the Company sold approximately 1,160 tons of concentrated apple juice versus 4,796 tons of concentrated apple juice in the same period of 2016. Most of our concentrated apple juice was sold directly or indirectly to the international market. In 2017, international demand of concentrated apple juice from China has continued to drop. According to the data provided by the Chinese Customs, the amount of exported concentrated apple juice from China declined by 7% in year 2016 as compared to 2015, and the amount of exported concentrated apple juice from China declined by 11.9% in the first two months of 2017 as compared to the same period of 2016. Over the past three years, the purchase price of fresh apples has increased, but the sales price of concentrated apple related products remained low. Because of the negative trends in the international market and estimated lower margins, our YingKou and Huludao Wonder factories did not operate their concentrated apple juice production facilities in 2016 and the first quarter of 2017, which caused a lower inventory of concentrated apple juice and required us to purchase supply from third-party . . .

World's best overall value for natural products!


                        Since 1996, iHerb has made great efforts to enhance your online shopping experience.  Initially, our
                        company promoted the benefits of St. John's Wort; hence the name: iHerb.  We carry one of the
                        largest selections of high-quality natural products at the best overall value.  Consider iHerb your own
                        California-based natural products store!
                    










Top 10 reasons to make iHerb your number one choice!




1. Shop directly and save!

            iHerb.com is one of the world's largest online stores for natural products.
            We have been in business since 1996 and have two distribution centers, based
            in California and Kentucky.
        

            Browse our site and you'll find over 1,200 brands and 35,000 brand name products that you may also find at health food stores and natural
            pharmacies -- with one important difference: Our prices are typically 30 - 40% less. Also, don't forget to check our  Specials page for
            additional discounts on some best-selling products.
        


2. Free or discounted shipping

            Every iHerb order is eligible to receive discounted or free shipping! In general, the more products you add to your cart, the greater the likelihood that you will receive free shipping. In some cases you’ll even find that ordering one product alone may result in free shipping. We encourage you to experiment with different product combinations in order to find the best value, and share your cart with others! iHerb is the world's leader in bringing the best overall value in natural products to its customers.
        


3. Honest customer product reviews

            Unlike retailers that display third-party reviews, all of our reviews are written by iHerb customers. In order to write a review, you must
            have ordered the product from iHerb first. This means you receive honest and candid reviews, thereby helping you make a smarter buying decision.
        


4. Assurance of freshness with expiration dates

            Because we have one of the highest product turnover rates in the industry, iHerb is able to offer you the FRESHEST products possible!
            Our inventory turnover rate averages to 8.1 times per year; among the highest turnover rates, if not the highest, in our industry. This means that iHerb products are on the shelf an average of only 45 days!
        

            Plus, most products we carry have expiration or best-by dates, which can be accessed on the product page. It's like holding the real bottle or package in your hand, as you would in a typical "brick and mortar" store.
        


5. Air-conditioned, super clean warehouses

            iHerb’s distribution centers  are entirely climate-controlled, which protects the products from such conditions as humidity, heat and cold. This level of quality control is employed by iHerb to ensure product effectiveness for the customer.
            In addition, our distribution centers are industry certified by NSF International, earning Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) certification.
        


6. Solid personal privacy commitment

            Personal privacy is critically important to us. Since 1996, iHerb has never sold, leased or shared any customer information with third parties. Your personal information remains entirely confidential.
        


7. Enhanced 256-bit encryption with tokenization

            Simply put, we only store the last 4 digits and the expiration date of your credit card, so you can identify what card you are using.
        


8. 24 hour/7 day customer service

            One of the ways iHerb can offer such low prices is by automating the whole ordering process. While our customer service agents don't
            actually take orders, they do offer live  customer support from our California facility, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. (Pacific Time), Monday - Friday.
            We are also reachable 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, by chat and email to answer questions and resolve issues with your order. Of course,
            nobody's perfect. We may get quite busy at times and we ask for a little patience. We'll do our best to take care of things promptly, efficiently
            and courteously -- this is what our customers deserve!
        


9. Save even more by helping others save!

            As an iHerb customer, share your favorite iHerb products or categories, or even a shopping cart containing multiple products with others via simple Rewards links, and you will save even more!



10. A greener way to shop

            When you shop with us, you're part of a global solution. iHerb uses 100% post-consumer recycled paper for 90% of all shipping boxes. Our bubble wrap is 40% recyclable, and we recycle virtually all packing materials received 
            from manufacturers. All in the interest of a healthier, more sustainable planet!  Read more.

                        A unique blend of superfruits containing a powerhouse of antioxidants that work together as a defense against free radical damage.*
                    




                        Bursting with flavor, RESERVE™ is a tasty and convenient way to supplement your diet with the support you need for full-body health and wellness. Sweetened by nature, RESERVE’s delicious, sweet berry taste contains no added sugars, and no artificial flavors, colors or sweeteners.
                    


INGREDIENTS









The A-Listers

Resveratrol, Dark Sweet Cherry, Blueberry, Concord Grape, Pomegranate and Acai Berry. These power players owe their distinct red, blue and purple hues to their high anthocyanin content, which offers potent antioxidant effects.










                                Resveratrol
                            



                                RESERVE’s superstar ingredient, resveratrol, is a heart-healthy compound that has been known to help support your body’s immune system, fight oxidative stress, and support healthy eye function.
                            







Dark Sweet Cherry


Sweet and succulent, this delicious heart-shaped fruit has been cultivated around the world for centuries. Native to the Caucasus Mountain regions, dark sweet cherries contain significant amounts of anthocyanin glycosides known for their natural ability to neutralize free radicals.









Blueberry


Once a staple in the Native American diet, they were referred to as “star berries” because of the five-point star shape on the blueberry blossoms. Mild and sweet, blueberries are distinctive in that they are the only blue food and are more abundant on the North American continent than any other. Blueberries were also a key ingredient in Native American folk remedies.







Concord Grape


Rich in health-protecting antioxidants, the Concord is a hearty American grape with a thick, dark purple skin and seeds that naturally contain phytonutrients called polyphenols. Research suggests that certain polyphenols may play a role in supporting heart health.









Pomegranate


A symbol of hope and abundance in many cultures, pomegranates have been enjoyed for thousands of years. When opened, this “jewel of the winter” reveals clusters of juicy, gem-like seeds on the inside containing a powerhouse of antioxidants. Pomegranates are one of the world’s most popular fruits.







Acai


Sporting a deep purple color and claiming to be the richest source of antioxidants of all known fruits, the “crown jewel” of Brazil has been revered by the people of the Amazon for its unique nutritional properties.












ALL-STAR SUPPORTING CAST


                        Aloe Vera, Grapeseed Extract and Green Tea Extract combine to provide robust protection against oxidative stress.
                    










                                Aloe Vera
                            



                                Native to northern Africa, the aloe plant is a stemless succulent often cited in ancient records for its many health benefits.
                            






                                Green Tea
                            



                                Rich in the antioxidant catechin, this tea gets its name for its green-colored leaves when brewed and is the most favored of teas in all of China. Wildly popular throughout the world, green tea was first recognized outside of China in the early 1900s.
                            



                                Grape Seed Extract
                            



                                Derived from ground-up seeds of red wine grapes, this little nugget of awesome is highly favored for its antioxidant content.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
