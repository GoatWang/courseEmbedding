Wecast Network: Scooting Into Oblivion - Seven Stars Cloud Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:SSC) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Wecast Network: Scooting Into OblivionFeb.15.17 | About: Seven Stars (SSC) The Street Sweeper Short only, contrarianTheStreetSweeperSummaryControversial underwriter Chardan Capital Markets helped take this company public through a reverse merger into a shell company… a less than auspicious introduction to the public.The stock has surged on two silly announcements of "merger" agreements … with companies owned by none other than Wecast’s Chinese chairman.The chairman’s companies offloaded to Wecast include a third-tier Chinese publication. The other company sells scooters and furniture, though Wecast actually calls it a leading "global supply chain" manager.The chairman in control of the company is a Chinese entertainment guru whose former company trades OTC Markets, under a "Warning" note, at a price of $0.0003 per share.Institutions avoid Wecast stock, while losses persist, cash dwindles, the deficit exceeds $92 million and Wecast struggles along under going concern issues. Wecast Network (NASDAQ:WCST) has struggled along since 1996, when the company was called Gallery Rodeo International, a Beverly Hills "art business" turned hotel/gaming business with $327 in cash. After seven incarnations over the decades, Wecast is now a mishmash of China-linked businesses, controlled by Chinese parties and overseen by a Chinese chairman toting 40% of the company's common stock. Meanwhile, the company rips through millions of dollars, subtly pushing average stockholders closer to watching their shares get watered down in the future. Formerly called You On Demand Holdings, the video-on-demand provider operates primarily in China. After numerous business changes, Wecast now hopes to develop a consumer management platform for businesses and consumers ... or maybe headsets ... or whatever idea strikes their fancy tomorrow. Here is an executive summary on this company: *Controversial underwriter Chardan Capital Markets helped take this company public through a reverse merger into a shell company… a less than auspicious introduction to the public. *The stock has surged on two silly announcements of merger agreements … with companies owned by none other than Wecast's Chinese chairman. *One bogus merger is actually a $50-million loan loaded with conditions, including a profit target. If Sun Video were actually able to reach that $15 million target profit level, you sure couldn't buy it for so relatively little. *The other bogus merger is a freebie thrown in by the chairman, arguably just for the sake of hype. *The chairman's companies off-loaded to Wecast include a third-tier Chinese publication. The other company sells scooters and furniture, though Wecast has the nerve to tout it as a leading "global supply chain" manager. *The chairman who controls the company is a Chinese entertainment guru who has helped grind his former company into the ground. The OTC Markets where that stock is traded lists his NextMart under "Warning!" at a price of $0.0003 per share. *Wecast's recent announcement sounds like pure promotion designed to drive up the stock. Wecast suddenly wants investors to believe that it's really a tech company ... rather than a struggling video provider that just bought a scooter company. *Company leaders are fleeing. Both the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have suddenly resigned within weeks of each other. *Institutions avoid Wecast stock. No surprise. Company revenue is slim, losses are high, cash is low, the deficit exceeds $92 million and Wecast drags along under going concern issues. *Wecast is more a tiny scooter-and-furniture maker than a global supply chain manager or video-on-demand provider … or a headset maker. This company can't decide on or focus on a business. Investors may find other viewpoints here and the company website here. Meanwhile, TheStreetSweeper presents the top nine reasons we believe Wecast is a huge risk. * 1. Rat's Nest of Related Party Deals The stock ran up following two mergers with companies owned by Wecast's chairman. *Merger 1: Wecast announced the Feb. 1 completion of a merger with Sun Video Group to buy 51% of M.Y. Products. The company name was changed from You On Demand to Wecast Network Inc. The cost: 33.3 million shares of Wecast stock, actually a $50 million loan. The hype: Sun says it will generate $15 million profit within 12 months of closing or return the shares. The hitch: M.Y. Products is owned by Sun Video. Sun is owned by chairman Bruno Wu. This debt deal is off if Sun Video doesn't reach its target. If Sun Video were really able to reach $15 million profit in a year, no one would be able to buy it for a mere $50 million. The deal sounds fishy to us. *Merger 2: Wecast on Feb. 2 acquires 55% of Wide Angle Group Limited. The hype: Wide Angle is an industrial/trade media and commerce company. Wecast gets the Wide Angle shares from BT Capital Global Limited... which is owned by guess who? Chairman Bruno Wu and his Sun Seven Stars. The cost: Nothing. "WCST will pay no additional monetary or stock consideration for the acquisition." The hitch: Wecast's chairman threw in his company, Wide Angle, for free. Why on earth would he do that? It could be that Wide Angle is worthless. It could be the chairman wants to promote the stock. Or maybe both. *2. Who's Your Daddy And You Say He's Selling Scooters? Let's look at the two companies, owned by the chairman, which are intricately bound to Wecast. First, Wide Angle is just a third-tier politically oriented magazine ... published in China: 

 

 (Source:http://guangjiaojing.zazhi.com) Second, M.Y. Products is 100% owned by Sun Video, an affiliate of Mr. Wu, and Sun Seven Stars. M.Y. Products claims on its website that it's a "leading company of Wecast global supply chain management." The company further asserts it helps Chinese manufacturers that export products to the US. Mighty big claims: 

 (Source: PR Newswire, Company) But Wayback Machine shows M.Y. Products is a different kind of critter. Yep, the M.Y. Products website just last October clearly states they manufacture lots of goods under various brand names: 

 (Source: Wayback Machine) And rather than "supply chain management," M.Y. Products has been making and selling ... Scooters and furniture: That's right. The scooters are marketed to kids in the U.S., Denmark and China. Rockboard currently lists M.Y. Products as its mailing address: 

 

 (Source: Web archive; MY Products) The above looks like a hobby website to us. Below is more verification of what M.Y. Products really does.... 

 (Source: BizStanding Business Directory) Indeed, M.Y. Products was incorporated nine years ago. The scooter/furniture company shares a warehouse with three other businesses in Franklin, Indiana at 400 N. Forsythe Street. Hmmm. So scooters and furniture fall well short of "global supply chain management." *3. Adios, Suckers It's always disconcerting when officers throw up their hands and leave a company. Especially when the dearly departed is the chief financial officer, who undoubtedly knows the company finances better than anyone. And such a departure is an even bigger red flag when the CFO ducks out after less than a year on the job. That's the case with Wecast. CFO Mei Chen suddenly said "zài," or goodbye a couple of weeks ago, just about nine months after accepting the job: Item 5.02    Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.  On January 30, 2017, Ms. Mei Chen, the Chief Financial Officer ("CFO") of the Company notified the Board of Directors (the "Board") of her resignation from her position as CFO, effective February 4, 2017. Ms. Chen's resignation was not because of any disagreement with the Company known to an executive officer of the Company on any matter relating to the Company's operations, policies or practices. The Company thanks Ms. Chen for her service to the Company. On January 30, 2017, the Board appointed Mr. Yi Xu as the Chief Operating Officer, as well as the interim CFO and principal accounting officer of the Company, effective February 4, 2017. Unfortunately, no one less than the CEO, Mingcheng Tao, initiated the leadership dash from Wecast. He suddenly resigned in December:    Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.  Mingcheng Tao Resignation On December 4, 2016, Mr. Mingcheng Tao, the Chief Executive Officer and director of the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") of Wecast Network, Inc. (the "Company") notified the Board of his resignation from his position as CEO and from the Board, effective immediately. Mr. Tao's resignation was not because of any disagreement with the Company known to an executive officer of the Company on any matter relating to the Company's operations, policies or practices. The Company thanks Mr. Tao for his service to the Company. It's bad news when the top leaders flee... and especially worrisome with these little Chinese reverse-take-overs... *4. Reverse Take-Over; Controversial Underwriter Did someone say, "RTO?" Yes. Wecast went public through a reverse merger into a shell company in 2007. The underwriting team at the controversial Chardan Capital Markets helped breathe life into the shell. 

 (Source: Company SEC filing) Chardan is the brainchild of Kerry Propper, whose father started the similarly named Chardan Capital (without the word "Markets"). In a 2010 profile of the younger Propper, Observer wrote: " In the meantime, Mr. Propper's business is evolving. Late last year, he and his father were sued by investors in a $1.25 million deal for a Chinese firm called Huiheng Medical. Its CFO said on a conference call that the company was "spending substantial amounts of money paying bribes to officials in control of the Chinese hospitals," the suit says. According to records, it was settled this year. "It was a non-event," Mr. Propper said. " USA Today reported that Chardan Capital Markets was censured and fined $40,000 for three violations of short-selling rules. In 2003, the federal government sued the father and son for allegedly failing to make promised payments to a limited partnership that received Small Business Administration money. So, certainly not the most promising blastoff into the public arena. Now, about the company's big guy ... *5. Chairman's Background Chairman Wu is such a contributor to Wecast that investors have got to consider his background. Mr. Wu is a Chinese entertainment guru married to a Chinese actress. He worked for Sun New Media as both chairman and chief executive. Mr. Wu was quoted in a 2007 press release describing that company's Hail Mary to create an "enhanced" business strategy and name change to NextMart (OTCPK:NXMR): "Dr. Bruno Wu, Chairman and CEO of NextMart Inc. commented, "By changing the company's name to NextMart, we have established a powerful brand name under which we can market all of our information and e-commerce services to customers. This a critical first step for building the foundation of China's largest shopping community, with an initial focus on women's fashion products over the next 24-36 months. Our enhanced focus gives us the opportunity to leverage our core competence of media and marketing, as well as our suite of technologies, our know-how, and our market connections." But the technologies, know-how and market connections apparently didn't materialize as expected. The company proceeded to fall apart. Here's where NextMart stands now: 

 (Source: OTC Markets) *6. Quarterly Losses Persist; Institutions Say, "No Thanks" The stock attracts virtually no institutions, leaving shares in the hands of retail investors and the Chinese chairman ... a potential set up for extreme volatility on the downside. 

 (Source: Bloomberg) Lack of big banks' interest is not shocking ... considering the quarterly losses that go on and on and on, quarter after quarter: 

 (Source: Bloomberg) With Wecast's recurring losses since inception and an accumulated deficit exceeding $92 million, auditors have substantial doubts the company can continue as a going concern. *7. Almost No Cash Left; Diluting Shareholders Here's the cash mess Wecast found itself buried in last quarter: 

 (Source: Company SEC filing, TheStreetSweeper) And here's how - since its expenses exceed revenue - Wecast rapidly burns through cash: 

 (Sources: Company SEC filings, TheStreetSweeper) So Wecast had little choice but to raise cash by selling 1.136 million shares of the company stock last November to Mr. Wu's controlled company, Sun Seven Stars. That sale raised $2 million so Wecast could keep its doors open. The money-guzzler had to come up with even more dollars ... in the form of that promissory note convertible to stock that Wecast called a "merger." Wecast's stock-selling history, along with the financial messiness, convinces us there's more potential ahead for diluting existing stockholders. *8. Latest Hype Wecast issued a promotional press release on Valentine's Day with the announcement that testing of virtual reality and augmented reality headsets is nearing completion. The release drops all the big buzz words like "VR," "AR", "SaaS," and "artificial intelligence." 

 (Source: Company press release) This, in our view, is pure hype. Before this most recent release, the first time Wecast used "VR," in any SEC filing was in Feb. 1, 2017, regarding the merger with Sun Video (which is really just a small-time manufacturer): 

 (Source: Company SEC filing, press release) Before the Valentine's Day release, Wecast filings had never before mentioned "commerce technology solution" or "SaaS" or "virtual reality" or "augmented reality." So now Wecast suddenly wants investors to believe that it's really a tech company ... rather than a money-losing video provider that just bought a scooter company. The promotional release also underscores Wecast's inability to develop and focus on a valid business plan. *9. The Reality Of Virtual Reality Meanwhile, dozens of real companies are spending hundreds of millions of dollars, even billions in the VR and AR field in which Wecast suddenly purports to be an expert. The market is already dominated by giants selling headsets, including: *Facebook/Oculus VR - Oculus is the indisputable leader, so hot that Facebook spent $2 billion for a pre-shipment product. *Microsoft - Microsoft's HoloLens focuses on headset uses such as spatial mapping, gesture recognition and voice and speech recognition. Unlike others, HoloLens is wireless. *Google - Google's $15 Google Cardboard gaming-focused headset is designed for using VR apps on Android smartphones. Google is also selling its Daydream headset. *WorldViz - The company's 3D interactive and immersive visualization is aimed at universities, government institutions and private businesses. Other established rivals include Bricks & Goggles, Marxent Labs, Unity Technologies, Magic Leap, Vuzix, CastAR, etc., etc. *Conclusion So Wecast appears to be a Chinese-controlled scooter and furniture company that parades around as a global supply chain manager and video-on-demand provider and consumer management platform developer ... and now a headset maker. Wecast's chairman facilitates "mergers" with his own companies - one of which is a freebie and the other is actually a debt deal. The company has gone through numerous operational changes and still can't seem to decide what it should be doing. Both the chief executive and chief financial officer have recently thrown on their goggles and scooted away from the whole mess. We think stockholders may be wise to do the same. This thing is blowing up and when the smoke clears, we expect the stock to simmer down to 20 cents per share.

	WCST Q1 2017 OPERATING RESULTS




	 


	Revenue for the three months ending March 31, 2017 was $33.2
	million as compared to $1.3 million for the same period in 2016, an increase of approximately $31.9 million, or 2512%. The increase
	was primarily due to our new business lines acquired in January 2017 and one time consulting services that we provided to several
	customers. This was partially offset by a decrease of our legacy YOD business in the amount of $0.5 million, as the legacy YOD
	business shifts to the new exclusive distribution agreement with Zhejiang Yanhua Culture Media Co., Ltd. ("Yanhua ")
	which was announced in Q4 2016.


	 


	Cost of revenues was approximately $29.3 million for the three
	months ending March 31, 2017, as compared to $0.9 million for the three months ending March 31, 2016. Our cost of revenues increased
	by $28.4 million which is in line with the increase of revenues. Our cost of revenues is primarily comprised of electronic products
	purchasing costs from Wecast Services.


	 


	Gross profit margin for the three months ending March 31, 2017
	decreased from 27.88% in the same period 2016 to 11.52%, mainly due to the shift to the Wecast Services business from the legacy
	YOD business.


	 


	Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”)
	expenses for the three months ending March 31, 2017 was $1.3 million as compared to $2.2 million for the same period in 2016, a
	decrease of approximately $0.9 million or 42%. Salaries and compensation (a component of SG&A) for the three months ending
	March 31, 2017 was $0.8 million, a decrease of $0.6 million. Rent expenses for the three months ending March 31, 2017 was $0.1
	million, a decrease of $0.1 million. The decreases were mainly attributable to certain existing employees and offices that had
	been used to provide consulting services, whose cost was recorded and shifted to cost of sales in the three months ending March
	31, 2017.


	 




	 





	 




	  


	Travel and entertainment expenses for the three months ending
	March 31, 2017 was $0.4 million, a decrease of $0.3 million while advertising and promotion expenses for the three months ending
	March 31, 2017 was $0.02 million, a decrease of $0.03 million. This was due to the legacy YOD business transition to the Yanhua
	Partnership (announced Q4 2016), which reduced sales expenses related to that part of our business.


	 


	Professional fees for the three months ending March 31, 2017
	was $0.3 million as compared to $0.4 million in the same period in 2016, a decrease of approximately $0.1 million. This was mainly
	due to a decrease in audit and valuation fees.	


	 


	Basic and diluted earnings per share for Q1 2017 was $0.04 as
	compared to a $0.09 loss per share in the same period 2016.


	 


	Chairman Bruno Wu stated, “As the Company was able to
	recognize revenues from new businesses from the very beginning of the quarter, revenues for Q1 2017 were approximately $33 million
	dollars, or 26 times more than revenues for the same period Q1 2016 and 7 times more than revenues for ALL of 2016. Revenues in
	Q1 2017 were mostly attributable to the new business model or the Wecast Services Group, a business vertical that resides under
	the Product Sales Cloud, and was formed with the recent acquisitions of M.Y. Products, Sun Video Group and Wide Angle Group announced
	in early January. More specifically, revenues were generated from our first product vertical, consumer electronics, as well as
	our supply chain management services. We intend to add more product verticals beyond consumer electronic and as these categories
	grow and scale, and new product verticals and services are offered, we expect gross margins to expand as well as the year continues.
	We are also working diligently on launching and expanding our other 2 cloud services, the Brand Intellectual Property Cloud and
	the Financial Product Transactional Cloud, which have been described on our prior earnings call as well as in our recently published
	investor presentation.”


	 


	“While we will not be providing any guidance into Q2 revenues
	today, based on the progression we have seen thus far and the ramp up that we anticipate, we are reiterating our full year top
	line revenue guidance of $300 million USD.”


	 


	“Finally, I am extremely proud of the hard work and determination
	of our team led by Mr. Bing Yang. While there is still a tremendous amount of work to be done, the progression that has been made
	thus far on building an efficient and valuable platform and tool for our business customers has been extremely exciting to witness.
	We have a strong leadership group and employee pool in place, all of whom consider themselves fully aligned with our external stakeholders
	and are determined to create a total business, technology and financial services platform that will ultimately drive shareholder
	value to new heights.”

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  The following management's discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the notes thereto and the other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report. In addition to historical information, the following discussion contains certain forward-looking information. See "Special Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements" above for certain information concerning those forward-looking statements.  Overview  Wecast Network is a premium content VOD service provider with primary operations in the People's Republic of China. Wecast Network, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Nevada on October 19, 2004. Wecast Network is leveraging and optimizing its current operations as a premium content Video On Demand service provider in China to evolve into a global, B2B2C, mobile-driven, consumer management platform for both enterprises and consumers. By aiming to establish the world's premier multimedia, social networking and e-commerce-enabled network with the largest global effective connected user base, Wecast Network, through this expanded, cloud-based, ecosystem of connected screens combined with strong partnerships with leading global providers, will be capable of delivering a vast array of Wecast Network-branded products and services to enterprise customers and end-use consumers - anytime and anywhere, across multiple platforms and devices.  Wecast Network, through its subsidiaries and variable interest entities, provide integrated value-added service solutions business for the delivery of VOD and paid video programming to digital cable providers, Internet Protocol Television ("IPTV") providers, Over-the-Top ("OTT") streaming providers, mobile manufacturers and operators, as well as direct customers. By leveraging and optimizing its existing operations, we have positioned ourselves to evolve into a mobile driven, "new media" platform for both enterprises and consumers.  Wecast Network launched its VOD service through acquisition of YOD Hong Kong, formerly Sinotop Group Limited, in July 30, 2010 through its subsidiary China CB Cayman. Through a series of contractual arrangements, YOD WFOE, the subsidiary of YOD Hong Kong, controls Sinotop Beijing, a corporation established in the PRC. Sinotop Beijing is the 80% owner of Zhong Hai Media, through which we provide: 1) integrated value-added business-to-business ("B2B") service solutions for the delivery of VOD and enhanced premium content for digital cable; 2) integrated value-added business-to-business-to-customer ("B2B2C") service solutions for the delivery of VOD and enhanced premium content for IPTV and OTT providers and; 3) a direct to user, or B2C, mobile video service app. As a result of the contractual arrangements with Sinotop Beijing, we have the right to control management decisions and direct the economic activities that most significantly impact Sinotop Beijing and Zhong Hai Media, and accordingly, under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("U.S. GAAP"), we consolidate these operating entities in our consolidated financial statements.  On October 8, 2016, the Company signed an agreement with Zhejiang Yanhua ("Yanhua Agreement"), where Zhejiang Yanhua ("Yanhua") will act as the exclusive distribution operator (within the territory of the People' Republic of China) of Wecast Network's licensed library of major studio films. According to the Yanhua Agreement, the existing legacy Hollywood studio paid contents as well as other IP contents specified in the agreement, along with the corresponding authorized rights letter that Wecast Network is entitled to, will be turned over to Yanhua as a whole package, which was agreed to be priced at RMB 13,000,000. In addition to the above-mentioned minimal guarantee fee of RMB 13,000,000 specified, there is a provision in the Yanhua Agreement which states that once the revenue recognized from the existing contents transferred from Wecast Network to Yanhua reaches the amount of RMB 13,000,000, the revenue above RMB 13,000,000 will be shared with Wecast Network from the date when this revenue threshold is reached based on certain revenue-sharing mechanism stipulated in the Yanhua Agreement.  Wecast Network is a next generation global brand licensing, IP sales and video commerce company driven by AI and Big Data. With a firm focus on 4 strategy pillars which include: Brand, Content, Commerce and Licensing, the Company is leveraging and optimizing its legacy operations as a premium content Video On Demand service provider in China to evolve into a global, vertical, ubiquitous and transactional B2B2C, mobile-driven, consumer and supply chain management platform. By aiming to establish the world's premier multimedia, social networking and smart e-commerce-enabled network with the largest global effective connected user base, Wecast Network, through this expanded, cloud-based, ecosystem of connected screens combined with strong partnerships with leading global providers, will be capable of delivering a vast array of Wecast Network-branded products and services to enterprise customers and end-use consumers - anytime and anywhere, across multiple platforms and devices.  Our Unconsolidated Equity Investments  Investments in Shandong Media, Hua Cheng and Wecast Internet where the Company can exercise significant influence, but not control, is classified as a long-term equity investments and accounted for using the equity method. Under the equity method, the investment is initially recorded at cost and adjusted for the Company's share of undistributed earnings or losses of the investee. Investment losses are recognized until the investment is written down to nil provided the Company does not guarantee the investee's obligations nor it is committed to provide additional funding.  Principal Factors Affecting Our Financial Performance  Our operating results are primarily affected by the following factors:  . Our ability to adapt our product and service offerings to meet consumer demands. Our expansion prospect is dependent on continued development of our product and services. The content distribution industry in China is highly competitive and dominated by large Internet companies that have more resources than us. The growth of our business will depend on whether we can develop new services and products that can offer higher quality content, technological innovation and unique user experience.  Table of Contents  . Our ability to expand our subscriber base. Our business is affected by the overall size of our user base, which in turn is determined by, among other factors, (i) user experience of our service and products, (ii) our relationship with distribution platforms, such as digital cable and IPTV providers and mobile product manufacturers, (iii) expansion of our business to include increased service offerings and (iv) the expansion of our subscribers beyond smartphones to mobile tablets and other Internet-enabled mobile devices.  . Our ability to achieve revenue growth and meet internal or external expectations of future performance. In the latter half of 2014, we shifted our focus to our core VOD business and our business model is still evolving. Our financial performance is affected by, among other things, our ability to come to favorable business terms with our distribution partners, manage and procure content in a cost-effective manner and manage our operating expenses. Overall, our operating expenses have been decreasing but we have also incurred certain additional costs related to our financing activities and maintaining our public company status.  . Changes in China's economic, political or social policies or conditions. We operate in China and derive all of our revenues from sales to customers in China. Accordingly, our business, financial condition and results of operation is significantly influenced by the political, social and economic policies and conditions in China. While the Chinese economy has experienced significant growth over the past decade, growth has been uneven, both geographically and among various sectors of the economy. In addition, the Chinese government continues to play a significant role in regulating telecommunication and Internet industry development by imposing certain laws and regulations concerning Internet access and distribution of video content and other information over traditional and new media platforms. Some of the laws and regulations are also relatively new and involving and their interpretation and enforcement involve significant uncertainty.  Taxation  United States  Wecast Network, Inc. is subject to United States tax. No provision for income taxes in the United States has been made as Wecast Network, Inc. had no taxable income in the United States since inception.  Cayman Islands  CB Cayman was incorporated in the Cayman Islands. Under the current laws of the Cayman Islands, it is not subject to income or capital gains tax. In addition, dividend payments are not subject to withholding tax in the Cayman Islands.  Hong Kong  Our subsidiary, YOD Hong Kong, was incorporated in Hong Kong and under the current laws of Hong Kong, is subject to Profits Tax of 16.5%. No provision for Hong Kong Profits Tax has been made as YOD Hong Kong has no taxable income.  The People's Republic of China  Under the Enterprise Income Tax Law, our Chinese subsidiaries and VIE are subject to an earned income tax of 25.0%.  Our future effective income tax rate depends on various factors, such as tax legislation, the geographic composition of our pre-tax income and non-tax deductible expenses incurred. Our management carefully monitors these legal developments to determine if there will be any change in the statutory income tax rate.

In October, the Company signed an agreement to form a five years partnership with Zhejiang Yanhua Culture Media Co., Ltd., or Yanhua, where Yanhua will act as the exclusive distribution operator (within the territory of PRC) of the Company's licensed library of major studio films. Pursuant to the Yanhua agreement, the existing legacy Hollywood studio paid content as well as other IP content specified in the agreement, along with the corresponding authorized rights letter that the Company is entitled to, will be transferred over to Yanhua, which was agreed to be priced at RMB 13,000,000 (approximately $1,926,954). According to the agreement, at the end of 2016, as a whole package, the payment is agreed to be paid in two installments: the first half of RMB 6,500,000 was received on December 30, 2016. The remaining RMB 6,500,000 was due to be received if the license content fees due to Studios for the existing legacy Hollywood paid contents was settled by March 30, 2017. As the Company did not expect and did not make the payment to the Studios by March 30, 2017, we deemed this portion of the fee to be not fixed or determinable and therefore, this portion of the revenue did not meet the revenue recognition criteria to be recognized as of December 31, 2016.  Pursuant to the Yanhua Agreement, $107,517 of the first installment of RMB 6,500,000 was recognized as revenue in 2016 based on the relative fair value of licensed content delivered to Yanhua by December 31, 2016.  Cost of revenue  Cost of revenue was $4,435,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to $3,674,000 for the same period in 2015, an increase of approximately $761,000, or 21%. The increase in cost of revenue was primarily due to the acquisition of new content to meet our increasing business demands and the additional expense (approximately $558,000) caused by the Yanhua agreement. Our cost of revenue is primarily comprised of content licensing fees. Our content license agreements with production companies incorporate minimum guaranteed payment levels.  Gross profit  Our gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $109,000, as compared to gross profit of $932,000 for 2015. The decrease in gross profit was mainly due to an increase in cost of sales and the slight decrease in revenue.  Selling, general and administrative expenses  Our selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016, increased approximately $2,134,000, or 26% to $10,371,000, as compared to $8,237,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015.  The increase was primarily attributed to the bad debt expense occurred in 2016 of $2,873,000, which was partially offset by a decrease in compensation expense by $739,000.  Professional fees  Professional fees are generally related to audit and review fees, legal fees and consulting fees. Our professional fees increased approximately by $641,000, or 90%, to $1,357,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, from $716,000 during 2015. The increase in professional fees was related to our increasing legal service fees, which increased from $176,000 in 2015 to $436,000 in 2016 primarily attributed to the investment activities that occurred in 2016.  Depreciation and amortization  Our depreciation and amortization expense increased approximately $99,000, or 25%, to $489,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, from $390,000 during 2015.The increase was mainly due to the new office building purchased in 2016.  Impairment of other intangible assets  On July 30, 2010, the Company entered into an Ordinary Share Purchase Agreement by and among the Company, CB Cayman, and Weicheng Liu, an individual, the Company recognized additional assets identified from the business combination, including charter. Our impairment of other intangible assets are generally related to the impairment of mobile app development and the Charter/Cooperation agreement for $172,000 and $1,846,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, respectively, due to no significant revenue or cash flows would be generated from the Charter/Cooperation agreement and the decision to stop developing the APP.  Earn-out share award expenses  Our earn-out share award expenses are related to the 10,000,000 share awards issued to SSS at the closing price $1.37 on the stock issuance date.  Pursuant to the Amended Tianjin Agreement dated December 21, 2015, contingent on the performance of SSF, Tianjin Enternet will receive shares of the Company's common stock over three years, with the exact number not exceeding 5.0 million per year, provided the earn-out provisions for each of the 2016, 2017 and 2018 annual periods (the "Earn-Out Share Award") are achieved. The earn-out provision for 2016, 2017 and 2018, based on SSF performance, are either 50.0 million homes/users passed or $4.0 million net income, 100.0 million homes/users passed or $6.0 million net income and 150.0 million homes/users passed or $8.0 million net income, respectively. The earn-out provision is based on either the number of home/user pass or the net income of SSF.  On November 10, 2016, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Wecast Network held a special meeting. At the recommendation of the Company's audit committee, the Board determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and the Company's shareholders to amend the terms of the Earn-Out Share Award to (1) reduce the total Earn-Out Share Award from 15,000,000 shares of Common Stock to 10,000,000 shares of Common Stock and (2) measure the achievement of the earn-out provisions based on the Companywide achievement of homes passed in lieu of the measurement being measured by SFF's stand-alone achievement of homes passed. Based on evidence provided to the Board, the requisite thresholds necessary to trigger issuance of all shares of Common Stock subject to the Earn-Out Share Award have been achieved. Accordingly, on November 10, 2016, the Board approved the issuance of 10,000,000 shares of its common stock, par value $0.001 per share ("Common Stock to SSS") and the shares were issued on November 11, 2016.  The Company recognized the fair value of the Common Stock to SSS of approximately $13,700,000, based on the market price of the Company's Common Stock, as Earn-out share award expense.  Loss from operations  Our loss from operations increased $19,416,000 to $27,827,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, from $8,411,000 during 2015.This was mostly due to the earn-out share award expenses mentioned above.  Interest expense, net  Our interest expense increased $134,000 to $254,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, from $120,000 during 2015. The interest expense increase during 2016 was primarily comprised of 1) approximately $123,000 in interest expense recorded and related to the amortization of debt issuance costs related to the $17.7 million convertible note to SSS, and 2) approximately $24,000 in interest expenses accrued for the convertible note issued to SSS before its conversion on June 27, 2016.  Table of Contents  Change in fair value of warrant liabilities  Certain of our warrants are recognized as derivative liabilities and re-measured at the end of every reporting period and upon settlement, with the change in value reported in the statement of operations. We reported gain of $324,000 and gain of $190,000 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The changes are primarily due to fluctuation in our closing stock price.  Equity in loss of equity method investees  Our equity in loss of equity method investees decreased $124,000 to $32,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, from $156,000 during 2015. This was primarily due to Shandong Media which recognized a $124,000 loss on investment in 2015 and recognized nil loss on investment in 2016 as the investment was fully impaired as of December 31, 2015.  Net loss attributable to non-controlling interest  Hua Cheng has a 20% non-controlling interest in Zhong Hai Media and as such we allocate 20% of the operating loss of Zhong Hai Media to Hua Cheng. During the year ended December 31, 2016, $1,602,000 of our operating loss from Zhong Hai Video was allocated to Hua Cheng. For the year ended December 31, 2015, operating loss attributable to non-controlling interest was $1,055,000, of which $440,000 was allocated to Hua Cheng.  Dividends on preferred stock  For the year ended December 31, 2015, in connection with the issuance of Series E Preferred Stock, we recorded dividends of approximately $16,402,000, which was primarily comprised of the recognition of a deemed dividend for a beneficial conversion feature discount of $16,571,000. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we did not record dividends on preferred stock.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  As of December 31, 2016, we had cash of approximately $2,539,000. Approximately $310,000 was held in our Hong Kong and US entities and $2,229,000 was held in our China entities. The Company has no plans to repatriate these funds.  As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report, the Company has incurred significant continuing losses in 2016 and 2015, and total accumulated deficits was $112,294,000 and $86,458,000 as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had net current liabilities (current assets less current liabilities) of $4,084,000. We must continue to rely on proceeds from debt and equity issuances to fund ongoing operating expenses to date, which could raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans regarding these matters are also described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in this report. The consolidated financial statements included in this report have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty.  On March 28, 2016, we completed a common stock financing with SSS for $10.0 million under an agreement entered into in December 2015. On July 19, 2016, we completed a stock financing with SSW for $4.0 million. On August 12, 2016, we completed another common stock financing with Harvest Alternative Investment Opportunities SPC ("Harvest") for $4.0 million. On November 11, 2016, the Company entered into a SPA with Wecast Media Group Limited (formerly known as Sun Seven Stars Hong Kong Cultural Development Limited) ("WMG"), an affiliate of SSS. Pursuant to the terms of the SPA, the Company has agreed to sell and issue 1,136,365 shares of the Company's common stock, for $1.76 per share, or a total purchase price of $2.0 million to WMG.  The following table provides a summary of our net cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities.   Year Ended December 31, December 31, 2016 2015 Net cash used in operating activities $ (9,365,000) $ (6,435,000) Net cash used in investing activities (11,410,000) (253,000) Net cash (used in)/provided by financing activities 19,705,000 (310,000) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (160,000) (45,000) Net increase/(decrease) in cash (1,230,000) (7,043,000) Total cash at beginning of period 3,769,000 10,812,000 Cash at end of period $ 2,539,000 $ 3,769,000  Table of Contents  Operating Activities  Cash used in operating activities increased for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to an increase in net loss and a decrease in collection from customers, which was partially offset by a decrease in payments, made for license content fees, accrued expenses and other liabilities during 2016.  Financing Activities  Net cash provided by financing activities for year ended December 31, 2016 was from 1) proceeds of $10.0 million received from the sales of 4,545,455 shares of the Company's common stock, issuance of a two-year warrant to acquire an additional 1,818,182 shares of the Company's common stock at an exercise price of $2.75 per share to SSS; 2) proceeds of $4.0 million received from the sales of 2,272,727 shares of the Company's common stock to SSW; 3) proceeds of $4 million received from the sales of 2,272,727 shares of the Company's common stock to Harvest; 4) proceeds of $2.0 million received from the sales of 1,136,365 shares of the Company's common stock to SSS and 5) approximately $295,000 issuance costs paid out.

NEW YORK, June 16, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Wecast Network, Inc. (NASDAQ:    WCST) ("Wecast" or "WCST) announced today the formation of a Joint Venture ("JV") called Seven Stars He Ying Smart Cloud ("SSHY"), with Beijing HE YING Fund Management Limited ("He Ying").  The JV, which will be 51% owned by Wecast and be added to the Product Sales Cloud, will focus on several strategic areas using Wecast's burgeoning BASE + VPaaS infrastructure:  supply chain finance, supply chain management and financial settlement for both the automotive and commodities industries as well as a global commodity index exchange module based on the NextGen Exchange Group's existing platform, trading system and technology (as previously announced, Wecast recently acquired 51% of NextGen Exchange Group).








To facilitate the cross-border supply chain finance segment of the JV, SSHY and Wecast will establish a limited partnership fund in China, with SSHY responsible for raising RMB 50 Billion ($7.4 Billion USD) from investment partners such as government entities, banks and insurance companies over the next 18 months.  Since 2015 (and separate from the JV that is being announced today), He Ying's management has raised RMB77 Billion in private equity funds.  Wecast will oversee the management and business development of the JV's operations and projects.  
Once fully operational, the supply chain finance fund could theoretically convert each dollar from the fund into the generation of 6-10x sales turnover over a 12 month period, with average gross margins for the commodity and automobile industry, of 1-3%.
About Wecast Network, Inc. (http://corporate.wecastnetworkinc.com)
Wecast Network (NASDAQ:    WCST) is aiming to be the leading provider of total B2B business solutions for today's constantly evolving business landscape.  With a focus on 'BASE' technology and infrastructure (Blockchain, Artificial Intelligence, Supply Chain & Exchanges) to power our V PaaS (Virtual Platform as a Service), WCST is creating a closed trade ecosystem for buyers and sellers designed to eliminate supply chain and transactional middlemen and create a more direct and margin-expanding trading path for principals.  WCST is applying BASE + V PaaS to focus on 3 Core Cloud Areas: I. Brand, Content & Intellectual Property Cloud; II. Product Sales Cloud; III. Transactional Finance Product Cloud.  With the three clouds functioning both independently and interdependently, Wecast is creating a vertical, transactional and flexible platform for today's global enterprises.
The Company's mission and vision is to be the world's leading cloud-based, total B2B enterprise solution & platform provider that empowers businesses to grow with Big Data technology.
