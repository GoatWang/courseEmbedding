                Fund closure comes after departure of co-manager Chris Wang
            



                Move will reduce New York firm’s assets to about $2.3 billion
            



Jeffrey Altman’s Owl Creek Asset Management is winding down its Asian funds after the voluntary departure of Hong Kong-based co-manager Chris Wang, according to a regulatory filing.The move is expected to cut New York-based Owl Creek’s assets to $2.3 billion, from about $2.6 billion at the end of February, the firm said in a filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. It plans to deregister its Hong Kong office with the city’s securities regulator, it added.Firms including TPG-Axon Capital Management, Hutchin Hill Capital and Gruss Capital Management have recently shut Asian offices amid market volatility and mounting investor discontent. Disillusioned with years of mediocre performance and high fees, investors pulled $70 billion from the $3 trillion hedge-fund industry last year, the first annual net outflow since 2009, according to Hedge Fund Research Inc.








Founded by Altman in 2001, Owl Creek invests in companies affected by corporate events, such as mergers and acquisitions and takes bullish and bearish bets on stocks and credit. Its $1.1 billion Owl Creek Overseas Fund returned almost 14 percent last year, ranking 42nd among funds with at least $1 billion of assets, according to an annual ranking by Bloomberg. Still, assets had fallen from almost $5 billion in February 2012, according to a marketing document at the time.Owl Creek set up its Hong Kong unit in 2007, according to the latest regulatory filing. Wang, who joined in February 2008, opened the Hong Kong office and headed Asian operations, according to a 2016 marketing document. The office obtained a license from Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commissions in May 2011.Fund ReturnsPatrick Clifford, a spokesman for Owl Creek in New York, couldn’t immediately comment beyond the filing.

Owl Creek Asia Fund Ltd. started in July 2007 and had $364 million of assets at the end of February 2016, according to the marketing document. It was previously co-managed by Altman and Jeffrey Lee, who has since left. The fund returned an annualized 9.4 percent between inception and February 2016. It survived a near-21 percent loss in 2008 and a 2 percent decline in 2011. It retreated 5.5 percent in the first two months of last year.Among the firms that have announced Asian office closures in the past year are some of the earliest to set up a presence in the region. TPG-Axon won a license for its Hong Kong office in 2005, and Gruss obtained its asset management license in the city in 2008.

(Bloomberg) -- Jeffrey Altman’s Owl Creek Asset Management is winding down its Asian funds after the voluntary departure of Hong Kong-based co-manager Chris Wang, according to a regulatory filing.

What

 

we

 

have

 

gotten

is

 

our

 

large

exposure

 

to

was

 

the

 

reason

 

for

 

the

drawdown

 

in

We

 

did

 

not

 

have

that

 

performed

 

disproportionately

 

worse

 

than

 

their

 

beta

would

nor

 

did

too

 

net

 

long

 

going

 

into

 

a

 

severe

 

downturn

 

in

 

the

 

equity

 

markets.

 

Inception

 

Date

 

was

 

July

 

2,

 

2007.

Master

 

Fund,

 

Ltd's

 

portfolio

 

at

 

each

 

month

The

 

composition

 

of 

 

the

 

portfolio

 

will

 

vary

 

daily.

 

Exposure

 

includes

 

the

 

notional

 

exposure

 

of 

 

total

 

return

 

swaps

 

and

 

futures

 

contracts.

 

As

 

we

 

have

 

written

 

about

 

in

 

our

 

previous

 

letters,

 

we

 

believed

 

this

 

exposure

 

was

 

 justified

 

because

 

of 

 

the

 

compelling

 

and

 

event

‐

driven

 

nature

 

of 

 

the

 

bottoms

‐

up

 

opportunities

 

we

 

found

 

and

 

our

 

top

 

down

 

view

 

that

 

the

 

markets

 

would

 

do

 

okay.

 

While

 

we

 

have

 

gotten

 

the

 

bottoms

‐

up

 

mostly

 

right,

 

our

 

top

 

down

 

view

 

has

 

clearly

 

been

 

wrong

 

this

 

year.

 

We’ve

 

always

 

believed

 

our

 

strengths

 

are

 

in

 

the

 

bottoms

 

up,

 

the

 

micro…

 

the

 

alpha.

 

But

 

by

 

having

 

such

 

a

 

large

 

net

 

equity

 

exposure,

 

we

 

were

 

making

 

implicit

 

bets

 

on

 

the

 

macro…

 

on

 

the

 

beta…

 

that

 

we’ve

 

had

 

less

 

conviction

 

in.

 

We

 

feel

 

that

 

by

 

having

 

a

 

smaller

 

net

 

exposure,

 

our

 

performance

 

will

 

be

 

more

 

representative

 

of 

 

our

 

strengths

 

and

 

that

 

we

 

will

 

also

 

be

 

able

 

to

 

manage

 

through

 

the

 

volatility

 

of 

 

the

 

markets

 

more

 

effectively.

 

We

 

remain

 

long

‐

biased

 

and

 

do

 

want

 

some

 

market

 

exposure,

 

but

 

given

 

how

 

uncertain

 

we

 

expect

 

the

 

macro

 

environment

 

to

 

remain

 

for

 

the

 

foreseeable

 

future

 

(years,

 

not

 

months),

 

we

 

think

 

it

 

is

 

prudent

 

to

 

run

 

with

 

smaller

 

nets

 

going

 

forward.

 

So,

 

we

 

expect

 

to

 

run

 

with

 
























 

3

a

 

narrower

 

range

 

of 

 

net

 

equity

 

exposure

 

going

 

forward,

 

in

 

the

 

0

‐

50%

 

range

 

versus

 

our

 

historical

 

range

 

of 

 

about

 

0

‐

80%.

 

At

 

the

 

end

 

of 

 

November,

 

our

 

net

 

equity

 

exposure

 

was

 

approximately

 

35%.

 

We

 

continue

 

to

 

like

 

the

 

micro

 

stories

 

behind

 

our

 

names,

 

on

 

both

 

the

 

long

 

and

 

short

 

side,

 

and

 

feel

 

that

 

the

 

market

 

is

 

pricing

 

in

 

a

 

much

 

higher

 

likelihood

 

of 

 

a

 

China

 

hard

 

landing

 

than

 

we

 

believe

 

is

 

warranted.

 

Over

 

the

 

last

 

three

 

months,

 

we

 

have

 

visited

 

about

 

half 

 

of 

 

our

 

portfolio

 

companies

 

and

 

have

 

spoken

 

with

 

all

 

of 

 

them

 

and

 

feel

 

strongly

 

that

 

our

 

investment

 

theses

 

are

 

largely

 

unchanged.

 

We

 

have

 

used

 

the

 

recent

 

volatility

 

in

 

these

 

markets

 

to

 

adjust

 

our

 

portfolio,

 

adding

 

to

 

high

 

conviction

 

names

 

such

 

as

 

China

 

Shanshui,

 

Visteon,

 

Far

 

East

 

Horizon,

 

and

 

Hui

 

Xian

 

REIT

 

while

 

also

 

trimming

 

our

 

winners

 

such

 

as

 

PICC

 

and

 

Brilliance.

 

We’ve

 

added

 

a

 

number

 

of 

 

single

 

name

 

shorts

 

across

 

the

 

construction

 

machinery,

 

consumer,

 

and

 

telecom

 

sectors

 

to

 

replace

 

the

 

index

 

hedges

 

we

 

put

 

on

 

over

 

the

 

last

 

few

 

months.

 

Single

 

name

 

shorts

 

currently

 

represent

 

about

 

85%

 

of 

 

our

 

short

 

book.

 

While

 

the

 

external

 

environment

 

(Europe

 

and

 

US)

 

continues

 

to

 

drive

 

liquidity

 

and

 

the

 

markets

 

in

 

Asia,

 

China

 

remains

 

very

 

much

 

in

 

flux

 

as

 

the

 

year

 

long

 

tightening

 

by

 

the

 

central

 

government

 

has

 

had

 

its

 

desired

 

effect,

 

a

 

slowing

 

Chinese

 

economy

 

and

 

lower

 

inflation.

 

CPI

 

in

 

October

 

was

 

5.5%,

 

down

 

from

 

the

 

peak

 

of 

 

6.5%

 

in

 

July,

 

and

 

we

 

expect

 

it

 

to

 

be

 

around

 

4%

 

by

 

the

 

beginning

 

of 

 

2012.

 

While

 

the

 

very

 

early

 

stages

 

of 

 

easing

 

are

 

starting,

 

liquidity

 

conditions

 

remain

 

tight

 

in

 

China.

 

Property

 

sales

 

continue

 

to

 

slow

 

and

 

housing

 

inventories

 

rise

 

with

 

the

 

home

 

purchase

 

restriction

 

being

 

the

 

primary

 

limiting

 

factor.

 

We

 

expect

 

the

 

next

 

internal

 

catalyst

 

for

 

the

 

Chinese

 

market

 

to

 

be

 

easing

 

in

 

some

 

form

 

of 

 

reserve

 

rate

 

requirement

 

cuts,

 

a

 

loosening

 

in

 

housing,

 

and

 

fiscal

 

stimulus.

 

We

 

remain

 

convinced

 

that

 

a

 

hard

 

landing

 

in

 

China

 

is

 

not

 

in

 

the

 

cards,

 

as

 

the

 

slowdown

 

is

 

primarily

 

self 

‐

inflicted

 

through

 

the

 

tightening

 

which

 

leaves

 

the

 

government

 

room

 

to

 

ease.

 

China’s

 

position

 

contrasts

 

starkly

 

with

 

both

 

Europe

 

and

 

the

 

US,

 

who

 

have

 

zero

 

bound

 

interest

 

rates

 

and

 

huge

 

budget

 

deficits,

 

which

 

makes

 

both

 

monetary

 

and

 

fiscal

 

stimulus

 

exceedingly

 

difficult.

 

On

 

November

 

30,

 

China

 

announced

 

a

 

cut

 

in

 

its

 

reserve

 

rate

 

requirement

 

by

 

50

 

bps

 

which

 

in

 

isolation

 

is

 

not

 

that

 

impactful,

 

but

 

we

 

believe

 

this

 

signals

 

the

 

official

 

beginning

 

of 

 

easing.

Owl Creek to Shut Asian Hedge Funds, Deregister Hong Kong Office





 
April 26, 2017, 9:47 AM GMT+5:30






Jeffrey Altman’s Owl Creek Asset Management is winding down its Asian funds after the voluntary departure of Hong Kong-based co-manager Chris Wang, according to a regulatory filing.
The move is expected to cut New York-based Owl Creek’s assets to $2.3 billion, from about $2.6 billion at the end of February, the firm said in a filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. It plans to deregister its Hong Kong office with the city’s securities regulator, it added.
Firms including TPG-Axon Capital Management, Hutchin Hill Capital and Gruss Capital Management have recently shut Asian offices amid market volatility and mounting investor discontent.
Disillusioned with years of mediocre performance and high fees, investors pulled $70 billion from the $3 trillion hedge-fund industry last year, the first annual net outflow since 2009, according to Hedge Fund Research Inc.
Founded by Altman in 2001, Owl Creek invests in companies affected by corporate events, such as mergers and acquisitions and takes bullish and bearish bets on stocks and credit. Its $1.1 billion Owl Creek Overseas Fund returned almost 14 percent last year, ranking 42nd among funds with at least $1 billion of assets, according to an annual ranking by Bloomberg. Still, assets had fallen from almost $5 billion in February 2012, according to a marketing document at the time.
Owl Creek Asia Fund Ltd. started in July 2007 and had $364 million of assets at the end of February 2016, according to the marketing document. It was previously co-managed by Altman and Jeffrey Lee, who has since left. The fund returned an annualized 9.4 percent between inception and February 2016. It survived a near-21 percent loss in 2008 and a 2 percent decline in 2011. It retreated 5.5 percent in the first two months of last year.
Among the firms that have announced Asian office closures in the past year are some of the earliest to set up a presence in the region. TPG-Axon won a license for its Hong Kong office in 2005, and Gruss obtained its asset management license in the city in 2008.

It plans to deregister its Hong Kong office with the city’s securities regulator, it added.Firms including TPG-Axon Capital Management, Hutchin Hill Capital and Gruss Capital Management have recently shut Asian offices amid market volatility and mounting investor discontent. Disillusioned with years of mediocre performance and high fees, investors pulled $70 billion from the $3 trillion hedge-fund industry last year, the first annual net outflow since 2009, according to Hedge Fund Research Inc.Founded by Altman in 2001, Owl Creek invests in companies affected by corporate events, such as mergers and acquisitions and takes bullish and bearish bets on stocks and credit. Its $1.1 billion Owl Creek Overseas Fund returned almost 14 percent last year, ranking 42nd among funds with at least $1 billion of assets, according to an annual ranking by Bloomberg. Still, assets had fallen from almost $5 billion in February 2012, according to a marketing document at the time.Owl Creek set up its Hong Kong unit in 2007, according to the latest regulatory filing. Wang, who joined in February 2008, opened the Hong Kong office and headed Asian operations, according to a 2016 marketing document. The office obtained a license from Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commissions in May 2011.Fund ReturnsPatrick Clifford, a spokesman for Owl Creek in New York, couldn’t immediately comment beyond the filing.Owl Creek Asia Fund Ltd. started in July 2007 and had $364 million of assets at the end of February 2016, according to the marketing document. It was previously co-managed by Altman and Jeffrey Lee, who has since left. The fund returned an annualized 9.4 percent between inception and February 2016. It survived a near-21 percent loss in 2008 and a 2 percent decline in 2011. It retreated 5.5 percent in the first two months of last year.Among the firms that have announced Asian office closures in the past year are some of the earliest to set up a presence in the region. TPG-Axon won a license for its Hong Kong office in 2005, and Gruss obtained its asset management license in the city in 2008.To contact the reporter on this story: Bei Hu in Hong Kong at bhu5@bloomberg.net.To contact the editors responsible for this story: Sree Vidya Bhaktavatsalam at sbhaktavatsa@bloomberg.net, Peter Vercoe©2017 Bloomberg L.P.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to read nextEarnings of Singapore’s 50 richest up 11% to S$142 billion: ForbesYahoo Finance SingaporeDiscover it: 4.8 out of 5 avg. by 24K+ customersDiscover CardSponsoredStarbucks to shutter all Teavana stores as sales disappointAssociated PressFBI arrests suspect in woman's death on Alaska cruise shipAssociated PressShale oil players are cutting spending on drilling, and investors could reward them for itCNBCWatch the Panorama Music Festival Live July 28-30Toyota MusicSponsoredIntel's quarterly beat, raised forecasts send shares higherReutersFrance nationalizing shipyard amid Italian takeover interestAssociated PressAmazon founder Jeff Bezos – briefly – becomes world's richest manThe GuardianSee Brandy's New Look - Try Not To CringeStantonDailySponsoredPratt & Whitney in hot seat as Airbus profits fallReutersRust Belt Wisconsin looks to fill high-skill jobs at FoxconnAssociated PressU.S. stocks decline with transports; bond yields upReutersDog's Wife is Skinny Now and Looks Like Kate MossCelebrity TransformationsSponsoredBottling Line Machinery Market - Trends and Forecasts by TechnavioBusiness WireHouse, Senate Republicans reach deal to move sanctions billAssociated Press
