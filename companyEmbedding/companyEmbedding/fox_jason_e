Jason Fox is known for selling insanely vibrant, rare corals, and popularizing new coral species into the hobby.  These corals include cyphastreas that branch, rainbow-colored montiporas with unusual textures, the now ubiquitous Jack-O-Lantern leptoseris, and of course many multi-colored acroporas.   Fortunately for reefers, these discoveries grow well in captivity.
