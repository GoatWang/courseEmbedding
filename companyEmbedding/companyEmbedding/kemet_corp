KEMET Corporation was set up in 1919 and now is based in Simpsonville, South Carolina. The company produces many kinds of capacitors, such as tantalum, aluminum, multilayer ceramic, film, paper, polymer electrolytic, and supercapacitors. Capacitors are electronic components that store, filter, and regulate electrical energy and current flow. As an essential passive component used in most circuit boards, capacitors are typically used for coupling, decoupling, filtering, oscillating and wave shaping and are used in communication systems, data processing equipment, personal computers, cellular phones, automotive electronic systems, defense and aerospace systems, consumer electronics, power management systems and many other electronic devices and systems (basically anything that plugs in or has a battery). The company also manufacturers a variety of electronic components such as, AC line filters, EMI cores and filters, flex suppressors, relays, metal composite inductors, ferrite products, and transformers/magnetics. The product line consists of nearly 5 million distinct part configurations distinguished by various attributes, such as dielectric (or insulating) material, configuration, encapsulation, capacitance (at various tolerances), voltage, performance characteristics and packaging.

History[edit]
In 1919, KEMET Corporation was founded as a business of Union Carbide Corporation to manufacture component parts for vacuum tubes. In 1958, KEMET changed its market focus to tantalum capacitor. In 1969, the company entered the market of ceramic capacitors. In 1990, KEMET Electronics Corporation was acquired from Union Carbide and after two years, the company went public on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol KEM.
In its long developing history, KEMET acquired the tantalum business unit of EPCOS AG in 2007, Evox Rifa Group Oyj and Arcotronics Italia S.p.A. in 2008, Cornell Dubilier Foil, LLC and Niotan Incorporated in 2012.[1]
In 2012, the company completed the acquisition of Cornell Dubilier Foil, LLC and Niotan Incorporated.[2]
In 2017 the company announced the closing of a deal to purchase a controlling share of NEC Tokin. After the purchase by KEMET concludes on APril 10, 2017, NEC Tokin will be renamed "Tokin Corporation".[3]
Products and services[edit]
KEMET Electronics Corporation manufacturers capacitors and other components for computing, telecommunications, medical, aerospace defense, and auomotive markets. The Solid Capacitor Business Group produces tantalum and ceramic capacitors. The Film and Electrolytic Business Group sells film, paper, solid organic aluminum electrolytic capacitors, wet aluminum electrolytic capacitors.
Tantalum Business Group focuses on tantalum and aluminum capacitors for computing, telecommunications, medical, military, automotive and many other industries. Ceramic Business Group focuses on multilayer ceramic capacitors. Film and Electrolytic Business Group focuses on film, paper and wet aluminum electrolytic capacitors.
Research and development[edit]
In January 2014, KEMET introduced the High Voltage-High Temperature (HV-HT) Series in C0G Dielectric, improving the efficiency over competitive high temperature (200 degree) precious metal electrode (PME) and base metal electrode (BME) ceramic capacitor devices.[4] Oct. 2013 KEMET announced the opening of the new aluminum Electrolytic Innovation Center (EIC) in Weymouth, U.K. Products made from this new center include 20 g High Vibration Screw Terminal capacitors and a Low Inductance product line under Film and Electrolytic Business.[5] In fiscal year 2015, KEMET had 33 PhD scientists, of which 17 were focused on technology, and 501 engineers (about one half of which are in manufacturing and the other half in R&D). KEMET was granted a record number of 20 U.S. patents in fiscal year 2015.

KEMET Corporation was set up in 1919 and now is based in Simpsonville, South Carolina. The company produces many kinds of capacitors, such as tantalum, aluminum, multilayer ceramic, film, paper, polymer electrolytic, and supercapacitors. Capacitors are electronic components that store, filter, and regulate electrical energy and current flow. As an essential passive component used in most circuit boards, capacitors are typically used for coupling, decoupling, filtering, oscillating and wave shaping and are used in communication systems, data processing equipment, personal computers, cellular phones, automotive electronic systems, defense and aerospace systems, consumer electronics, power management systems and many other electronic devices and systems (basically anything that plugs in or has a battery). The company also manufacturers a variety of electronic components such as, AC line filters, EMI cores and filters, flex suppressors, relays, metal composite inductors, ferrite products, and transformers/magnetics. The product line consists of nearly 5 million distinct part configurations distinguished by various attributes, such as dielectric (or insulating) material, configuration, encapsulation, capacitance (at various tolerances), voltage, performance characteristics and packaging.

In January 2014, KEMET introduced the High Voltage-High Temperature (HV-HT) Series in C0G Dielectric, improving the efficiency over competitive high temperature (200 degree) precious metal electrode (PME) and base metal electrode (BME) ceramic capacitor devices.[4] Oct. 2013 KEMET announced the opening of the new aluminum Electrolytic Innovation Center (EIC) in Weymouth, U.K. Products made from this new center include 20 g High Vibration Screw Terminal capacitors and a Low Inductance product line under Film and Electrolytic Business.[5] In fiscal year 2015, KEMET had 33 PhD scientists, of which 17 were focused on technology, and 501 engineers (about one half of which are in manufacturing and the other half in R&D). KEMET was granted a record number of 20 U.S. patents in fiscal year 2015.
Awards[edit]
In June 2013, KEMET won the Supplier Excellence Award for the Americas, Asia and Europe by TTI.[6] In 2015, KEMET received the Global Operations Excellence Award from TTI.[7]

Kemet Corp.


            
            KEMET Corp. engages in the manufacturing of capacitors. The company's product offerings include tantalum, multilayer ceramic, solid and electrolytic aluminum and film and paper capacitors. It manufactures a broad line of capacitors in many different sizes and configurations using a variety of raw materials. The company operates its business through two segments: Solid Capacitors, and Film and Electrolytic. The Solid Capacitors segment products are commonly used in conjunction with integrated circuits, and the same circuit may, and frequently does, contain both ceramic and tantalum capacitors. Tantalum capacitors are a popular choice because of their ability for high capacitance in a small volume package. While ceramic capacitors are more cost-effective at lower capacitance values, tantalum capacitors are more cost-effective at higher capacitance values while solid aluminum capacitors can be more effective in special applications. Film, paper, and aluminum electrolytic capacitors can be used to support integrated circuits, but also are used in the field of power electronics to provide energy for applications such as motor starts, power conditioning, electromagnetic interference filtering safety and inverters. Capacitors account for the largest market within the passive component product grouping. The Film and Electrolytic segment produces film, paper, and electrolytic capacitors. This segment operates manufacturing sites throughout Europe, Asia, Mexico and the United States and maintains a product innovation center in Sweden. The company was founded in 1919 and is headquartered in Simpsonville, SC.

KEMET's Statement on the Reliability Impact of Procuring KEMET Capacitors through Non authorized Sources
Over the past decade, the number of non authorized sources for electronic components including KEMET Capacitors has greatly increased. These sources range from individuals selling electronic components out of their homes, to large web-based traders and independent distributors/brokers. There is no way to conclusively determine the storage/handling conditions and legitimacy of origin of products bought through non authorized sources. Product supplied through non authorized sources may appear to be legitimate, but many quality issues with such product can occur and KEMET cannot warrant product purchased through non authorized sources.
Customers that buy KEMET Capacitors from non authorized sources may save money in the short-term, but they run the risk of major reliability issues that can damage their reputation and prove enormously expensive in the long-term due to warranty expenses, field replacements, and liability claims. Customers that nonetheless turn to non authorized channels for KEMET Capacitors trade risk for reliability. For these reasons, KEMET Corporation strongly encourages all our customers to buy our product exclusively through our authorized sources. Our authorized sources are listed on our website.
