Explain Everything, Inc. Key Developments

Explain Everything, Inc. Launches Next-Generation Collaboration Experience for Teachers and Learners
Mar 23 16
A new dimension to working and learning together has been introduced as part of Explain Everything, Inc.'s, product: Explain Everything Collaborative Whiteboard. The company continues to seek ways to help people build and share knowledge in ways that were previously impossible or very difficult to execute. With the new application for iOS, the company completed its worldwide launch following SXSWedu and also introduced Explain Everything Discover, a new content community portal, and also added an integrated, cross-platform license and deployment model for its products and services. Explain Everything Collaborative Whiteboard allows users on different iPads to work on the same project with all of the design, recording, and export features made popular by its Interactive Whiteboard application. The Explain Everything Discover content portal provides users an additional destination to publish projects easily, discover the work of others, and download, edit, and remix projects from the global community. Other differentiating features from its previous product include CODE-based project sharing, a cutout tool, background templates, and external display options. The Interactive Whiteboard for Chrome, Android, and Windows Operating systems, the Collaborative Whiteboard for iPad, and Explain Everything Discover are bundled as part of an annual subscription with heavily discounted pricing options for education users. The original Explain Everything Interactive Whiteboard continues to be available for iOS as a separate application and purchase. The price of the application will increase in April from $3.99 to $5.99.


Explain Everything, Inc. Launches New iOS Collaborative Whiteboard
Feb 1 16
Explain Everything, Inc. launched a new iOS collaborative whiteboard, updates to its Android, Chrome, and Windows interactive whiteboard, and Explain Everything Discover, a new web-based content portal at Bett Show 2016. With over 3 million users of its products worldwide, this launch provides teachers, students, and anyone who shares content an end-to-end solution for generating ideas, collaborating, and publishing and sharing material. Explain Everything Discover provides users a repository of shared editable projects that can be viewed, downloaded, and remixed. Explain Everything Collaborative Whiteboard (iOS only at launch) allows users to create, animate, and record from multiple devices in real-time while on the same wireless network. The new application was first made available in a few markets and will released worldwide around March 2016.

'The No.1 App for Every Teacher'- Daniel Edwards


 




 




 











Explain Everything supports learning experiences and educational practices for over 5 million teachers and students in schools all over the world





Teachers are using Explain Everything for both live and video-based instructional delivery. They prepare materials in advance or start from a blank canvas. Teachers also create projects and activity templates that are shared with students to work and build upon.

















Students are creating rich artifacts of understanding with Explain Everything. Screencasts and other content created with Explain Everything become multimedia representations that can capture both the process and product of a learning experience. Students are creating tutorials, animations, and presentations — sharing ideas and becoming “teachers” themselves. They are working with project activities, collaborating in real-time, and sharing and publishing their work.





Explain Everything fits into any teaching and learning environment, with a variety of import and export integrations and connections including popular services like Google Apps for Education, iCloud, Dropbox, Microsoft OneDrive, and more. Explain Everything comes with its own cloud-based sharing platform as well. Leverage the open sharing community on Explain Everything Discover to get inspired, to download and remix public projects, and to let others access your creations with a single link.
Explain Everything Discover also allows private, closed-community sharing within a group or institution.











Examples of projects shared by teachers and students

Student-directed
Tutorials and Explanations

This student group has created a video about the chemical element Au – gold.

  I love how Explain Everything gives students complete ownership of their learning.Last year, my students created lesson reflections based on a topic that was delivered to them.It was so wonderful to hear their voice in their reflections.They did a better job explaining their learning than I could ever do for them!It was a wonderful thing to witness! Mrs. Storer, Instructional Coach & Technology Integration,Mentor Montgomery Intermediate School    I often tell teachers, if I could only place one app on our student iPads, it would be Explain Everything.It is the most versatile app available for schools.A goal of using an iPad in classrooms is to transform students into creators:planners, authors, speakers, producers, researches, and designers.Explain everything makes that happen, across all subjects, in one app. Molly Fedele, Technology Coach,Mattacheese Middle School    Explain Everything is an absolute must have for all teachers!I use it to create quick reteaches of lessons to students that they access at home prior completing their homework.Parents are thrilled with this resource, and it greatly benefit students.Students are so focused, excited, and engaged when using this amazing yet simple app.Kiss that outdated overhead projector goodbye - just snap a quick photo of any document and project.Finally, an app I use everyday that makes the difficult job of teaching a little easier. Tracey Gamache, Grade 4 Teacher,Riddle Brook School
