Investment Funds
Introduction
AEI is one of America's most experienced sponsors of income-producing commercial property programs. We have been providing investors with professional program investment programs and management since 1975. During the past 38 years, our professional team of real estate, investment, financial, and legal experts have acquired hundreds of net leased properties across America. Tens of thousands of investors have purchased shares in AEI property programs.
AEI offerings provide an opportunity to invest in diversified portfolios of commercial properties acquired without debt. AEI investment properties are subject to long-term net leases (typically, 8 to 15 years) and are 100% occupied by creditworthy corporate tenants prior to purchase - one important reason why our business model allows us to avoid many of the vacancy risks common to more speculative real estate offerings. Since AEI programs own their properties debt-free, they are not exposed to the risks of foreclosure or fluctuating mortgage rates. Our conservative investment strategy and management style are intended to lower volatility and reduce risk.
If you are an Accredited Investor and would like more information about the opportunities and services available from AEI, I invite you to contact your financial advisor or AEI Investor Relations at 800-328-3519.
Sincerely,


							Robert P. Johnson
							President/CEO

HARTEN, Judge
 
����������� Appellant Estella Alvarez challenges the
district court's denial of her motion to dismiss for lack of personal
jurisdiction.� We affirm.� 
FACTS
Respondents AEI Net Lease Income and Growth Fund XX Limited Partnership
(AEI Net Lease XX) and AEI Real Estate Fund XVI Limited Partnership (AEI Real
Estate XVI) are organized as limited partnerships domiciled in Minnesota.� In both limited partnerships, corporations
function as general partners; Robert P. Johnson is president of the
corporations. 
����������� During the mid-1990s, both appellant and her
then-husband, Anthony R. Alvarez, were officers and shareholders in Renaissant
Development Corporation (RDC), a Texas corporation that operated various Texas
restaurant chains.�� 
����������� Respondents owned several Texas
properties.� On November 30, 1994,
Anthony Alvarez in his capacity as president of RDC entered into a lease
agreement with AEI Net Lease XX, whereby RDC would become lessee of one of
AEI's Texas properties.� That same day, both Anthony Alvarez and appellant signed a "guarantee of
lease."� The document stated that
the
undersigned * * * hereby absolutely and unconditionally guarantees to said
Lessor * * * the due and prompt performance and observance of all of the
obligations of said Lease to be met by Lessee, including but not limited to the
payment of rent and other payments to be made under the Lease.
 
The document also contained the following clause:
This Guarantee is executed under and intended
to be construed by the laws of the State of Minnesota.� The undersigned consents to be sued in the
jurisdiction and venue of any District Court in the State of Minnesota or in
any Court in the State of Texas, such jurisdiction and venue to be determined
at the sole option and election of Lessor.
 
The document
was signed by Anthony Alvarez in his capacity as president of an entity called
The Harvard Associates, Inc.� It was
also signed by both Anthony Alvarez and appellant, apparently individually.
����������� On August 30, 1995, Anthony Alvarez in his
capacity as president of RDC leased another Texas property owned by AEI Net
Lease XX.� Again, Anthony Alvarez and
appellant signed a document containing language nearly identical to that found
in the 1994 guarantee.� 
����������� Finally, on March 22, 1996, Anthony Alvarez
in his capacity of president of RDC leased a third Texas property, this time
from AEI Real Estate XVI.� Anthony
Alvarez, in his capacity as president of The Harvard Associates, Inc. and as
president of various other corporations, signed a guarantee with terms almost
identical to the aforementioned guarantees.�
Both Anthony Alvarez and appellant also signed the guarantee in their
respective individual capacities.� 
In 1997, Anthony Alvarez and appellant reached a divorce agreement
whereby Anthony Alvarez was to retain sole control over the RDC restaurant
businesses.� 
����������� In August 2000, respondents filed a complaint
in Ramsey County District Court against, among others, The Harvard Associates,
Inc., Anthony Alvarez, and appellant.�
Respondents alleged that RDC had failed to pay rent under all three of
the foregoing lease agreements and that the defendants were liable for the
resulting damages pursuant to the guarantor agreements. 
����������� Appellant moved to dismiss the complaint on
the grounds that the district court lacked personal jurisdiction over her.� In support of this motion, appellant
submitted an affidavit in which she alleged that she had little or no
involvement with RDC operations.�
Rather, according to appellant, she merely signed documents that Anthony
Alvarez had placed in front of her from time to time.� Appellant argued that this lack of knowledge concerning the
forum-selection clauses contained in the guarantor agreements, coupled with the
inconvenience that would result to her in Minnesota litigation, justified
dismissal of the complaint.� Appellant
acknowledged that she signed all three documents purporting to make her a
guarantor of the lease agreements.�
Johnson claims that appellant did in fact have some contact with
respondents' offices in the mid-1990s concerning the guarantor agreements;
appellant denies this claim.� 
����������� The district court denied appellant's motion
to dismiss, finding that enforcing the forum-selection clauses contained in the
guarantor agreements was neither unfair nor unreasonable.� The district court noted that "[w]hile
[appellant] may have been unsophisticated in business matters, it is clear that
her husband was not" and that "[w]hen Mr. Alvarez negotiated these
[guarantor] agreements he was doing so as agent of the corporations and of his
wife."� The district court
concluded:
The bottom
line is that, on her husband's advice, [appellant] voluntarily signed
agreements which she chose of her own free will not to read or familiarize
herself with, and she did so for the benefit of her and her husband.� Under these circumstances the court is
satisfied that there is nothing unfair about requiring [appellant] to defend
this case in Minnesota.
 
This appeal
followed.����������� 
D E C I S I O
N
 
Enforcement of a forum-selection clause is within the discretion of the
district court.� Personalized Mktg. Serv., Inc. v.
Stotler & Co., 447 N.W.2d 447, 450 (Minn. App. 1989), review
denied (Minn. Jan. 12, 1990).�
The district court's decision should not be disturbed unless the
forum-selection clause is "so unreasonable that its enforcement would be
clearly erroneous and against both logic and the facts on record."� Id. at 451 (citation omitted).� 
����������� When parties contractually agree to a
forum-selection clause, that agreement should be given effect unless the party
seeking to avoid the agreement can show that to do so would be unfair or
unreasonable.� Hauenstein & Bermeister, Inc. v.
Met-Fab Indus., 320 N.W.2d 886, 890 (Minn. 1982).� Enforcement of a forum-selection clause is
unfair or unreasonable only if:� (1) the
chosen forum is a seriously inconvenient place for trial; (2) the choice of
forum agreement is one of adhesion; or (3) the agreement is otherwise unreasonable.� Interfund Corp. v. O'Byrne, 462 N.W.2d 86,
88 (Minn. App. 1990).� Appellant
contends that the district court abused its discretion in enforcing the
forum-selection clauses at issue because the three enumerated situations apply.
1.�������� Seriously Inconvenient Forum
Appellant claims that Minnesota is a seriously inconvenient forum as
applied to her because she and her family reside in Texas and defending a
lawsuit in Minnesota would disrupt the lives of her and her children.
In order for a forum to be seriously inconvenient, one party would have
to be "effectively deprived of a meaningful day in court."� The Bremen v. Zapata Off-Shore Co., 407
U.S. 1, 19, 92 S. Ct. 1907, 1918 (1972), quoted in Hauenstein, 320 N.W.2d at
890.� Factors relating to the location
and convenience of witnesses generally do not enter the analysis in determining
whether a forum is seriously inconvenient.�
Hauenstein,
320 N.W.2d at 890.� Accordingly,
appellant's discussion concerning the practical complications that might
disrupt her life are irrelevant in determining whether to enforce the
forum-selection clauses at issue.�
Moreover, appellant has not demonstrated how enforcement of the
forum-selection clauses will deprive her of a meaningful day in court and
therefore has failed to show that Minnesota is a seriously inconvenient venue
for trial.
2.�������� Adhesion Contracts
Appellant argues that the guarantor agreements at issue constitute
contracts of adhesion.
By definition,
an adhesion contract is drafted unilaterally by a business enterprise and
forced upon an unwilling and often unknowing public for services that cannot
readily be obtained elsewhere.� It is a
contract generally not bargained for, but which is imposed on the public for necessary
service on a "take it or leave it" basis.� Even though a contract is on a printed form and offered on a
"take it or leave it" basis, those facts alone do not cause it to be
an adhesion contract.� There must be a
showing that the parties were greatly disparate in bargaining power, that there
was no opportunity for negotiation and that the services could not be
obtained elsewhere.
 
Schlobohm v. Spa Petite, Inc.,
326 N.W.2d 920, 924-25 (Minn. 1982) (citations omitted) (emphases in
original).� Accordingly, the two
essential inquiries for determining whether a contract is one of adhesion
are:� (1) whether the contract the
result of the superior bargaining power of one of the parties; and (2) whether
the contractual service involved a public necessity.� Osgood v. Medical, Inc., 415 N.W.2d 896, 899 n.1 (Minn. App.
1987), review
denied (Minn. Feb. 12, 1988).
Appellant acknowledges that she signed the guarantor agreements at
issue even though she did not know what the agreements bound her to do.� Despite appellant's claims that she had
little knowledge concerning her husband's business affairs,[1]
she could have been in a fair bargaining position had she taken the time to
read what she was signing rather than blindly following her former husband's
advice or instructions.� See Cell v.
Moore & Schley Sec. Corp., 449 N.W.2d 144, 147 (Minn. 1989) (no
adhesion contract where, although party claimed to be unsophisticated,
"there is no indication that he was forced to enter into the agreement or
was completely unable to negotiate its terms").� Moreover, there is no evidence that appellant signed the
guarantor agreements as a result of respondents� superior bargaining
power.� On this ground alone the
guarantor agreements cannot be considered to be adhesion contracts.� See id.
Finally, the guarantor agreements involved a guaranty by appellant, her
former husband, and others as a means of inducing respondents to lease certain
properties to RDC.� Appellant
acknowledges she was an officer and shareholder of RDC.� Under the circumstances of the present case,
this type of agreement cannot be said to involve a public necessity, as RDC
presumably could have leased properties for its restaurants from any number of
Texas landowners.� See Schlobohm, 326 N.W.2d at
925 (no adhesion contract where "no showing that [a party's] services were
necessary or that the services could not have been obtained
elsewhere").� 
In sum, the guarantor agreements at issue do not display the indicia of
adhesion contracts.
3.�������� Otherwise Unreasonable Agreement
Appellant asserts that the terms of the guarantees were otherwise
unreasonable.� 
A forum selection
clause is otherwise unreasonable if enforcement of the clause would contravene
a strong public policy of the forum in which the suit is brought.� Judicial economy and the prevention of
multiple actions on similar issues are policies which can render a forum
selection clause patently unreasonable. 
 
Interfund, 462
N.W.2d at 89 (citations omitted).� Here,
there is simply no evidence to explain how the enforcement of the
forum-selection clauses at issue would contravene a strong public policy.
Because appellant has failed to show that the chosen forum is seriously
inconvenient, that the contracts at issue were adhesion contracts, or that they
were otherwise unreasonable, we conclude that the district court acted within
its discretion in enforcing the forum-selection clauses.� 
Affirmed.




* Retired judge of the Minnesota
Court of Appeals, serving by appointment pursuant to Minn. Const. art. VI, �
10.


 


[1]
Appellant claims that the district court erred as a matter of law by imputing
the business knowledge of a husband to a wife and by imputing the knowledge of
one corporate officer to another.� Based
on the district court's order, it is not clear that the district court made any
such legal determination.� On the
contrary, it appears that the district court was simply discussing Anthony
Alvarez's business sophistication as one of many factors weighing against
appellant's assertion that the guarantor agreements constitute contracts of
adhesion.� 
At any rate, the issue in the present case is whether the district court
abused its discretion in enforcing the forum-selection clauses, not whether
knowledge attribution from Anthony Alvarez to appellant is appropriate.� We will not reverse a district court's
decision based on an error�real or perceived�concerning what amounts to a
collateral legal question.� See In re
Welfare of D.T.N., 508 N.W.2d 790, 797 (Minn. App. 1993) ("A
reviewing court will not reverse a trial court for an error that it can see did
not change the result." (citation omitted)), review denied (Minn. Jan.
14, 1994).�

Calpers Cuts Investment Targets. New Private Equity Funds Launched


Calpers Cuts Investment Targets, Greatly Impacting Local Governments 
With the declaration that California’s roads are “in dire shape” and the evacuation of 180,000 people due to the Oroville Dam emergency, it’d seem like the state can’t catch a break. Especially when you consider the fact that California’s state public pension system, Calpers, recently voted to lower its projected future investment returns.
Calpers, the $300 billion institution that manages 1.7 million current and future retirees’ investments, has cut the future returns projection down from 7.5 percent to 7 percent; the reduction will be implemented over the next three years. The trustees acknowledged the importance of the decision, and the consequences it may have on municipal governments— with the returns covering less of retirees’ pensions, local governments will have to pay more. Vallejo, Stockton, and San Bernardino’s bankruptcies can be, in part, attributed to pension payments to Calpers.
Critics of Calpers claim that the system makes it extremely difficult to leave, with judge Christopher Klein in Stockton’s bankruptcy case calling Calpers “a bully”. In November of 2016, Calpers cut California town Loyalton’s four municipal retirees pensions by 60 percent. Other critics argue that Calpers returns are too high, and should use the returns of Treasury securities as a base; 10-year bonds have returns at approximately 2.5 percent.
While Calpers may be cutting its targets, we’ve compiled a list of funds that have launched  that accept both private and institutional investments. We’ve identified that Jan 2016 has seen $370 M in new funds launched (compared to $265 M in Jan 2017), with $100 M funded in 2017 vs $64 M in 2016. Therefore, the funding rate for newly launched funds stays relatively the same at around 26%.
Here are the most notable private equity funds launched:
Chestnut Development Partners
Chestnut Development Partners II, LP is the second fund from Chestnut Real Estate; the first is aptly named Chestnut Development Partners, LP. Chestnut Development focuses on primary and secondary U.S. markets, and seeks to invest $1 million to $5 million in retail and healthcare properties. It’s typical hold period ranges from 3-7 years. Anchor Health Properties, a JV partner of Chestnut Development, is expected to grow to $50 million in equity.
MLG Companies
MLG Private Fund III is the newest addition to the MLG Private Funds series; the funds aim to acquire geographically diverse commercial real estate assets, ranging from $5-55 million. MLG has an 8% cumulative preferred return, targeted IRR returns of 13-15% over a 5 year period, and has the potential to achieve $150 million. The third private fund places emphasis on multi-family, industrial, and office acquisitions.
Bristol Group
Bristol Group invests in assets that are in need of recapitalization, re-tenanting, or repositioning. The fund also looks into fee simple or leasehold interests, joint ventures, options, and sub-performing and nonperforming loans. Apartments, office, and retail are also possible assets. The fund aims for an investment size of $10 million to $1 billion.
