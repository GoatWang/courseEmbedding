File Formats










 
  
 


 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 


 
 
 
 







FILE FORMATS
There are two types of file formats that we use. The first is called
a Vector file. The Vector format is basically all lines, curves, and
color
designation.  This type of graphic can be scaled up or down
without
any distortion.

 Our system uses a proprietary Vector format that can only be
shared
with other systems with like software.  We can import other Vector
file formats to our own format.  These would include Adobe
Illustrator
(.ai), Corel Draw File (.cdr), Encapsulated Postscript (.eps), Windows
Medafile (.wmf), and a CAD [Computer Assisted Drafting] program format
(.dxf). Sizes designated in the files may or may not be converted.
Other
precautions also need be followed to insure usable conversion. 
First,
all shapes have to closed and adjacent like colors combined.  Even
though shapes may appear closed and solid when filled, they may not
be. 
Second, adjacent colors should kept to a minimum.  Gaps may show
in
time. Third, any fonts included in the layout must be converted into
graphics. 
This can be done through either an "Outline" command or a "change text
to curves" command.  Third, the images should only be vector type;
bitmaps Finally, layering shapes on screen or print is much cleaner
than
layering vinyl.  Any layering in vinyl will show seams in the
final
product.

 Files coming from desktop programs, no matter how popular or
universal, 
cannot be used.  Documentation program files need to have the
originating
program and fonts installed to read or print. Printing is not the same
as cutting.  However, if a particular letterstyle you have is
needed;
it may be converted into a language we can use if it is an IBM
compatible
True Type Font (.ttf).  This file can be copied from your
\windows\system
directory or gotten from its original font disk.  Check under lettering
for more options. Macintosh,  postscript, or True Type font may be
used with many restrictions.

 

 The Second type of files we work with are raster files. 
Raster files are two dimensional arrays of "pixels".  These pixels
can be just Black or White (Black and White bitmap files) or have
shades
of Gray (Grayscale) or have color depth (Color).  Unless these
pictures
are converted to Vector format they can only be printed.  If need
be we can vectorize a bitmap file to cut in vinyl.  The vecorizing
traces the edges of the pixels then retains the tracing and deletes the
bitmap image.  Bitmap ( Black and White) files are the only
formats
that can be directly vectorized.  Because of the staircase edge
effect
that happens when a raster image is enlarged, the image needs to be
created
at as large a size that can be transported.  Examples of bitmap
files
extensions would be (.pcx) and (.bmp). Other file formats may also be
directly
vectorized, but they must be in Black and White only.

 With effort color images can be vectorized to be cut in
vinyl. 
The colors need to be solid with distinct separation.

 Spot coloring, whether it be solid or graduated fills, require
vector type images. Colors are assigned to particular shapes then
printed.

 While only Vector type images can be cut, both Vector and
Raster
images can be printed. The same staircasing effect on raster images
mentioned
earlier make file size critical.  The more an image is enlarged
the
worse the effect becomes.  Optimum file size is 300 dpi at output
size.  This file size should  be from original information
and
not photo program enlarged.  Lettering and hard diagonal edges are
the first areas to show distortion.  Printing these images require
the Four Color Process Printing process.  File formats for these
images
would include (.tif), (.bmp), (.eps), and (.wmf).

For fast, easy, quality installation of graphics with no bubbles, even in cold weather. Rapid Tac application fluid shocked installers by allowing them more control over their applications than ever before. Now what took hours could be accomplished in minutes. Using Rapid Tac application fluid can often allow a large graphic to be installed with one person where two people were required to perform the same installation dry. Rapid Tac application fluid also cleans the substrate without leaving residues ensuring a contaminant free installation. It then helps to "float" the vinyl film until it is properly positioned. Rapid Tac application fluid's best feature is that it effectively breaks the surface tension of the adhesive on the film allowing it to flow and bond to the substrate more effectively than even a dry application. It is now possible to achieve a full bond in as little as ninety seconds. Your customers and your reputation will benefit from higher-quality applications. Your bottom line will benefit from faster applications and less failures as well.
