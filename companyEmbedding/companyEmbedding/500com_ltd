Real-time Fraud Protected Telephony Services

For organisations who need to protect themselves against the financial and legal consequences of voice fraud, 500’s software portfolio delivers protection for fixed lines, mobiles and SIP connectivity, while meeting the suite of telecoms service standards defined by the Federation of Communication Services.


Read More

500 developed the only accredited protection against fixed and mobile voice fraud because businesses need the assurance that comes from certification they can trust.
Since preventing voice theft and controlling voice costs are inextricably linked, 500’s service enables a business to do both.
Our solutions are designed and built to protect against the serious consequences of attacks on unprotected voice services.


The willingness of 500 Ltd to engage at a technical level and really understand their requirements was a key part of the decision to engage with them. They took the time to really understand our requirements as a solution provider, and no other provider was able to offer the combination of billing services underpinned by high levels of fraud mitigation

ESP LTD PB-500 Electric Guitar





The PB-500 ASB features a mahogany body with a beautiful flamed maple top. A 3-piece mahogany set neck, Tune-O-Matic bridge, and stop tailpiece give this guitar great sustain and strength.

Abalone and mother-of-pearl dot inlays in the rosewood fretboard and chrome hardware complement the rest of the guitar's look perfectly. Seymour Duncan Alnico Pro 2 humbucker pickups provide plenty of power, and a push-pull coil split provides a wide selection of tones. Grover tuners and an Earvana compensated nut ensure you'll sound spot-on in tune in every key.

By MattyGfrom Boston, MASee all my reviews I have been playing 18 years and have played them all. This guitar plays as well as any I have played. The pickups are just fantastic. Roll off the volume a bit and the tone changes beautifully. The split coil is great. Versetile instrument. Neck feels great. Only thing is that if you play while sitting alot (I don't) it does sit a little funny on your thigh. No biggie.(1 of 1 customers found this review helpful)Was this review helpful? Yes / No - You may also flag this review6/25/2007(1 of 1 customers found this review helpful) 5.0Excellent all around By jimiirixfrom outer space in the 60's, manReally a quality guitar for the money only one volume and tone control but super well made and finished, nice shape and excellent action.  Pickups sound like US version humbuckers with plenty of definition, not muddy like some import humbuckers.  Highly recommend for blues and boogie players, not for metal IMO.(1 of 1 customers found this review helpful)Was this review helpful? Yes / No - You may also flag this review1/16/2008(1 of 4 customers found this review helpful) 2.0Cumbersome, and dull. By Jaybles of Series Overkill.from Dallas, GA.See all my reviews I used this guitar in my local music shop because it looked kinda classy, and it was an ESP. I mean, c'mon, ESP makes some amzing instruments. When I plugged it in however,(through both a peavy valve king, and a Fender metal head) I was severly dissapointed. First off, the guitar's tone was sort of hollow, no real substance to it. A kind of tiny sound really. Though it looks like it would have a nice thick, solid, deep tone, it does not. The pickups emit a hum, and make you want to play harder because not all your sound is being pulled though, kinda like playing a beginer guitar.           Now for playability, the guitar, is smooth, but kind of too smooth, uncomfortably smooth. It feels plastic like. The frets are kind of small, and it lacks sustain. And the heel of the headstock is ridiculously large. It extends easily to the 2nd fret, and is very annoying, it's almost as large as the heel connecting the body to the neck. Which, i suppose provides better tuning stability, but it sacrifices playability. The bottom horn of the guitar is so far up and so small that it makes it extremely hard to play sitting down, and the extra smooth satin finish doesn't really help there, it slides all over the place. The knobs look as if they're strategically placed, but because they're placed more awkwardly than most guitars, they're really hard to get used to. All in all, I do not reccomend this guitar to anyone, unless they want to work too hard to get something to sound nice.(1 of 4 customers found this review helpful)Was this review helpful? Yes / No - You may also flag this review6/8/2007 5.0wow...... By The Red Celtfrom Atlanta, GaI played this today in a little shop. The guy just took it out of the box and hung it up on the wall. At first I was a little concerned because "out of the box" guitars need a little set up. Not this one. Its was only slightly out of tune. The through neck design and the Alinco pickups are amazing. I've only heard tone like this in higher end models. It had a great "all around" tone that is conducive to just about any style aside maybe ultra heavy metal. Overall great sound, unique body style, and great walnut finish.Was this review helpful? Yes / No - You may also flag this reviewDisplaying reviews 1-4Back to top

The electric guitar is an instrument that took the world by storm. Rising from nonexistence to prominence in nearly every genre in just a few decades, it's had an impact on the music scene that no one can deny. If you're looking to follow in the footsteps of legends like Jimi Hendrix and Carlos Santana or modern guitar heroes like Dave Grohl and Tom Morello, then choosing a solid-body electric guitar is an important rite of passage. Newly released is the Jimi Hendrix Signature Stratocaster.Solid-body designs are the most common type of electric guitar, owing to their outstanding versatility. The Fender Stratocaster is a solid body electric that is considered to be on the the iconic guitars in rock and roll. To get the Made in USA quality, check out the Fender American Standard Stratocaster. Six strings is par for the course, but if you're adventurous you can also challenge yourself with extended-range 7, 8, 10 or even 12-string guitars. Under those strings are the pickups, which come in two major varieties. Single coils were the original style pickups, and they're still widely in use today. These pickups are known for allowing a little bit of feedback, or hum, giving a vintage character to their sound. The second type of pickup is dual-coil, also known as humbuckers because they cancel out that hum. The two coils have a side-effect that results in a more powerful, heavy tone, making them the go-to pickups for distortion-rich genres like metal, grunge and alternative.The tone is also affected by the wood of the guitar body, which has a subtle impact on the overall character of the sound. Poplar and alder are some of the most common tonewoods, since they create bright, balanced sounds that flatter precision playing. On the other end of the scale you have maple and mahogany, which yield a darker, mellower tone. Other woods, like basswood and ash, lie somewhere in the middle, providing a neutral character that makes them amazingly versatile.Apart from the pickups and body material, one of the other factors to take into account when choosing your guitar is the neck style. It may seem simple at first glance, but there are a lot of differences from one neck to the next. For example, is the back C-shaped or V-shaped? What is the radius of the fretboard? Fretted or fretless? Rosewood or ebony on top, maple or mahogany in back? All of these things distinguish one guitar neck from the next, and you owe it to yourself to do your homework here. It might take some thought in order to figure out for certain what works best for you, but it's worth the effort a guitar that's the right "fit" will be a joy to play.So, take your time and make your decision carefully. With your favorite guitar in your hands and plenty of practice to get to know its ins and outs, you'll be well on your way to earning your own place in music history.
