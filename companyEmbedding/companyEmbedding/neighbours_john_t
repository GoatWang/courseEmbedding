John T. NeighboursPartner, Faegre Baker Daniels LLPBiographyJohn Neighbours is a partner at the law firm of Faegre Baker Daniels LLP in Indianapolis, having devoted much of his practice to representing employers in labor and employment law matters.  Mr. Neighbours has been active in the Labor and Employment Law Section of the American Bar Association and served for 11 years on the Section’s Council and as an officer of the Section.  He was the management-side editor of the Section’s publication, The Developing Labor Law, a principle treatise on traditional labor law issues.
Among his other professional activities, he is a fellow of the College of Labor and Employment Lawyers and the Indiana Bar Association, and a member of the United States Chamber’s Labor Relations Committee.  Mr. Neighbours has also been active in the Central Indiana community for nearly his entire professional career.  In the 1980s and 1990s, he was a Board member and Chair of the Indianapolis Zoological Society at the time the Zoo was built and opened in downtown Indianapolis.  He was also involved in the sports initiative as a member of the Board of the Indiana Sports Corporation, a mayoral appointment by both Mayors Hudnut and Goldsmith to the Greater Indianapolis Progress Committee, and a member of the Board of the Indianapolis Museum of Art and the Indianapolis Symphony. 
More recently, Mr. Neighbours has served on the Board, and as Chair of, the United Way of Central Indiana and the Greater Indianapolis Chamber of Commerce.  He was also the founding Board Chair of the Charles A. Tindley Accelerated School, and is President of the Board of the Meadows Community Foundation, which is committed to wholistic neighborhood redevelopment of the Meadows Community.  
He was asked by Mayor Ballard to serve on the Indianapolis Public Safety Foundation, an organization created to support public safety agencies and personnel in Central Indiana.  To date, the Meadows Community Foundation, working with the City and Strategic Capital Partners, has deployed more than $70 million to the Meadows neighborhood for mixed income housing, green space, and most recently, a health and wellness center for the YMCA and HealthNet. 
Mr. Neighbours’ recognitions have included being the recipient of the Charles L. Whistler Award, a Sagamore of the Wabash presented by Governor Mitch Daniels, and he has been listed for many years among The Best Lawyers of America and in Chambers USA: A Guide To America’s Leading Business Lawyers.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/27/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.  Royalty trusts may have special tax treatment, so you should consult a tax advisor on the potential tax consequences of investing in them.News, commentary and events are from third-party sources unaffiliated with Fidelity.
