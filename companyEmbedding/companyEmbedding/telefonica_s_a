NEC Cloud Solution - SaaS
Telefónica chose SaaS as a new business model to boost revenue without significant investment. Only NEC SaaS met Telefonica's requirements and already end-users are growing fast.


PortugueseSpanishJapaneseEnglishChinese

IntroductionTelefónica, the world's leading integrated international telecommunications company, is based in Spain and has approximately 300 million customers worldwide.The Telefónica group is already providing next-generation services but these days, although there is growing demand for telecommunications services, revenue growth in its current conventional core telephony services may have peaked.Telefónica therefore started looking for and trying to  create new value-added service business models to boost revenues and  profitability.Meanwhile,  NEC, the leading global enterprise specializing in the IT   and network  business fields, has for many years been providing a   variety of  solutions based on its concept of C&C - the integration   of computers  and communications.More recently, the company has also been  pioneering the development of  technologies relating to cloud computing  that it calls "C&C Cloud."ChallengesLike nearly all telecom operators, Telefónica has recently been facing growing pressures on its revenues and profits.Meanwhile, companies in the critical field of small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) were requesting new services to strengthen their business capabilities.  These customers were also wanting the new services to be made available quickly to enable them to respond their customers' needs promptly.Requiring little initial investment and few risks, Telefónica gradually settled on software as a service (SaaS) as the potentially optimum way to meet the needs of these customers quickly while keeping costs to the minimum."The most important issue was service usability," said Mr. Luis Aragoneses, Fix Product Marketing Manager in Telefónica's SME Segment.  "We wanted to provide services that satisfied our customers across the globe.  To do that, we have to offer services with high usability and flexibility with a diverse range of applications to meet customer needs."Solution

 "We carefully analyzed a large number of options and finally found the best solution which was NEC SaaS," explained Mr. Aragoneses.  There were several important reasons why Telefónica selected NEC as its partner and the most important was that, compared with its competitors, only NEC was able to offer an integrated IT and network solution.  "NEC is a quite unique company and is able to combine its long experience in the IT world with its experience in the networking and communication world," said Mr. Luis Miguel Domínguez, Strategic Project Director in NEC Iberica.  Another reason was NEC's ability to deliver its SaaS solution faster than anyone imagined.  "I was honestly amazed! I never thought the service infrastructure could be set up in only 45 days," commented Mr. Aragoneses.  NEC also had to meet the tough Telefónica requirements for usability, flexibility, scalability, and security.  Only NEC' s proposed SaaS solution was able to do this and one reason was the company' s long track record of reliable cooperation with telecommunication carriers and cutting edge technologies.  Two key technologies enabling NEC to successfully meet Telefónica' s demands regarding its SaaS solution were "Aggregation Skills" and "Multi-Tenancy."  "The aggregation skill (on our SaaS platform) includes not only technology but business processors to aggregate and bring applications to the platform," explained Mr. Dominguez.  "These make it possible to deploy new applications very quickly and even globally if required thereby enabling us to achieve benefits from the economies of scale that we are able to pass back to our clients," he said.  The solution delivered by NEC is a multi-tenancy SaaS platform which allows multiple end users to subscribe to and use a variety of application services on the same infrastructure.  Those end users can access all the applications they wish by using just one window.  "NEC's multi-tenancy platform has made it possible for Telefónica to provide this kind of IT service which is desired by a large number of end users," said Mr. Aragoneses.  "NEC has a very broad portfolio that covers IT platforms, applications and access devices and the company was able to combine all three into an innovative and creative business model," commented Mr. Dominguez.

ResultsThe benefits that the NEC SaaS solution is bringing to both Telefónica and its SME customers are way beyond initial expectations.Telefónica is excited by the fast take up of its SaaS.  "Since our service was launched, we've already gained over 10,000 users in this year and the number is significantly growing," enthused Mr. Aragoneses.From the end user's viewpoint too, the NEC SaaS solution also has several key merits.  End users have been eagerly utilizing a variety of applications such as CRM, billing, video-conferencing and GPS applications at low prices, and have enjoyed finding their requests for new applications being addressed quickly."This high level of usability will play an important role in expanding our services," said Mr. Aragoneses.The remote connections give us a clear advantage with respect to all our competitors," commented one end user.After observing the initial success of its SaaS business model, Telefónica plans to expand the services globally.  Moreover, this promising start to the SaaS partnership between Telefónica and NEC opens the way to more extensive collaborations in the cloud computing field.AboutTelefónica S.A. is the No.1 internationally integrated telecommunications company in terms of its customer base and is based in Madrid, Spain.  Telefonica has approximately 300 million customers and their core business is in Spain and in 15 Latin American countries.  It also operates in six other European countries.Related LinksMore about this case studyNEC's Cloud SolutionNEC Cloud Solution - SaaS (Software as a Service) Case Study: PLDT - A Multi-purpose Cloud SolutionMore case studiesMinistry of Education, Province of San Juan, ArgentinaCustomer profileTelefónica S.A.

Europe[edit]
Germany[edit]
Main article: Telefónica Germany
Telefónica was the parent of Telefónica Deutschland, which held two alternative IP carriers. The two ISPs, mediaWays and HighwayOne merged in January 2003 after having been purchased by Telefónica in 2001 and February 2002 respectively.
On 26 January 2006 Telefónica completed its £17.7 billion (€25.7 billion) acquisition of the UK-based operator O2 which also provided mobile phone services in Germany under the O2 brand.[11] Following the purchase, Telefónica merged Telefónica Deutschland and O2 Germany to form the current business Telefónica Germany.
Telefónica Germany, purchased competitor E-Plus on 1 October 2014. As part of the purchase, Telefónica reduced its stake in its subsidiary to 62.1%. Integration continues as of August 2015, but the now merged network is Germany's largest in customers.

Telefónica is the second largest corporation in Spain, behind the Santander Group.[12] It owns Telefónica de España which is the largest fixed phone and ADSL operator in Spain, Telefónica Móviles, the largest mobile phone operator in Spain (under the Movistar brand), and Terra Networks, S.A., an Internet subsidiary. Spain now has the most extensive fibre-to-home network in Europe, as of April 2016.[13]
United Kingdom[edit]
Main article: O2 (UK)
On 31 October 2005, O2 agreed to be taken over by Telefónica, with a cash offer of £17.7 billion, or £2 per share.[14] According to the merger announcement, O2, which provided mobile phone services in the UK, Ireland, Germany and the Isle of Man (uniquely to the O2 group Manx Telecom also offered fixed-line services), retained its name and continued to be based in the United Kingdom, keeping both the brand and the management team. The merger became unconditional on 23 January 2006 and O2 became a wholly owned subsidiary of Telefónica. Manx Telecom was sold by Telefónica Europe in June 2010.
In January 2015, Li Ka-shing entered into talks with Telefónica to buy O2 for around £10.25 billion, aiming to merge it with his subsidiary Three.[15] The acquisition was officially blocked by the European Commission on 11 May 2016, which argued that the merger would reduce consumer choice and lead to a higher cost of services [16] Telefónica began to seek a stock market flotation of the business instead.[17]
France[edit]
In France, since 2011, Telefónica has a joint venture with the French telecommunications company Bouygues Telecom, part of the Bouygues group, to offer global telecommunication services packages to multinational companies. This cooperation was expanded in June 2015 through the creation of a separate joint venture company named Telefónica Global Solutions France, with its own marketing and sales teams offering Telefónica and Bouygues Telecom services packages to corporations.

The landline division is currently part of Brasil Telecom. Telefónica is the parent of Telefônica Vivo.
In 2009, after four big "blackouts" on Telefónica's broadband "Speedy", ANATEL ordered Telefónica to stop sales of its broadband service until improvements were made on the infrastructure to provide better-quality service.[19] After the release of sales of broadband internet in August 2009, ANATEL expects the company's service investments to keep on par with the sales.

Monopoly[edit]





This section needs to be updated. Please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. (June 2016)


Europe[edit]
Telefónica has received several fines due to convictions over unfair competition, abuse of its position as dominant provider, and antitrust violations through the Commission of Telecommunications, European Commission, and Spanish tribunals. These fines include:
1. 900,000 euro fine, Spanish tribunals,[30]
2. 18 million euro fine, Spanish Telecommunication Market commission, 57 million in 2004 for unfair competition,[31] and,
3. 151.9 million euro by European Commission for abusing of its dominant position.[32][33]
As of 2008, Telefónica had in court two more fines, with a value of 793 million euros.[34]
On 5 July 2007, the European Commission ordered Telefónica to pay a record antitrust fine of almost €152 million for activities in the Spanish broadband market which, according to European Union competition commissioner Neelie Kroes, "harmed Spanish consumers, Spanish businesses and the Spanish economy as a whole, and by extension Europe's economy".
Several consumer groups in Spain have reported unnecessary delays in cancelling Telefónica's ADSL service. These consumer groups also claim that services continue to be billed after being cancelled and that service cancellation requests are ignored.[35] This has led Spanish people to organize themselves in consumer groups such as the "Asociación de Internautas" and user communities like "Bandaancha" in order to defend themselves from Telefónica's abuses, and to give support and help to each other in their various complaints about Telefónica's unfair practices.
The practices are claimed to include the complex process involved in cancelling lines.[36] These line cancellation procedures are justified by Telefónica as a way of "defending customers against hoaxes". Furthermore, in areas where ADSL lines are scarce, there are also reports of customers who claim to have had their service cancelled or inexplicably transferred to another customer although they have paid their bills.[37] This practice is considered by some to be used by Telefónica in certain areas of Spain where there are few broadband connections.
Positions on network neutrality[edit]
Main article: Network neutrality
In February 2010, Telefónica CEO Cesar Alierta expressed in a meeting at Bilbao, Spain that his company intends to charge Google and other search engines for the use of their network. Alierta[38] complained that such search engines were benefiting from the platform without contributing to the company's expenses and that such a trend will change in the near future. Additionally he said that Telefónica will seek to push its own content.[39]
Investments and collaborations[edit]
Telefónica is a supporter of the Hybrid Broadcast Broadband TV (HbbTV) initiative (a consortium of broadcasting and Internet industry companies including SES, OpenTV, and Institut für Rundfunktechnik) that is promoting and establishing an open European standard for hybrid set-top boxes for the reception of broadcast TV and broadband multimedia applications with a single user interface, and has run pilot HbbTV services in Spain.[40]
Telefónica's Wayra subsidiary first launched in Latin America and Spain in 2011 to provide seed investment and mentoring to new companies. Since its inception, Wayra has backed over 300 companies including Trustev, Venddo, Cloudwear[41] and NFWare.[42]
As of 1 December 2014, the Firefox web browser includes the Firefox Hello WebRTC feature,[43] that allows real-time voice and video online chats.[44] Firefox Hello is powered by[clarification needed] Telefónica[45] and was also co-developed by Telefónica.[46]

The company was created in Madrid in 1924 as Compañía Telefónica Nacional de España (CTNE) with ITT as one of its major shareholders.[7] Until the liberalisation of the telecom market in 1997,[8] Telefónica was the only telephone operator in Spain and still holds a dominant position (over 75% in 2000).[9] Since 1997, the Spanish government has privatized its interest in the company.

Europe[edit]
Germany[edit]
Main article: Telefónica Germany
Telefónica was the parent of Telefónica Deutschland, which held two alternative IP carriers. The two ISPs, mediaWays and HighwayOne merged in January 2003 after having been purchased by Telefónica in 2001 and February 2002 respectively.
On 26 January 2006 Telefónica completed its £17.7 billion (€25.7 billion) acquisition of the UK-based operator O2 which also provided mobile phone services in Germany under the O2 brand.[11] Following the purchase, Telefónica merged Telefónica Deutschland and O2 Germany to form the current business Telefónica Germany.
Telefónica Germany, purchased competitor E-Plus on 1 October 2014. As part of the purchase, Telefónica reduced its stake in its subsidiary to 62.1%. Integration continues as of August 2015, but the now merged network is Germany's largest in customers.
Spain[edit]

Telefónica is the second largest corporation in Spain, behind the Santander Group.[12] It owns Telefónica de España which is the largest fixed phone and ADSL operator in Spain, Telefónica Móviles, the largest mobile phone operator in Spain (under the Movistar brand), and Terra Networks, S.A., an Internet subsidiary. Spain now has the most extensive fibre-to-home network in Europe, as of April 2016.[13]
United Kingdom[edit]
Main article: O2 (UK)
On 31 October 2005, O2 agreed to be taken over by Telefónica, with a cash offer of £17.7 billion, or £2 per share.[14] According to the merger announcement, O2, which provided mobile phone services in the UK, Ireland, Germany and the Isle of Man (uniquely to the O2 group Manx Telecom also offered fixed-line services), retained its name and continued to be based in the United Kingdom, keeping both the brand and the management team. The merger became unconditional on 23 January 2006 and O2 became a wholly owned subsidiary of Telefónica. Manx Telecom was sold by Telefónica Europe in June 2010.
In January 2015, Li Ka-shing entered into talks with Telefónica to buy O2 for around £10.25 billion, aiming to merge it with his subsidiary Three.[15] The acquisition was officially blocked by the European Commission on 11 May 2016, which argued that the merger would reduce consumer choice and lead to a higher cost of services [16] Telefónica began to seek a stock market flotation of the business instead.[17]
France[edit]
In France, since 2011, Telefónica has a joint venture with the French telecommunications company Bouygues Telecom, part of the Bouygues group, to offer global telecommunication services packages to multinational companies. This cooperation was expanded in June 2015 through the creation of a separate joint venture company named Telefónica Global Solutions France, with its own marketing and sales teams offering Telefónica and Bouygues Telecom services packages to corporations.
Americas[edit]
Telefónica operates the Movistar mobile phone brand throughout Latin America. In Mexico it occupies a distant second place and it is the largest in Chile, Venezuela, Brazil, and Peru.
Argentina[edit]
Telefónica owns Telefónica de Argentina which is the largest fixed-line operator in the country. It provides broadband, local and long distance telephone services in southern part of the country as well as the Greater Buenos Aires area. The Telefónica Group has been in the country since 1990. The mobile business is run by Telefónica Móviles through Movistar, a local subsidiary.
Brazil[edit]
Telefónica's largest fixed-line operation in South America is in Brazil, where it provides broadband, local and long distance telephone services in the aforementioned state, which alone represents the highest GDP of South America. It also owns a majority stake in the Brazilian mobile operator Vivo, having agreed on 28 July 2010 to buy Portugal Telecom's stake in the firm for €7.5 billion, after increasing its original offer by €1.8 billion over three months of incident-rich negotiations.[18] The Telefónica group has been in the country since 1996 when it acquired CRT, a fixed-line and mobile operator in the southern part of the country. The landline division is currently part of Brasil Telecom. Telefónica is the parent of Telefônica Vivo.
In 2009, after four big "blackouts" on Telefónica's broadband "Speedy", ANATEL ordered Telefónica to stop sales of its broadband service until improvements were made on the infrastructure to provide better-quality service.[19] After the release of sales of broadband internet in August 2009, ANATEL expects the company's service investments to keep on par with the sales. On 24 July 2010 Telefónica announced that the number of Speedy subscribers had exceeded three million people.
Chile[edit]
Telefónica owns Telefónica Chile, formerly CTC (Compañía de Telecomunicaciones de Chile, formerly known as Compañía de Teléfonos de Chile) which is the biggest fixed-line operator and internet service provider in the country. The Telefónica Group has been in the country since 1989. The mobile business is run by Telefónica Móviles through a local subsidiary. On 25 October 2009, Telefónica Chile changed its name to Movistar, including cellphone, landline, satellite TV, and internet.[20]
Colombia[edit]
On 18 April 2006, Telefónica's president Cesar Alierta signed an agreement with the Colombian government to buy 50% and one share of the state-owned communications company, Colombia Telecomunicaciones (TELECOM).[21] With this sale, Telefónica became the largest Colombian land-line operator, and also gained an important presence in the local, long-distance and broadband market. The mobile business is run by Telefónica Móviles through the brand movistar. It is unknown what will happen with their previous established subsidiary Telefónica Empresas, being most probable a merger with TELECOM. The company is now known as Telefónica - Telecom.

In 2011, the company was renamed Telefónica Czech Republic and in 2013, it was announced that Telefónica would sell its stake in the company to PPF. Under the terms of the sale, the company will continue trading under the O2 brand for a maximum of four years.[26]

Main article: Telefónica Slovakia
During 2006, Telefónica won the tender to become the third mobile phone operator in Slovakia, under the O2 brand. It began providing services on 2 February 2007 under the name Telefónica O2 Slovakia, s.r.o. It initially launched providing only a prepaid service but in mid-2007 began to sell contract phones. The company was sold along with Telefónica Czech Republic to PPF.[26]
Ireland[edit]
Main article: O2 (Ireland)
O2 in Ireland was purchased by Telefónica as part of its acquisition of O2 plc in the UK in 2005. Telefónica Ireland has become the second largest mobile phone operator in Ireland, operating a GSM/EDGE and high-speed HSPA+ wireless broadband network to residential and business customers through its "O2" brand. Telefónica Ireland also provide fixed broadband to business customers.
It was announced on 24 June 2013 that Telefónica had agreed to sell its O2 Ireland mobile business for at least €780 million ($1 billion) in cash to Hutchison Whampoa's subsidiary 3.[27] O2 was merged into Hutchison Whampoa's subsidiary Three Ireland in March 2015
Italy[edit]
Main article: Telecom Italia
Telefónica currently owns 46% of Telco, the holding company that controls 22% of Telecom Italia, Italy's former government–owned telephone company. In late 2003, Telefónica announced its intention to acquire the entirety of Telco by January 2014, potentially becoming Telecom Italia's largest shareholder. The plan, was however challenged by the Brazilian competition authority since Telefónica and Telecom Italia, with Vivo and TIM respectively, are the two largest telephone companies competing in Brazil. Subsequently, Telefónica confirmed in September 2014 that it intended to sell its shares in Telecom Italia following the purchase of Global Village Telecom (GVT) in Brazil from Vivendi.[28] Telefónica sold its shares in the business to Vivendi as part of the sale of GVT in June 2015.[29]

From 2011, they are to sponsor the Spanish UCI ProTour cycling team known as Movistar Team.

Motor sports

Teléfonica through Movistar, is the major sponsor of Yamaha Motor Racing, a motorcycle racing team in MotoGP, and was also a major sponsor of one of Suzuki's and Honda's racing teams in MotoGP in the early 2000s.
Within Formula One, Telefónica was a major sponsor of the Renault F1 Team until Fernando Alonso's departure to McLaren in 2007, and were title sponsors of the Spanish Grand Prix from 2006 to 2010.

Monopoly[edit]





This section needs to be updated. Please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. (June 2016)


Europe[edit]
Telefónica has received several fines due to convictions over unfair competition, abuse of its position as dominant provider, and antitrust violations through the Commission of Telecommunications, European Commission, and Spanish tribunals. These fines include:
1. 900,000 euro fine, Spanish tribunals,[30]
2. 18 million euro fine, Spanish Telecommunication Market commission, 57 million in 2004 for unfair competition,[31] and,
3. 151.9 million euro by European Commission for abusing of its dominant position.[32][33]
As of 2008, Telefónica had in court two more fines, with a value of 793 million euros.[34]
On 5 July 2007, the European Commission ordered Telefónica to pay a record antitrust fine of almost €152 million for activities in the Spanish broadband market which, according to European Union competition commissioner Neelie Kroes, "harmed Spanish consumers, Spanish businesses and the Spanish economy as a whole, and by extension Europe's economy".
Several consumer groups in Spain have reported unnecessary delays in cancelling Telefónica's ADSL service. These consumer groups also claim that services continue to be billed after being cancelled and that service cancellation requests are ignored.[35] This has led Spanish people to organize themselves in consumer groups such as the "Asociación de Internautas" and user communities like "Bandaancha" in order to defend themselves from Telefónica's abuses, and to give support and help to each other in their various complaints about Telefónica's unfair practices.
The practices are claimed to include the complex process involved in cancelling lines.[36] These line cancellation procedures are justified by Telefónica as a way of "defending customers against hoaxes". Furthermore, in areas where ADSL lines are scarce, there are also reports of customers who claim to have had their service cancelled or inexplicably transferred to another customer although they have paid their bills.[37] This practice is considered by some to be used by Telefónica in certain areas of Spain where there are few broadband connections.
Positions on network neutrality[edit]
Main article: Network neutrality
In February 2010, Telefónica CEO Cesar Alierta expressed in a meeting at Bilbao, Spain that his company intends to charge Google and other search engines for the use of their network. Alierta[38] complained that such search engines were benefiting from the platform without contributing to the company's expenses and that such a trend will change in the near future. Additionally he said that Telefónica will seek to push its own content.[39]
Investments and collaborations[edit]
Telefónica is a supporter of the Hybrid Broadcast Broadband TV (HbbTV) initiative (a consortium of broadcasting and Internet industry companies including SES, OpenTV, and Institut für Rundfunktechnik) that is promoting and establishing an open European standard for hybrid set-top boxes for the reception of broadcast TV and broadband multimedia applications with a single user interface, and has run pilot HbbTV services in Spain.[40]
Telefónica's Wayra subsidiary first launched in Latin America and Spain in 2011 to provide seed investment and mentoring to new companies. Since its inception, Wayra has backed over 300 companies including Trustev, Venddo, Cloudwear[41] and NFWare.[42]
As of 1 December 2014, the Firefox web browser includes the Firefox Hello WebRTC feature,[43] that allows real-time voice and video online chats.[44] Firefox Hello is powered by[clarification needed] Telefónica[45] and was also co-developed by Telefónica.[46]
Telefónica Dynamic services offers mobile-money using Sybase 365 Mobile wallet systems, with a service-centre based in Tel-Aviv.
Incidents[edit]
On 12th May 2017, Telefónica computer's network was attacked by a malware known as WannaCry ransomware attack and it was critical.

Monopoly[edit]





This section needs to be updated. Please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. (June 2016)


Europe[edit]
Telefónica has received several fines due to convictions over unfair competition, abuse of its position as dominant provider, and antitrust violations through the Commission of Telecommunications, European Commission, and Spanish tribunals. These fines include:
1. 900,000 euro fine, Spanish tribunals,[30]
2. 18 million euro fine, Spanish Telecommunication Market commission, 57 million in 2004 for unfair competition,[31] and,
3. 151.9 million euro by European Commission for abusing of its dominant position.[32][33]
As of 2008, Telefónica had in court two more fines, with a value of 793 million euros.[34]
On 5 July 2007, the European Commission ordered Telefónica to pay a record antitrust fine of almost €152 million for activities in the Spanish broadband market which, according to European Union competition commissioner Neelie Kroes, "harmed Spanish consumers, Spanish businesses and the Spanish economy as a whole, and by extension Europe's economy".
Several consumer groups in Spain have reported unnecessary delays in cancelling Telefónica's ADSL service. These consumer groups also claim that services continue to be billed after being cancelled and that service cancellation requests are ignored.[35] This has led Spanish people to organize themselves in consumer groups such as the "Asociación de Internautas" and user communities like "Bandaancha" in order to defend themselves from Telefónica's abuses, and to give support and help to each other in their various complaints about Telefónica's unfair practices.
The practices are claimed to include the complex process involved in cancelling lines.[36] These line cancellation procedures are justified by Telefónica as a way of "defending customers against hoaxes". Furthermore, in areas where ADSL lines are scarce, there are also reports of customers who claim to have had their service cancelled or inexplicably transferred to another customer although they have paid their bills.[37] This practice is considered by some to be used by Telefónica in certain areas of Spain where there are few broadband connections.
Positions on network neutrality[edit]
Main article: Network neutrality
In February 2010, Telefónica CEO Cesar Alierta expressed in a meeting at Bilbao, Spain that his company intends to charge Google and other search engines for the use of their network. Alierta[38] complained that such search engines were benefiting from the platform without contributing to the company's expenses and that such a trend will change in the near future. Additionally he said that Telefónica will seek to push its own content.[39]
Investments and collaborations[edit]

Telefónica's Wayra subsidiary first launched in Latin America and Spain in 2011 to provide seed investment and mentoring to new companies. Since its inception, Wayra has backed over 300 companies including Trustev, Venddo, Cloudwear[41] and NFWare.[42]

Europe[edit]
Germany[edit]
Main article: Telefónica Germany
Telefónica was the parent of Telefónica Deutschland, which held two alternative IP carriers. The two ISPs, mediaWays and HighwayOne merged in January 2003 after having been purchased by Telefónica in 2001 and February 2002 respectively.
On 26 January 2006 Telefónica completed its £17.7 billion (€25.7 billion) acquisition of the UK-based operator O2 which also provided mobile phone services in Germany under the O2 brand.[11] Following the purchase, Telefónica merged Telefónica Deutschland and O2 Germany to form the current business Telefónica Germany.
Telefónica Germany, purchased competitor E-Plus on 1 October 2014. As part of the purchase, Telefónica reduced its stake in its subsidiary to 62.1%. Integration continues as of August 2015, but the now merged network is Germany's largest in customers.
Spain[edit]

Telefónica is the second largest corporation in Spain, behind the Santander Group.[12] It owns Telefónica de España which is the largest fixed phone and ADSL operator in Spain, Telefónica Móviles, the largest mobile phone operator in Spain (under the Movistar brand), and Terra Networks, S.A., an Internet subsidiary. Spain now has the most extensive fibre-to-home network in Europe, as of April 2016.[13]
United Kingdom[edit]
Main article: O2 (UK)
On 31 October 2005, O2 agreed to be taken over by Telefónica, with a cash offer of £17.7 billion, or £2 per share.[14] According to the merger announcement, O2, which provided mobile phone services in the UK, Ireland, Germany and the Isle of Man (uniquely to the O2 group Manx Telecom also offered fixed-line services), retained its name and continued to be based in the United Kingdom, keeping both the brand and the management team. The merger became unconditional on 23 January 2006 and O2 became a wholly owned subsidiary of Telefónica. Manx Telecom was sold by Telefónica Europe in June 2010.
In January 2015, Li Ka-shing entered into talks with Telefónica to buy O2 for around £10.25 billion, aiming to merge it with his subsidiary Three.[15] The acquisition was officially blocked by the European Commission on 11 May 2016, which argued that the merger would reduce consumer choice and lead to a higher cost of services [16] Telefónica began to seek a stock market flotation of the business instead.[17]
France[edit]
In France, since 2011, Telefónica has a joint venture with the French telecommunications company Bouygues Telecom, part of the Bouygues group, to offer global telecommunication services packages to multinational companies. This cooperation was expanded in June 2015 through the creation of a separate joint venture company named Telefónica Global Solutions France, with its own marketing and sales teams offering Telefónica and Bouygues Telecom services packages to corporations.

The landline division is currently part of Brasil Telecom. Telefónica is the parent of Telefônica Vivo.
In 2009, after four big "blackouts" on Telefónica's broadband "Speedy", ANATEL ordered Telefónica to stop sales of its broadband service until improvements were made on the infrastructure to provide better-quality service.[19] After the release of sales of broadband internet in August 2009, ANATEL expects the company's service investments to keep on par with the sales.

Monopoly[edit]





This section needs to be updated. Please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. (June 2016)


Europe[edit]
Telefónica has received several fines due to convictions over unfair competition, abuse of its position as dominant provider, and antitrust violations through the Commission of Telecommunications, European Commission, and Spanish tribunals. These fines include:
1. 900,000 euro fine, Spanish tribunals,[30]
2. 18 million euro fine, Spanish Telecommunication Market commission, 57 million in 2004 for unfair competition,[31] and,
3. 151.9 million euro by European Commission for abusing of its dominant position.[32][33]
As of 2008, Telefónica had in court two more fines, with a value of 793 million euros.[34]
On 5 July 2007, the European Commission ordered Telefónica to pay a record antitrust fine of almost €152 million for activities in the Spanish broadband market which, according to European Union competition commissioner Neelie Kroes, "harmed Spanish consumers, Spanish businesses and the Spanish economy as a whole, and by extension Europe's economy".
Several consumer groups in Spain have reported unnecessary delays in cancelling Telefónica's ADSL service. These consumer groups also claim that services continue to be billed after being cancelled and that service cancellation requests are ignored.[35] This has led Spanish people to organize themselves in consumer groups such as the "Asociación de Internautas" and user communities like "Bandaancha" in order to defend themselves from Telefónica's abuses, and to give support and help to each other in their various complaints about Telefónica's unfair practices.
The practices are claimed to include the complex process involved in cancelling lines.[36] These line cancellation procedures are justified by Telefónica as a way of "defending customers against hoaxes". Furthermore, in areas where ADSL lines are scarce, there are also reports of customers who claim to have had their service cancelled or inexplicably transferred to another customer although they have paid their bills.[37] This practice is considered by some to be used by Telefónica in certain areas of Spain where there are few broadband connections.
Positions on network neutrality[edit]
Main article: Network neutrality
In February 2010, Telefónica CEO Cesar Alierta expressed in a meeting at Bilbao, Spain that his company intends to charge Google and other search engines for the use of their network. Alierta[38] complained that such search engines were benefiting from the platform without contributing to the company's expenses and that such a trend will change in the near future.

History[edit]




Logo from 1984 to 1993


The company was created in Madrid in 1924 as Compañía Telefónica Nacional de España (CTNE) with ITT as one of its major shareholders.[7] Until the liberalisation of the telecom market in 1997,[8] Telefónica was the only telephone operator in Spain and still holds a dominant position (over 75% in 2000).[9] Since 1997, the Spanish government has privatized its interest in the company.

Europe[edit]
Germany[edit]
Main article: Telefónica Germany
Telefónica was the parent of Telefónica Deutschland, which held two alternative IP carriers. The two ISPs, mediaWays and HighwayOne merged in January 2003 after having been purchased by Telefónica in 2001 and February 2002 respectively.
On 26 January 2006 Telefónica completed its £17.7 billion (€25.7 billion) acquisition of the UK-based operator O2 which also provided mobile phone services in Germany under the O2 brand.[11] Following the purchase, Telefónica merged Telefónica Deutschland and O2 Germany to form the current business Telefónica Germany.
Telefónica Germany, purchased competitor E-Plus on 1 October 2014. As part of the purchase, Telefónica reduced its stake in its subsidiary to 62.1%. Integration continues as of August 2015, but the now merged network is Germany's largest in customers.
Spain[edit]

Telefónica is the second largest corporation in Spain, behind the Santander Group.[12] It owns Telefónica de España which is the largest fixed phone and ADSL operator in Spain, Telefónica Móviles, the largest mobile phone operator in Spain (under the Movistar brand), and Terra Networks, S.A., an Internet subsidiary. Spain now has the most extensive fibre-to-home network in Europe, as of April 2016.[13]
United Kingdom[edit]
Main article: O2 (UK)
On 31 October 2005, O2 agreed to be taken over by Telefónica, with a cash offer of £17.7 billion, or £2 per share.[14] According to the merger announcement, O2, which provided mobile phone services in the UK, Ireland, Germany and the Isle of Man (uniquely to the O2 group Manx Telecom also offered fixed-line services), retained its name and continued to be based in the United Kingdom, keeping both the brand and the management team. The merger became unconditional on 23 January 2006 and O2 became a wholly owned subsidiary of Telefónica. Manx Telecom was sold by Telefónica Europe in June 2010.
In January 2015, Li Ka-shing entered into talks with Telefónica to buy O2 for around £10.25 billion, aiming to merge it with his subsidiary Three.[15] The acquisition was officially blocked by the European Commission on 11 May 2016, which argued that the merger would reduce consumer choice and lead to a higher cost of services [16] Telefónica began to seek a stock market flotation of the business instead.[17]
France[edit]
In France, since 2011, Telefónica has a joint venture with the French telecommunications company Bouygues Telecom, part of the Bouygues group, to offer global telecommunication services packages to multinational companies. This cooperation was expanded in June 2015 through the creation of a separate joint venture company named Telefónica Global Solutions France, with its own marketing and sales teams offering Telefónica and Bouygues Telecom services packages to corporations.
Americas[edit]
Telefónica operates the Movistar mobile phone brand throughout Latin America. In Mexico it occupies a distant second place and it is the largest in Chile, Venezuela, Brazil, and Peru.
Argentina[edit]
Telefónica owns Telefónica de Argentina which is the largest fixed-line operator in the country. It provides broadband, local and long distance telephone services in southern part of the country as well as the Greater Buenos Aires area. The Telefónica Group has been in the country since 1990. The mobile business is run by Telefónica Móviles through Movistar, a local subsidiary.
Brazil[edit]
Telefónica's largest fixed-line operation in South America is in Brazil, where it provides broadband, local and long distance telephone services in the aforementioned state, which alone represents the highest GDP of South America. It also owns a majority stake in the Brazilian mobile operator Vivo, having agreed on 28 July 2010 to buy Portugal Telecom's stake in the firm for €7.5 billion, after increasing its original offer by €1.8 billion over three months of incident-rich negotiations.[18] The Telefónica group has been in the country since 1996 when it acquired CRT, a fixed-line and mobile operator in the southern part of the country. The landline division is currently part of Brasil Telecom. Telefónica is the parent of Telefônica Vivo.
In 2009, after four big "blackouts" on Telefónica's broadband "Speedy", ANATEL ordered Telefónica to stop sales of its broadband service until improvements were made on the infrastructure to provide better-quality service.[19] After the release of sales of broadband internet in August 2009, ANATEL expects the company's service investments to keep on par with the sales. On 24 July 2010 Telefónica announced that the number of Speedy subscribers had exceeded three million people.
Chile[edit]
Telefónica owns Telefónica Chile, formerly CTC (Compañía de Telecomunicaciones de Chile, formerly known as Compañía de Teléfonos de Chile) which is the biggest fixed-line operator and internet service provider in the country. The Telefónica Group has been in the country since 1989. The mobile business is run by Telefónica Móviles through a local subsidiary. On 25 October 2009, Telefónica Chile changed its name to Movistar, including cellphone, landline, satellite TV, and internet.[20]
Colombia[edit]
On 18 April 2006, Telefónica's president Cesar Alierta signed an agreement with the Colombian government to buy 50% and one share of the state-owned communications company, Colombia Telecomunicaciones (TELECOM).[21] With this sale, Telefónica became the largest Colombian land-line operator, and also gained an important presence in the local, long-distance and broadband market. The mobile business is run by Telefónica Móviles through the brand movistar. It is unknown what will happen with their previous established subsidiary Telefónica Empresas, being most probable a merger with TELECOM. The company is now known as Telefónica - Telecom.

In 2005, Telefónica bought Český Telecom (Czech Telecom), the former state-owned Czech phone operator which still dominates the Czech fixed-line market. As part of this deal Telefónica also gained its 100% subsidiary Eurotel, one of three mobile phone operators in the Czech Republic. Starting 1 July 2006, both companies were merged into one legal entity and renamed Telefónica O2 Czech Republic. In 2011, the company was renamed Telefónica Czech Republic and in 2013, it was announced that Telefónica would sell its stake in the company to PPF. Under the terms of the sale, the company will continue trading under the O2 brand for a maximum of four years.[26]
Slovakia[edit]
Main article: Telefónica Slovakia
During 2006, Telefónica won the tender to become the third mobile phone operator in Slovakia, under the O2 brand. It began providing services on 2 February 2007 under the name Telefónica O2 Slovakia, s.r.o. It initially launched providing only a prepaid service but in mid-2007 began to sell contract phones. The company was sold along with Telefónica Czech Republic to PPF.[26]
Ireland[edit]
Main article: O2 (Ireland)
O2 in Ireland was purchased by Telefónica as part of its acquisition of O2 plc in the UK in 2005. Telefónica Ireland has become the second largest mobile phone operator in Ireland, operating a GSM/EDGE and high-speed HSPA+ wireless broadband network to residential and business customers through its "O2" brand.

Italy[edit]
Main article: Telecom Italia
Telefónica currently owns 46% of Telco, the holding company that controls 22% of Telecom Italia, Italy's former government–owned telephone company. In late 2003, Telefónica announced its intention to acquire the entirety of Telco by January 2014, potentially becoming Telecom Italia's largest shareholder. The plan, was however challenged by the Brazilian competition authority since Telefónica and Telecom Italia, with Vivo and TIM respectively, are the two largest telephone companies competing in Brazil. Subsequently, Telefónica confirmed in September 2014 that it intended to sell its shares in Telecom Italia following the purchase of Global Village Telecom (GVT) in Brazil from Vivendi.[28] Telefónica sold its shares in the business to Vivendi as part of the sale of GVT in June 2015.[29]

Monopoly[edit]





This section needs to be updated. Please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. (June 2016)


Europe[edit]
Telefónica has received several fines due to convictions over unfair competition, abuse of its position as dominant provider, and antitrust violations through the Commission of Telecommunications, European Commission, and Spanish tribunals. These fines include:
1. 900,000 euro fine, Spanish tribunals,[30]
2. 18 million euro fine, Spanish Telecommunication Market commission, 57 million in 2004 for unfair competition,[31] and,
3. 151.9 million euro by European Commission for abusing of its dominant position.[32][33]
As of 2008, Telefónica had in court two more fines, with a value of 793 million euros.[34]
On 5 July 2007, the European Commission ordered Telefónica to pay a record antitrust fine of almost €152 million for activities in the Spanish broadband market which, according to European Union competition commissioner Neelie Kroes, "harmed Spanish consumers, Spanish businesses and the Spanish economy as a whole, and by extension Europe's economy".
Several consumer groups in Spain have reported unnecessary delays in cancelling Telefónica's ADSL service. These consumer groups also claim that services continue to be billed after being cancelled and that service cancellation requests are ignored.[35] This has led Spanish people to organize themselves in consumer groups such as the "Asociación de Internautas" and user communities like "Bandaancha" in order to defend themselves from Telefónica's abuses, and to give support and help to each other in their various complaints about Telefónica's unfair practices.
The practices are claimed to include the complex process involved in cancelling lines.[36] These line cancellation procedures are justified by Telefónica as a way of "defending customers against hoaxes". Furthermore, in areas where ADSL lines are scarce, there are also reports of customers who claim to have had their service cancelled or inexplicably transferred to another customer although they have paid their bills.[37] This practice is considered by some to be used by Telefónica in certain areas of Spain where there are few broadband connections.
Positions on network neutrality[edit]
Main article: Network neutrality
In February 2010, Telefónica CEO Cesar Alierta expressed in a meeting at Bilbao, Spain that his company intends to charge Google and other search engines for the use of their network. Alierta[38] complained that such search engines were benefiting from the platform without contributing to the company's expenses and that such a trend will change in the near future. Additionally he said that Telefónica will seek to push its own content.[39]
Investments and collaborations[edit]
Telefónica is a supporter of the Hybrid Broadcast Broadband TV (HbbTV) initiative (a consortium of broadcasting and Internet industry companies including SES, OpenTV, and Institut für Rundfunktechnik) that is promoting and establishing an open European standard for hybrid set-top boxes for the reception of broadcast TV and broadband multimedia applications with a single user interface, and has run pilot HbbTV services in Spain.[40]
Telefónica's Wayra subsidiary first launched in Latin America and Spain in 2011 to provide seed investment and mentoring to new companies. Since its inception, Wayra has backed over 300 companies including Trustev, Venddo, Cloudwear[41] and NFWare.[42]
As of 1 December 2014, the Firefox web browser includes the Firefox Hello WebRTC feature,[43] that allows real-time voice and video online chats.[44] Firefox Hello is powered by[clarification needed] Telefónica[45] and was also co-developed by Telefónica.[46]
Telefónica Dynamic services offers mobile-money using Sybase 365 Mobile wallet systems, with a service-centre based in Tel-Aviv.
Incidents[edit]
On 12th May 2017, Telefónica computer's network was attacked by a malware known as WannaCry ransomware attack and it was critical.

Telefónica was the parent of Telefónica Deutschland, which held two alternative IP carriers. The two ISPs, mediaWays and HighwayOne merged in January 2003 after having been purchased by Telefónica in 2001 and February 2002 respectively.
On 26 January 2006 Telefónica completed its £17.7 billion (€25.7 billion) acquisition of the UK-based operator O2 which also provided mobile phone services in Germany under the O2 brand.[11] Following the purchase, Telefónica merged Telefónica Deutschland and O2 Germany to form the current business Telefónica Germany.
Telefónica Germany, purchased competitor E-Plus on 1 October 2014. As part of the purchase, Telefónica reduced its stake in its subsidiary to 62.1%. Integration continues as of August 2015, but the now merged network is Germany's largest in customers.

Spain now has the most extensive fibre-to-home network in Europe, as of April 2016.[13]
United Kingdom[edit]
Main article: O2 (UK)
On 31 October 2005, O2 agreed to be taken over by Telefónica, with a cash offer of £17.7 billion, or £2 per share.[14] According to the merger announcement, O2, which provided mobile phone services in the UK, Ireland, Germany and the Isle of Man (uniquely to the O2 group Manx Telecom also offered fixed-line services), retained its name and continued to be based in the United Kingdom, keeping both the brand and the management team. The merger became unconditional on 23 January 2006 and O2 became a wholly owned subsidiary of Telefónica. Manx Telecom was sold by Telefónica Europe in June 2010.
In January 2015, Li Ka-shing entered into talks with Telefónica to buy O2 for around £10.25 billion, aiming to merge it with his subsidiary Three.[15] The acquisition was officially blocked by the European Commission on 11 May 2016, which argued that the merger would reduce consumer choice and lead to a higher cost of services [16] Telefónica began to seek a stock market flotation of the business instead.[17]
France[edit]
In France, since 2011, Telefónica has a joint venture with the French telecommunications company Bouygues Telecom, part of the Bouygues group, to offer global telecommunication services packages to multinational companies.

The landline division is currently part of Brasil Telecom. Telefónica is the parent of Telefônica Vivo.
In 2009, after four big "blackouts" on Telefónica's broadband "Speedy", ANATEL ordered Telefónica to stop sales of its broadband service until improvements were made on the infrastructure to provide better-quality service.[19] After the release of sales of broadband internet in August 2009, ANATEL expects the company's service investments to keep on par with the sales.

Monopoly[edit]





This section needs to be updated. Please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. (June 2016)


Europe[edit]
Telefónica has received several fines due to convictions over unfair competition, abuse of its position as dominant provider, and antitrust violations through the Commission of Telecommunications, European Commission, and Spanish tribunals. These fines include:
1. 900,000 euro fine, Spanish tribunals,[30]
2. 18 million euro fine, Spanish Telecommunication Market commission, 57 million in 2004 for unfair competition,[31] and,
3. 151.9 million euro by European Commission for abusing of its dominant position.[32][33]
As of 2008, Telefónica had in court two more fines, with a value of 793 million euros.[34]
On 5 July 2007, the European Commission ordered Telefónica to pay a record antitrust fine of almost €152 million for activities in the Spanish broadband market which, according to European Union competition commissioner Neelie Kroes, "harmed Spanish consumers, Spanish businesses and the Spanish economy as a whole, and by extension Europe's economy".
Several consumer groups in Spain have reported unnecessary delays in cancelling Telefónica's ADSL service. These consumer groups also claim that services continue to be billed after being cancelled and that service cancellation requests are ignored.[35] This has led Spanish people to organize themselves in consumer groups such as the "Asociación de Internautas" and user communities like "Bandaancha" in order to defend themselves from Telefónica's abuses, and to give support and help to each other in their various complaints about Telefónica's unfair practices.
The practices are claimed to include the complex process involved in cancelling lines.[36] These line cancellation procedures are justified by Telefónica as a way of "defending customers against hoaxes". Furthermore, in areas where ADSL lines are scarce, there are also reports of customers who claim to have had their service cancelled or inexplicably transferred to another customer although they have paid their bills.[37] This practice is considered by some to be used by Telefónica in certain areas of Spain where there are few broadband connections.
Positions on network neutrality[edit]
Main article: Network neutrality
In February 2010, Telefónica CEO Cesar Alierta expressed in a meeting at Bilbao, Spain that his company intends to charge Google and other search engines for the use of their network. Alierta[38] complained that such search engines were benefiting from the platform without contributing to the company's expenses and that such a trend will change in the near future. Additionally he said that Telefónica will seek to push its own content.[39]
Investments and collaborations[edit]
Telefónica is a supporter of the Hybrid Broadcast Broadband TV (HbbTV) initiative (a consortium of broadcasting and Internet industry companies including SES, OpenTV, and Institut für Rundfunktechnik) that is promoting and establishing an open European standard for hybrid set-top boxes for the reception of broadcast TV and broadband multimedia applications with a single user interface, and has run pilot HbbTV services in Spain.[40]
Telefónica's Wayra subsidiary first launched in Latin America and Spain in 2011 to provide seed investment and mentoring to new companies. Since its inception, Wayra has backed over 300 companies including Trustev, Venddo, Cloudwear[41] and NFWare.[42]

        Product development_


Telefónica I+D is the biggest product-making factory of Telefónica. Its engineers and user experience designers are responsible of the development of many of the more strategic products that Telefónica offers to its clients around the world. They leverage on the technical expertise obtained in research projects through the history of Telefónica I+D.






              The power of differential technology
            





Engineers and user experience designers work in multidisciplinary teams together with business people from central organisations and local business units. The level of activity on each project depends on the specific nature of the product that is created. As a general rule, the involvement is higher when requires a deeper technical expertise or a when the user experience is a key factor for success.
The vast majority of products where Telefónica I+D participates were originally developed as innovation prototypes in the research projects of the company. As they become mature enough, the products are integrated in the commercial and operational channels of Telefónica. At this later stage, Telefónica I+D continues being responsible of the development of the products. There is a continuous process of evaluation for the appropriateness of internal evolution, being the achievement of technical differentiation the main criteria for the involvement of Telefónica I+D in the project.
Additionally, Telefónica I+D guarantees the technical excellence of the products developed internally. With this purpose it maintains a structure for technical coordination of the engineers and user experience designers that works across Telefónica.
Currently, Telefónica I+D is developing commercial products in the following areas:

The application of cognitive capabilities to its platforms will allow Telefónica’s customers to know, manage, and control their digital lives with the company, and discover new customer propositions.


Facebook, Microsoft, and UNICEF participated in the presentation together with Telefónica’s Chairman and CEO, José María Álvarez-Pallete and Chema Alonso, the company’s Chief Data Officer who has shown also an example of implementation with ProFuturo.

Mobile World Congress (MWC), Barcelona, February 26, 2017.- Telefónica presented today its fourth platform that, thanks to the application of cognitive capabilities, will be the basis for a new relationship model with customers. AURA will enable users to manage their digital experiences with the company and control the data generated by using Telefónica’s products and services in a transparent and secure manner. Telefónica becomes the first company in the industry to provide its customers the possibility of managing their relationship with the company based on cognitive intelligence.
The process of transformation began several years ago with the complex task of simplification and end-to-end digitalization of the company in order to make the three platforms it already had intelligent.  Since 2012, Telefónica has invested approximately 48 billion Euro in this process both in the deployment of networks and other state of the art infrastructure, and in the integration of all its IT systems or the development of new digital products and services.
These platforms are building blocks that enabled Telefónica to develop a fourth, cognitive platform.  AURA redefines the interaction between Telefónica and its customers in a safe and simple environment, with transparency and control over personal information. AURA will facilitate the discovery of new value-added propositions based on the insights of their data and will be available through multiple channels and devices.
The fourth platform will make cognitive sense of this flow of data. Until now, this data was generated in an uninterrupted, although fragmented, manner by the networks and other physical assets of the company (1st platform, Telefónica’s core asset), its unified IT systems (2nd platform), as well as the products and services it offers to its users (3rd platform). These smart platforms will imply a major qualitative leap in the customers’ experience with the company.
“Cognitive intelligence will allow us to understand our customers better, so they can then relate to us in a more natural and easy way, and generate a new relationship of trust with them based on transparency and the control of their data”, said Telefónica Chairman and CEO, José María Álvarez-Pallete during the presentation event. “We are pioneers in this relationship model. Never before have the users of telecommunications services been able to talk with the networks in real time. We’re expanding the relationship with our customers, seeking to increase their satisfaction, and opening new possibilities for them so that they can enrich their digital lives with us”.
 
Creating value through knowledge
Chema Alonso, Chief Data Officer of Telefónica, resorted to the latest technologies for the presentation of AURA. Using HoloLens, Microsoft’s augmented reality glasses, he described the path that data follows through the first three platforms, up to its transformation into something unique for each customer. As proof that AURA is not just a project but a nascent reality, Telefónica made several demonstrations through different channels, such as a mobile app and the integration of AURA with Amazon Echo.
For example, customers will be able to ask questions about the products and services they use; create and track a claim; manage and unblock device access to the Wi-Fi router provided by Telefónica; get information about their favourite shows and program their recording; or be alerted when their data consumption is greater than usual. Each user will have a “personal data space”, the memory which will store the digital trace they leave when using Telefónica products and services, and which will allow the customers, if they so desire, to personalize their experience. AURA will also be able to make recommendations about offers of products and services that best adapt to the needs of the user, the contents that adapt to their preferences, the installation of security, or the detection of fraudulent apps.
“With AURA we want to transform data into knowledge and place it into our customers’ hands so that they are able to know, decide, and act, and so that they can make the most of their relationship with Telefónica”, said Chema Alonso during the presentation.
 
Privacy and collaboration with different partners
Based on the principle of the customers’ privacy in their relationship with Telefónica, users will be provided with safety, transparency, and control over their data.  AURA will be easy to manage. An example of this simplicity is the Timeline feature, which will enable users to chronologically see the data they generate as they use the company’s products and services.
In this space of trust and understanding with the customer, AURA will allow users to decide whether or not to share part of the insights generated from their data with third parties and so enrich their digital experiences. Integration with other technologies and digital services will make AURA a powerful platform of innovation open to other partners and different technologies.
“Artificial Intelligence is poised to be the transformative technology of our time, and at Microsoft we aim to bring the benefits of AI to every person and organization on the planet,” said Peggy Johnson, Executive Vice President of Business Development at Microsoft during the presentation. Telefónica is collaborating with Microsoft in its fourth platform project. “We have made deep investments in AI, machine learning, and an industry-leading cloud infrastructure to set a new bar for intelligent services like speech and image recognition. We’re thrilled to collaborate with Telefónica to bring these next generation experiences to their customers.”
UNICEF also participated in the presentation with another example that demonstrates the great social potential contained in data. Users will have the possibility of altruistically sharing anonymized data regarding their mobility or use of mobile services. In this way, the United Nations agency will be able to improve the quality of its predictive models, improving its response to children in cases of natural disasters or health emergencies.
"As UNICEF continues to innovate in an increasingly complex world, we need to agree with new partners and use new technologies to solve the biggest challenges facing children.  In crises like natural disasters, diseases, and the ongoing movement of millions of children because of war and violence, UNICEF knows that partners and technologies are key to our ability to understand the world and act quickly.  We are excited to work with Telefonica, and our other major technology partners, to build solutions to the most pressing issues of our time”, added Christopher Fabian, Co-Founder of UNICEF Innovation.
Along the same line, another use case is being developed in collaboration with ProFuturo, the social and educational initiative promoted by Fundación Telefónica and Fundación Bancaria “la Caixa”, so that customers can anonymously and voluntarily give their data and ProFuturo can combine it with its own and obtain useful insights for the implementation of its social initiatives. In this way, customers of Telefónica can help governments and humanitarian agencies to achieve the educational challenges identified by the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals Fund. 
Javier Oliván, Vice-president of Growth at Facebook, presented an interesting example of the potential of new collaboration proposals. This use case demonstrates an improvement of Facebook’s Safety Check service for Telefónica customers that have also registered with the service, enhancing accuracy of notifications. In case of an emergency, when Safety Check is activated, Facebook will have the capability of notifying Telefónica customers who are in the area, prompting them with a notification so they can verify if they are alright. In this collaboration, the client’s personal information is not shared with Facebook. “We are excited to partner with Telefónica to improve experiences like Safety Check, so members of our community can let friends and family know they're safe if they happen to be near a disaster area”, said Mark Zuckerberg, Founder, Chairman and CEO from Facebook’s headquarters in Menlo Park.
The use cases of AURA shown during the presentation, as well as the great possibilities opened up with this new model of relationship with its clients, can be seen at the Telefónica stand at the Barcelona MWC (Hall 3 - 3K 21), where the company proposes a unique journey through its four platforms.

Telefónica’s Lean Product Development Journey

	Telefónica’s Lean Product Development Journey 
by Matic Golob

    in Best Practices, Efficient Process & Knowledge Based Environment, Skilled People and CollaborationComments 

Telefónica is one of the world’s leading telecommunication service providers, operating in 21 countries, employing around 120,000 people, and serving over 360 million customers around the globe. In 2011, the continuous and rapid changes in the telecommunications market led Telefónica to reinvent itself and transform into a digital telecommunications company.
The combination of traditional telco assets combined with digital ones, enable its customers to access and enjoy the latest technology. To achieve this, Telefónica defined its path towards success by applying three values: Discover, Disrupt, and Deliver.
The Lean Analytics Association (LAA) team carried out a Gemba Walk at Telefónica’s Headquarters in Madrid to document their lean product development journey and discover how lean thinking practices are impacting their innovation outcomes.

Telefónica is one of the largest telecommunication companies in the world in terms of market capitalization and number of customers. It offers a range of services in fixed, mobile and broadband networks, as well as an innovative range of digital services. Telefónica stands behind three of the most loved customer brands:


The Lean Analytics Association met Telefónica’s Research & Development team, responsible of coordinating the overall digital innovation strategy and the entire Group’s R&D to understand which practices enable their innovation process to be efficient. In particular, LAA team was interested to learn how Telefónica’s engineers and user experience designers develop many of the most strategic products Telefónica offers to its global customers.

These practices were identified and structured according to the four building blocks of the Lean Innovation Model. Below are just some of the best practices identified and described in the Telefónica chapter of the Lean Product Development Best Practices Book.

1) STRATEGY AND PERFORMANCE
Telefónica follows the Lean Startup approach in projects where the market is yet to be validated. In other words, when the innovation projects aim is to create products that offer new solutions to customers or to adapt new solutions for niches markets which are non-existent up to now. However, in the cases where the market knowledge already exists and a validated business strategy is in place, Telefónica follows the Product Life Cycle (PLC) approach. In these cases, new products are developed within the PLC framework.



2) SKILLED PEOPLE AND COLLABORATION
Lean Startup is a relatively new approach, which requires a new mindset and new way of working. To support, ease and speed-up the cultural change process, Telefónica developed a specialized training. This training focuses on upgrading the competencies of employees that have the predominantly technical background and enabling them to learn about and apply these new approaches and related methods. To provide further support and continuous development to its employees, Telefónica strategically allocates each project to an experienced sponsor, together with internal and external mentors, and a project leader who provides coaching towards a different mindset, moving from “achiever and performer”, to “pioneer and explorer”, i.e., interpreneurial.

3) EFFICIENT PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT PROCESS AND KNOWLEDGE BASED ENVIRONMENT
In 2006, Telefónica I+D introduced and transitioned to the use of the agile methodology for the development of their software programs. However, in 2011, Telefónica began to position itself as a digital telecommunications company and started to build digital products. Since then, Telefónica has followed the Lean Startup approach and has achieved significant improvements in areas like development time, and quality, while reducing cost, and enhancing its learning culture. All these changes have led to a significant cultural transformation within the company.
The Lean Startup approach helped Telefónica to successfully launch several new innovation projects and set guidelines for emerging projects that are aligned with the company’s innovation strategy. Additionally, Telefónica actively involves its Branding Department and the Sales Force in the development and validation of projects’ core hypotheses.



4) CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT AND CHANGE
One of the best practices observed in Telefónica is its approach to open innovation, which involves working with others to blend internal and external knowledge and co-create new solutions. Large organizations typically find the concept of open innovation very difficult to digest, as their mindsets are pointed more towards IP and keeping the “know-how” in-house.
Telefónica also regularly encourages and rewards its best and most successful projects, teams and intrapreneurs. Additionally, innovation teams also have the opportunity to share their progress and result with top management as well as with their peers and the best projects and teams are awarded by Telefónica’s I+D CEO.


Consolidated best practices as identified in Telefónica, structured around LAA’s Lean Innovation Model

Applying lean approaches, in particular, Lean Startup, in a large corporation is complex and requires alignment to a new vision and mindset, but the benefits are worth the efforts. Telefónica has accelerated its innovation cycle by 2.6 times, thus reducing the time spent on each project and, therefore, decreasing the budget invested in each project by 48% on average. At the same time, and even with a lower overall budget, the company launched, within the same time frame, more projects than before, increasing the number of innovation projects by 45% while shifting the project focus to the customer. This offers more opportunities to test a higher number of ideas with customers early in the project, and consequently, increase the possibilities of having a greater impact on its business by creating products that customers need.
