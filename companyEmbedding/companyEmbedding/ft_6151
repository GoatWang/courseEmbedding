Our SureVoid products provide a temporary support platform for concrete placement until the grade beam or structural slab set and can support itself across drilled piers, pads, intermittent footings, or other concrete work. The SureVoid material, lying under structural concrete construction, gradually absorbs ground moisture and loses its strength after the concrete has set, creating a space into which soil can expand without causing damage. With their unique design, SureVoid products can be made to support nearly any concrete wall height and width or any structural slab thickness. SureVoid products are also used in other areas of concrete forming where creating spaces is required. They are frequently utilized in areas with limited access.Categories:Building Materials & Supply, Construction, Paper & Pulp Manufacturing, Concrete Contractor, Concrete MaterialsYear Established:1977Other Contact Info:Email: dcook@surevoid.com,Fax: (817) 429-7333,TOLLFREE: 1-888-803-8643 Find:Manufacturing & Industrial Supplies>Paper & Pulp Manufacturing>Sure Void ProductsLocal ResourcesAdd a BusinessBrowse by City/StateAdvertiser ResourcesAccount CenterAdvertise With UsSome business information provided by Infogroup ®, Omaha, Nebraska Copyright © 2014.Privacy|About Our Ads|Terms|Add/Edit Business|Yahoo Maps Terms of Use|Help|Send Feedback|Additional terms of service Paper Pulp Manufacturing - Yahoo Local Search Results
