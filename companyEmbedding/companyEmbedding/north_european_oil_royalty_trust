North European Oil Royalty Trust











































 





North European Oil Royalty Trust (the Trust) was organized in 1975 as the successor entity to North European Oil Corporation and North European Oil Company.  Since November 11, 1981 the units of beneficial interest of the Trust have traded on the New York Stock Exchange, originally under the symbol NET but since January 29, 2002 under the symbol NRT.
The Trust is administered by five Trustees, one of whom is designated the Managing Trustee, and the Managing Director. The purpose of the Trust is to collect, hold and verify royalties paid into the Trust by the operating companies, German subsidiaries of the Exxon Mobil Corporation and the Royal Dutch/Shell Group of Companies. The royalties are paid out in whole cents on a quarterly basis to the Trust�s unit owners after making allowances for anticipated administrative expenses. The royalties are derived from the sale of natural gas, sulfur and oil extracted by the operating companies from the Trust�s overriding royalty areas in northwestern Germany as specified in the terms of the two royalty agreements in place.  Additionally the Trustees and Managing Director are responsible for complying with all the legal and financial requirements imposed upon a publicly traded business.  Further information regarding the Trust is available in the annual and quarterly reports and the filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that can be accessed in the Investor's section of this website.
The Trust has not issued and does not issue any debt or equity securities other than units of beneficial interest and, pursuant to the Trust Agreement which created the Trust, the Trust is not permitted to do so.

BEB, a joint venture between ExxonMobil 
                                Corp. and the Royal Dutch/Shell, is an integrated 
                                gas supply company which is active in exploration, 
                                production, import, underground storage and sales 
                                of natural gas. As the largest German natural 
                                gas producer, BEB provides their customers access 
                                to a secure gas supply through a well-balanced 
                                structure ensuring gas availability. More than 
                                half the natural gas which BEB has at its disposal 
                                to cover the demand of its customers comes from 
                                its own domestic resources. About 50% of the German 
                                gas reserves contain hydrogen sulfide with varying 
                                concentrations which must be removed before it 
                                can be put to commercial use as a clean environment-friendly 
                                energy. BEB therefore operates a gas desulfurization 
                                plant at Grossenkneten located south of the city 
                                of Oldenburg. At the plant the hydrogen sulfide 
                                is removed from the natural gas and then converted 
                                to elemental sulfur.





Drilling Rig BEB 1
                                To maintain a ready and stable gas supply for 
                                the future BEB is always looking for new gas reservoirs. 
                                Therefore generally deep wells with a depth of 
                                more than 4000 m (13, 000 ft) have to be drilled. 
                                The BEB drilling rig operates with the rotary 
                                method. It works on the principle of rotating 
                                the drill-string with the drill bit via a rotary 
                                table on the surface driven by an electrically 
                                powered unit

                              The natural gas will be produced from wells located 
                              at so called well sites. The visible part of a gas 
                              well is the so called christmas tree which forms 
                              the wellhead and allows a safe gas production. 
                              





Part of a sour gas well site
                                Sulfur solvents are pumped into the sour gas wells 
                                preventing elemental sulfur from clogging in the 
                                production string. Solvents and reservoir water 
                                are co-produced with the gas and removed in the 
                                gas dehydration units installed at each production 
                                well. The liquids discharged from the gas are 
                                collected in tanks.

                                From the dehydration unit, the gas flows through 
                                metering devices to permit the field measurement 
                                of the raw gas volumes. The gas is then transported 
                                by way of flow lines to gathering stations and 
                                finally to the Grossenkneten plant where the sulfur 
                                present in the natural gas is removed.

The natural gas is produced from 
                                wells located at the so called well site where 
                                the gas flows out of the production well. Reservoir 
                                water which is co-produced with the gas is separated 
                                at the well site. The gas is then fed into BEBs 
                                pipeline network.

Why royalties may be the best income investment on earth









Why Buy Royalties
In today’s investing landscape, investors are looking for new ways to insulate their money from unpredictable stock market fluctuations. This has led to a substantial rise in the popularity of alternative investments like royalties. Investing in royalties offers buyers the opportunity to purchase future royalty stream revenue generated by royalty assets.
At Royalty Exchange, you will now have access to purchase some of these alternative assets in an online marketplace:

Auctions
Royalty Exchange take royalty transactions out of the private, backroom deal and into the open marketplace through online public auctions. Every listing provides all the relevant rights and catalog information, financial data, media, and any other information needed to make a sound investment decision. 
Advances [beta]
Royalty Exchange’s Peer Advance platform allows you to provide advances with fixed rates and terms to royalty rightsholders, backed by their royalty income. It’s as close to a guaranteed return as you can get.

Steady Income
Royalties are generally stable investments, they pay consistent income every year. Each asset listing on our site will include historical financial data.


Longevity
Royalty streams last for the life of the copyright or patent. In many cases, with royalties generated from copyrights, those payments can last up to 75 years.


Diversification
Royalties from intellectual property, especially music royalties, are uncorrelated assets. Meaning they are not influenced by fluctuations in the stock market. This is a good way to stabilize the income your portfolio generates.


Potential Upside
Some royalties, especially in music, experience large spikes in revenue based on increased use. For example, when a song is used in a popular commercial, revenue spikes... or when a popular artist covers an older song, the owners of the copyright enjoy a major boost in royalty payments.








Why royalties could be the perfect income investment
Intellectual property assets with a strong track record of consistent earnings may be the perfect investment for those seeking income. Owners of intellectual property of any kind are paid every time their IP is used. They create an asset once, and then collect payment over and over again.
Imagine this… you’re a songwriter. You write a song for a film and this move becomes a classic; the type of film that people watch many times over a period of years. One of these films–even 20 years after its release date–still airs on TV nearly every week and is purchased or streamed on iTunes, Amazon Video, Netflix, and even on DVD.Every time one this film is bought, streamed, or aired on TV you get paid.
Billy Goodrum is one of these songwriters. He penned original music for the hit comedy Dumb and Dumber (1994), among others. Below, you can see that the royalties he earned from that movie increased at least 15% every year from 2011 through 2014, ultimately reaching a 12-month total of over $22,000 before he sold it in early 2015.


Royalties don't rust. They don't get sued by angry workers. And they don't require expensive tools or machinery to make money. Somebody creates it once and they make money for decades.
Until recently, you probably never had the opportunity to own income-producing intellectual property. That’s where Royalty Exchange comes in. We’re a marketplace where these types of royalty assets are bought and sold. We specialize in intellectual property with a documented track record of regular, consistent income.

Through our one-of-a-kind platform, investors can buy privately owned royalty rights directly from the artists, inventors and creators. In a world of negative interest rates, these income-generating royalty rights just might be the perfect investment.
To view all our current and past auctions, simply create a free account via the link below. The process takes less than 2 minutes, and you'll be able to explore all the fantastic income investments available across both Auctions and Advances.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
