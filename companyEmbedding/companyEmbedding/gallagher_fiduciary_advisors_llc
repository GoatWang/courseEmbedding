Gallagher Fiduciary Advisors Appoints Area President


  

 







ITASCA, IL, February 6, 2014 -- Gallagher Benefit Services, Inc. (GBS) today announced that Nick Davies will assume the role of area president of its institutional investment and fiduciary advisory practice and subsidiary, Gallagher Fiduciary Advisors, LLC (GFA). He is based in Washington, D.C. and will be responsible for GFA's Washington, D.C. and Newark, N.J. offices.
Davies joined GFA in 2013 as a senior consultant focusing on client service and firm management. He has over 16 years of pension and investment experience. Most recently, he served as the U.S. defined benefit segment leader within Mercer's Investments business, focusing on pension risk solutions and alternative investments. Davies also brings a plan sponsor perspective to GFA. As senior investment officer for the Board of Investment Trustees in Montgomery County, Md., he helped oversee approximately $3 billion of pension assets. Davies' background also includes actuarial work, asset/liability modeling, investment manager research and delegated multi-manager investment solutions.
Samuel ("Skip") Halpern, current area president for the Washington, D.C. and Newark offices, will step back from internal management responsibility at GFA, but will continue to advise select clients across GFA's services (both institutional advisory and independent fiduciary services) and assist in the transition. This gradual transition is designed to maintain continuity while positioning the firm for the future.
"I am excited to be part of the Gallagher Fiduciary Advisors team and to help lead the growth of the investment business," said Davies. "We have great people, technology, resources and processes, and in an increasingly complex world, GFA offers a unique combination of expertise in institutional investment and fiduciary work."
Francis X. Lilly, area chairman of GFA in Washington, D.C., noted that Davies brings a complementary skill set that makes him a natural fit for GFA. "Nick has extensive experience from the U.S. and U.K. on pension investment issues, including liability-driven investing strategies, pension risk transfer, and alternative investments across private and public markets," Lilly said. "GFA has a strong history of providing investment advisory and independent fiduciary services, and both are essential to financial management decisions for defined benefit plan sponsors as well as 401k, VEBA and other clients."
"Nick brings extensive knowledge about the value of broader consulting across the benefits landscape, and I'm confident that our investment advisory and fiduciary decision-making businesses will continue to grow under his leadership," said David Ziegler, executive vice president of Gallagher Benefit Services.
Davies joins a highly qualified GFA team as one of three Chartered Alternative Investment Analysts. Client interests are also served by 13 investment professionals who are Chartered Financial Analysts, four attorneys with ERISA experience and one Certified Public Accountant.
