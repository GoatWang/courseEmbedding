We are relationship focused and not interested in rushing to “do a deal” unless we are aligned. Our focus is to get to know the people (hopes, dreams, motivations, skills, etc.) and the business (growth potential, strengths, weaknesses, etc.). Because we spend time determining whether we’re the right partners and share a vision for the future – gaining alignment – the rest will come easily.

Overview

Asset classes are a result of a period strategic asset allocation process and approved by the CalPERS Board of Administration.
CalPERS' investment portfolio is diversified into several asset classes.
Strategic asset allocation is the dominant determinant of portfolio risk and return; a well-diversified portfolio shapes our long-term performance, protects the Retirement Fund, and ensures any weaknesses in one area are offset by gains in another.

Yellow Wood Partners has raised $370 million for its oversubscribed second fund. Yellow Wood Capital Partners II LP will focus on the consumer sector, making investments between $50 million and over $150 million apiece. Park Hill was placement agent while Proskauer Rose LLP served as legal counsel.
PRESS RELEASE
BOSTON, July 27, 2017 – Yellow Wood Partners, a leading private equity firm focused on investing in consumer brands and companies, today announced that it has completed fund raising for its oversubscribed Yellow Wood Capital Partners II LP, with $370 million of committed capital.
Yellow Wood Fund II will pursue the same investment strategy it has employed since inception, partnering with management teams in North America and applying its operational and financial resources to transform brands and companies into category leaders. Yellow Wood seeks to invest the new fund in a limited number of platforms, probably no more than five, in the consumer sector. This focused investment strategy allows the firm to concentrate its resources in working with management teams to build out their companies through operating initiatives as well as acquiring additional brands to grow and diversify their product offerings. Industry categories targeted for investment span the consumer sector and may include Beauty & Personal Care, Health & Wellness, Household, Food & Beverage, and Pet Care among others. Targeted equity investment for each portfolio company will be between $50-$150+ million. 





Dana Schmaltz, Founding Partner of Yellow Wood Partners, said, “The successful completion of Fund II is an important milestone for Yellow Wood. It is our belief that overachieving our targeted fund raise supports the strategy we set out to implement six years ago, to build a firm that invests and manages brands as operators who have built, and not just invested behind, consumer brands. Our small group of sophisticated limited partners are true partners in this strategy as we have sought to form a stronger alignment of our interests. We appreciate their support and commitment to Yellow Wood and we look forward to working with them to achieve our mutual goals. As our success with PDC Brands shows we believe there is a great opportunity to build a limited number of great portfolio companies where our team can enhance the success of consumer brands to drive exceptional returns for our investors.”
Tad Yanagi, Partner at Yellow Wood added, “We start Fund II with a strong pipeline of investment opportunities. Over the last five years we have continued to expand our outreach to entrepreneurs as well as to the financial community that understands how Yellow Wood can bring our combined operating and investment experience to acquire and grow consumer brands. We look forward to working with skilled management teams to drive the transformation of new businesses into growing global consumer products companies that appeal to consumers across all distribution channels.”
Yellow Wood recently completed the $1.425 billion sale of PDC Brands, a rapidly growing provider of beauty, personal care, and wellness brands, after quadrupling the company’s revenue and growing EBITDA by over five times. During Yellow Wood’s ownership, PDC completed five exclusive acquisitions adding nine additional growing brands to the platform. 





Fund II includes a small group of eight sophisticated institutions, including a number of large university endowments, foundations and institutional investors, a number of which are returning Limited Partners of the firm. Park Hill assisted the firm as Placement Agent for certain of the limited partnership interests. Proskauer Rose LLP served as legal counsel.
About Yellow Wood Partners
Yellow Wood Partners is a Boston-based private investment firm that invests exclusively in the consumer industry in the middle market. The firm seeks to acquire branded consumer products across a variety of channels including mass, drug, food, specialty, club and e-commerce. Yellow Wood’s success in driving growth and operational efficiencies is based on the team’s combination of investment expertise and complementary marketing, sales, finance, operations, and international skills. The goal of this operational approach is to form strong partnerships with the management teams of portfolio companies to drive exceptional returns for all of its stakeholders.

   More in Private Equity 




Private Equity Program Fund Performance Review

As of September 30, 2016, the since inception Net IRR is 10.7% and the Net Multiple is 1.4x.
The table below reflects the performance of all active PE partnership investments as of September 30, 2016. At the end of each quarter, the General Partners report on the value of invested capital. The General Partners have 120 days to provide Limited Partners with financial data, so there is generally a 2-quarter delay in performance reporting.



  How to Read the Performance Review Table  



The table is updated quarterly and provides information on the status of all active CalPERS private equity commitments; it doesn't include any exited partnership investments.

The Fund column lists the names of all active partnership investments.
Vintage Year is the year in which CalPERS’ first cash flow for the investment occurred.
Capital Committed identifies the original amount CalPERS committed to each fund.
Cash In represents capital contributed for investments and management fees.
Cash Out represents distributions CalPERS has received back from the fund.
Cash Out & Remaining Value represents the distributions CalPERS has received plus the reported value of the invested capital.
Net IRR is the Net Internal Rate of Return based on CalPERS’ actual cash flows and the reported value of the invested capital.
Investment Multiple is the Cash Out & Remaining Value divided by the Cash In.

In evaluating private equity performance, CalPERS emphasizes using both the realized Internal Rate of Return (IRR) and Investment Multiple. Interim IRRs by themselves are not the best indicators of current or future fund performance.
The IRR is calculated based on CalPERS records of cash flows and financial statements from the investment managers.

2x Partners and RC/Fontis To Exit Tasty Bite Investment; Kagome To Acquire Leading Ethnic Food Brand

April 14, 2015 2xPartners_admin 


2x Consumer Products Growth Partners and Rustic Canyon/Fontis Partners To Exit Tasty Bite Investment
Kagome to acquire leading ethnic food brand
Chicago, IL and Pasadena, CA – 2x Consumer Products Growth Partners (“2x Partners”) and Rustic Canyon/Fontis Partners (“RC/Fontis”) are set to exit their investments in Preferred Brands International, Inc. An announcement was made simultaneously to the Nikkei and Bombay stock exchanges that Kagome Co., Ltd. (TYO: 2811), a large Japanese food and beverage company, will acquire majority interest in Preferred Brands. Management will continue to own a significant minority interest following the transaction, which is subject to customary regulatory approvals and is expected to close in May, 2015.
Based in Stamford, CT, with manufacturing in Pune, India, Preferred Brands is a leading manufacturer and marketer of Indian entrées, Asian noodles and ethnic inspired organic rice products under the TASTY BITE brand. During the term of the investments from 2x Partners (invested in 2010) and RC/Fontis (initially invested in 2008 as the first institutional money into the Company), the Company’s revenue approximately doubled and tripled respectively while profitability growth exceeded revenue growth in all cases.
“Pending regulatory approval, we will be pleased to see a global industry leader like Kagome take Tasty Bite to the next level,” said Andrew Whitman, Managing Partner at 2x Partners. Adds Renée LaBran, Managing Partner at RC/Fontis, “We have tremendous respect for the Tasty Bite team, and expect that the company will thrive under their continued leadership and the guidance of Kagome.”
LaBran and Managing Partner Gabrielle Greene-Sulzberger led the investment from RCF and were supported by their partner Danny Villanueva. The 2x Partners team included Whitman and Vice President Kim Anne Starke and were supported by Managing Partner Sharon Kieffer, Vice President Mike Apostal and several of the firm’s Industry Venture Partners.
Barclays acted as exclusive financial advisor to Preferred Brands. The Giannuzzi Group, LLP and Horwood Marcus & Berk Chartered provided legal counsel to the Company and the investors respectively.

Arboretum Ventures Managing Directors Paul McCreadie (from left), Jan Garfinkle and Tim Petersen can celebrate the record raising of the Ann Arbor venture capital firm's fourth fund.
 


An exit strategyArboretum Ventures, arguably the most
      successful venture capital firm in the state in recent years,
      has had six major exits since 2008: HealthMedia Inc., Ann
      Arbor, which was sold for $200 million.
Accuri Cytometers
      Inc., Ann Arbor, which was sold for $205
      million. HandyLab
      Inc., Ann Arbor, which was sold for $275
      million. CardioMEMS
      Inc., Atlanta, which was sold for $435
      million. Esperion
      Therapeutics Inc. (Nasdaq: ESPR), Ann Arbor,
      and Goleta, Calif.-based Inogen
      Inc., which had initial public
      offerings. "Those six exits have
      returned more than $3 billion in value," said Jan Garfinkle,
      an Arboretum managing director.Ann Arbor-based Arboretum Ventures LLC has finished raising the largest venture capital fund in state history, closing Arboretum Ventures IV LP at $220 million.On June 18, Arboretum filed a form with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission saying it intended to raise $215 million for its fourth fund. In less than three months, the firm surpassed that total.Its previous fund, raised in 2011, also was oversubscribed. It had been targeted at $125 million and closed at $138 million. The previous largest fund in state history was the $180 million Michigan Growth Capital Partners II, raised in 2013 by Farmington Hills-based Beringea LLC.Managing Director Tim Petersen said Arboretum will continue to concentrate on medical devices, diagnostics health care IT and health care service companies. "We'll continue to invest in companies that address the cost of health care, that take costs out of the system," Petersen said. "It's not as if we're running out of opportunities to do that. The landscape is as attractive as it has ever been." Managing Director Jan Garfinkle added, "We'll stick to our knitting." Arboretum typically invests between $10 million and $15 million in its portfolio companies over a series of rounds as they hit development milestones, Garfinkle said. That means the company will be able to invest in at least 15 additional companies from this fund. Managing Director Paul McCreadie said Arboretum is already in due diligence on six possible investments from the new fund. Petersen said the company has invested in 35 companies since being founded in 2002. He said the 2003 fund of $24 million and 2007 fund of $73 million both rank in the top quartile of venture capitals funds raised nationally in those years. Petersen said new investors include three health care systems that he is not allowed to identify, one of them in Michigan. Returning investors include the Ann Arbor-based Renaissance Venture Capital Fund and the Troy-based Kresge Foundation.Chris Rizik, CEO and fund manager at Renaissance Venture Capital, said he previously invested in Arboretum's second and third funds: "Arboretum II was our first investment back in 2008. We literally closed on that investment the day after our own first closing." Robert Manilla, chief investment officer of the $3.5 billion Kresge Foundation, told Crain's that in 2006, "my team spent considerable time looking for an institutional-quality asset manager in Michigan. After considerable due diligence, we invested in their 2007 fund and have been investors in each of their successive funds."I have watched the organization grow from a small Michigan health care venture firm to a nationally recognized health care investor. ... Their 2007 fund is our top-performing U.S. venture fund of that vintage, and their 2011 fund, while still early in its life, is progressing well." Other VC experts said Arboretum should be thanked for restoring confidence for investing in Midwest firms. Jonathan Murray, who runs the Ann Arbor office of Pittsburgh-based Draper Triangle Ventures, said Arboretum has delivered consistent returns."What's really important is they're helping the limited-partner community in Michigan find out it's possible to invest in Midwest companies and make money," Murray said, referring by the term "limited partners" to the institutional investors, including foundations and nonprofits, that some think have been too slow to invest in the state. Patti Glaza, vice president of Invest Detroit and managing director of its two investment funds, the Detroit Innovate and First Step funds, said Arboretum's strategy of investing in life sciences firms has proven wise.Glaza said Arboretum's track record has opened the door for other VC firms by proving that you can have strong returns by investing in Michigan investment firms that have a Midwest focus. News that Arboretum has closed on its new fund follows the news last week that Arboretum was part of a $39.5 million funding round in Plymouth Township-based Delphinus Medical Technologies Inc., thought to be the largest single investment in a medical device company in state history.Arboretum's share of that round came from its third fund.

Capital Partners, a private equity firm in Greenwich, Conn., has closed $360 million for its second fund. Champlain Advisors served as lead placement agent.
PRESS RELEASE
GREENWICH, CT (January 27, 2014) — Capital Partners, Inc. (“Capital Partners”), announced today that it has closed its latest private equity fund, Capital Partners Private Equity Income Fund II, LP (“CP II”) with total committed capital of $360 million. CP II will be led by its three Managing Directors, Mark D. Allsteadt, Brian D. Fitzgerald, and Robert S. Tucker.
According to Robert Tucker of Capital Partners, “CP II will continue Capital Partners’ primary strategy of making investments in private North American companies that have dedicated management teams, solid market positions, demonstrated records of free cash-flow generation, prospects for growth and EBITDA between $4 million and $25 million.”
Mark Allsteadt of Capital Partners, commented that “CP II will focus on opportunities that will generate an attractive annual cash yield for investors and where it can leverage the experience of our management group to actively support the portfolio companies in developing and executing their strategic plans to grow the businesses and generate long-term gains.”
“CP II plans to finance its acquisitions with a moderate level of outside debt and substantial equity which results in lower leverage-related risk for portfolio companies,” added Brian Fitzgerald of Capital Partners. “CP II has already made two platform investments: American Leather, a manufacturer of high-end, custom upholstered furniture, and Derby Fabricating Solutions, a manufacturer of foam and rubber components.”
“CP II is more than double the size of Capital Partners’ prior fund, diversifying the investor base considerably,” added Terry Crikelair, Managing Partner of Champlain Advisors, LLC who led the CP II fund placement. “The fund was oversubscribed and increased its hard cap to accommodate investor demand.”
Champlain Advisors, a global fund placement and investor relations advisory firm served as lead placement agent. Finn Dixon & Herling LLP acted as legal counsel.
