Why is this contact information displayed? [Close]
The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

Description
Lessons from the Virtual Classroom, Second Edition
The second edition of the classic resource Lessons from the
Cyberspace Classroom offers a comprehensive reference for
faculty to hone their skills in becoming more effective online
instructors. Thoroughly revised and updated to reflect recent
changes and challenges that face online teachers, Lessons from
the Virtual Classroom is filled with illustrative examples from
actual online courses as well as helpful insights from teachers and
students. This essential guide offers targeted suggestions for
dealing with such critical issues as evaluating effective
courseware, working with online classroom dynamics, addressing the
needs of the online student, making the transition to online
teaching, and promoting the development of the learning
community.
Praise for Lessons from the Virtual Classroom,
Second Edition
"Palloff and Pratt demonstrate their exceptional practical
experience and insight into the online classroom. This is an
invaluable resource for those tasked with creating an online
course."
 D. Randy Garrison, professor, University of Calgary, and
author, Blended Learning in Higher Education: Framework,
Principles, and Guidelines
"Faculty will deeply appreciate and make use of the many
explicit examples of how to design, prepare, and teach both blended
and fully online courses."
 Judith V. Boettcher, faculty coach and author, The
Online Teaching Survival Guide: Simple and Practical Pedagogical
Tips
"Lessons from the Virtual Classroom is filled with
insightful caveats and recommendations, pointed examples to enhance
your practice, succinct summaries of the research, and engaging
visual overviews. Each page brings the reader a renewed sense of
confidence to teach online as well as personal joy that there is
finally a resource to find the answers one is seeking."
 Curtis J. Bonk, professor of education, Indiana
University-Bloomington, and author, Empowering Online Learning:
100+ Activities for Reading, Reflecting, Displaying, and

With the emergence of new technologies, and the need for universities and colleges to offer more online courses to their students, there is a great trend in faculty who traditionally teach face-to-face needing to learn how to teach online. Additionally instructors already teaching online may need help taking their courses to the next level. Sloan-C reported that 5.6 million students (30%) took at least one online course in 2009. With the economy and challenges for school funding, more colleges, universities, and students are turning to online courses.
Rena Palloff and Keith Pratt, the most trusted online teaching experts, have completely updated and revised LESSONS FROM THE VIRTUAL CLASSROOM: The Realities of Online Teaching, 2nd Edition (Jossey-Bass, a Wiley brand; July 2013; $40; Paper; ISBN:  978-1-118-12373-7) to reflect changes in technology and advances in online teaching made in the last decade, in order to meet today’s online learning challenges. LESSONS FROM THE VIRTUAL CLASSROOM continues to offer helpful suggestions for dealing with such critical issues as evaluating effective tools, working with online classroom dynamics, addressing the special needs of online students, making the transition to online teaching, and promoting the development of the learning community.
LESSONS FROM THE VIRTUAL CLASSROOM is filled with numerous examples from actual online courses and insights from teachers and students.  New topics include the open source movement, Web 2.0, Google groups, and topics for the K–12 sector.
