Index variable annuities 


Variable investment options














Variable annuities
Variable annuities offer market growth potential based on the investment options you choose.
A variable annuity may be a good choice if you're willing to tolerate some market risk in exchange for growth potential.




Variable annuities can offer:

Tax-deferred growth
Variable investment options
Income options, including income for life
Death benefit options
Optional benefits that may help protect your retirement assets and income (available at an additional cost)

How do variable annuities work?



1 . Customize your investment
You give the insurance company money in one or more payments. Some variable annuities let you choose a number of variable investment options, while others offer a predetermined mix of investments.



2 . Accumulation phase
Your contract’s value may increase – or decrease – depending on the performance of the investments you choose. Variable annuities involve risk, and it’s possible to lose money.





3 . Tax-deferred growth
You defer paying taxes on any gain in your contract until you receive money from the contract. Tax-deferred growth means the money stays in your contract and has potential to grow faster.



4 . Distribution phase
After a period of time specified by your contract you may then receive the amount allowed by your contract in a lump sum, over a set period of time, or as income for the rest of your life.

A variable annuity isn't an appropriate solution for everyone, and you shouldn't buy one unless it's appropriate for your situation. Purchasing an annuity is an important decision, and one you should only make after consulting
                            with your financial professional and tax advisor.

Investing in a variable annuity may be the answer for part of your overall retirement strategy. A variable annuity offers a unique combination of features, including market participation through a variety of investment options; tax-deferred growth opportunities; and optional protection benefits that can provide certain accumulation, income, and beneficiary guarantees for an additional cost. Please note that we no longer offer any variable life insurance products.
Variable annuities and variable life insurance products are subject to investment risk, including loss of principal, and contract/policy values fluctuate daily. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate with market conditions so that units, upon distribution, may be worth more or less than the original cost.
Purchasing an annuity within a retirement plan that provides tax deferral under sections of the Internal Revenue Code results in no additional tax benefit. An annuity should be used to fund a qualified plan based upon the annuity’s features other than tax deferral. All annuity features, risks, limitations, and costs should be considered prior to purchasing an annuity within a tax-qualified retirement plan.
Withdrawals will reduce the contract value and the value of any protection benefits. Withdrawals taken within the contract withdrawal charge schedule will be subject to a withdrawal charge. All withdrawals are subject to ordinary income tax and, if taken prior to age 59½, may be subject to a 10% federal additional tax.
For more complete information about variable annuities and variable investment options, call your financial professional or Allianz Life Financial Services, LLC at 800.624.0197 for a prospectus. The prospectuses contain details on investment objectives, risks, fees, and expenses, as well as other information about the variable annuity and variable investment options, which you should carefully consider. Please read the prospectuses thoroughly before sending money.
Guarantees are backed by the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing company. Variable annuity and variable life insurance guarantees do not apply to the performance of the variable subaccounts, which will fluctuate with market conditions.

Investment Options




























You could lose money by investing in the AZL Government Money Market Fund. Although the Fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund’s sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the Fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the Fund at any time. 7 Day Current Yield more closely reflects the current earnings than the total return.
The Allianz Investment Management LLC, Allianz Global Investors, NFJ Investment Group LLC, RCM Capital Management LLC, and PIMCO investment options are managed by an affiliate of Allianz Life Insurance Company of New York and Allianz Life Financial Services, LLC. All are affiliated companies.
Performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance is not a guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate with market conditions, so that units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance information quoted. To access the most current month-end performance, please select Standardized Monthly Performance from the View Type above.
Performance is calculated on the basis of historical performance of each investment option. Actual performance from the date the Separate Account began investing in the investment option is shown. Performance figures show the change in value of a hypothetical investment over the indicated periods, assuming reinvestment of dividends and capital gains.
Standardized performance.
  Standardized performance information reflects the deduction of the Mortality and Expense risk (M&E) charge except Allianz Index Advantage® Variable Annuity and Allianz Index Advantage® New York Variable Annuity and Allianz Index Advantage ADVSM Variable Annuity, which have a product fee instead of an M&E charge.
Standardized performance for Index Advantage ADVSM Variable Annuity does not reflect deduction of the withdrawal charge as the withdrawal charge only applies to, and is only deducted from, the index options. Standardized performance information for all listed products also reflects the fees and expenses of the investment options after reductions for fee waivers and expense reimbursements, contract maintenance charge, and withdrawal charge as follows:




Withdrawal Charge Schedule




 Allianz VisionSM Variable Annuity 
8.5%, 8.5%, 7.5%, 6.5%, 5%, 4%, 3%, 0%


 Allianz VisionSM New York Variable Annuity 
8.5%, 8.5%, 7.5%, 6.5%, 5%, 4%, 3%, 0%


 Allianz ConnectionsSM Variable Annuity 
8.5%, 8.5%, 7.5%, 6.5%, 5%, 4%, 3%, 0%


 Allianz Index Advantage® Variable Annuity 
8.5%, 8%, 7%, 6%, 5%, 4%, 0%


 Allianz Index Advantage® New York Variable Annuity 
8.5%, 8%, 6.5%, 5%, 3%, 1%, 0%


 Allianz Index Advantage NFSM  Variable Annuity 
8.5%, 8%, 7%, 6%, 5%, 4%, 0%



The M&E charge is assessed daily against the investment option’s net asset value (NAV). The product fee and a contract maintenance charge of 0.01% are shown as assessed against the investment options NAV on the last day of each year (or the last day of the period for any period of less than one year) and the withdrawal charge is shown as assessed against the NAV on the last day of each period using the withdrawal charge percentage that would apply at that time. The product fee, contract maintenance charge and withdrawal charge are not reflected as actually calculated and deducted. They are shown as a representation of these fee's impacts on fund performance. This may overstate or understate actual performance.
Standardized performance information does not reflect the deduction of any optional rider charge. Performance would be lower if the investment options fees were calculated before reductions for waivers and reimbursements, or if rider charges were deducted. Investment option fee waivers and expense reimbursements are not permanent and may be discontinued. Please see the prospectus for more details on contract expenses and charges.

Allianz Life Launches Two New Index Variable Annuity Products | Business Wire
























































Allianz Life Launches Two New Index Variable Annuity Products




Allianz Index Advantage ADV and Allianz Index Advantage NF Offer 
      Innovative Solutions with Potential Growth and Level of Protection






May 23, 2017 10:05 AM Eastern Daylight Time



MINNEAPOLIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Allianz Life Insurance Company of North America (Allianz 
      Life®) today announced the launch of two new index variable annuity 
      (IVA) products, Allianz Index Advantage ADVSM Variable 
      Annuity and Allianz Index Advantage NFSM Variable Annuity. 
      Modeled after the successful flagship Allianz Index Advantage® Variable 
      Annuity, the new offerings provide multiple ways to benefit from the 
      balance of performance potential and level of protection.
    


      The new IVA product lineup now positions Allianz Life to better 
      capitalize on the growing demand for IVAs and brings the well-received 
      concept of upside potential with some protection to a broader market of 
      consumers. Allianz Index Advantage ADV is exclusively designed to fit 
      within a fee-based portfolio, while Allianz Index Advantage NF, with no 
      annual product fee on the index strategies, establishes another option 
      for fee-sensitive clients.
    

      “By offering Index Advantage ADV and Index Advantage NF, Allianz Life 
      now has a suite of index variable annuity products that help balance 
      risk and return, giving clients more options for building a solid 
      retirement foundation,” said Allianz Life Chief Distribution Officer Tom 
      Burns. “These IVAs offer an opportunity to grow a client’s retirement 
      nest egg by being able to participate in market gains while still having 
      a level of asset protection.”
    

      Index Advantage ADV and Index Advantage NF both help clients reach 
      long-term financial goals by offering the combination of variable 
      options and three index options giving a balance between protection and 
      performance potential. Both of these potential solutions also offer 
      features including tax-deferred growth opportunities and a built-in 
      death benefit.
    

      As with any investment vehicle, variable annuities are subject to risk, 
      including possible loss of principal. Investment returns and principal 
      will fluctuate with market conditions so that contract values, upon 
      distribution, may be worth more or less than the original cost.
    

For more complete information about Allianz index variable annuities 
      and the variable options, call Allianz Life Financial Services, LLC at 
      800.542.5427 for a prospectus. The prospectuses contain details on 
      investment objectives, risks, fees, and expenses, as well as other 
      information about the variable annuity and variable options, which your 
      clients should carefully consider. Encourage your clients to read the 
      prospectuses thoroughly before sending money.


      Withdrawals will reduce the contract value and the value of any 
      protection benefits. Additional withdrawals taken within the withdrawal 
      charge period will be subject to a withdrawal charge. All withdrawals 
      are subject to ordinary income tax and, if taken prior to age 59½, may 
      be subject to a 10% federal additional tax
    

      Guarantees are backed by the financial strength and claims-paying 
      ability of the issuing company and do not apply to the performance of 
      the variable subaccounts, which will fluctuate with market conditions.
    

      Products are issued by Allianz Life Insurance Company of North America 
      and distributed by its affiliate, Allianz Life Financial Services, LLC, 
      member FINRA, 5701 Golden Hills Drive, Minneapolis, MN 55416-1297. www.allianzlife.com 
      (L40538, L40538-NF)
    

      Not FDIC insured •May lose value •No bank or credit union guarantee •Not 
      a deposit •Not insured by any federal government agency or NCUA/NCUSIF.

Allianz Life To Launch New Variable Annuity


June 2010
BY:

Recently, Allianz Life Insurance Company
of North America announced plans
to offer a new variable annuity product,
the Allianz Retirement Pro Variable
Annuity, later this year.
Allianz plans to break into the feebased
market with the creation of this
new product that's specifically for the
market's dually registered investment
advisors. As a long-term financial vehicle,
Allianz Retirement Pro features flexible
protection, low-cost tax deferral and ability
to allocate or transfer funds between
two accounts. Depending on the investors'
objectives, they can move money
between an account with an extensive
investment lineup that offers more
equity exposure (the Base Account) and
an account that offers income and death
benefit guarantees (the Income Advantage
Account). Allianz said this product
will offer fee-based advisors' clients
an insured solution that will assist them
with accumulating, preserving and distributing
retirement assets.

            Learn about ConsumerAffairs for Brands!Consumer Complaints and ReviewsRon of Flower Mound, TX on May 5, 2017Satisfaction RatingUnbelievable. Started two months ago trying to move money from one of my fixed annuities to another insurance company. After a few weeks, I called because funds were not moved. (Notice that they never contact you that there's a problem). I was told that the type of account was different. I had a 403b and was moving it to a IRA. They said you couldn't do that. So, the new company sent another request with 403b. They said they never received it. I had to call again. They said I needed to fill the form out AGAIN stating IRA, not 403b. I did. Nothing happened for another week. I called AGAIN. They had no record of my previous conversation with the phone rep or the doc I sent. It's as if all the calls and work never happened.I asked to speak to a supervisor because the phone reps answering couldn't deal with it. I was put on hold for 45 minutes. No one came back. No one helped. At this moment, I still have not resolved this issue. I was so upset, I'm spending time waiting on the phone writing this review. DON'T EVER USE ALLIANZ. They don't have a clue about customer service and don't monitor their reps to know when they're doing their jobs correctly. Not good when they're holding our money!Helpful?YesNoChauntel of Cashmere, WA on April 19, 2017Satisfaction RatingInsurance? I don't think so! Allianz Global Assistance is a complete scam! Do not fall for their bogus marketing trap and purchase insurance. There are loopholes in their policy which they will email you after you purchase the policy. I am so upset and want to share so others don't fall for this ploy! The people you talk to repeat over and over that they must adhere to the policy. Complete show of bad business practices. It's obvious they only care about their bottom line profit and not their reputation or their customer service. Steer clear of these jokers!Helpful?YesNoDiane of Londonderry, NH on March 8, 2017Satisfaction RatingWe went to a couple of seminars in NH and fell for the smooth-talking rep about the Allianz 222 fixed index annuity. He told us there is a 20% cash bonus. After speaking with Allianz directly, and as noted on their website, there is no cash bonus. The 20% goes towards the protected payment base. You definitely have to take a stream of income after 10 years. Don't be fooled by what sounds like a cash bonus!!Helpful?YesNoHope of Pflugerville, TX on March 4, 2017Satisfaction RatingJust like the other complaints. Totally misled 4 years and it's lost money every year at a time that market has had huge gains. When I complained to the agent he couldn't read or even understand the statement. I tried to speak to customer service. They were rude and told me I should have known better and I was stuck with what I have. I am warning everyone to stay away from this company.Helpful?YesNoCarmen of Albuquerque, NM on Feb. 22, 2017Satisfaction RatingI purchased an Annuity through a Financial Advisor who I thought knew the product. Come to find out, I purchased a product that does not mature. I cannot ever withdraw the full amount in the Annuity. I can however annuitize or withdraw the money over a 10 year period. I complained about the sales pitch and misrepresentation of the product because I would never buy anything that I could not take my money out of after so many years. The Rep informed me I was given and signed a Contract. Be careful - when an Advisor tries to sell you something - make them show the points in writing they use as product benefits. Always ask what happens when you die - make them show you that info in writing as well. I am stuck with a Product I never would have wanted.Helpful?YesNo

Received notice of cancellation from Allianz on the 16th. The amount of the insurance was 131.16. They assured that my account would be credited for half of what was taken from my account. I made the correction. The flight insurance was for my husband & I. As of 1/31, after many calls my account has not been credited. The service presentation "was not able to give me that information." I asked for his name & he hung up on me after I asked him to spell it. I know he will say we were disconnected. I will never use priceline because of Allianz Ins. Co. I "will" get my money refund. It's not much, but it's principal. He said to call his supervisor at 8:00 Am. They are based in Mexico, so, I really don't know when to call back.Helpful?YesNoDarlene of Cambridge Springs, PA on Jan. 30, 2017Satisfaction RatingMy husband and I took out 2 annuities with Allianz because our advisor said they were a good company and we should make at least 5% on the account. In the 2 years we have had these 2014 to 2016 our money has gone backwards from what we put into it. The fees they charged actually take out more than the account makes over a year. Of course, we are locked into this for 7 years or we will get a penalty so if we take it out now we will lose the fees for the last 2 years and also the penalty and they win. If we leave it in they will continue not to make us any money and take fees and they win. We are so sorry we listened to our advisor, she made a terrible mistake. We worked so hard for this money to save towards retirement and now it is going backwards.Helpful?YesNoJack of Brookside, NJ on Jan. 24, 2017Satisfaction RatingI bought an annuity from Allianz and I am oh so sorry that I did that! It has been a complete fiasco since the annuity was purchased! The salesman came to my home, sat at my dining room table and outright lied to me and my wife about the annuity he was attempting to sell me! He told me the annuity was a 10 year annuity that paid 7% interest per year thus doubling my money in the 10 year period! Come to find out that the man lied to me because the annuity was actually a 30 year, 2% interest annuity!!! For the final 20 years of the annuity Allianz will pay me ZERO% interest and I will only be able to access 5% of the total amount of money each year for 20 years!!!When I contacted Allianz corp headquarters I was treated horribly and was told basically "too bad you bought it so you own it!" They totally didn't want to hear anything about my problem and they certainly didn't try to help my dilemma in any way! They were condescending, rude and totally not interested in helping one of their customers! If you were thinking of purchasing an Allianz product you should do some research first and be aware that they have had several class-action lawsuits that represented over half 1 million dissatisfied customers!This is not a company that you want to do any business with or put your hard earned money into an account where once they have it you will be lucky if you ever get back what they promise you! Do your due diligence, do your research and then run away from this unscrupulous company as fast as you can! They are not nice people or a customer oriented business organization!Helpful?YesNoCasey of Coatesville, PA on Nov. 9, 2016Satisfaction RatingI dealt with the customer service on a monthly basis. I had to take partial withdrawals and it was very easy to call in and get what I wanted. The customer service is polite and understanding. There are many options with Allianz. Partial withdrawals are easy to just call in and they are processed within 24 hours. They also have programs to take distributions on an automatic monthly basis. I took a full withdrawal a few years after nine eleven. It was a simple process of writing in a letter with my signature guaranteed. I mailed it to the process center and within 48 hours I had it wired into my account with was highly efficient and easy. There are many different funding options. I opened my annuity moving it from a previous IRA. It was very easy and the paperwork was user-friendly and simplistic to go over with my financial officer.Helpful?YesNoSpencer of Fayetteville, WV on Oct. 26, 2016Satisfaction RatingWhat a great experience I have had with Allianz. My grandmother has an Annuity with them and needed to take a withdrawal to do some repairs to her home. Both her agent and the customer service people made everything so easy. We just had to fill out a form with our agent and about a week later we received a check in the mail. Thank you Allianz!Helpful?YesNoJeremiah of Canton, OH on Sept. 15, 2016Satisfaction RatingIn the past couple of months I've had some questions about my statement. I was able to talk to a live person, who was able to give me the answers I needed. I had several available based on my needs. They were also very clear about any applicable penalties that might be incurred. All the options were favorable. The options were great ranging from check to direct deposit, or even to reinvest the withdraw into other investment options. I liked having the various options. This was nice. I could set it up to have funds put into my account from my paycheck. This way I could fund my account without worrying about missing a deposit.Helpful?YesNoKaren of Winfield, IL on Sept. 3, 2016Satisfaction RatingAfter the death of our father this past January (2016) we learned our parents had purchased three annuities. My siblings and I chose our method and timing of disbursement late January or early February. Approximately May 19th, 2016 we received a letter from Allianz with header of "Complaint Determination: Justified". The letter contained a lot of legalese but stated "Because the complaint has been determined to be "Justified," you are being offered a single cash payment of a full refund of your share of the funds paid into the above-mentioned annuity, less any funds removed." The amount offered was approximately 41% of each of our portion of our annuitization value. In bold print the second paragraph began, "You are not required to accept this relief. Accepting this relief award would result in your receiving an additional cash payment. If you do not wish to accept this payment you should do nothing and not accept the relief offer.Confused, we had our attorney draft a letter for clarification. Response stated our father had logged the complaint. Our father had not even written a check. My sister handled all his business affairs after our mother passed away in 2010. We were advised by our attorney that accepting our "Justified" cash payment would result in the surrender of the balance of our policies. Considering an Allianz annuity? Form your own opinion and beware.Helpful?YesNoLori of Chapala, Jalisco, Other on Aug. 17, 2016Satisfaction RatingAllianz Life insurance Company of North America holds an Annuity we purchased some 30 ago; The fund performed very poorly however we kept it because it had a guaranteed death benefit of $50,000. After my husband turned about 70 Allianz kept trying to put it into annuitization. We kept declining this. In 2015 we notified them that we wanted the maturity date postponed to the 100 year age limit (which now they conveniently have no record of). On July 12 2016 our broker received a letter and form to be signed by husband and I, to postpone annuitization. The form was filled out, dated and signed and returned however it was a couple days late, as the requested response date was 20 July as we were out of the country. In the meantime our broker also received a letter on July 14 stating the annuity had gone into a non-revocable annuitization, which was six days prior to the requested response date, of July 20th. A few days later the first check arrived and was dated August 1; which we have not cashed. We tried many times to reach out and communicate with Allianz and explain that we had indeed filed the paper to postpone the maturity date to the 100 year age limit in 2015; As well as via our broker in 2016. We finally were able to speak with a supervisor (Jamie) who advised us our case would be reviewed by the accommodation committee, after several phone calls; they finally returned a call to us they stated that they would not revoke the decision and return it to annuity status. Because I could not prove we had signed and returned the form which extended the maturity date to the 100 year age limit; as it was sent via regular mail. Allianz states they had sent a request prior to the forced annuitization, which we did not receive. They did not mention the same form to postpone the annuity to the 100 year age limit which was faxed to them by our investment broker July 2016. Seems to us they had already made their decision, (July 14) as no life Insur. Co. wants to pay out the death benefit which is much greater than the market value of annuity. Upon further review, nowhere, on said form does it state the form needs to be returned via registered mail. (however Jamie at Alliance indicated that because it wasn't, we had no recourse) We have also reviewed our original contract, no where do we see anything that states Allianz has the right to put the annuity into forced annuitization without our specific consent to begin receiving monthly payments. (as neither of us have reached the 100 year age limit)We have requested that Allianz provide us a copy of the contract, and specifically indicate where it states we must begin annuitization prior to age 100. Which they have not done so yet. We have discovered Allianz has a bad reputation for trying to take advantage of the elderly. Seems they intimidate and distort facts to confuse people into accepting Allianz's decision. This imposes a hardship on the elderly who rely on the death benefit to cover their final expenses. BAD COMPANY!!!! BEWARE.Helpful?YesNoDeborah of Newberry, FL on July 7, 2016Satisfaction RatingMy father has had an annuity/Life Insurance policy with Allianz since 2012. He has never taken any income from the annuity as of this time. He is in an Assisted Living Facility and is not mentally or physically capable of managing his own finances. In June 2016 I received a letter stating that there had been an address change for his policy. I checked the property tax records for the new address and found that the house belonged to someone with the same name. Considering the fact that you have to provide the account number, previous address, and last 4 of social prior to conducting any business with Allianz, it is inconceivable how this could happen.I then logged onto his account online and the account was there, but the money was GONE!!! I then called the automated customer service number and when I entered his last 4, the computer said there was no record of that number. Then I had to drive 3 hours to have him sitting next to me while he gave them permission to talk with me about the account (he lives by my sister now, but she has a business to run). When we gave the HUMAN on the phone his last 4, she said that # was not associated with the account. After going round and round about the situation, her conclusion was that he was receiving statements on an account that was not his.I believe we have it straightened out now (after about a week). Had he been childless, without an advocate, he would not have found out that he was broke for at least a year. By then, they would have written him off as a senile old man. He would have been kicked out of the ASL facility and placed in a run down government/medicare approved facility, where they pack them in like sardines and the paint is peeling off the walls (I've seen those facilities when he went in for rehab).It is absolutely MIND BLOWING how this could have happened. The employee responsible should have been fired IMMEDIATELY if not put in jail. I reported their actions to Florida Elder Abuse hotline (just to get it on record) and to Florida Dept of Financial Services and submitted a complaint (again to get it on record). If it happened to him, it's happened to others.It will haunt me for years when I remember an old lady in a nursing home my dad had stayed in for rehab. She told me the court assigned someone (an attorney I think), to handle her affairs. She told me, "they took all my money. Now they just move me from one nursing home to another." Her room was barren of personal items except 2 photos. A lifetime of memorabilia was gone. I wrote her off as being senile. Now it saddens me immensely that she may have been telling the truth. So not only does the policy pay an absolute MINIMAL amount of interest (No matter what the broker says), but their handling of customer's retirement savings is REPREHENSIBLE!! The stress they caused my family is INEXCUSABLE!Helpful?YesNoKatherine of Converse, TX on June 25, 2016Consumer Increased Rating!1My savings has finally been returned to me and no overnight delivery fees were applied. Glad to hopefully have this "bad" experience over. Will deposit the check into my credit co. account, and wait for an additional 10 days so my adviser is assured that their dollars are good now. All I can say is...Allianz, what a mess this has been. Katherine of Converse, TX on June 17, 2016Original ReviewStarted with a IRA account that I presume will be doing well! Then proceeded to add another acct, a investment acct... with non-qualified funds. Allianz people added these $$$ to my IRA already started. That, I understood, was a "wrong" thing to do. I caught this when I checked on my accts through computer. The rep at Allianz immediately moved to a different investment acct, 3 days later... but too late, I lost trust that this company is knowledgeable regarding "Other People's Money"... mine.Now, 4 weeks later, and way too many hands touching my funds and way too many calls to "whoever answers the phone". For 3 weeks, all they're keep saying, "these were IRA funds" and now a whole bunch of paperwork is required. Allianz made these $$$ an IRA. Finally, someone named Greta in Customer Relations... was finally "allowing my" $$$ to be mailed to me, the owner of my savings. But, that did not happen! Today, just got off the phone with another rep and he told me funds are allocated to be mailed out on Mon, 6/20/16. A week later than promised by Greta. This time I stated that I want overnight delivery, now am worried that this #1 rated co. will charge for the service, as noted in another critical review... even though... they have caused this whole adventure from hell. All I can say is be very careful before considering Allianz, and I must also add... anyone promoting this "outfit"!Helpful?YesNoAnthony of Dothan, AL on June 11, 2016Satisfaction RatingKenmore is a good company. I have used them before and will always use them.Helpful?YesNoNeal of Clover, SC on June 7, 2016Satisfaction RatingI needed to take a partial surrender from my retirement account for an emergency. I called on two separate occasions, and spoke with two different reps, to verify the information I was given was correct. I was given the same answer from two different people so I was certain at this point that I could move forward with the withdrawal. Without going into great detail, the information I was given was in fact WRONG, and the transaction did not go the way it was planned or the way I was told it would go. Due to INCORRECT info given to me TWICE my account now has a balance of over $38k LESS than should be. This has now created a legal situation on my end due to the incompetence of Allianz and their support team. Just to verify their incompetence, once I received the money and knew what was going on I called to express my concerns and ask how we could reach a resolution. But before that I decided to ask for a third time what the procedure was.Once I was told yet again about their procedure [in detail] I proceeded to tell the guy how it actually happened. His response: "Umm, I actually just told you wrong. That's not how it actually goes. We actually do this..." After I brought him up to speed on everything he assured me a manager would be in touch within 24-48 hrs. Over a week later and I HAD TO CALL THEM BACK and ask what the problem was. It wasn't until then they realized my whole situation was reported to the wrong department! I was again assure someone would definitely be in contact with me again within 24-48 hrs. “GUARANTEED” he said.After 4 days I had to call them back yet again. To this moment, still no resolution!! I am now transferring every dime of my remaining retirement monies from this company and placing it with someone capable of communicating accurate information and will do what they say. No way I want these idiots handling my retirement!! There are far too many choices out there. So, if you're considering Allianz, I recommend you go the other way.Helpful?YesNoCynthia of Antioch, CA on March 23, 2016Satisfaction RatingThe rep gave me a detailed scenario for fixed & variable annuities - what outcome would occur upon receipt & how the fluctuation of the market affects them. The repayment of the funds and early withdrawal penalties were explained in detail. She was VERY patient as I asked many questions in my attempt to understand more fully. She was very clear of the timeline for payment, any withdrawal penalties prior to that time and how their protocol of having that if the need arises.   Helpful?YesNoL of Jacksonville Beach, FL on Feb. 24, 2016Satisfaction RatingI have had an annuity with Allianz for over 4 years. I put the money in; I got a bonus; it grew and didn't lose money. All was good... UNTIL I requested a penalty-free withdrawal. When they received my request they IMMEDIATELY deducted the amount from my balance and they CLAIM they sent me a check... which I never received. Just sent it regular mail - no tracking, no insurance, no signature required. They said I should allow 10 business days for the check to process through US mail. It didn't show up. They offer to stop payment and issue another check - which will take 4 more days - and send the new check the same way: regular mail with no tracking, etc. If I want special handling it will cost extra. If I want the money deposited directly into my bank account it will cost extra. AND of course they will not credit the amount of the missing check back to my account. Don't most checks get subtracted when they are CASHED? Not with Allianz. So the withdrawal was deducted from my account but I still don't have the money and probably won't for who knows how long. Allianz gets the benefit of my money and any interest it earns for a month or more. I WILL get all my money out of this company as soon as possible and I recommend you find another place to put yours.Helpful?YesNoAngelo of Lawrenceville, GA on Feb. 19, 2016Satisfaction RatingI received a 1099-R from Allianz for tax year 2015 that was incorrect. Many attempts via e-mail, phone and US mail have been ignored. A promised response from a supervisor in the policyholder service department was never forthcoming. It has been more than three weeks since I first tried to resolve this matter. They simply 'stone wall' my repeated requests.Helpful?YesNoMary Ellen of Downingtown, PA on Feb. 5, 2016Satisfaction RatingIts Feb. 5 and still no 1099. It's bad enough that I haven't received my paper 1099 yet. This company doesn't even offer the option to get it electronically or by import through Turbo Tax. HELLO! It's 2016. Get on the ball, Allianz.Helpful?YesNoRon of Las Vegas, NV on Dec. 29, 2015Satisfaction RatingIt has been a very good investment for me and my husband in our retirement years. I highly recommend it to all. Comes in very handy for little unexpected cost, like when our a/c went out in the middle of summer and we needed a cans infusion, it was there for us. Nice to know you have it when emergencies come along.Helpful?YesNoStacey of Waterbury, CT on Dec. 27, 2015Satisfaction RatingVery helpful answering questions and offering options. They described at least 10 different ways to better my annuity and helped me by allowing me to withdraw enough to buy a coop and guided me with putting the money back without incurring fees. They also assisted my husband in opening an annuity fund and he has been happy with them as well. The smaller type companies seem to be more compliant than some of the larger ones we have previously dealt with.Helpful?YesNoVonda of Detroit, MI on Dec. 26, 2015Satisfaction RatingI've had no problems. Allianz provides me with statements on a regular basis. When I had a name change due to divorce, there were no hoops to jump through. I also appreciate the ability to change my allocation percentage options annually.Helpful?YesNoLorelei of Akron, OH on Dec. 22, 2015Satisfaction RatingI have several annuities. They're great supplemental income. I highly recommend them and Allianz customer service has been very helpful when I needed to make changes. You Can Get cash, payments, or savings policies.Helpful?YesNoCarl of South Orange, NJ on Dec. 19, 2015Satisfaction RatingOffers a high yield indexed fund that is based on market performance. Payments are calculated on a yearly change of market indexes. When the index is lower on the anniversary date than the previous year's anniversary date, no payments are issued. The percentage increase over the previous year less 1.5 percent is added to your principal. After ten years of investing and contributing to the fund, there will be a lifetime monthly payment that is calculated based on what has been accumulated.Helpful?YesNoKate of Menomonee Falls, WI on Dec. 15, 2015Satisfaction RatingIn general my annuity experience is positive. The one aspect of the Allianz annuity I do not like is the way it credits increases. It is based on the S&P 500 like many annuities. This one resets each year on the anniversary date which is fine. What I do not like is how the increased is figured. Each month on the monthly anniversary date the increase or decrease in the market is noted. Decreases have no limit when the market is down. Increases are limited to, this year, 2.6% of the market. In an up and down economy like we have now, one month's loss can take 5-6 months to recoup if the market does really well those months. Helpful?YesNoJohn of Steelville, MO on Dec. 13, 2015Satisfaction RatingI have had it for a long time! Just sits there earning! I have never looked around for another annuity! My wife has one, but I can't remember which company! Annuities are nice to have and I feel they are a safe bet!Helpful?YesNoMary of Clermont, FL on Dec. 11, 2015Satisfaction RatingBought 10 years ago when offered a nice bonus. Company no longer runs this bonus but it was easy to purchase. The rep was helpful. Easy to collect yearly payouts.Helpful?YesNoJeff of Chester, PA on Dec. 7, 2015Satisfaction RatingThey are very helpful explaining all my options and deciding what's best for me. Low deposits, low rewards, low risks. Steady and slow was the way to go for me. Others may be different.Helpful?YesNoExpert ReviewConsumerAffairs Research TeamThe ConsumerAffairs Research Team believes everyone deserves to make smart decisions.

            Annuities are often touted as an investment, but they actually work more like an insurance policy. When you buy an annuity, you pay a company a set amount of money and are guaranteed to get a lump sum of cash every month for the rest of your life.The complicated part is figuring out whether or not buying an annuity makes sense for you. There are a lot of extra costs with an annuity versus a traditional investment portfolio, but you may be eligible for tax benefits.

        	Top
        	ExpensesAnnuities have a reputation for becoming accompanied by hefty fees. While certain costs are to be expected, consumers should clearly understand them before purchase.Surrender fees: Be sure to understand the surrender fee that will be paid if the money is taken out of the annuity before the contract time period is up.
                                    Commissions: Similar to investment products, annuities are bought and sold on the market, and an advisor or agent makes a commission from the sale. This charge is paid by the consumer.
                                    Monthly fees: Annuity monies are invested, often in mutual funds. These funds usually incur fund management fees, and the costs are passed on to the consumer.
                                    Funding optionsThe initial funds used to purchase an annuity can come from many sources. There are also ways to add to an annuity once it has been created.Single payment: The simplest option for consumers who have a lump sum of money and want to put it into an annuity is to write a check or wire the money to the company.
                                    Series of payments: Some annuities allow consumers to initially fund the account with a small amount of money and then add to the principle periodically. This is a form of saving while growing money for retirement.
                                    Social Security: Consumers can choose to reduce their Social Security benefits in the near term and use the savings for an annuity for the long term. Consumers should carefully consult a financial advisor regarding this option.
                                    Investment optionsAnnuity funds are invested in various markets. Depending on the type of annuity, consumers can have more or less control over the underlying investment options.Immediate annuities: An immediate annuity offers, as the name implies, immediate results. You make a lump sum payment and immediately (or almost immediately) begin to get a guaranteed monthly payment. Immediate annuities generally are paid out for the rest of your life, but they can also be paid out over another set period of time that you specify.
                                    Fixed annuities: When you buy a fixed annuity, your rate is locked in for a guaranteed amount of time ranging from one to ten years. Your rate might still fluctuate, but it will never go below the amount you set with your fixed annuity. This type of annuity is good for people who want a low-risk insurance plan and aren’t concerned about growing their annuity.
                                    Variable annuities: A variable annuity is spread out over several investment accounts, making it similar to a mutual fund. Generally, variable annuities are not advised since The return on the account is based on the performance of these funds and not on a fixed amount. However, it does make sense in certain situations, especially if you are open to risky investments for the potential of a high return and you already have a vibrant investment portfolio.
                                    Equity indexed annuity: An equity-indexed annuity combines the best of fixed and variable annuities by offering a fixed rate and payments while tying your money to an index to allow for a higher growth potential than a regular fixed annuity.
                                    Payout optionsWhen purchasing an annuity, the consumer can choose how the future payments will be made.Guaranteed period: This option provides a guaranteed number of payments. Upon death, the payments continue to a beneficiary for a set period of time.
                                    Lifetime payments: The guaranteed payment in this case is for the lifetime of the annuity holder only. This option provides no survivor benefits. Lifetime payments may be appropriate for those with no beneficiaries.
                                    Survivor payments: Popular with married couples, this type of payment will continue for the life of the holder and, upon death, will then continue for the life of the beneficiary as well.
                                    Withdrawal optionsThere are several ways to withdraw money from an annuity. However, there are also many fees and penalties associated if the money is withdrawn before the age of 59 1/2. Consumers should be sure they clearly understand all the tax and other financial implications of withdrawals.Annuitization: This options converts the current value of the annuity into a stream of payments. It provides a guarantee of steady income for the life of the annuitant or can provide steady income to beneficiaries after death of the annuitant, based on a chosen time period. Payments can be made using a fixed amount or a variable amount.
                                    Systematic withdrawal: With this option, the consumer chooses how much and when payments will be made. This can include withdrawing only the earnings or withdrawing the principal and the earnings. However, there is no guarantee of payments for life when making withdrawals.
                                    Lump sum: It's possible to take the entire lump sum of an annuity's value; however, the investment gain will be taxed as ordinary income. If withdrawal is made before age 59 1/2, penalties will also be due.
                                    Company stabilityThe FDIC does not back annuities, so if the insurance company goes out of business, there won't be any payouts. There are some state guarantees, but consumers should be sure they work with a strong and reputable financial company to protect their investments.Credit quality: Most companies with high ratings from the major financial rating services will readily present this information. If it's not obvious, consumers should research the company using the major rating agencies.
                                    Financial strength: In addition to ratings, the number of assets under management and the cash reserves available can make a statement about the strength of a company and its annuity payment ability.
                                    Company history: A company's history is a good place to start when researching its stability. Consumers should find out details such as how long the company has been in business and how may annuities it has underwritten.
                                    What are different types of annuities?
        	Top
        	Fixed annuityA fixed annuity sets a guaranteed payout for the rest of the beneficiary's life. Fixed annuities can provide predictability and a steady income during retirement.Variable annuityA variable annuity's payout stream is determined by the performance of an underlying investment. Variable annuities provide growth potential.Indexed annuityA combination of a fixed and a variable annuity is known as an indexed annuity. The annuitant receives a guaranteed minimum payout while the rest of the payment varies along with the underlying investment's performance.Immediate annuityImmediate annuities begin to pay a short period after the investment is made. These can be fixed or variable.Deferred annuityAny money earned by investing in a deferred annuity will be accumulated until payout is set to begin. Deferred annuities can be fixed or variable and can be converted to immediate annuities once payout is desired.Who's it for?
        	Top
        	SaversAnnuities are an option for consumers who want to let their money grow and at the same time avert taxes on the income. These consumers are usually confident that they will not need to access their money for a long period of time and reasonably expect to outlive their savings.Savers plus income generatorsThis group of consumers want both the ability to grow income and still have access to assets. They often include consumers nearing retirement age.RetireesFor those who are now living from their savings, an annuity can create a predictable and guaranteed stream of income for life. Consumers often use this income to cover essential retirement living expenses.Social Security recipientsConsumers who have Social Security or pension plan income may want to use an annuity to supplement these sources.Company reviews

Minneapolis-based Allianz Life Insurance Company of North America (Allianz Life) provides annuities and life insurance products in the United States[1] in all states except for New York. In New York, annuities and life insurance products are offered by Allianz Life Insurance Company of New York (Allianz Life of NY).
Allianz Life offers various products, including fixed and variable annuities and life insurance. These products are offered through a network of more than 100,000 agents nationwide.
The company is a principal subsidiary of Allianz SE, a global financial services group that is the 31st largest corporation in the world based on revenue (Fortune Global 500, July 2013).[2] Allianz SE employs nearly 155,000 people worldwide.
History[edit]
Allianz Life Insurance Company of North America began as North American Casualty, started by Henry Little of Minneapolis, Minnesota in 1896. North American Casualty then merged with North American Life Association – founded in 1910 by Zeke Austin with capital from Henry Little – in 1912 to become North American Life and Casualty (NALAC). H.P. Skoglund served as NALAC’s CEO for 44 years.
In 1979, NALAC was acquired by Allianz AG of Munich, Germany, becoming a company of the Allianz Group. Founded in 1890, the Allianz Group is now one of the world’s largest integrated financial services organizations with asset management, life, health and property-casualty insurance, and banking operations in more than 70 countries.
The company was renamed Allianz Life Insurance Company of North America (Allianz Life) in 1993. Today, Allianz Life and Allianz Life of NY are the only Allianz Group subsidiaries providing life insurance in the U.S.[3]
In 2010, Allianz Life was recognized by the Minneapolis Star Tribune as one of the top 100 workplaces in the Twin Cities, ranking fifth on the list of top public companies.[4] Allianz Life was also honored in 2010 as one of Minneapolis/St. Paul Business Journal’s Best Places to Work winners, ranking eight on the list of large companies with more than 1,000 full-time Minnesota employees.[5]

Minneapolis-based Allianz Life Insurance Company of North America (Allianz Life) provides annuities and life insurance products in the United States[1] in all states except for New York. In New York, annuities and life insurance products are offered by Allianz Life Insurance Company of New York (Allianz Life of NY).
Allianz Life offers various products, including fixed and variable annuities and life insurance. These products are offered through a network of more than 100,000 agents nationwide.
The company is a principal subsidiary of Allianz SE, a global financial services group that is the 31st largest corporation in the world based on revenue (Fortune Global 500, July 2013).[2] Allianz SE employs nearly 155,000 people worldwide.
History[edit]
Allianz Life Insurance Company of North America began as North American Casualty, started by Henry Little of Minneapolis, Minnesota in 1896. North American Casualty then merged with North American Life Association – founded in 1910 by Zeke Austin with capital from Henry Little – in 1912 to become North American Life and Casualty (NALAC). H.P. Skoglund served as NALAC’s CEO for 44 years.
In 1979, NALAC was acquired by Allianz AG of Munich, Germany, becoming a company of the Allianz Group. Founded in 1890, the Allianz Group is now one of the world’s largest integrated financial services organizations with asset management, life, health and property-casualty insurance, and banking operations in more than 70 countries.
The company was renamed Allianz Life Insurance Company of North America (Allianz Life) in 1993. Today, Allianz Life and Allianz Life of NY are the only Allianz Group subsidiaries providing life insurance in the U.S.[3]
In 2010, Allianz Life was recognized by the Minneapolis Star Tribune as one of the top 100 workplaces in the Twin Cities, ranking fifth on the list of top public companies.[4] Allianz Life was also honored in 2010 as one of Minneapolis/St. Paul Business Journal’s Best Places to Work winners, ranking eight on the list of large companies with more than 1,000 full-time Minnesota employees.[5]

North American Casualty then merged with North American Life Association – founded in 1910 by Zeke Austin with capital from Henry Little – in 1912 to become North American Life and Casualty (NALAC). H.P. Skoglund served as NALAC’s CEO for 44 years.
In 1979, NALAC was acquired by Allianz AG of Munich, Germany, becoming a company of the Allianz Group. Founded in 1890, the Allianz Group is now one of the world’s largest integrated financial services organizations with asset management, life, health and property-casualty insurance, and banking operations in more than 70 countries.
The company was renamed Allianz Life Insurance Company of North America (Allianz Life) in 1993. Today, Allianz Life and Allianz Life of NY are the only Allianz Group subsidiaries providing life insurance in the U.S.[3]
In 2010, Allianz Life was recognized by the Minneapolis Star Tribune as one of the top 100 workplaces in the Twin Cities, ranking fifth on the list of top public companies.[4] Allianz Life was also honored in 2010 as one of Minneapolis/St. Paul Business Journal’s Best Places to Work winners, ranking eight on the list of large companies with more than 1,000 full-time Minnesota employees.[5]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
