        Public Company

      Winmark Corporation pioneered what the company calls the
      "ultra-high-value" retailing niche. High quality used
      products are sold alongside new goods in a traditional retail store
      format. The rapidly growing company began with Play It Again Sports, which
      is ranked among the largest sporting-goods chains in the United States,
      with 410 stores in 2005. Its other three franchised businesses are Once
      Upon A Child (with 208 stores), Plato's Closet (with 133 stores),
      and Music Go Round (with 40 stores). All of these operations buy, sell,
      trade, and consign used and new merchandise. In addition, Winmark also
      offers business services, including equipment leasing, under the name
      Winmark Business Solutions.
    



      Origins
    

      Martha Morris was inspired to develop the Play It Again Sports concept in
      1983 when she had trouble reselling a nearly new $200 backpack. She
      borrowed $15,000 from a friend's parents, and the two women started
      a used sporting equipment store in a vacated tombstone shop near a
      Minneapolis cemetery. Morris bought out her friend within a few months.
      Boosted by local television coverage, she sold about $120,000 of used
      equipment during her first year of business. Initially she sold everything
      on consignment, but she later began buying used equipment outright and
      selling new goods, such as sales representative samples, last
      year's models, and retailers' out-of-season equipment.
    

      Financial success and customer feedback told Morris the idea could work
      elsewhere, so in mid-1988 she went to a franchise development consulting
      firm for help. K. Jeffrey Dahlberg and Ronald G. Olson, the owners of
      Franchise Business Systems, Inc. (FBS), had their doubts at first about
      the potential for a used sporting goods chain. In a 1994 
      
        Fortune
      
       magazine article Olson said, "Her store looked like a garage sale
      with hours." Nevertheless, the numbers showed them she was also
      pulling in a lot of business, so FBS took her on as a client.
    

      The Minneapolis 
      
        Star Tribune
      
       for March 8, 1992, Dick Youngblood wrote, "Her instincts were
      bull's-eye accurate. Despite limited capital, the business grew in
      18 months to 19 franchise operations in six states, taking 1989 revenues
      to more than $800,000, which included sales at the two stores Morris owned
      then plus the franchise and royalty fees. Sales of the franchised stores
      alone totaled $1.3 million." Dahlberg and Olson used their combined
      expertise to polish the entrepreneurial nugget into a gemstone.
    

      Dahlberg acquired his franchising know-how in his family-run hearing-aid
      business. He began developing the Miracle Ear Centers network when he was
      named president of Dahlberg, Inc. in 1983. However, the combination of
      uneven earnings and franchise startup costs of $10 to $15 million caused
      friction with his father and a power struggle with a group of California
      investment firms that held 20 percent of the company stock. In 1986, only
      a few months after being named CEO of Dahlberg, Inc., he left the company.
    

      A friend introduced Dahlberg to Olson, who had 20 years of retail
      experience with companies such as Dayton Hudson Corporation and on his
      own. The two men formed FBS in 1986 as a franchise development, marketing,
      and investment firm.
       Among the franchise systems they helped build were a 250-store eye-care
      chain and a 100-store dry-cleaning chain. Olson was left to run the
      day-to-day business of the consulting firm, while Dahlberg reconciled with
      his father and returned to lead the hearing-aid business in 1988.
    



      Play It Again Sports in 1990s
    

      In 1990, Dahlberg and Olson bought the franchising operation of Play It
      Again Sports for more than $1 million plus five years of royalty payments.
      Dahlberg became chairman and Olson served as president and CEO of the
      company. The next year, Morris decided to sell them her three retail
      stores as well, but she signed on as a consultant. By the end of 1991, 134
      Play It Again Sports franchise stores were open in 41 states and Canada.
    

      In January 1992, Dahlberg and Olson purchased Sports Traders, Inc., an
      independent wholesaler owned by Jim Van Buskirk, an early owner of Play It
      Again Sports. Van Buskirk acquired a 50 percent interest in the first
      Morris store in 1986, but the next year he left to develop his own Play It
      Again Sports stores. The wholesale business he started supplied both his
      and Morris's stores with new goods to supplement the selection of
      used sporting equipment purchased from the public. As part of the purchase
      agreement, Van Buskirk's Play It Again Sports stores continued to
      operate separately from the growing franchise system.
    

      Play It Again Sports franchises were being sold at a rapid pace. Dahlberg
      and Olson were able to draw from a pool of middle managers displaced by
      corporate downsizing. The men believed the Play It Again Sports concept
      could be translated into other retail areas and began acquiring
      successfully established businesses in the used goods market. In November
      1992, Dahlberg and Olson purchased franchising and royalty rights from
      Once Upon A Child, Inc., a Columbus, Ohio-based, 22-store chain selling
      children's clothing, furniture, and toys. The chain had been
      started by local retailers Dennis and Lynn Blum in 1985.
    

      Dahlberg resigned as president and CEO of Dahlberg, Inc. at the end of
      1992 in order to devote himself full time to the expanding Play It Again
      Sports business. Dahlberg, Inc., its sales and earnings boosted by the
      franchise system Dahlberg had built, was sold to Bausch & Lomb in
      1993 for $138 million.
    



      A Name Change in 1993
    

      In February 1993, Olson and Dahlberg opened the first corporate-owned Once
      Upon A Child store. All of their 16 Twin Cities franchises were sold
      before mid-year. Also in 1993, the company purchased assets of Hi Tech
      Consignments, a musical instrument and audio equipment retailer (renamed
      Music Go Round) and Computer Renaissance, Inc., a retailer of close-out
      and used computers. In recognition of the changes, Play It Again Sports
      Franchise Corp. was renamed Grow Biz International, Inc.
    

      In August 1993, an initial public offering (IPO) was announced: 1.6
      million common shares at $10 per share. The Grow Biz stock price jumped to
      $15 per share during the first trading day. The company raised about $16.7
      million from the IPO. Revenues for 1993 increased 89 percent over the
      previous year to $51.8 million. By the end of the year, 490 stores were
      open in the United States and Canada; eight of those stores were owned by
      the corporation. An additional 282 franchises had been awarded for future
      opening.
    

      In the 
      
        Twin Cities Business Monthly
      
       for December 1993, Gillian Judge wrote, "The company's
      recent rapid growth hasn't been without repercussions, and some of
      the newest franchisees of Once Upon A Child shops grumble that the system
      has some kinks to work out before it runs as well as Play It Again
      Sports." In order to bolster franchise support Grow Biz began to
      decentralize operations. During 1994, the company began individualizing
      concept support and leadership.
    

      Grow Biz's 1994 revenues grew to $83.6 million; net income was $1.4
      million, a 300 percent increase over the previous year. The first Canadian
      Once Upon A Child store was among the record 243 Grow Biz stores opened in
      1994. The company added a fifth business concept that year, compact disc
      stores. Grow Biz purchased assets, franchising, and royalty rights of CDX
      Audio Development, Inc., of Green Bay, Wisconsin, which operated 43 CD
      Exchange stores.
    

      In 1994, the company topped both 
      
        Fortune
      
       and 
      
        Inc.
      
       magazines' lists of the fastest-growing American public companies.
      According to 
      
        Fortune,
      
       Grow Biz had experienced an annual growth rate of 285 percent in terms of
      total revenues over the past five years. In an 
      
        Investor's Business Daily
      
       article by Claire Mencke, Olson pointed out that initially the
      company's rapid growth was unexpected. "But it happened that
      we brought together a lot of trends: value pricing starting with the used
      product, the trend in recycling, and the availability of a lot of
      strip-shopping center real estate."
    

      Despite the acclaim, 1994 also had its bleaker moments. Grow Biz stock
      price fell by 15.7 percent in October when lower-than-expected third
      quarter earnings were announced. According to an October 22, 1994 
      
        Star Tribune
      
       article, the earnings' setback was caused by a reduction in the
      projected number of store openings for the year, due to a tight strip-mall
      real estate market and losses related to foreign investments.
    


        Company Perspectives:
      


          Winmark Corporation develops, franchises and operates value oriented
          retail concepts for stores that buy, sell, trade and consign quality
          used and new merchandise. Each franchise emphasizes the ultimate in
          consumer value by offering high quality used merchandise at
          substantial savings, and by purchasing or accepting as trade
          customers' used goods that have been outgrown or are no longer
          used. New merchandise is offered to supplement the selection of used
          goods.
        



      The company had begun to franchise Play It Again Sports stores
      internationally in 1991. In 1993, Grow Biz entered into joint venture
      agreements to franchise stores in Europe and Mexico. However toward
      year-end 1994, Grow Biz withdrew from the Mexican market, closing both of
      its corporate-owned stores. The company also suffered losses in its
      corporate-owned German venture, but the franchised stores there continued
      to operate.
    

      In 
      
        Corporate Report Minnesota
      
       for April 1995, Lee Schafer noted that the Play It Again Sports
      franchises were moneymakers for their owners, a situation that was
      atypical of the franchise environment at the time. However, Schafer
      pointed out that analysts had some reservations about the other concepts.
      The computer stores faced uncertainty related to rapidly changing
      technology, the strength of franchisees among the kids clothes and toys
      concept was being questioned, and the disc businesses faced stiff
      competition from new disc sellers. Olson disputed this and said in the
      same article that Grow Biz was "concentrating on becoming
      operationally strong" in all five concept areas.
    

      Grow Biz gave its franchisees support and assistance in the following
      areas: advertising and marketing, centralized buying and warehouse
      services, point-of-sale computerized information systems, management
      training, and store opening assistance. It also provided periodic field
      support visits. The franchisees were generally required to comply with
      guidelines regarding store design, the use of television advertising
      focusing on the buy-sell concept, and standardized merchandise purchasing
      processes. An initial franchise fee cost $20,000. Franchisees also paid an
      annual royalty of 3 to 5 percent of gross revenues.
    

      Grow Biz more than doubled the size of its distribution facilities in 1995
      and consolidated operations at its headquarters. Revenues for 1995 topped
      $100 million, while net income climbed 47 percent to $2 million. Royalty
      revenue jumped 51 percent to $11.6 million. By year-end 1995, a total of
      1,311 franchises had been awarded: 965 stores were open, including 57
      stores in Canada, eight in Europe, and one in Australia.
    

      In early 1995, all the Grow Biz concepts except Music Go Round were ranked
      first in their categories in 
      
        Entrepreneur
      
       magazine's Annual Franchise 500. Music Go Round, the smallest of
      the five Grow Biz concepts with 11 U.S. stores in operation, generated $4
      million in revenues in 1995. Customers ranged from parents seeking a place
      to buy or sell musical instruments for their children to professional
      musicians upgrading their equipment.
    

      Among Computer Renaissance's best customers were first-time
      computer buyers and sellers and small business owners. The company also
      purchased used computers from corporations upgrading their systems and
      from liquidators. Only about 20 percent of store inventory was new. Unlike
      the other Grow Biz concepts, which typically purchased used goods ready
      for resale, the corporation refurbished used computers and provided
      franchise operations with technical assistance. Revenues for the 64 U.S.
      and Canadian stores in operation in 1995 were $23 million.
    

      Compact disc industry sales grew by 33.6 percent in 1994, according to
      company figures. With Disc Go Round, Grow Biz was positioning itself to
      capitalize on the strength of the relatively new industry plus the growing
      CD-ROM market. Disc Go Round's 1995 revenues were $17 million, and
      all of its 99 stores in operation were in the United States and Canada.
      The typical franchisee and customer were younger than those of the other
      Grow Biz concepts.
    

      Once Upon A Child stores targeted parents with children under 12 years of
      age. "Gently-used" items, which were sold for one-third to
      one-half of the new retail price, made up about 80 percent of the Once
      Upon A Child product mix in 1995. The 164 stores open that year generated
      $37 million in sales. In contrast, Play It Again Sports had 674 stores in
      operation in 1995 and generated $255 million in revenues.
    

      In 1998, a new franchise concept, ReTool, was launched. ReTool focused on
      buying and reselling used and reconditioned tools. In much the same manner
      as the other Grow Biz franchises, ReTool aimed at the typical consumer
      looking to sell tools he no longer needed and buy tools he did need at a
      discount.
    

      Olson said a May 1996 article by Susan Reda in 
      
        Stores
      
       that Grow Biz "raised the bar in terms of consumers'
      expectations" of used goods. He went on to say,
      "There's no longer a stigma attached to buying used
      items."
    



      Changes in the 21st Century
    

      Grow Biz had seen a growth in the number of stores in the 1990s, but that
      growth was apparently too fast. In 2000, the company showed a loss of
      $350,700. The 2000s saw big changes at the company. John Morgan acquired
      control of Grow Biz in 2000. A former partner in Winthrop Leasing, Morgan
      had sold his company and retired in 1999. However, retirement did not suit
      him and Morgan looked around for new business opportunities. As the chief
      executive officer, Morgan brought in a new management team to run the
      company. Jeffrey Dahlberg and Ron Olson, while not involved in operations,
      each continued to own 20 percent of the company's stock, while
      Morgan owned another 20 percent. In 2001, Grow Biz was renamed Winmark
      Corporation.
    

      Among the changes instituted by Morgan to revive the company was to close
      down the ailing Disc Go Round and Computer Renaissance franchises in 2000.
      The ReTool franchise was shut down in late 2001. The concept had never
      worked out as well as expected. As Morgan told John Hoogesteger in 
      
        CityBusiness
      
       for December 7, 2001, "People don't normally sell old
      tools. Even tools they rarely use they keep around in case they need them
      at some point." In the three years the franchise was in operation,
      only 17 stores had been opened. Weaker stores in the other franchises were
      also shut down during this period of reorganization. In 2002, Winmark
      began purchasing an interest in Archiver's, a photography service
      provider specializing in preserving old photographs. By early 2004,
      Winmark owned nearly 20 percent of the company's stock.
    


        Key Dates:

          The company's name is changed to Winmark Corporation.
        


            2003:
          


          Winmark Business Solutions is launched.
        



      Winmark's new Plato's Closet franchise, retailing used
      clothing for the teenage market, was a success. Developed by the same
      couple who had come up with Once Upon A Child, Dennis and Lynn Blum, the
      franchise name was suggested by their son, who had been studying the Greek
      philosopher in
       school. Focusing on "gently-used" trendy clothing not yet
      out of style in the rapidly changing teen market, each Plato's
      Closet store was between 2,500 to 3,200 square feet in size and contained
      some 98 percent used clothing and 2 percent new clothing. Most prices were
      some 70 percent below the new merchandise price. By 2005, there were over
      130 Plato's Closet stores in operation.
    

      The financial picture for Winmark improved dramatically in the first five
      years of the 21st century. With the closing of stores that were not
      performing, the company saw a profit of $3.2 million in 2001. This trend
      continued in the following years: $3.8 million profit in 2002, $4 million
      in 2003, and almost $4.1 million in 2004. In the first quarter of 2005,
      Winmark posted a net income of nearly $700,000. According to Neal St.
      Anthony in the 
      
        Star Tribune
      
       for April 13, 2004, since Morgan took over the company, Winmark's
      "performance has turned around and the return on equity has
      averaged more than 30 percent annually." By March 2005, Winmark
      operated a total of 791 stores in North America.
    

      In 2003, Winmark expanded its activities to become a service supplier to
      franchise owners and small business in general with the launch of Winmark
      Business Solutions (WBS), a free service that offered small business
      owners negotiated discount pricing from such vendors as accountants,
      office supply retailers, printers, and Web designers. WBS also leased
      equipment to small businesses. Under this arrangement, a business owner
      could choose the type of equipment needed and a particular vendor, and WBS
      would purchase that item and lease it to him. The lease deal allowed the
      business owner to free his cash for other purposes. The business concept
      was similar to that followed by Morgan's old company, Winthrop
      Leasing. While the leasing business was still a small part of
      Winmark's financial picture, company officers were optimistic about
      its future as a complement to the firm's franchising operations in
      the used goods market. While Winmark's success could propel more
      franchisers to develop competing national used product chains, the company
      was banking on its growing name recognition to help it continue to draw
      consumers to buy and sell merchandise and on potential franchisees to
      choose their concepts over other options.
