Corded Phones
Corded Classics
Our classic telephones combine familiar design and sturdy construction.   They’re easy to use and easy to hear, as they feature real bell ringers and are compatible with hearing aids.  These reliable phones don’t need an electrical outlet, so they still work even if the power goes out.  Plus, all of our classic wall telephones come with a 12 foot handset cord.
Corded Signature Series™
Built exclusively for QLT Consumer Lease Services, our Signature Series™ telephones combine classic styling with an updated look and added features for your convenience.   Select from a variety of colors to match the décor in your home. And all of our Signature Series™ telephones come with a 12 foot handset cord.
Corded Feature Phones
If you are looking for a corded telephone with more functionality than the Classics, one of our Feature Phones may be just what you are looking for.
Cordless Phones
Cordless Phones
Enjoy the freedom of a cordless telephone.   Carry the phone with you inside or outside your home.   Cordless phones are ideal for people who don’t want to get up every time the phone rings.   With many convenient features form which to choose, you’re certain to find a model that meets your needs.
Telephone Add-Ons
These products work with your existing telephone to provide additional features for your convenience.

      QLT Inc. is a biotechnology company that develops and markets photodynamic
      therapeutic products—drugs that are activated by exposure to light.
      The company has a history of developing treatments for cancer, but its
      greatest commercial success is Visudyne, a light-activated treatment for
      age-related macular degeneration, the leading cause of blindness in people
      over age 50. Other pharmaceutical products in the company's
      development pipeline include treatments for prostate cancer, skin cancer,
      and male pattern baldness. The acquisition of Atrix Laboratories in 2004
      gave QLT a second marketable pharmaceutical product named Eligard, which
      is a treatment for advanced prostate cancer.
    


        Origins
      


      Without question, the single most influential figure in QLT's
      history was Dr. Julia Levy, whose pioneering scientific work achieved
      commercial success when she was forced to trade her lab coat for the
      attire of a chief executive officer. Levy was born Julia Coppens in 1934,
      beginning her life in Singapore, where her father worked as an executive
      for a Dutch bank. Levy's father, Guillaume Coppens, sent his wife
      and two daughters to stay with relatives in British Columbia, Canada, on
      the eve of World War II, fearing for his family's safety. Guillaume
      Coppens's anxiety was justified; he was captured by the Japanese
      and interned in Indonesia, surviving the ordeal but devastated by the
      experience. He joined his family in British Columbia after the war, unable
      to work for the remainder of his life. "My recollection of my life
      was: 'Don't upset your father,'" Levy
      reflected in a July 23, 2003 interview with 
      
        Contemporary Canadian Biographies
      
      .
    

      Levy's mother, who served as the motivation for QLT's
      greatest commercial success, supported the family by working as a
      physiotherapist. After high school, Levy spent a year serving as a file
      clerk at BC Hydro to supplement the scholarships she had earned to attend
      the University of British Columbia, where she studied microbiology and
      immunology. After earning her undergraduate degree in 1955, Levy went
      overseas to obtain her doctorate, attending the University of
      London's National Institute for Medical Research. She earned her
      Ph.D. in experimental pathology in 1959 and returned to the University of
      British Columbia, where she began conducting research on cancer.
    

      After her first marriage ended in divorce, Levy married a physicist at the
      University of British Columbia named Edwin Levy. The couple married in
      1969 and several years later purchased a holiday property on Sonora Island
      in British Columbia, where they planned to build a cottage. It was the
      turning point in Levy's career. After a decade of conducting
      research, Levy had little to show for her efforts, at least in comparison
      to what she produced after she handed a machete to her son Ben and asked
      him to clear the weeds on the property. Ben, who was born during
      Levy's first marriage, was seven years old at the time, and he took
      to the task with zeal, slashing away at the underbrush with what amounted
      to a sword. Ben came across some cow parsley and hacked away at it with
      sufficient enthusiasm to cover his skin in fluid from the plant.
      "It was a hot day," Ben remembered in a July 6, 1996
      interview with the 
      
        Vancouver Sun
      
      , describing the fateful day on Sonora Island. "The sun came out,
      and all of a sudden, I just started blistering everywhere, especially on
      my arms."
    

      When Levy returned to work, she asked her colleagues at the University of
      British Columbia about what might have caused her son's skin to
      blister. She learned that a substance in cow parsley's 
       leaves can attack and destroy certain kinds of tissue, skin cells
      included, but only when activated by exposure to light. Levy was intrigued
      and began thinking about the potential of photo-activated drugs, embarking
      on research that would lead to her co-invention of photodynamic therapy
      (PDT). Levy's work focused on a two-step process that began with
      the intravenous injection of a drug. After the drug entered the
      patient's bloodstream, it collected where abnormal blood vessels
      were being formed. Once the drug was concentrated around the flawed blood
      vessels, it was activated by a dose of non-thermal laser light, triggering
      a process that destroyed abnormal cells.
    

      While Levy's scientific research found a pioneering and focused
      direction, her work with a team of researchers at the University of
      British Columbia centered on studying antibodies for treating various
      forms of cancer. Guiding a drug through development, the various stages of
      regulatory approval, and through numerous clinical trials represented one
      of the most arduous and time-consuming achievements in the business world,
      a monumental task that was even more challenging for the research team in
      Vancouver. In the beginning of the 1980s, the Canadian biotechnology
      industry did not exist. At the time, the only way to produce a drug was to
      sell the rights to a foreign pharmaceutical company. Levy and her
      colleagues turned to the University of British Columbia for support, but
      the university refused. With nowhere else to turn, and wishing to remain
      in control of their discoveries, the research team decided to start their
      own business. In 1981, Levy mortgaged her house to come up with $50,000, a
      sum matched by her cofounders, John Brown, Jim Miller, Anthony Phillips,
      and Ron MacKenzie. They named their company Quadra Logic Technologies,
      renting one room above a bakery to house their office and laboratory. Each
      of the founders continued to work at the university, unable to draw a
      salary from their fledgling venture, and conducted their research above
      the bakery during off hours.
    

      In many respects, Quadra Logic, or QLT as the company eventually became
      known, served as Levy's vehicle to deliver her scientific findings
      to the commercial market. Starting out in 1981, however, Levy and her
      colleagues were many years away from enjoying any commercial success. The
      path describing a drug's progression from discovery through
      development, regulatory approval, and commercialization promised to be an
      unnerving journey—particularly for a group not versed in the
      intricacies of clearing regulatory and clinical hurdles. Because the
      market in the United States was integral to the company's success,
      approval needed to be obtained from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
      (FDA), requiring a process that Levy later described as akin to playing
      "Russian Roulette," as quoted in the October 22, 2002 issue
      of 
      
        Canadian Chemical News.
      
       "And that's really ugly because you're not the
      master of your fate," she added.
    


        Photofrin in the Mid-1980s
      


      The young QLT scored its first success with a drug that already had begun
      progressing along the path toward commercialization. Levy convinced her
      partners to acquire the rights to Photofrin, a light-activated drug in the
      midst of clinical trials as a cancer treatment. In 1986, QLT formed an
      alliance with a larger pharmaceutical company—something nearly
      every small biotechnology company like QLT needed to do to survive. The
      company reached an agreement with American Cyanamid to co-develop
      Photofrin, brokering a deal that gave it equity, which enabled it to fund
      the drug's development. The alliance was important for another
      reason because American Cyanamid, practiced in the vagaries of drug
      development and clinical trials, provided the QLT team with an invaluable
      tutorial in shepherding a drug through to commercialization. "That
      was a very fortunate experience for us," Levy reflected in an
      October 2002 interview with 
      
        Canadian Chemical News
      
      . "Because with biotechnology companies they'll take the
      science forward to a certain level and then they'll license it out
      to a large pharma company, and the pharma company (will) say,
      'Thank you very much, we'll see you later,' and does
      the development."
    

      The partnership ended before Photofrin gained approval, but it ended on
      beneficial terms for QLT. American Cyanamid was acquired by another
      company in the early 1990s, which gave the rights to Photofrin back to
      QLT, which by that point had another drug in its development pipeline. The
      idea for the drug came from Levy, who drew her inspiration for developing
      photodynamic therapy from her son and her motivation for creating what
      would be her career's crowning achievement from her mother.
    


        The Development of Visudyne in the 1990s
      


      During the mid-1980s, Levy's mother began to lose her sight. She
      was diagnosed with age-related macular degeneration, an incurable
      deterioration of the central portion of the retina and the leading cause
      of blindness in people over the age of 50. Levy had spent her entire
      career studying cancer and she noticed a similarity between macular
      degeneration and her chosen field of study: both diseases manifested
      themselves by forming new, abnormal tissue.
    

      Levy's mother suffered from "wet" macular
      degeneration, in which flawed blood vessels bleed under the retina,
      damaging the light-sensitive membrane at the back of the eye. Levy focused
      her work on developing a drug that targeted the abnormal blood vessels and
      destroyed them when activated by light, eventually creating QLT's
      defining pharmaceutical product, Visudyne.
    


        Company Perspectives:
      


          QLT has the capability to maximize all the exciting products in our
          development pipeline and leverage our unique drug delivery
          technologies. We are also actively seeking to expand our pipeline
          through both in-house development and external alliances. Combining
          the best in science and business, all of us at QLT are committed to
          helping enrich the lives of thousands of patients.
        



      The development of Visudyne became a crusade of sorts for Levy, one whose
      success was jeopardized when QLT's partnership with American
      Cyanamid was terminated. Between 1992 and 1995, the company's
      survival was at stake as it sought to navigate on its own. Levy recalled
      the period in her October 2002 interview with 
      
        Canadian Chemical News
      
      , remembering "really putting on blinkers and just concentrating on
      trying to get approval for Photofrin, and taking our preclinical work with
      [Visudyne] forward." She added: "We could have gone under 
       then if we hadn't taken very major measures to pull ourselves
      together and focus, focus, focus."
    

      After a decade of work, QLT received the nod of approval it had labored to
      obtain in 1995, when Photofrin was accepted by the FDA as a marketable
      drug. QLT became the only company with approval to market a
      light-activated pharmaceutical product in the field of photodynamic
      therapy. Winning approval for her first drug was a celebratory moment for
      Levy, but she barely had time to mark the occasion before her
      responsibilities broadened. All of QLT's other founders departed in
      1995, leaving Levy, who had served variously as the company's chief
      scientific officer and vice-president, as the only one to lead the
      company. Before the year was through, Levy accepted the titles of
      president and chief executive officer, becoming the company's
      corporate and scientific leader as it endeavored to win approval for its
      second drug, Visudyne.
    


        Commercial Success in the 2000s
      


      Under Levy's leadership, QLT recorded the greatest financial growth
      in its history. Photofrin gave the company the steady stream of revenue it
      had worked for years to secure, but the lifeblood of its operations,
      Visudyne, would deliver QLT's most strident financial growth.
      Visudyne won approval from the FDA in 2000, the same year Levy sold
      Photofrin to Quebec-based Axcan Pharma Inc. QLT won approval for Visudyne,
      which it marketed in partnership with Novartis Ophthalmics, in April,
      recording its first sales from the drug in the second fiscal quarter of
      2000, when the company collected $25 million. During the second quarter of
      2001, the company generated $56 million from the sale of Visudyne, as its
      use spread throughout more than 50 countries. The U.S. market represented
      the company's single biggest market, accounting for two-thirds of
      Visudyne sales and enabling it to join an elite group of biotechnology
      companies. "Of the 490 publicly traded biotechnology companies
      around the world," Levy declared in the Winter 2001 issue of 
      
        Buyside,
      
       "only 14 are profitable, and QLT is one of them. Visudyne is an
      important reason for our growth," she added. "It was the
      largest ophthalmic product launch on record, with sales of $150 million in
      the first 12 months."
    

      After years of working to bring Visudyne to market and watching its sales
      mushroom with each passing fiscal quarter, Levy decided to give up her
      management responsibilities at QLT. She departed in 2002, after 21 years
      at the company, passing the titles of president and chief executive
      officer to Paul Hastings. Hastings started his career in the
      pharmaceutical industry in 1984 with Hoffman La Roche, the first of
      several companies he worked for in the industry. Before joining QLT,
      Hastings served as president and CEO of Axys Pharmaceuticals.
    

      Hastings's task at QLT was one Levy presumably would not have
      relished. Sales of Visudyne continued to rise as the reins of leadership
      passed from Levy to Hastings, but analysts demanded more. QLT was
      dependent almost entirely on the sale of Visudyne, a dependence that some
      industry observers described as a weakness. One analyst, in the January
      24, 2003 issue of 
      
        The America's Intelligence Wire
      
      , typified the assessment of QLT by the financial community, saying,
      "The big issue for them is what are you going to do next."
      Although Visudyne was the only treatment for macular degeneration on the
      market, QLT was expected to contend with its first competition as early as
      2005, when Eyetech, a biotechnology company working in collaboration with
      Pfizer, Inc., was expected to win approval for its macular degeneration
      drug Macugen.
    

      Hastings's challenge was to build QLT's business beyond
      Visudyne. The company had two other products under development,
      Tariquidar, a cancer treatment, and QLT0074, a male baldness treatment,
      but Hastings realized he needed to take a more aggressive approach to
      augmenting the company's business. In early 2004, he earmarked $500
      million in cash to develop the company's product pipeline and quell
      analysts' cries for a more diversified product offering. "We
      are looking to continue to build the pipeline by bringing in-house new
      technologies, licensing things in, and making acquisitions of products or
      companies," Hastings announced in the February 2, 2004 issue of 
      
        Investor's Business Daily
      
      . Toward this end, Hastings completed a deal that promised a more a
      balanced QLT in the years ahead. In November 2004, QLT completed a merger
      with Atrix Laboratories, Inc., a specialty pharmaceutical company with a
      pipeline of products and drug delivery platforms. Among the immediate
      gains of the merger was QLT's ability to market one of
      Atrix's products, Eligard, a treatment for prostate cancer. As
      Hastings prepared for the future, further deals were expected, as he
      sought to build on Levy's legacy and create a leading, diversified
      biotechnology company.

Advanced Search

                There are 3 types of search. Please only use one option at a time.
                
1) Build a boolean search string.
Ensure that document matches include...

...all of these word(s):



...and optionally include these word(s):



...but do not have these word(s):




2) Search for a phrase:

3) Search on part of a word:

Enter the first few characters of a word:




Submit



Information on how to use Search

                    There are 2 types of basic queries: Terms and Phrases.
                    A Term is a single word search.
                    A Phrase would wrap a string of words in quotes and find matches on the extact string.
                

Boolean Operators
You can combine basic queries with Boolean operators to form a more complex query. Boolean operators define the relationships between Terms or Phrases. Our search supports the following Boolean operators: AND, "+", OR, NOT and "-". Please note that Boolean operators must be all uppercase.
                

AND
example search: default AND document
                    This is the default operator. It will be used if there is no Boolean operator between two terms. For example:
                    default document is the same as default AND document. In this case both terms need to exist within a listing to find a match on that listing.The + character is synonymous with using AND.
                

OR
example search: default OR document
                    In this case just one of the terms needs to exist within a listing to find a match on that listing.
                

NOT
example search: default NOT "document type"
                    The NOT operator excludes documents that contain the term (or phrase) after NOT. So a listing match would have to include the word default but not the phrase "document type". The - character is synonymous with using NOT.
                

Wildcard/Prefix queries
You can perform "wildcard" or "prefix" queries using the '*' operator. Whereas all of the previous search found exact matches on the whole term or phrase, a wildcard search will find partial matches.
                    example search: ehr*
                    This query will match all documents containing words beginning with the prefix 'ehr' like the word Ehrlichia.
