FORT WAYNE, IND. — The Board of Directors of Franklin Electric announced today that Chairman and Chief Executive Officer R. Scott Trumbull will retire as Chief Executive Officer effective May 2, 2014 and that Gregg C. Sengstack has been appointed to succeed him in that role. Trumbull will remain non-executive chairman of Franklin Electric.
Trumbull first joined the Franklin Electric Board in 1998 and was named Chairman and Chief Executive Officer in 2002. During his tenure, Franklin Electric has transformed itself from being a submersible motor supplier for pump manufacturers to being a pumping systems supplier for distributors. Additionally, the Company’s revenues have grown to $965 million in 2013 with 37 percent of those revenues coming from developing region international markets. Under Trumbull’s leadership, the Company’s market capitalization has increased from around $520 million to about $1.9 billion.
Gregg C. Sengstack, 55 years old, first joined Franklin Electric in 1988 and has been President and Chief Operating Officer since 2011. He had previously been Senior Vice President and President, Franklin Fueling Systems and International Water Group and has held numerous positions in the Company’s Finance organization before becoming Chief Financial Officer in 1999. Sengstack is a member of the Board of Directors of Woodward Inc., a diversified manufacturer and service provider in the global aerospace and energy control markets.
Sengstack holds a bachelor’s degree from Bucknell University and masters in business administration from the University of Chicago.
David M. Wathen, Chairman of the Corporate Governance Committee of the Franklin Electric Board of Directors commented on behalf of the Board: “The Board of Directors has planned this transition for several years and we have the upmost confidence that Gregg is prepared to lead Franklin Electric.  We would like to express our sincere gratitude to Scott for all of his many accomplishments as the Chief Executive Officer of Franklin Electric over the past eleven years.”
Trumbull further noted: “Gregg is a strong leader and excellent strategist.  He has been a critical part of Franklin Electric’s success over the past 25 years and we are very confident he will lead the Company to even greater levels of growth and profitability in the future.”

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/21/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.  Royalty trusts may have special tax treatment, so you should consult a tax advisor on the potential tax consequences of investing in them.News, commentary and events are from third-party sources unaffiliated with Fidelity.
