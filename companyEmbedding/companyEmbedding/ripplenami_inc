Company Selected as Premiere Mapping Platform across United Kingdom

SAN DIEGO — (BUSINESS WIRE) — March 22, 2016 — 
RippleNami, Inc., a provider of a map-based data visualization platform accessed via the cloud, announced today that it has entered into an agreement with Northumbria University’s Northern Hub for Veterans and Military Families’ Research to provide a premiere mapping platform for United Kingdom-based National Health Service - Veteran Services. The NHS Veteran Services Commissioning Team facilitates healthcare and support services to 2.8 million veterans across the UK.
Working within the framework of the National Veteran’s Information Services and Network (N-VISioN), the entity created to facilitate this effort, the involved parties will utilize RippleNami’s proprietary mobile app and web-based portal to integrate data from government and private databases, making relevant resources easily accessible to UK veterans and their families. The primary goal is to greatly simplify access to all services afforded to veterans and their families. This includes easy-to-use icons containing locations of hospitals, substance abuse clinics, education centers, financial assistance, employment help, housing and shelters.
“A key philosophy is to connect the unconnected, and to give service users opportunities to make informed choices. This will also provide all those who work within the ex-armed forces sector access to a comprehensive directory of all services via a simple and intuitive app. In addition to the primary goals of the project, we are also looking to customize the app for all organizations that use it. The app has the ability to communicate in real-time to service users and co-workers,” stated Dr. Matthew Kiernan, co-founder of N-VISioN.
Political support for the project was secured on behalf of RippleNami from Parliament members Johny Mercer M.P. of Plymouth, England and Rishi Sunak M.P. of Richmond, England. In his role within Parliament, Mercer has made the modernizing and online availability of veteran services a priority while Sunak emphasized interest in a holistic community-driven approach to veteran care.
The first region to be implemented will be the Northeast region of England, which includes York, Leeds and Newcastle. The next stage of the project will be to secure national funding so the application can be phased in to six other UK regions, including Northwest England, Southwest England and Southeast England, as well as Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, by the end of 2016.
“We are extremely honored to be working with NHS, Northumbria University and N-VISioN, with the support of MP Mercer and MP Sunak. Veterans need myriad support services, and their ability to access this data quickly, easily and efficiently in the palm of their hands will change the ways in which UK vets get the assistance they need and deserve,” explained Phil Gahn, RippleNami co-founder and chief business development officer.
To better facilitate execution of this agreement, RippleNami plans to open an office in Northumbria University in Newcastle, England, in May 2016. This presence will complement RippleNami’s global efforts and its ability to improve the world through social good.

About Northumbria University
The Northern Hub for Veterans and Military Families Research is a collective of academics, service providers and service users with an interest in improving the health and social wellbeing of veterans and their families. The hub has evolved from the interests of Dr. Matthew Kiernan, Lieutenant Commander RN(Q) retired and Dr. Mick Hill. It has established itself through an evolutionary process attracting and welcoming anyone with a genuine interest in its vision. They openly welcome visionary and innovative research that helps improve and understand the complexities that our veterans and their families experience.
A fundamental principle of the hub is collaboration in research for the benefit of others. For more information about Northumbria University, visit

RippleNami, Inc. Wins Gold in Best in Biz Awards 2017 International

Wednesday, July 26, 2017 9:18 AM EDT




Most Socially Responsible Company of the YearSAN DIEGO --(BUSINESS WIRE)       RippleNami, Inc., a provider of a blockchain map-based data       visualization platform accessed via the cloud, has been named the gold       winner in the Most Socially Responsible Company of the Year category in       Best in Biz Awards 2017 International, the only independent global       business awards program judged each year by prominent editors and       reporters from top-tier publications from around the world.          RippleNami is quickly affecting change in developing nations by       connecting unconnected populations with an innovative blockchain and       mapping solution that allows anyone to map their world. RippleNami       created a visible and secure way for people to resolve a myriad of       problems involving data veracity, document control, big data management,       property protection, and identity management through an incorruptible       network. RippleNami knew that if they could take the technology solution       into developing countries, the world would forever be changed.          “As a rapidly growing, fast-paced startup technology company with a       strong focus on corporate social responsibility, RippleNami is quickly       impacting the lives of many by making a difference in the way people       connect using our novel blockchain and mapping solution. We genuinely       appreciate that the judges in the Best in Biz award program recognized       the power of the change RippleNami’s innovative solution is affecting       and noticed the Company’s successes to date,” explained Jaye       Connolly-Labelle, president and chief executive officer at RippleNami.          Almost 300 public and private companies hailing from all sectors of the       global economy from more than 30 countries competed in Best in Biz       Awards’ fifth annual International program. Best in Biz Awards 2017       International honors were once again presented in a range of categories,       including Fastest-Growing Company of the Year, Most Socially Responsible       Company of the Year, Most Innovative Company of the Year, Support       Department of the Year, Executive of the Year, Most Innovative Product,       Enterprise Product and Consumer Product of the Year.          Winners in the 5th annual program were determined based on scoring from       an independent panel of judges hailing from a wide spectrum of top-tier       publications and media outlets and from 15 countries and all continents.       Best in Biz Awards’ uniqueness stems, in part, from the composition of       its judging panels. Each year, only editors, writers and contributors to       business, consumer, financial, trade and technology publications, as       well as broadcast outlets and analyst firms, are invited to serve as       judges. Structured this way, Best in Biz Awards can best leverage the       expertise, experience and objectivity of its influential judges to       determine award winners.          “More than twenty years after the internet became a must-have tool and       medium for businesses, it’s fascinating to see how leading firms, as       encapsulated by this strong crop of Best in Biz Awards contenders,       demonstrate how far we’ve come,” said Mathew Schwartz, judging his       fourth Best in Biz Awards competition. “I was especially struck by how       strong the cloud computing segment continues to be — not just apps but       also infrastructure — and how even with the best technology in the       world, user interface design and the user experience remains so crucial.”          This year’s judging panel included writers and contributors to such       publications as ARD (Germany), Business Breakfast (United Arab       Emirates), Computer Hoy (Spain), Data Breach Today (United Kingdom), HT       Mobile (Israel), IAA Magazine (United Arab Emirates), InBusiness (Cyprus       and Greece), Irish Independent (Ireland), Radio Ngati Porou (New       Zealand), TechHim (India), TechnoFILE.com (Canada), Tune Media       (Singapore), Ventures Africa (Nigeria), and Wirausaha & Keuangan       (Indonesia).
