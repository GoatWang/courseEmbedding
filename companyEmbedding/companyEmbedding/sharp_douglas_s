Job Details
               Mary Jeanne has been a part of the RV&E team for over fifteen years and is always there to offer help. She believes that to be in this industry means to be an advocate for it, and that it is equally important to return something to the community which has supported RV&E Bike and Skate for the last 33 years. To this end, she initiated and cultivated a relationship between RV&E and Interlakes Foundation, a cancer research organization. I.F.'s Wellness Program was designed by Dr. James Fetten, a member of the race team that RV&E sponsors.
