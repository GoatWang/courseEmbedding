                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Fitch Expects to Rate AmeriCredit Automobile Receivables Trust, Series 2012-5; Presale Issued | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Expects to Rate AmeriCredit Automobile Receivables Trust, Series 
      2012-5; Presale Issued
    





November 13, 2012 10:13 AM Eastern Standard Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings expects to rate AmeriCredit Automobile Receivables Trust, 
      series 2012-5 as detailed below.
    

      Fitch's stress and rating sensitivity analysis are discussed in the 
      presale report titled 'AmeriCredit Automobile Receivables Trust 2012-5', 
      dated Nov. 13, 2012, which is available on Fitch's web site: www.fitchratings.com.
    

      Fitch expects to assign the following ratings:
    

      --$203,400,000 class A-1 notes 'F1+sf';
    

      --$315,300,000 class A-2 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$191,590,000 class A-3 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$76,517,000 class B notes 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$94,987,000 class C notes 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$93,403,000 class D notes 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$24,803,000 class E notes 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      Consistent Credit Enhancement Structure: The cash flow distribution is a 
      sequential-pay structure, consistent with prior transactions. Initial 
      hard credit enhancement (CE) is consistent with 2012-4 and 2012-3, but 
      lower than 2012-2. The reserve totals 2.00% (non-declining), and initial 
      overcollateralization (OC) is 5.25% (both of the initial pool balance), 
      growing to a target of 14.25% (of the current pool balance, excluding 
      the reserve).
    

      Stronger Portfolio/Securitization Performance: Losses on GM Financial's 
      portfolio and 2009-2012 AMCAR securitizations have declined to some of 
      the lowest levels ever seen, supported by the gradual economic recovery 
      and strong used vehicle values supporting higher recovery rates.
    

      Stable Corporate Health: Fitch rates GM 'BB+' and GM Financial 'BB' with 
      a Stable Rating Outlook for both. GM Financial has recorded positive 
      corporate financial results since 2010, while the overall health of GM 
      has also improved.
    

      Consistent Origination/Underwriting/Servicing: AmeriCredit Financial 
      Services Inc. demonstrates adequate abilities as originator, 
      underwriter, and servicer, as evidenced by historical portfolio 
      delinquency and loss experience and securitization performance. Fitch 
      deems AFSI capable of adequately servicing this series.
    

      Legal Structure Integrity: The legal structure of the transaction should 
      provide that a bankruptcy of GM Financial would not impair the 
      timeliness of payments on the securities.
    

      Additional information is available at 'www.fitchratings.com'. 
      The ratings above were solicited by, or on behalf of, the issuer, and 
      therefore, Fitch has been compensated for the provision of the ratings.

Business Wire




Mar 26, 2010 5:23 PM EDT













 


















































  Bond insurer Assured Guaranty Corp. (AGC) will provide a financial guaranty insurance policy for $200 million of Automobile Receivables Backed Notes priced today by AmeriCredit Automobile Receivables Trust 2010-A.  “This is the first public asset-backed transaction we have guaranteed outside of the secondary market for some time, and we look forward to increasing our participation in the resurgent ABS market.” said Paul Livingstone, Senior Managing Director for Structured Finance at AGC. “Further, we are very pleased to be working with AmeriCredit, a long-time client whose track record reflects its strong market position and experienced management.”  The issue will be collateralized by approximately $238 million of loans financing automobiles, light duty trucks and vans. In addition to the overcollateralization, investors and AGC are protected in the transaction by excess cashflow, an interest spread account and limited cross-collateralization with certain other AmeriCredit transactions.  The AGC financial guaranty insurance policy will unconditionally and irrevocably guarantee payments of interest and principal due on each insured distribution date.  AGC is a financial guaranty insurance subsidiary of Assured Guaranty Ltd. (together with its subsidiaries, Assured Guaranty or the Company) (NYSE:AGO). Assured Guaranty is a Bermuda-based holding company that provides, through its operating subsidiaries, credit protection products to the public finance, infrastructure and structured finance markets in the United States as well as internationally.

The Company's principal product is a guaranty of principal and interest payments on debt securities issued by governmental entities such as U.S. state or municipal authorities, obligations issued for international infrastructure projects, and asset-backed securities (ABS).  Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements:  Any forward-looking statements made in this press release reflect the current views of Assured Guaranty with respect to future events and financial performance and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
