History[edit]
Dimitris Coustas born in 1928 and worked professionally in the field of footwear. Managed to create a self-made one shoe industry employed 250 workers. In the early '60s D. Koustas with Nicholas Gregory founded the shipping company Roumeli Shipping and they bought their first vessel, which they named "Amalia". The company in 1966 ran three ships. The year 1970 D. Coustas bought the entire company and within five years has created a fleet of five ships with capacity of 35,000 tons. After the regime change, the company was renamed Danaos Shipping. In 1981, on the eve of the great maritime crisis D. Coustas kept a ship, 'John' (after his son) and proceeded to build three more ships, which were delivered in 1984.[10]
In 1986 he founded together with his friend Dimitris Theodossiou company Danaos Management Consultants who created innovative and dynamic software navigation, essential for the functioning of companies and ships.[11]
In 1987 his son, Dr. John Coustas took full control of the company. At that time fleet had only three bulk carriers. Three years later, in 1990, Dr. John Coustas decides to make the big turn. Bought seven containers ships of 2.700 teu, which were leased to the Korean company Hanjin for five years. In 2000 Danaos had 17 ships with a capacity of 720,000 tonnes. In 2003 he commissioned ships 8.100 teu. In 2006 entered the shipping company Danaos on the New York stock exchange market (trades in NYSE under the symbol DAC) and in a few years was able to dominate the field of containers. In 2007 the company had 40 ships, in 2010 51 ships, in 2012 65 ships and today in 2013 a Fleet of 61 vessels.[12]
Having developed sea transport services throughout its history, Danaos forged a reputation for operational support to liner companies and other charterers throughout the world.[13]
Fleet[edit]
Danaos containerships are deployed under multi-year, fixed-rate time charters that range from one to 18 years for vessels in current fleet, providing stable cash flows and high utilization rates. All containerships have low unscheduled off-hire days, which enhances company's reputation for safety and reliability in the industry. A comprehensive maintenance program is in place to ensure the continued high quality of the fleet.
In 2012, Danaos completed its extensive new-building program that has established the company as one of the largest containership operating lessors in the world. Since going public in 2006, Danaos has more than tripled its TEU carrying capacity, which has grown at a 21% compounded annual growth rate through the end of 2012. Today, Danaos fleet is one of the most modern in the industry and includes some of the largest containerships in the world, which are designed with certain technological advances and customized modifications that make them efficient with respect to both voyage speed and loading capability when compared to many existing vessels operating in the containership sector.[14]
On December 7, 2012, Danaos received the "Ship of the Year" award at the Lloyd's List Greek Shipping Awards 2012. The prize was awarded for the Hyundai Ambition, a 13,100 TEU containership built at Hyundai Samho Heavy Industries and delivered on June 29, 2012. The Hyundai Ambition is the last of a series of five 13,100 TEU containerships delivered to Danaos in 2012 and chartered to Hyundai Merchant Marine for 12 years. The vessel is fitted with an electronically controlled main engine in compliance with Tier II International Maritime Organization ("IMO") nitrogen oxides ("NOx") emissions standards and the phase II IMO Energy Efficiency Design Index ("EEDI") equipped with turbocharger cut-out measures, and is capable of super slow steaming down to 10% of maximum engine load. It is equipped with an advanced performance monitoring system with on line analysis for power measurement and multi-stations alarm monitoring controls. The vessel has undergone extensive trim optimization tests to enhance its performance and is coated with the latest silyl SPC coatings.[15]
Hyundai Ambition also has state of the art IT, Communication and Entertainment Systems on board, wired and wireless network offering Internet and Entertainment Systems to all Crew Cabins and messrooms, centralized video and music centre offering private selection of movies and music on board, as well as satellite TV at crew public spaces. [16] As of June 6, 2013, Danaos has a fleet of 61 container ships aggregating 352,065 TEUs

History[edit]
Dimitris Coustas born in 1928 and worked professionally in the field of footwear. Managed to create a self-made one shoe industry employed 250 workers. In the early '60s D. Koustas with Nicholas Gregory founded the shipping company Roumeli Shipping and they bought their first vessel, which they named "Amalia". The company in 1966 ran three ships. The year 1970 D. Coustas bought the entire company and within five years has created a fleet of five ships with capacity of 35,000 tons. After the regime change, the company was renamed Danaos Shipping. In 1981, on the eve of the great maritime crisis D. Coustas kept a ship, 'John' (after his son) and proceeded to build three more ships, which were delivered in 1984.[10]
In 1986 he founded together with his friend Dimitris Theodossiou company Danaos Management Consultants who created innovative and dynamic software navigation, essential for the functioning of companies and ships.[11]
In 1987 his son, Dr. John Coustas took full control of the company. At that time fleet had only three bulk carriers. Three years later, in 1990, Dr. John Coustas decides to make the big turn. Bought seven containers ships of 2.700 teu, which were leased to the Korean company Hanjin for five years. In 2000 Danaos had 17 ships with a capacity of 720,000 tonnes. In 2003 he commissioned ships 8.100 teu. In 2006 entered the shipping company Danaos on the New York stock exchange market (trades in NYSE under the symbol DAC) and in a few years was able to dominate the field of containers. In 2007 the company had 40 ships, in 2010 51 ships, in 2012 65 ships and today in 2013 a Fleet of 61 vessels.[12]
Having developed sea transport services throughout its history, Danaos forged a reputation for operational support to liner companies and other charterers throughout the world.[13]
Fleet[edit]
Danaos containerships are deployed under multi-year, fixed-rate time charters that range from one to 18 years for vessels in current fleet, providing stable cash flows and high utilization rates. All containerships have low unscheduled off-hire days, which enhances company's reputation for safety and reliability in the industry. A comprehensive maintenance program is in place to ensure the continued high quality of the fleet.
In 2012, Danaos completed its extensive new-building program that has established the company as one of the largest containership operating lessors in the world. Since going public in 2006, Danaos has more than tripled its TEU carrying capacity, which has grown at a 21% compounded annual growth rate through the end of 2012. Today, Danaos fleet is one of the most modern in the industry and includes some of the largest containerships in the world, which are designed with certain technological advances and customized modifications that make them efficient with respect to both voyage speed and loading capability when compared to many existing vessels operating in the containership sector.[14]
On December 7, 2012, Danaos received the "Ship of the Year" award at the Lloyd's List Greek Shipping Awards 2012. The prize was awarded for the Hyundai Ambition, a 13,100 TEU containership built at Hyundai Samho Heavy Industries and delivered on June 29, 2012. The Hyundai Ambition is the last of a series of five 13,100 TEU containerships delivered to Danaos in 2012 and chartered to Hyundai Merchant Marine for 12 years. The vessel is fitted with an electronically controlled main engine in compliance with Tier II International Maritime Organization ("IMO") nitrogen oxides ("NOx") emissions standards and the phase II IMO Energy Efficiency Design Index ("EEDI") equipped with turbocharger cut-out measures, and is capable of super slow steaming down to 10% of maximum engine load. It is equipped with an advanced performance monitoring system with on line analysis for power measurement and multi-stations alarm monitoring controls. The vessel has undergone extensive trim optimization tests to enhance its performance and is coated with the latest silyl SPC coatings.[15]
Hyundai Ambition also has state of the art IT, Communication and Entertainment Systems on board, wired and wireless network offering Internet and Entertainment Systems to all Crew Cabins and messrooms, centralized video and music centre offering private selection of movies and music on board, as well as satellite TV at crew public spaces.

History[edit]
Dimitris Coustas born in 1928 and worked professionally in the field of footwear. Managed to create a self-made one shoe industry employed 250 workers. In the early '60s D. Koustas with Nicholas Gregory founded the shipping company Roumeli Shipping and they bought their first vessel, which they named "Amalia". The company in 1966 ran three ships. The year 1970 D. Coustas bought the entire company and within five years has created a fleet of five ships with capacity of 35,000 tons. After the regime change, the company was renamed Danaos Shipping. In 1981, on the eve of the great maritime crisis D. Coustas kept a ship, 'John' (after his son) and proceeded to build three more ships, which were delivered in 1984.[10]
In 1986 he founded together with his friend Dimitris Theodossiou company Danaos Management Consultants who created innovative and dynamic software navigation, essential for the functioning of companies and ships.[11]
In 1987 his son, Dr. John Coustas took full control of the company. At that time fleet had only three bulk carriers. Three years later, in 1990, Dr. John Coustas decides to make the big turn. Bought seven containers ships of 2.700 teu, which were leased to the Korean company Hanjin for five years. In 2000 Danaos had 17 ships with a capacity of 720,000 tonnes. In 2003 he commissioned ships 8.100 teu. In 2006 entered the shipping company Danaos on the New York stock exchange market (trades in NYSE under the symbol DAC) and in a few years was able to dominate the field of containers. In 2007 the company had 40 ships, in 2010 51 ships, in 2012 65 ships and today in 2013 a Fleet of 61 vessels.[12]
Having developed sea transport services throughout its history, Danaos forged a reputation for operational support to liner companies and other charterers throughout the world.[13]
Fleet[edit]
Danaos containerships are deployed under multi-year, fixed-rate time charters that range from one to 18 years for vessels in current fleet, providing stable cash flows and high utilization rates. All containerships have low unscheduled off-hire days, which enhances company's reputation for safety and reliability in the industry. A comprehensive maintenance program is in place to ensure the continued high quality of the fleet.
In 2012, Danaos completed its extensive new-building program that has established the company as one of the largest containership operating lessors in the world. Since going public in 2006, Danaos has more than tripled its TEU carrying capacity, which has grown at a 21% compounded annual growth rate through the end of 2012. Today, Danaos fleet is one of the most modern in the industry and includes some of the largest containerships in the world, which are designed with certain technological advances and customized modifications that make them efficient with respect to both voyage speed and loading capability when compared to many existing vessels operating in the containership sector.[14]
On December 7, 2012, Danaos received the "Ship of the Year" award at the Lloyd's List Greek Shipping Awards 2012. The prize was awarded for the Hyundai Ambition, a 13,100 TEU containership built at Hyundai Samho Heavy Industries and delivered on June 29, 2012. The Hyundai Ambition is the last of a series of five 13,100 TEU containerships delivered to Danaos in 2012 and chartered to Hyundai Merchant Marine for 12 years. The vessel is fitted with an electronically controlled main engine in compliance with Tier II International Maritime Organization ("IMO") nitrogen oxides ("NOx") emissions standards and the phase II IMO Energy Efficiency Design Index ("EEDI") equipped with turbocharger cut-out measures, and is capable of super slow steaming down to 10% of maximum engine load. It is equipped with an advanced performance monitoring system with on line analysis for power measurement and multi-stations alarm monitoring controls. The vessel has undergone extensive trim optimization tests to enhance its performance and is coated with the latest silyl SPC coatings.[15]
Hyundai Ambition also has state of the art IT, Communication and Entertainment Systems on board, wired and wireless network offering Internet and Entertainment Systems to all Crew Cabins and messrooms, centralized video and music centre offering private selection of movies and music on board, as well as satellite TV at crew public spaces. [16] As of June 6, 2013, Danaos has a fleet of 61 container ships aggregating 352,065 TEUs

History[edit]
Dimitris Coustas born in 1928 and worked professionally in the field of footwear. Managed to create a self-made one shoe industry employed 250 workers. In the early '60s D. Koustas with Nicholas Gregory founded the shipping company Roumeli Shipping and they bought their first vessel, which they named "Amalia". The company in 1966 ran three ships. The year 1970 D. Coustas bought the entire company and within five years has created a fleet of five ships with capacity of 35,000 tons. After the regime change, the company was renamed Danaos Shipping. In 1981, on the eve of the great maritime crisis D. Coustas kept a ship, 'John' (after his son) and proceeded to build three more ships, which were delivered in 1984.[10]
In 1986 he founded together with his friend Dimitris Theodossiou company Danaos Management Consultants who created innovative and dynamic software navigation, essential for the functioning of companies and ships.[11]
In 1987 his son, Dr. John Coustas took full control of the company. At that time fleet had only three bulk carriers. Three years later, in 1990, Dr. John Coustas decides to make the big turn. Bought seven containers ships of 2.700 teu, which were leased to the Korean company Hanjin for five years. In 2000 Danaos had 17 ships with a capacity of 720,000 tonnes. In 2003 he commissioned ships 8.100 teu. In 2006 entered the shipping company Danaos on the New York stock exchange market (trades in NYSE under the symbol DAC) and in a few years was able to dominate the field of containers. In 2007 the company had 40 ships, in 2010 51 ships, in 2012 65 ships and today in 2013 a Fleet of 61 vessels.[12]
Having developed sea transport services throughout its history, Danaos forged a reputation for operational support to liner companies and other charterers throughout the world.[13]
Fleet[edit]
Danaos containerships are deployed under multi-year, fixed-rate time charters that range from one to 18 years for vessels in current fleet, providing stable cash flows and high utilization rates. All containerships have low unscheduled off-hire days, which enhances company's reputation for safety and reliability in the industry. A comprehensive maintenance program is in place to ensure the continued high quality of the fleet.
In 2012, Danaos completed its extensive new-building program that has established the company as one of the largest containership operating lessors in the world. Since going public in 2006, Danaos has more than tripled its TEU carrying capacity, which has grown at a 21% compounded annual growth rate through the end of 2012. Today, Danaos fleet is one of the most modern in the industry and includes some of the largest containerships in the world, which are designed with certain technological advances and customized modifications that make them efficient with respect to both voyage speed and loading capability when compared to many existing vessels operating in the containership sector.[14]
On December 7, 2012, Danaos received the "Ship of the Year" award at the Lloyd's List Greek Shipping Awards 2012. The prize was awarded for the Hyundai Ambition, a 13,100 TEU containership built at Hyundai Samho Heavy Industries and delivered on June 29, 2012. The Hyundai Ambition is the last of a series of five 13,100 TEU containerships delivered to Danaos in 2012 and chartered to Hyundai Merchant Marine for 12 years. The vessel is fitted with an electronically controlled main engine in compliance with Tier II International Maritime Organization ("IMO") nitrogen oxides ("NOx") emissions standards and the phase II IMO Energy Efficiency Design Index ("EEDI") equipped with turbocharger cut-out measures, and is capable of super slow steaming down to 10% of maximum engine load. It is equipped with an advanced performance monitoring system with on line analysis for power measurement and multi-stations alarm monitoring controls. The vessel has undergone extensive trim optimization tests to enhance its performance and is coated with the latest silyl SPC coatings.[15]
Hyundai Ambition also has state of the art IT, Communication and Entertainment Systems on board, wired and wireless network offering Internet and Entertainment Systems to all Crew Cabins and messrooms, centralized video and music centre offering private selection of movies and music on board, as well as satellite TV at crew public spaces. [16] As of June 6, 2013, Danaos has a fleet of 61 container ships aggregating 352,065 TEUs

History[edit]
Dimitris Coustas born in 1928 and worked professionally in the field of footwear. Managed to create a self-made one shoe industry employed 250 workers. In the early '60s D. Koustas with Nicholas Gregory founded the shipping company Roumeli Shipping and they bought their first vessel, which they named "Amalia". The company in 1966 ran three ships. The year 1970 D. Coustas bought the entire company and within five years has created a fleet of five ships with capacity of 35,000 tons. After the regime change, the company was renamed Danaos Shipping. In 1981, on the eve of the great maritime crisis D. Coustas kept a ship, 'John' (after his son) and proceeded to build three more ships, which were delivered in 1984.[10]
In 1986 he founded together with his friend Dimitris Theodossiou company Danaos Management Consultants who created innovative and dynamic software navigation, essential for the functioning of companies and ships.[11]
In 1987 his son, Dr. John Coustas took full control of the company. At that time fleet had only three bulk carriers. Three years later, in 1990, Dr. John Coustas decides to make the big turn. Bought seven containers ships of 2.700 teu, which were leased to the Korean company Hanjin for five years. In 2000 Danaos had 17 ships with a capacity of 720,000 tonnes. In 2003 he commissioned ships 8.100 teu. In 2006 entered the shipping company Danaos on the New York stock exchange market (trades in NYSE under the symbol DAC) and in a few years was able to dominate the field of containers. In 2007 the company had 40 ships, in 2010 51 ships, in 2012 65 ships and today in 2013 a Fleet of 61 vessels.[12]
Having developed sea transport services throughout its history, Danaos forged a reputation for operational support to liner companies and other charterers throughout the world.[13]
Fleet[edit]
Danaos containerships are deployed under multi-year, fixed-rate time charters that range from one to 18 years for vessels in current fleet, providing stable cash flows and high utilization rates. All containerships have low unscheduled off-hire days, which enhances company's reputation for safety and reliability in the industry. A comprehensive maintenance program is in place to ensure the continued high quality of the fleet.
In 2012, Danaos completed its extensive new-building program that has established the company as one of the largest containership operating lessors in the world. Since going public in 2006, Danaos has more than tripled its TEU carrying capacity, which has grown at a 21% compounded annual growth rate through the end of 2012. Today, Danaos fleet is one of the most modern in the industry and includes some of the largest containerships in the world, which are designed with certain technological advances and customized modifications that make them efficient with respect to both voyage speed and loading capability when compared to many existing vessels operating in the containership sector.[14]
On December 7, 2012, Danaos received the "Ship of the Year" award at the Lloyd's List Greek Shipping Awards 2012. The prize was awarded for the Hyundai Ambition, a 13,100 TEU containership built at Hyundai Samho Heavy Industries and delivered on June 29, 2012. The Hyundai Ambition is the last of a series of five 13,100 TEU containerships delivered to Danaos in 2012 and chartered to Hyundai Merchant Marine for 12 years. The vessel is fitted with an electronically controlled main engine in compliance with Tier II International Maritime Organization ("IMO") nitrogen oxides ("NOx") emissions standards and the phase II IMO Energy Efficiency Design Index ("EEDI") equipped with turbocharger cut-out measures, and is capable of super slow steaming down to 10% of maximum engine load. It is equipped with an advanced performance monitoring system with on line analysis for power measurement and multi-stations alarm monitoring controls. The vessel has undergone extensive trim optimization tests to enhance its performance and is coated with the latest silyl SPC coatings.[15]
Hyundai Ambition also has state of the art IT, Communication and Entertainment Systems on board, wired and wireless network offering Internet and Entertainment Systems to all Crew Cabins and messrooms, centralized video and music centre offering private selection of movies and music on board, as well as satellite TV at crew public spaces. [16] As of June 6, 2013, Danaos has a fleet of 61 container ships aggregating 352,065 TEUs

History[edit]
Dimitris Coustas born in 1928 and worked professionally in the field of footwear. Managed to create a self-made one shoe industry employed 250 workers. In the early '60s D. Koustas with Nicholas Gregory founded the shipping company Roumeli Shipping and they bought their first vessel, which they named "Amalia". The company in 1966 ran three ships. The year 1970 D. Coustas bought the entire company and within five years has created a fleet of five ships with capacity of 35,000 tons. After the regime change, the company was renamed Danaos Shipping. In 1981, on the eve of the great maritime crisis D. Coustas kept a ship, 'John' (after his son) and proceeded to build three more ships, which were delivered in 1984.[10]
In 1986 he founded together with his friend Dimitris Theodossiou company Danaos Management Consultants who created innovative and dynamic software navigation, essential for the functioning of companies and ships.[11]
In 1987 his son, Dr. John Coustas took full control of the company. At that time fleet had only three bulk carriers. Three years later, in 1990, Dr. John Coustas decides to make the big turn. Bought seven containers ships of 2.700 teu, which were leased to the Korean company Hanjin for five years. In 2000 Danaos had 17 ships with a capacity of 720,000 tonnes. In 2003 he commissioned ships 8.100 teu. In 2006 entered the shipping company Danaos on the New York stock exchange market (trades in NYSE under the symbol DAC) and in a few years was able to dominate the field of containers. In 2007 the company had 40 ships, in 2010 51 ships, in 2012 65 ships and today in 2013 a Fleet of 61 vessels.[12]
Having developed sea transport services throughout its history, Danaos forged a reputation for operational support to liner companies and other charterers throughout the world.[13]
Fleet[edit]
Danaos containerships are deployed under multi-year, fixed-rate time charters that range from one to 18 years for vessels in current fleet, providing stable cash flows and high utilization rates. All containerships have low unscheduled off-hire days, which enhances company's reputation for safety and reliability in the industry. A comprehensive maintenance program is in place to ensure the continued high quality of the fleet.
In 2012, Danaos completed its extensive new-building program that has established the company as one of the largest containership operating lessors in the world. Since going public in 2006, Danaos has more than tripled its TEU carrying capacity, which has grown at a 21% compounded annual growth rate through the end of 2012. Today, Danaos fleet is one of the most modern in the industry and includes some of the largest containerships in the world, which are designed with certain technological advances and customized modifications that make them efficient with respect to both voyage speed and loading capability when compared to many existing vessels operating in the containership sector.[14]
On December 7, 2012, Danaos received the "Ship of the Year" award at the Lloyd's List Greek Shipping Awards 2012. The prize was awarded for the Hyundai Ambition, a 13,100 TEU containership built at Hyundai Samho Heavy Industries and delivered on June 29, 2012. The Hyundai Ambition is the last of a series of five 13,100 TEU containerships delivered to Danaos in 2012 and chartered to Hyundai Merchant Marine for 12 years. The vessel is fitted with an electronically controlled main engine in compliance with Tier II International Maritime Organization ("IMO") nitrogen oxides ("NOx") emissions standards and the phase II IMO Energy Efficiency Design Index ("EEDI") equipped with turbocharger cut-out measures, and is capable of super slow steaming down to 10% of maximum engine load. It is equipped with an advanced performance monitoring system with on line analysis for power measurement and multi-stations alarm monitoring controls. The vessel has undergone extensive trim optimization tests to enhance its performance and is coated with the latest silyl SPC coatings.[15]
Hyundai Ambition also has state of the art IT, Communication and Entertainment Systems on board, wired and wireless network offering Internet and Entertainment Systems to all Crew Cabins and messrooms, centralized video and music centre offering private selection of movies and music on board, as well as satellite TV at crew public spaces. [16] As of June 6, 2013, Danaos has a fleet of 61 container ships aggregating 352,065 TEUs

History[edit]
Dimitris Coustas born in 1928 and worked professionally in the field of footwear. Managed to create a self-made one shoe industry employed 250 workers. In the early '60s D. Koustas with Nicholas Gregory founded the shipping company Roumeli Shipping and they bought their first vessel, which they named "Amalia". The company in 1966 ran three ships. The year 1970 D. Coustas bought the entire company and within five years has created a fleet of five ships with capacity of 35,000 tons. After the regime change, the company was renamed Danaos Shipping. In 1981, on the eve of the great maritime crisis D. Coustas kept a ship, 'John' (after his son) and proceeded to build three more ships, which were delivered in 1984.[10]
In 1986 he founded together with his friend Dimitris Theodossiou company Danaos Management Consultants who created innovative and dynamic software navigation, essential for the functioning of companies and ships.[11]
In 1987 his son, Dr. John Coustas took full control of the company. At that time fleet had only three bulk carriers. Three years later, in 1990, Dr. John Coustas decides to make the big turn. Bought seven containers ships of 2.700 teu, which were leased to the Korean company Hanjin for five years. In 2000 Danaos had 17 ships with a capacity of 720,000 tonnes. In 2003 he commissioned ships 8.100 teu. In 2006 entered the shipping company Danaos on the New York stock exchange market (trades in NYSE under the symbol DAC) and in a few years was able to dominate the field of containers. In 2007 the company had 40 ships, in 2010 51 ships, in 2012 65 ships and today in 2013 a Fleet of 61 vessels.[12]
Having developed sea transport services throughout its history, Danaos forged a reputation for operational support to liner companies and other charterers throughout the world.[13]
Fleet[edit]
Danaos containerships are deployed under multi-year, fixed-rate time charters that range from one to 18 years for vessels in current fleet, providing stable cash flows and high utilization rates. All containerships have low unscheduled off-hire days, which enhances company's reputation for safety and reliability in the industry. A comprehensive maintenance program is in place to ensure the continued high quality of the fleet.
In 2012, Danaos completed its extensive new-building program that has established the company as one of the largest containership operating lessors in the world. Since going public in 2006, Danaos has more than tripled its TEU carrying capacity, which has grown at a 21% compounded annual growth rate through the end of 2012. Today, Danaos fleet is one of the most modern in the industry and includes some of the largest containerships in the world, which are designed with certain technological advances and customized modifications that make them efficient with respect to both voyage speed and loading capability when compared to many existing vessels operating in the containership sector.[14]
On December 7, 2012, Danaos received the "Ship of the Year" award at the Lloyd's List Greek Shipping Awards 2012. The prize was awarded for the Hyundai Ambition, a 13,100 TEU containership built at Hyundai Samho Heavy Industries and delivered on June 29, 2012. The Hyundai Ambition is the last of a series of five 13,100 TEU containerships delivered to Danaos in 2012 and chartered to Hyundai Merchant Marine for 12 years. The vessel is fitted with an electronically controlled main engine in compliance with Tier II International Maritime Organization ("IMO") nitrogen oxides ("NOx") emissions standards and the phase II IMO Energy Efficiency Design Index ("EEDI") equipped with turbocharger cut-out measures, and is capable of super slow steaming down to 10% of maximum engine load. It is equipped with an advanced performance monitoring system with on line analysis for power measurement and multi-stations alarm monitoring controls. The vessel has undergone extensive trim optimization tests to enhance its performance and is coated with the latest silyl SPC coatings.[15]
Hyundai Ambition also has state of the art IT, Communication and Entertainment Systems on board, wired and wireless network offering Internet and Entertainment Systems to all Crew Cabins and messrooms, centralized video and music centre offering private selection of movies and music on board, as well as satellite TV at crew public spaces. [16] As of June 6, 2013, Danaos has a fleet of 61 container ships aggregating 352,065 TEUs

Dr. John CoustasPresident & CEO





Dear Shareholders,
The efficacy of our business strategy was evident in 2014, a year that saw overcapacity, tough competition, and the beginning of new alliances after the Chinese authorities rejected the P3 alliance among Maersk Line, CMA CGM, and MSC, which would have allowed the carriers to effectively control the industry.  Danaos Corporation remained protected from market volatility with our strong charter coverage and efficient, cost-effective operations. Additionally, we continued to deleverage and improve our balance sheet and to tactically upgrade our fleet.
Significantly, this year our legacy interest rate swaps began to expire. These have been negatively impacting our profitability for several years. With no imminent dramatic increase in interest rates and with an international deflationary outlook, our financial performance will continue to improve as the interest rate swaps expire.  We have also managed to keep our expenses among the lowest in the industry and have also benefited from the strong dollar as our euro denominated costs improve significantly.
In 2012, Danaos completed an extensive newbuilding program, in which we received delivery of 5 modern vessels with aggregate capacity of 65,500 TEU from Hyundai Samho Heavy Industries. Each of these vessels was backed by a long-term time charter to a major liner company. We are managing our fleet very conservatively and have invested in some smaller much younger vessels to replace vessels built prior to 1990 that we sold for scrap. Following our 2012 deliveries, we decided to retire some older tonnage and sold 14 vessels, all built prior to 1993 and we replaced them with 6 newer mostly post 2001 built vessels in sizes ranging between 2500 – 6500 TEU.  These vessels operate in niche markets where we expect to see good demand / supply dynamics. 
Now that all the “old guard” went for scraping, we are left with a very modern fleet to which we have applied state of the art technology to optimize performance.  We are actively engaged in research on the optimization of the fuel consumption on our existing fleet as well as several other exciting technological innovations that will allow us to maintain our competitive edge in the containership market.
The container charter market saw a significant increase in panamax rates during the first quarter of 2015 due to increased demand resulting from port congestion in the US West Coast and the continued shrinkage of the world panamax fleet. The delay in the opening of the new Panama Canal will further help to absorb panamax tonnage in the short term, while delays caused by port congestion in the US West Coast have resulted in increased demand in the Asia to US East Coast all water service. These factors have positively affected TEU mile demand in the industry. Additionally niche markets have begun to show signs of strength.  In particular, demand in north south markets was relatively healthy and there was growth in Intra-Asia markets driven by new production in lower cost Asian countries that created a trade multiplier with China.
We believe that “containerization” will continue to grow as a multiple to world GDP over the long term.  In addition we have seen more and more heavy cargoes, such as steel products, bagged cement and grain shipped in containers. The increasing carrying capacity of containerships has encouraged shippers to “containerize” more heavy cargoes in order to reduce shipping costs.
Danaos Corporation’s strategy has always been to secure long-term commitments from top tier charterers. We seek to obtain charters of greater than 5 years for our panamax vessels and greater than 8 years for post-panamax vessels. This allows Danaos to limit its downside revenue risk and maintain good cash flow visibility. As of the date of this writing, our diverse portfolio of customers includes 10 out of the 20 major liner companies. We have forged these strong relationships over decades by providing outstanding customer service, always pursuing operational excellence, and developing leading-edge expertise in the technology that serves the industry. We have also remained committed to rigorous operational standards and a steadfast commitment to the safety of our crews and environmental protection.
The current market dynamic presents Danaos with an opportunity to consolidate our business and concentrate on what we are best at: operating our vessels safely and efficiently.  Part of our ability to manage our business has always been our significant understanding of ship technology.  For the past two decades, we have put a great deal of emphasis on the technology aspects of our business and have taken part in various research and development projects that have made us more efficient and have benefited our industry. I strongly believe that technology will continue to be a competitive advantage for years to come.
Last year was undeniably challenging for the containership market, but as a company we have come through stronger and have already begun to reap the benefits in the firming charter market in 2015.  Having prospered through multiple growth cycles of the shipping industry, we believe we are very well positioned to continue our growth plan as market conditions present compelling opportunities.
Respectfully,

Dr. John Coustas 
President & CEO

Danaos is one of the world’s largest independent owners of containerships.



      Danaos Corporation is one of the largest independent owners of modern, large-size containerships. We charter our containerships on long-term contracts at fixed rates to many of the world's largest liner companies.
    

      Our distinct edge in advanced shipping technology and long track record of safety, efficiency, and environmental responsibility has helped us forge lasting relationships with our customers.
    

      Our conservative and disciplined
approach to fleet growth has positioned us to exploit market opportunities during
periods of low ship prices and reduced demand.
    






          Established in 1972 by Dimitris Coustas


Danaos has a long history of operating and investing in the shipping industry. Since 1993, when Dr. John Coustas assumed leadership of the company, our fleet has grown from three multi-purpose vessels to a focused fleet of 56 containerships with a carrying capacity of 353,586 TEU.

Danaos is one of the world’s largest independent owners of containerships.



      Danaos Corporation is one of the largest independent owners of modern, large-size containerships. We charter our containerships on long-term contracts at fixed rates to many of the world's largest liner companies.
    

      Our distinct edge in advanced shipping technology and long track record of safety, efficiency, and environmental responsibility has helped us forge lasting relationships with our customers.
    

      Our conservative and disciplined
approach to fleet growth has positioned us to exploit market opportunities during
periods of low ship prices and reduced demand.
    






          Established in 1972 by Dimitris Coustas


Danaos has a long history of operating and investing in the shipping industry. Since 1993, when Dr. John Coustas assumed leadership of the company, our fleet has grown from three multi-purpose vessels to a focused fleet of 56 containerships with a carrying capacity of 353,586 TEU.

Disciplined approach to growth with long term financial stability






				Danaos completed an extensive newbuilding program in 2012 and has since consolidated and optimized its fleet.
			

				Nine older vessels were sold in 2013 and an additional five were sold in 2014. Danaos is well positioned to make accretive acquisitions through its joint venture with Gemini Shipholdings.
			






				Our long term charters support a stable revenue stream.
			

				We have consistently achieved stable revenue and cash flow through our chartering strategy.  Our commitment to operational excellence and efficiency has made us a provider of choise to our partners and drives strong operating margins.
			






				Danaos’ high charter coverage protects the company’s free cash flow and limits market risk.
			

				Our fleet is contracted on long-term fixed rate charters, a strategy we have employed since the early 1990s. This has allowed us to sustain cyclical lows and positioned us to opportunistically expand our fleet.
			






				Our fleet is contracted to a diverse group of the world’s leading liner companies
			

				These relationships are built over decades and are predicated on our efficiency, reliability, and commitment to customer service.
