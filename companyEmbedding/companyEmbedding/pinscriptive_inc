Market Snapshot
Specialty Drugs account for 2% of all drugs sold, but by 2018 will be 50% of the spend for drugs. Pinscriptive uses advanced big-data analytics and collaborative approaches to identify the right drugs, for the right patient at the right time, therefore reducing cost and improving outcomes.  In essence, Pinscriptive will deliver evidence backed, value based decision support for at-risk providers and payers seeking to make the most appropriate specialty drug decision.
Customer Problem Solved

Managing Specialty Drugs: Precision Analytics Disrupt Old Ways 





Fixing Specialty Drugs 







Welcome to Pinscriptive



















EVIDENCE-BACKED. VALUE-BASED.
SPECIALTY DRUG DECISION SUPPORT



Specialty drug use and spending is out of control. In the US alone, spending on specialty drugs will quadruple to $400 billion by 2020.





Pinscriptive leverages Big Data analytics to identify the most clinically effective specialty medications at an optimal cost for a specific patient.





 We’re ushering in an era of precision analytics that will drive precision medicine – enabling the exact right drug, for the exact right patient, all at an optimized value.









Specialty Drug Cost is Out of Control
Specialty drugs account for just 2% of all medicines prescribed, yet they are on pace to comprise 50% of the drug spend in the next few years. Traditional approaches to drug utilization and cost management are simply not working. And biopharmaceutical pipelines are filled with new, high priced, innovative specialty drugs that continue to pressure health care budgets around the world.



Delivering Effective Outcomes
Pinscriptive is developing a unique big data analytics platform that combines real world clinical and economic cost data to recommend specialty drugs that produce the most effective health outcomes for patients at the best overall value.



A Solution for Innovative Specialty Medicines
Pinscriptive is giving payers, at-risk providers, physicians, and biopharmaceutical manufacturers the ability shift from a volume to a value model through precision analytics; eliminating inappropriate specialty drug use and lowering the overall cost burden on the healthcare system.
