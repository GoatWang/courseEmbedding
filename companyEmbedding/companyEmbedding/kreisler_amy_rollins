Champion of Change: Amy Rollins Kreisler
November 24, 2014










Amy Rollins Kreisler is a member of the board of directors and financial aid committee. As chair of the O. Wayne Rollins Foundation, she provided a $3.5 million grant that was instrumental in launching the campaign for a young adult campus. 
How does Skyland Trail change futures?
For many clients  – particularly young adults - Skyland Trail helps them realize that they have a future. Skyland Trail opens doors that once seemed close, and introduces opportunities that clients may never have felt capable of pursuing. Clients who engage in the program learn tools that will help them throughout the rest of their lives.
Why are you an advocate for mental health and Skyland Trail?
When you see what a difference Skyland Trail can make in someone’s life, you become passionate about being a part of a community working to support and empower people struggling with mental illness. The more you’re aware of the role mental health plays in so many problems, the more you want to make a difference and do what you can.
How will the planned expansion improve the capacity to change futures?
The new young adult campus and program will be a jewel in the crown that is Skyland Trail. It will make a huge impact in Atlanta and the Southeast, where there are few options for this age group and this type of recovery-focused treatment. The specialized campus and programming will put Skyland Trail on the forefront of treating young adults with mental illness, which is becoming nationally recognized as a critical need.

About Peer Rating
Martindale-Hubbell® Peer Review Ratings™ are the gold standard in attorney ratings, and have been for more than a century. These ratings indicate attorneys who are widely respected by their peers for their ethical standards and legal expertise in a specific area of practice.


The Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings process is the gold standard due to its objectivity and comprehensiveness. Lawyers solicited for peer reviews include both those selected by the attorney being reviewed and lawyers independently selected by Martindale-Hubbell. All reviewers are verified as attorneys through Martindale-Hubbell's extensive attorney database. Only attorneys practicing at least three years and receiving a sufficient number of reviews from non-affiliated attorneys are eligible to receive a Rating.
What are the different Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings?
AV Preeminent®: The highest peer rating standard. This rating signifies that a large number of the lawyer's peers rank him or her at the highest level of professional excellence for their legal knowledge, communication skills and ethical standards.
Distinguished: An excellent rating for a lawyer with some experience. This rating indicates the attorney is widely respected by their peers for high professional achievement and ethical standards.
Notable: This rating indicates that the lawyer has been recognized by a large number of their peers for strong ethical standards.
Lawyers who have received peer reviews after 2009 will display more detailed information, including practice areas, summary ratings, detailed numeric ratings and written feedback (if available). Details for individual reviews received before 2009 are not displayed.
Attorneys that receive reviews from their peers, but not a sufficient number to establish a Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Rating, will have those reviews display on our websites.
For more information on Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings™, please visit our Ratings Page on Martindale.com and our Frequently Asked Questions
Close ×




About Client Rating
The Martindale-Hubbell® Client Review Ratings™ display reviews submitted by clients of lawyers and law firms.


The Client Review Rating score is determined through aggregation of validated responses. People who submit reviews are clients of law firms who hired a lawyer within the last year, whose matter is not pending and who want to share their experience of that lawyer or law firm with other potential clients. Reviewers can be anyone who hires a lawyer including in-house counsel, corporate executives, small business owners and private individuals.
Martindale-Hubbell validates that the reviewer is a person with a valid email address. As part of the review process, respondents must affirm that they have been a client of the lawyer or law firm identified within the past year, although Martindale-Hubbell cannot confirm the lawyer/client relationship as it is often confidential. The content of the responses are entirely from client reviewers.
Prior results do not guarantee a similar outcome and Martindale-Hubbell accepts no responsibility for the content or accuracy of any review.
