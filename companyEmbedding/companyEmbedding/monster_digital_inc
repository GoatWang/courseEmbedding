Monster Digital, Inc. Key Developments

Monster Digital Announces Receipt Of Nasdaq Notice Of Bid Price Deficiency
Jun 20 17
Monster Digital, Inc. announced that on June 15, 2017, the Company received a letter from the Nasdaq Listings Qualifications department of the Nasdaq Capital Market (Nasdaq) notifying the Company that the minimum bid price per share for its common stock was below $1.00 for a period of thirty (30) consecutive business days and that the Company did not meet the minimum bid price requirement set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). The Nasdaq notification letter does not result in the immediate delisting of the Company’s common stock, and the stock will continue to trade uninterrupted Company management intends to resolve the situation to allow for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market. The Company has a compliance period of 180 calendar days, or until December 12, 2017, to regain compliance with Nasdaq’s minimum bid price requirement. If at any time during the 180-day compliance period, the closing bid price per share of the Company’s common stock is at least $1.00 for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days, Nasdaq will provide the Company a written confirmation of compliance and the matter will be closed. In the event the Company does not regain compliance with Rule 5550(a)(2) within this compliance period, it may be eligible for additional time to regain compliance. To qualify for the additional time, the Company will be required to meet the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares and all other initial listing standards, with the exception of the minimum bid price requirement, and will need to provide written notice of its intention to cure the deficiency during the second compliance period by effecting a reverse stock split, if necessary. If the Nasdaq staff concludes that the Company will not be able to cure the deficiency, or if the Company determines not to submit the required materials or make the required representations, the Company’s common stock will be subject to delisting by Nasdaq.


Monster Digital Announces Nasdaq's Acceptance of its Plan to Regain Compliance 
Jun 14 17
Monster Digital, Inc. announced that the Nasdaq Stock Market has accepted the Company's plan to regain compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) which will permit the continued listing of Monster Digital's stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market. As previously reported on April 17, 2017, Monster Digital received a letter from Nasdaq indicating that it was no longer in compliance with the minimum stockholders' equity requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market. Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) requires listed companies to maintain stockholders' equity of at least $2.5 million. In Monster Digital's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, it reported stockholders' equity of $2,488,000, which is below the minimum stockholders' equity required for continued listing pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1). Further, as of April 17, 2017, Monster Digital did not meet the alternative compliance standards relating to the market value of listed securities or net income from continuing operations and did not comply with the Nasdaq Listing Rules. On June 1, 2017, Monster Digital submitted to Nasdaq a plan to regain compliance with Nasdaq listing rules. Based on the Company's submission, Nasdaq has determined to grant the Company an extension of time to regain compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1). The terms of the extension are as follows: on or before October 16, 2017, the Company shall have demonstrated compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1)Rule by completing one or more of the transactions above and opt for one of the two following alternatives to evidence compliance with said listing Rule: Alternative 1: The Company must furnish to the SEC and Nasdaq a publicly available report (e.g., a Form 8-K) including: A disclosure of Staff's deficiency letter and the specific deficiency(ies) cited; A description of the completed transaction or event that enabled the Company to satisfy the stockholders' equity requirement for continued listing; An affirmative statement that, as of the date of the report, the Company believes it has regained compliance with the stockholders' equity requirement based upon the specific transaction or event referenced in Step 2; and A disclosure stating that Nasdaq will continue to monitor the Company's ongoing compliance with the stockholders' equity requirement and, if at the time of its next periodic report the Company does not evidence compliance, that it may be subject to delisting. Alternative 2: The Company must furnish to the SEC and Nasdaq a publicly available report including: Steps 1 & 2 set forth above; A balance sheet no older than 60 days with pro forma adjustments for any significant transactions or event occurring on or before the report date. The pro forma balance sheet must evidence compliance with the stockholders' equity requirement; and A disclosure that the Company believes it also satisfies the stockholders' equity requirement as of the report date and that Nasdaq will continue to monitor the Company's ongoing compliance with the stockholders' equity requirement and, if at the time of its next periodic report the Company does not evidence compliance, that it may be subject to delisting. Regardless of which alternative the Company chooses, if the Company fails to evidence compliance upon filing its Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2017 with the SEC and Nasdaq the Company may be subject to delisting. In the event the Company does not satisfy the terms, Nasdaq will provide written notification that its securities will be delisted. At that time, the Company may appeal Nasdaq's determination to a Listing Qualifications Panel. Nasdaq granted an exception to enable the Company to regain compliance with the listing rules.


Monster Digital Submits Plan With Nasdaq To Regain Compliance
Jun 2 17
Monster Digital, Inc. announced that it has submitted its plan to Nasdaq detailing how it will regain compliance with Nasdaq continued listing requirements. On April 17, 2017, Monster Digital received a letter from Nasdaq indicating that it was no longer in compliance with the minimum stockholders' equity requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market. Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) requires listed companies to maintain stockholders' equity of at least $2.5 million. In Monster Digital's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, it reported stockholders' equity of $2,488,000, which is below the minimum stockholders' equity required for continued listing pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1). Further, as of April 17, 2017, Monster Digital did not meet the alternative compliance standards relating to the market value of listed securities or net income from continuing operations and did not comply with the Nasdaq Listing Rules. If the plan is accepted, Nasdaq may grant Monster Digital an extension of up to 180 calendar days from the original non-compliance date of April 17, 2017, or until October 13, 2017, to regain compliance. The company's common stock will continue to trade on the Nasdaq Capital Market pending Nasdaq's review of the plan of compliance.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited interim financial statements and the notes to those financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Report.  Certain statements in this Report constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include statements, which involve risks and uncertainties, regarding, among other things, (a) our projected sales, profitability, and cash flows, (b) our growth strategy, (c) anticipated trends in our industry, (d) our future financing plans, and (e) our anticipated needs for, and use of, working capital. They are generally identifiable by use of the words "may," "will," "should," "anticipate," "estimate," "plan," "potential," "project," "continuing," "ongoing," "expects," "management believes," "we believe," "we intend," or the negative of these words or other variations on these words or comparable terminology. In light of these risks and uncertainties, there can be no assurance that the forward-looking statements contained in this filing will in fact occur. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.  The forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made and, except to the extent required by federal securities laws, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statements are made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.  The "Company", "we," "us," and "our," refer to Monster Digital, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary SDJ Technologies, Inc.  Overview  General  Our primary business focus is the design, development and marketing of premium products under the "Monster Digital" brand for use in high-performance computing and consumer and mobile product applications. We have invested significantly in building a broad distribution channel for the sale of products bearing the "Monster Digital" brand. Our current focus is to leverage our distribution network through cooperating with Monster, Inc. to identify and market additional specialty and consumer electronics products.  Currently, our primary product offerings are as follows:   A line of action sports cameras used in adventure sport, adventure photography and extreme-action videography.   A line of ultra-small mobile external memory drive products for Apple iOS devices.   On-The-Go Cloud devices on an exclusive basis which create a wi-fi hot spot for multiple users while simultaneously allowing data to be viewed, played or transferred among the connected storage.   A broad selection of high-value memory storage products consisting of high-end, ruggedized Solid State Drives ("SSDs"), removable flash memory CompactFlash cards ("CF cards"), secured digital cards ("SD cards") and USB flash drives.  Our license with Monster, Inc. allows us to manufacture and sell certain high-end products, utilizing the Monster premium brand name which is highly recognized by consumers for its high quality audio-video products. We work with our world-class subcontract manufacturers and suppliers to offer new and enhanced products that use existing technology and adopt new technologies to satisfy existing and emerging consumer demands and preferences. On the marketing side, we partner with Monster, Inc. to support the sales and marketing of these products on a global basis.  Historically, memory has been the most significant part of our business and it is a commodity that tends to be subject to price erosion. Using the Monster branding to quickly introduce new technologies to the market is designed to bring about the introduction of products that are not subject to the same level of downward pressure on pricing as is common with memory products. In addition, we intend to expand and continue to invest in our international operations, which we believe will be an important factor in our continued growth.  As a result of our strategy to increase our investments in sales, marketing, support, and international expansion, we expect to continue to incur operating losses and negative cash flows from operations at least in the near future and may require additional capital resources to execute strategic initiatives to grow our business.  Net sales  The principal factors that have affected or could affect our net sales from period to period are:   The condition of the economy in general and of the memory storage products industry in particular,   Our customers' adjustments in their order levels,   Changes in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors or suppliers,   The addition or termination of key supplier relationships,   The rate of introduction and acceptance by our customers of new products,   Our ability to compete effectively with our current and future competitors,   Our ability to enter into and renew key corporate and strategic relationships with our customers, vendors and strategic alliances,   Changes in foreign currency exchange rates,   A major disruption of our information technology infrastructure,   Unforeseen catastrophic events, such as armed conflict, terrorism, fires, typhoons and earthquakes, and   Any other disruptions, such as labor shortages, unplanned maintenance or other manufacturing problems.  Cost of goods sold  Cost of goods sold primarily includes the cost of products that we purchase from third party manufacturers and sell to our customers. Additional packaging and assembly (labor) costs for certain product orders is also a component of costs of goods sold. Cost of goods sold is also affected by inventory obsolescence if our inventory management is not effective or efficient. We mitigate the risk of inventory obsolescence by stocking relatively small amounts of inventory at any given time, and relying instead on a strategy of manufacturing or acquiring products based on orders placed by our customers.  General and administrative expenses  General and administrative expenses relate primarily to compensation and associated expenses for personnel in general management, information technology, human resources, procurement, planning and finance, as well as outside legal, investor relations, accounting, consulting and other operating expenses.  Selling and marketing expenses  Selling and marketing expenses relate primarily to salary and other compensation and associated expenses for internal sales and customer relations personnel, advertising, outbound shipping and freight costs, tradeshows, royalties under a brand license, and selling commissions.  Research and development expenses  Research and development expenses consist of compensation and associated costs of employees engaged in research and development projects, as well as materials and equipment used for these projects, and third party compensation for research and development services. We do not engage in any long-term research and development contracts, and all research and development costs are expensed as incurred.  Other expenses  Interest and finance expense includes interest paid or payable to a finance company for outstanding borrowings, bank fees, purchase order finance fees, interest accrued on convertible debt, amortization of a debt discount that arose as a result of the issuance of warrants with convertible debt, and amortization of debt issuance costs. Debt conversion expense is a non-cash charge for the effect of an induced conversion of debt to equity  Three Months ended March 31, 2017 Compared to Three Months ended March 31, 2016  Results of Operations  The following discussion explains in greater detail our consolidated operating results and financial condition. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes herein.  Three months ended March 31, 2017 2016  Net sales for the three months ended March 31, 2017 increased approximately 77% to $951,000 from $538,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2016. We are beginning to gain traction with our action sports camera line even as we significantly reduce sales of memory product. In the three months ended March 31, 2017, sales in our action sports camera line represented 87% of our total sales. In three months ended March 31, 2016, sales in our action sports camera line represented 24% of our total sales.   Three months ended March 31, 2017 2016 (in thousands) Cost of goods sold $ 998 $ 491 Gross profit (loss) $ (47 ) $ 47 Gross profit margin (4.9 )% 8.7 %  Cost of goods increased approximately 103%, which was greater than the increase in sales. As a percent of net sales, cost of goods sold was 104.9% in the three months ended March 31, 2017 as compared to 91.3% for the three months ended March 31, 2016. Gross profit in the three months ended March 31, 2017 decreased to ($47,000) from $47,000 in the three months ended March 31, 2016. Gross profit   Three months ended March 31, 2017 2016 (in thousands) Selling and marketing $ 700 $ 635 General and administrative $ 1,491 $ 992  Sales and marketing for the three months ended March 31, 2017 increased approximately 10%, to $700,000, compared to $635,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The increase in sales and marketing expense was significantly attributable to the increase in royalty expense as the Monster, Inc. royalty payment rate increased in the third quarter of 2016.  General and administrative expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2017 increased by approximately 50% to $1,491,000 compared to $992,000 in the three months ended March 31, 2016. There was an approximate $339,000 increase in stock-based compensation in the three months ended March 31, 2017 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016. In addition, there was an increase in legal expense since becoming a public company in July 2016.  Three months ended March 31, 2017 2016  R&D for the three months ended March 31, 2017 increased approximately 43% to $70,000, compared to $49,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The increase is most significantly related to having an employee who is working on new product procurement and design during the first quarter of 2017. With respect to our products, the basic functional technology we use has changed very little over time, therefore, our R&D spending has primarily related to enhancing existing functionality, introducing new functions within existing products, and designing and engineering new products largely with existing proven technology. Though we are in the process of product redesign, we do not expect that R&D costs as a percentage of sales will be significant for the foreseeable future.   Three months ended March 31, 2017 2016 (in thousands) Interest and finance expense $ 1 $ 252 Gain on settlement of customer refund (68 ) -  Interest expense for the three months ended March 31, 2016 included $237,000 of interest expense related to bridge financing that was converted to equity as part of the initial public offering in July 2016. Also during that period, we incurred interest expense related to accounts receivable factoring that is not being used during the three months ended March 31, 2017. Gain on settlement of customer refund of $68,000 is the amortization of a $340,000 deferred gain that resulted from a settlement agreement on a customer refund from fiscal 2012.  Three months ended March 31, 2017 2016 (in thousands)  Income tax expense generally consists of state income taxes due or paid in the states in which we operate. We have not recognized a deferred tax benefit for the operating losses generated during the periods due to the uncertainty that we will generate taxable income in the future that will allow us to utilize the benefit.  Financial Condition  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Our primary sources of liquidity throughout the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 have been our initial public offering, cash raised in private placements of common stock and collections on accounts receivable.  In June 2015, we secured an accounts receivable financing facility with Bay View Funding. The contract provides for maximum funding of $4.0 million and a factoring fee of 1.35% for the first 30 days and .45% for each 10-day period thereafter that the financed receivable remains outstanding. As of March 31, 2017, there was no balance owed on this facility. The facility automatically renews annually at year-end unless terminated with 30 days notice.  On July 13, 2016, we closed an initial public offering and received net proceeds of $8,151,000.  In November 2016, we issued 484,848 shares of common stock in a Private Placement receiving net proceeds of approximately $672,000.  In March 2017, the Company issued additional shares pursuant to a Private Placement Memorandum, issuing 273,478 shares receiving net proceeds of approximately $287,000  Discussion of Cash Flows Three months ended March 31, 2017 2016 Change (in thousands) Net cash used in operating activities $ (1,610 ) $ (747 ) $ (863 ) Net cash used in investing activities - - - Net cash provided by financing activities 307 670 (363 ) Net decrease in cash $ (1,303 ) $ (77 ) $ (1,226 )  Operating Activities  Net cash used in operating activities in the three months ended March 31, 2017 was approximately $1.6 million, due primarily to the net loss of $2.2 million. The loss as a use of cash was partially offset by non-cash stock-based compensation of $433,000, by using existing inventory for sales during the quarter and by a $399,000 increase in accounts payable. One other significant use of cash was a $547,000 reduction in an amount due to a customer. In the three months ended March 31, 2016, the use of cash for operating activities was primarily related to the net loss of $1.9 million partially offset by the collection of accounts receivable of $279,000, a decrease in inventory of $142,000 and a net increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $266,000.  Investing Activities  Our current operating structure does not depend upon a significant investment in capital equipment or operating facilities. Substantially all of our manufacturing is conducted offshore by third party manufacturers. Our office and warehouse facilities are leased under a three-year operating lease. For the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, we used no cash in investing activities.  Financing Activities  Net cash provided by financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was $307,000 and was attributable to issuance of common stock pursuant to a private placement memorandum. Net cash provided by financing activities in the three months ended March 31, 2016 was $670,000 and was attributable to bridge loan financing and preferred stock issuances during the first quarter of 2016.  Debt Instruments  As of March 31, 2017, debt instruments include two convertible notes payable with a total principal amount of $38,000 due in 2015 that remain unpaid.  Operating and Capital Expenditure Requirements  We have not achieved profitability since our inception and we expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future. We expect our cash expenditures to increase in the near term as we fund our future growth. As a publicly traded company we will incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we were not required to incur as a private company. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, and the Nasdaq Stock Market, requires public companies to implement specified corporate governance practices that are currently inapplicable to us as a private company. We expect these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly.  Our current cash balance is not sufficient to fund the operations for the next twelve months. As such, the Company believes that substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern exists. We will need to raise substantial additional financing in the future to fund our operations. In order to meet these additional cash requirements, we would likely need to sell additional equity or convertible securities that may result in dilution to our stockholders. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of convertible securities, these securities could have rights senior to those of our common stock and could contain covenants that restrict our operations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional equity or debt financing on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing agreements with third parties, it may be necessary to relinquish valuable rights to our product candidates, technologies or future revenue streams or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. For additional risks associated with our substantial capital requirement, please see "Risk Factors" in our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 31, 2017.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined by applicable SEC rules and regulations.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires that management make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, which are based upon historical experiences, market trends and financial forecasts and projections, and upon various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances at that certain point in time. Actual results may differ, significantly at times, from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.  We believe the following critical accounting policies and estimates affect the significant estimates and judgments we use in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, and may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than others.  Revenue recognition  Net sales (revenue) are recognized when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, when delivery has occurred, when the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and when collectability of the receivable is reasonably assured. These elements are met when title to the products is passed to the buyers, which is generally when product is delivered to the customer and the customer has accepted delivery.  Certain customers have limited rights of return and/or are entitled to price adjustments on products held in their inventory. We reduce net sales in the period of sale for estimates of product returns, price adjustments and other allowances. Our reserve estimates are based upon historical data as well as projections of sales, customer inventories, price adjustments, average selling prices and market conditions. Price protection is calculated on a product by product basis. The objective of price protection is to mitigate returns by providing retailers with credits to ensure maximum consumer sales. Price protection is granted to retailers after they have presented us an affidavit of existing inventory. Actual returns and adjustments could be significantly different from our estimates and provisions, resulting in an adjustment to net sales.  Inventories  Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost being determined on the weighted average cost method of accounting. We purchase finished goods and materials to assemble kits in quantities that we anticipate will be fully used in the near term. Changes in operating strategy, customer demand, and fluctuations in market values can limit our ability to effectively utilize all products purchased and can result in finished goods with above-market carrying costs which may cause losses on sales to customers. Our policy is to closely monitor inventory levels, obsolescence and lower market values compared to costs and, when necessary, reduce the carrying amount of inventory to market value. As of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, inventory on hand was comprised primarily of finished goods ready for sale and packaging materials.  Share-based compensation/Warrants valuation  We use the Black-Scholes model to determine the fair value of stock options and stock purchase warrants on the date of grant. The amount of compensation or other expense recognized using the Black-Scholes model requires us to exercise judgment and make assumptions relating to the factors that determine the fair value of our share-based grants. The fair value calculated by this model is a function of several factors, including the grant price, the expected future volatility, the expected term of the option or warrant and the risk-free interest rate correlating to the term of the option or warrant. The expected term is derived using the simplified method provided in Securities and Exchange Commission release Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 110 which averages an award's weighted average vesting period and contractual term for "plain vanilla" share options. The expected volatility is estimated by analyzing the historic volatility of similar public companies. The risk-free rate of return reflects the weighted average interest rate offered for US treasury rates over the expected life of options or warrants. The expected term and expected future volatility requires our judgment. In addition, we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize a cost or expense for those stock options or warrants expected to vest.  Fair value measurements  Fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. Fair value is based on a hierarchy of valuation techniques, which is determined on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our market assumptions. These two types of inputs create a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:  Level 1: Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.  Level 2: Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets.  Level 3: Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable.  All stock options are valued under methods of fair value under the Level 3 tier, as described above.  Factors included in the valuation of common stock, prior to the initial public offering, underlying stock options and warrants, include the present value of future cash flows, capital structure, valuation of comparable companies, existing licensing agreements and the growth prospects for our product line. These factors were incorporated into an income approach and a market approach in order to derive an overall valuation of our common stock of $5.49. Such a valuation is dependent upon estimates that are highly complex and subjective.  RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Coin collecting, model train building, slot car racing and rocket-launching can be very relaxing and rewarding hobbies. At Amazon.com, we carry all the supplies and kits you need to start a new and fulfilling pastime. Driving RC cars, planes and helicopters inspire hours of play outdoors, and the world of collecting is a great place to meet others who share your hobbies. 

For collectors of baseball cards, Magic the Gathering cards, paper money, vintage photographs, postcards and manuscript rejection slips, we carry every size of plastic binder slips you could need. They’re perfectly clear and sturdy so your treasures stay easy-to-see and protected.  Whether you’re just drawn to the esthetics of coins or you just plain love money, we also carry a variety of coin collecting supplies to make sure your Buffalo Nickel stays penned in and safe. 

Browse our die-cast vehicle collection and you’ll find aircrafts, excavators, military vehicles, Harley Davidson models and more. Or if you need a little more horse-power from your hobbies, check out our radio controlled vehicles. Our wide selection of RC vehicles includes helicopters, cars, planes, boats, motorcycles and more. Driving and flying RC vehicles are the perfect hobbies for young racing enthusiasts. Bring your vehicles to a skate park and see how many jumps and flips you can perform with them. 

But once you sign for all the supplies you need for your hobbies, what’s there to look forward to in the mail? Now you can replay the experience of receiving your Amazon.com packages again and again with our model UPS and USPS vehicles. Relive the excitement and anticipation whenever you need a pick-me-up with our highly detailed mail trucks.

Immersing yourself in your hobbies is a great way to unwind after a long work day. Hobbies can even open new worlds for you, like meeting fellow enthusiasts, developing common pastimes with loved ones, and even inspiring new careers.

Get your purchases fast with our free two-day shipping programThere's so much convenience when it comes to online shopping. It's easy to find exactly what you're looking for all in one place when you shop with Walmart online. Plus, you can see all the items that you want to purchase and know immediately whether they're in stock or not. However, two issues that arise   that you don't deal with when you're shopping in store   is that you sometimes have to wait several days to get your purchases or pay a higher additional fee to get your purchases shipped faster. However, thanks to Walmart, you don t have to deal with either problem. We offer free two-day shipping on millions of the items that we sell, and it's all available to you without joining a membership club or paying extra fees for the privilege. Combine this with our low prices, every day, on everything, and you can get the things you want quickly at prices that fit your budget.How Walmart's free two-day shipping worksWhen you're looking at our website to find the types of items that you're interested in purchasing, the first step is to look for the logo that says 2-Day Shipping on the product page. Many of these items will also state Free store pickup or Free store pickup today below the free shipping information. If you see these words on the product page for your item, you have the additional option to pick the item up for free at your chosen Walmart location or receive it at your designated location for free as long as you spend $35 or more. If your purchase is less than $35, you can upgrade to free shipping for $5.99.On the left-hand side of all the pages on our website, you'll see a section that section labeled Shipping & Pickup. Beneath that, you'll find the option for 2-Day Shipping. Click the radio button next to 2-Day Shipping and the page will reload, displaying only items that are available for free two-day shipping. As long as you place your order by 2 p.m., you can expect delivery in two business days. This means that, if you order your item after 2 p.m. on a Friday, you won't receive it until the following Wednesday. However, if you order it on Tuesday before 2 p.m., you can expect to get it by the following Friday. Keep in mind that weekends and holidays don't count as business days for shipping. Also, be sure to note that the 2 p.m. cutoff time is relative to the time zone where we're shipping your item from, not the time zone from where you're ordering it.Other shipping optionsRemember that any item that's marked with 2-Day Shipping on its page is also eligible for free shipping on qualifying purchase amounts. Most of these items are also eligible for in-store pickup   many of them that same day   even if you order after 2 p.m. If you select an item that's not eligible for our free two-day shipping program, there are many others that are eligible for free three- to five-day shipping. Again, this free shipping is only for purchases of $35 or more. Items that are part of this shipping promotion include Marketplace and freight items, but shipping costs are based on location on a case-by case basis for these products.If you're ordering an item that we're not shipping to you   but one of our trusted partners is   it's possible that they might offer free shipping too. However, it might not be for a specific time frame. To verify, check the shipping information found on the product page, located below the item's price.What you should know about the free two-day shipping programHere's some additional information about Walmart's free two-day shipping program:Residents of Hawaii and Alaska aren't eligible for the free 2-Day Shipping program; it's only available in the contiguous United StatesRecipients who have their packages sent to these locations   AA, AE, AK, AP, AS, FM, GU, HI, MP, PK, PW and VI or any APO or FPO in the continental U.S.   will receive free three- to five-day shipping for their items on purchases of more than $35.
