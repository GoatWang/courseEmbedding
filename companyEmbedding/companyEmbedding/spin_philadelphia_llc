The SPIN Tradition








A Loving Legacy


Community and the can-do spirit are in our DNA. In 1971, there were no summer programs serving children with developmental disabilities in Philadelphia. A group of parents in the city’s northeast neighborhoods demanded more for their children, so they organized to create it themselves. They joined forces with two special education teachers at their local public school, David and Trina Losinno. Together, they created Camp SPIN. David, Trina, and several of the camp’s early counselors became the organizations first leaders, growing SPIN over its first 40 years from a summer camp into a multi-faceted organization. Today, with new leaders who have been with SPIN since the early 80’s, SPIN serves over 3500 children and adults every year.

Members


SPIN membership is a forty-five year old tradition, dating back to the founders of SPIN. At that time parents, receiving no funding for services for their children, decided that they needed to do it themselves. Today families, staff and community participants make up our membership and help us to remain a strong organization.
SPIN members are the stakeholders of the organization and demonstrate that they are committed to the individuals we support. Members meet yearly in October to hear about the accomplishments and goals of our organization. SPIN members provide the foundation of our organization showing, by their contributions, that they are vested in maintaining and assuring quality services and a life of possibilities for everyone.

Kathleen Dougherty – Corporate Officer, Children’s Services
 

My name is Kathleen Dougherty but I am known to all as Katie. My husband Robert and I have three children, Bobby, Lynn and Joey. My connection with SPIN began in 1980 when my oldest son, Bobby, was born with Downs Syndrome. Within two weeks of his birth our family established a connection with SPIN that still exists. We began as service recipients and when it came time for Bobby to move from SPIN to School age services I couldn’t break the connection.
 
Prior to Bobby’s birth I was an elementary school teacher who planned to stay home and care for my children. When I decided to return to work I applied for a teacher’s aide position at SPIN and the rest is history. Over time I moved up the career ladder. I have held nine different positions in the Children’s Services Department and I am now the Corporate Officer of Children’s Services.
During my time at SPIN I completed by Bachelor’s Degree in Elementary Education at Chestnut Hill College and my Master’s Degree in Education Leadership from Arcadia University. I have seen the Children’s Services Department expand both the number of children we serve and the types of services we provide to support our agency’s mission to designed supports and services for children that are inclusive.
 
My experiences as a parent of a child that received Early Intervention Services and an adult son with intellectual disabilities and my professional experience in both direct service and supervisory service has provided me with the ability to see things from a variety of perspectives. By sharing my life’s experiences I facilitate the development of services that address the needs of the families we support.
