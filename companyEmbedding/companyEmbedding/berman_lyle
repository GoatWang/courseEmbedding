 LONG HISTORY IN LEATHER 1899: Berman Brothers Fur, Wool and Hides is founded by brothers David, Ephraim and Alexander Berman.
Late 1920s: David Berman's son, Nathan, takes over management.
1946: Wearing fur is unpopular after World War II, and the store is reinvented as Berman Buckskin, with fringed deerskin jackets and Indian motifs marketed to tourists.


1967: Berman Brothers Fur Co. downsizes its wholesale trade, shifting to a retail operation.
1972: The Bermans expand into leather specialty shops, including hotels and shopping malls. Within four years there are 19 Berman Buckskin stores in four states.
1979: W.R. Grace & Co. acquires Berman Brothers. Lyle Berman (grandson of David, son of Nathan) becomes president.
1987: Lyle Berman takes the company private in a $99.3 million leveraged buyout.
1988: The 163-store chain is sold to CVS New York Inc., (previously Melville Corp.) for $220 million. Melville merges Berman with its Wilsons House of Suede, forming Wilsons the Leather Experts Inc., the name that exists today.
1992: Wilsons the Leather Experts buys Snyder Leather.
1993: Wilsons acquires Georgetown Leather Design. With 631 stores under its umbrella, sales hit $600 million.
1996: Lyle Berman and Wilsons management take the company private for the second time, for $67.8 million.
1997: Wilsons goes public.
2001: Wilsons buys privately held Bentley's Luggage Corp., which sells travel products at 106 stores, for an undisclosed sum as part of a plan to reach $1 billion in sales.
2002: The travel stores lose $26.4 million in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks, and Wilsons closes 135 outlets.
2004: Wilsons shuts 111 underperforming stores and cuts 950 jobs. In April, Peninsula Investment Partners of Charlottesville, Va., and two affiliates of Quaker Capital Management of Pittsburgh invest $35 million for 17.9 million shares of stock.
2005: In April, Lyle Berman resigns from the board of directors, the last tie to a business begun by his grandfather.
2007: In June, Wilsons gets another infusion from private equity investors. This time, it's for a total of $45 million.

                                                                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                    
                        
                                                                                        Sources: Star Tribune archives, Lyle Berman, SEC filings, referenceforbusiness.com

Business[edit]
Berman grew up in Minnesota and attended the University of Minnesota where he was graduated in 1964 with a degree in business administration. He then went to work for his father's leather business, Berman Buckskin. When the business was sold to W. R. Grace in 1979, he stayed on as president and CEO. The company was then later sold to the Melville Corporation where it became Wilsons Leather. From 1994 to 2000 he was the chairman and CEO of the Rainforest Cafe chain of restaurants and retail stores.[1]
Berman also played an important role in gaming companies. In 1990 he was a co-founder of Grand Casinos, a company that sought to create gambling establishments outside of Las Vegas and Atlantic City. Grand Casinos' Native American casino holdings were spun off into a new company, Lakes Entertainment, and Berman was named CEO. Additionally, Berman is the chairman of the board of the World Poker Tour and Pokertek.[1]
He won the B'nai B'rith Great American Traditions award in 1995 and the Gaming Executive of the Year award in 1996.
Berman was one of the many investors victimized by the massive Ponzi scheme of Bernie Madoff, though his actual losses are unknown.[2]
Poker[edit]
Berman has won 3 World Series of Poker (WSOP) bracelets and is a member of the Poker Hall of Fame.
In 2005, Lyle Berman competed in the National Heads Up Championship. He finished in fifth place losing to eventual champion Phil Hellmuth Jr. in the quarterfinals.
Although he prefers high-stakes cash games, he has as of 2009 won over $2,500,000 in live poker tournaments.[3] His 16 cashes at the WSOP account for $1,446,317 of those winnings.[4] He was inducted into the Poker Hall of Fame in 2002.
According to the James McManus book Positively Fifth Street, Berman has bankrolled T. J. Cloutier in numerous poker tournaments, including the 2000 WSOP main event, where he finished 2nd. The book All-In is about Berman's life.[5]
Berman currently resides in Plymouth, Minnesota and has 4 children.

Publications[edit]
Berman co-authored I'm All In : Lyle Berman and the Birth of the World Poker Tour (ISBN 1-58042-176-8) with Marvin Karlins. The autobiography details Berman's life from his childhood to his life as an adult, covering his business ventures, his opinions on poker and Las Vegas, and his experiences with designing and developing the World Poker Tour into what it is today.

Business[edit]
Berman grew up in Minnesota and attended the University of Minnesota where he was graduated in 1964 with a degree in business administration. He then went to work for his father's leather business, Berman Buckskin. When the business was sold to W. R. Grace in 1979, he stayed on as president and CEO. The company was then later sold to the Melville Corporation where it became Wilsons Leather. From 1994 to 2000 he was the chairman and CEO of the Rainforest Cafe chain of restaurants and retail stores.[1]
Berman also played an important role in gaming companies. In 1990 he was a co-founder of Grand Casinos, a company that sought to create gambling establishments outside of Las Vegas and Atlantic City. Grand Casinos' Native American casino holdings were spun off into a new company, Lakes Entertainment, and Berman was named CEO. Additionally, Berman is the chairman of the board of the World Poker Tour and Pokertek.[1]
He won the B'nai B'rith Great American Traditions award in 1995 and the Gaming Executive of the Year award in 1996.
Berman was one of the many investors victimized by the massive Ponzi scheme of Bernie Madoff, though his actual losses are unknown.[2]
Poker[edit]
Berman has won 3 World Series of Poker (WSOP) bracelets and is a member of the Poker Hall of Fame.
In 2005, Lyle Berman competed in the National Heads Up Championship. He finished in fifth place losing to eventual champion Phil Hellmuth Jr. in the quarterfinals.
Although he prefers high-stakes cash games, he has as of 2009 won over $2,500,000 in live poker tournaments.[3] His 16 cashes at the WSOP account for $1,446,317 of those winnings.[4] He was inducted into the Poker Hall of Fame in 2002.
According to the James McManus book Positively Fifth Street, Berman has bankrolled T. J. Cloutier in numerous poker tournaments, including the 2000 WSOP main event, where he finished 2nd. The book All-In is about Berman's life.[5]
Berman currently resides in Plymouth, Minnesota and has 4 children.

Business[edit]
Berman grew up in Minnesota and attended the University of Minnesota where he was graduated in 1964 with a degree in business administration. He then went to work for his father's leather business, Berman Buckskin. When the business was sold to W. R. Grace in 1979, he stayed on as president and CEO. The company was then later sold to the Melville Corporation where it became Wilsons Leather. From 1994 to 2000 he was the chairman and CEO of the Rainforest Cafe chain of restaurants and retail stores.[1]
Berman also played an important role in gaming companies. In 1990 he was a co-founder of Grand Casinos, a company that sought to create gambling establishments outside of Las Vegas and Atlantic City. Grand Casinos' Native American casino holdings were spun off into a new company, Lakes Entertainment, and Berman was named CEO. Additionally, Berman is the chairman of the board of the World Poker Tour and Pokertek.[1]
He won the B'nai B'rith Great American Traditions award in 1995 and the Gaming Executive of the Year award in 1996.
Berman was one of the many investors victimized by the massive Ponzi scheme of Bernie Madoff, though his actual losses are unknown.[2]
Poker[edit]
Berman has won 3 World Series of Poker (WSOP) bracelets and is a member of the Poker Hall of Fame.
In 2005, Lyle Berman competed in the National Heads Up Championship. He finished in fifth place losing to eventual champion Phil Hellmuth Jr. in the quarterfinals.
Although he prefers high-stakes cash games, he has as of 2009 won over $2,500,000 in live poker tournaments.[3] His 16 cashes at the WSOP account for $1,446,317 of those winnings.[4] He was inducted into the Poker Hall of Fame in 2002.
According to the James McManus book Positively Fifth Street, Berman has bankrolled T. J. Cloutier in numerous poker tournaments, including the 2000 WSOP main event, where he finished 2nd. The book All-In is about Berman's life.[5]
Berman currently resides in Plymouth, Minnesota and has 4 children.

Board of Directors
Bradley Berman - Chairman of the Board
Bradley Berman has been a director of Black Ridge Oil & Gas since our inception and began serving as the company’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer in November 2010. Under Mr. Berman's stewardship, Black Ridge Oil & Gas accumulated our initial 10,000 net mineral acres in North Dakota & Montana’s Bakken & Three Forks play. Having successfully launched the company into the oil & gas business, Mr. Berman recruited a seasoned energy executive, Mr. Ken DeCubellis, to take his place as Black Ridge Oil & Gas' new CEO in November 2011. Mr. Berman’s introduction to the industry came by way of his role as a board member of Ante4, Inc. (previously, WPT), a position he held since 2004. Mr. Berman was instrumental in navigating Ante4 into a merger with Plains Energy, which resulted in the creation of Voyager Oil & Gas, Inc. Mr. Berman served on the board of Voyager until he assumed the role of CEO at Black Ridge Oil & Gas in November 2010. Mr. Berman is President of King Show Games, Inc., a gaming development company he founded in 1998. Between 1992 and 2004, Mr. Berman worked in various capacities at Grand Casinos, Inc. and then Lakes Entertainment, Inc., achieving the position of Vice President of Gaming. Mr. Berman is a fourth generation entrepreneur - his family has launched successful businesses in a variety of opportunistic industries.
Benjamin Oehler - Independent Director
Benjamin S. Oehler has been a director of Black Ridge Oil & Gas since November 16, 2010, and chairman of our audit committee and compensation committee since February 22, 2011.  From 1999 to 2007, Mr. Oehler served as President and Chief Executive Officer of Waycrosse, Inc., a financial advisory firm for the family owners of Cargill Incorporated.  While at Waycrosse, Mr. Oehler played a key role in two major growth initiatives for Cargill: the merger of Cargill’s fertilizer business into a public company which is now Mosaic, Inc., and the transformation of Cargill’s proprietary financial markets trading group into two major investment management companies: Black River Asset Management, LLC and CarVal Investors, LLC.  Prior to joining Waycrosse, Mr. Oehler was an investment banker for Piper Jaffray.  By the time he left Piper Jaffray in 1999, he was group head of Piper’s Industrial Growth Team.  He has also played a leadership role in a number of corporate buy-outs and venture stage companies, served on corporate and non-profit boards of directors, and has been involved in the creation and oversight of foundations and charitable organizations, as well as U.S. trusts and off-shore entities. Mr. Oehler has been a board member of many companies and non-profit organizations and recently completed the Stanford University Law School Directors Forum, a three-day update on key issues facing corporate directors presented by the Stanford Business School and Stanford Law School.  
Joseph Lahti - Independent Director
Joseph Lahti is a Minneapolis native and leader in numerous Minnesota business and community organizations. As principal of JL Holdings since 1989, Mr. Lahti has provided funding and management leadership to several early-stage or distressed companies. Mr. Lahti currently serves Chairman of the Board of PokerTek, Inc., a publicly traded company, and as an independent board member of AFAM/Innealta. Within the past five years Mr. Lahti served on the board of directors of Zomax Inc. and Voyager Oil & Gas, Inc., and more than five years ago Mr. Lahti served as the chairman of the board of directors of Shuffle Master, Inc. Through his public company board experience, he has participated on, and chaired, both audit and compensation committees. Mr. Lahti graduated from Harvard University in 1982 with a bachelor’s degree in economics, After graduating, Mr. Lahti completed a 12-month commercial lending training program at First Bank Minneapolis before working with Syncronamics, Inc., where he specialized in scheduling and staffing-level consulting at Hughes Aircraft and Pac Tel. He joined CIGNA Financial Services as a financial counselor in 1985 and left to become president of McQuillan Lahti and Associates in 1989. At both firms, he advised business owners in the areas of tax, investment, insurance, and succession planning strategies and related product selection. From 1993 to 2002, Mr. Lahti held the positions of chief operating officer, president, chief executive officer, and chairman at Shuffle Master, Inc., a company that provides innovative products to the gaming industry.

Lyle Berman is a 1964 graduate of the University of Minnesota with a degree in Business Administration. Mr. Lyle Berman began his career with Berman Buckskin, his family's leather business. He helped grow the business into a major specialty retailer with 27 outlets. In 1990, Mr. Lyle Berman participated in the founding of Grand Casinos, Inc.

Business[edit]
Berman grew up in Minnesota and attended the University of Minnesota where he was graduated in 1964 with a degree in business administration. He then went to work for his father's leather business, Berman Buckskin. When the business was sold to W. R. Grace in 1979, he stayed on as president and CEO. The company was then later sold to the Melville Corporation where it became Wilsons Leather. From 1994 to 2000 he was the chairman and CEO of the Rainforest Cafe chain of restaurants and retail stores.[1]
Berman also played an important role in gaming companies. In 1990 he was a co-founder of Grand Casinos, a company that sought to create gambling establishments outside of Las Vegas and Atlantic City. Grand Casinos' Native American casino holdings were spun off into a new company, Lakes Entertainment, and Berman was named CEO. Additionally, Berman is the chairman of the board of the World Poker Tour and Pokertek.[1]
He won the B'nai B'rith Great American Traditions award in 1995 and the Gaming Executive of the Year award in 1996.
Berman was one of the many investors victimized by the massive Ponzi scheme of Bernie Madoff, though his actual losses are unknown.[2]
Poker[edit]
Berman has won 3 World Series of Poker (WSOP) bracelets and is a member of the Poker Hall of Fame.
In 2005, Lyle Berman competed in the National Heads Up Championship. He finished in fifth place losing to eventual champion Phil Hellmuth Jr. in the quarterfinals.
Although he prefers high-stakes cash games, he has as of 2009 won over $2,500,000 in live poker tournaments.[3] His 16 cashes at the WSOP account for $1,446,317 of those winnings.[4] He was inducted into the Poker Hall of Fame in 2002.
According to the James McManus book Positively Fifth Street, Berman has bankrolled T. J. Cloutier in numerous poker tournaments, including the 2000 WSOP main event, where he finished 2nd. The book All-In is about Berman's life.[5]
Berman currently resides in Plymouth, Minnesota and has 4 children.

Business[edit]
Berman grew up in Minnesota and attended the University of Minnesota where he was graduated in 1964 with a degree in business administration. He then went to work for his father's leather business, Berman Buckskin. When the business was sold to W. R. Grace in 1979, he stayed on as president and CEO. The company was then later sold to the Melville Corporation where it became Wilsons Leather. From 1994 to 2000 he was the chairman and CEO of the Rainforest Cafe chain of restaurants and retail stores.[1]
Berman also played an important role in gaming companies. In 1990 he was a co-founder of Grand Casinos, a company that sought to create gambling establishments outside of Las Vegas and Atlantic City. Grand Casinos' Native American casino holdings were spun off into a new company, Lakes Entertainment, and Berman was named CEO. Additionally, Berman is the chairman of the board of the World Poker Tour and Pokertek.[1]
He won the B'nai B'rith Great American Traditions award in 1995 and the Gaming Executive of the Year award in 1996.
Berman was one of the many investors victimized by the massive Ponzi scheme of Bernie Madoff, though his actual losses are unknown.[2]
Poker[edit]
Berman has won 3 World Series of Poker (WSOP) bracelets and is a member of the Poker Hall of Fame.
In 2005, Lyle Berman competed in the National Heads Up Championship. He finished in fifth place losing to eventual champion Phil Hellmuth Jr. in the quarterfinals.
Although he prefers high-stakes cash games, he has as of 2009 won over $2,500,000 in live poker tournaments.[3] His 16 cashes at the WSOP account for $1,446,317 of those winnings.[4] He was inducted into the Poker Hall of Fame in 2002.
According to the James McManus book Positively Fifth Street, Berman has bankrolled T. J. Cloutier in numerous poker tournaments, including the 2000 WSOP main event, where he finished 2nd. The book All-In is about Berman's life.[5]
Berman currently resides in Plymouth, Minnesota and has 4 children.

Publications[edit]
Berman co-authored I'm All In : Lyle Berman and the Birth of the World Poker Tour (ISBN 1-58042-176-8) with Marvin Karlins. The autobiography details Berman's life from his childhood to his life as an adult, covering his business ventures, his opinions on poker and Las Vegas, and his experiences with designing and developing the World Poker Tour into what it is today.

Additionally, Berman is the chairman of the board of the World Poker Tour and Pokertek.[1]
He won the B'nai B'rith Great American Traditions award in 1995 and the Gaming Executive of the Year award in 1996.
Berman was one of the many investors victimized by the massive Ponzi scheme of Bernie Madoff, though his actual losses are unknown.[2]
Poker[edit]
Berman has won 3 World Series of Poker (WSOP) bracelets and is a member of the Poker Hall of Fame.
In 2005, Lyle Berman competed in the National Heads Up Championship. He finished in fifth place losing to eventual champion Phil Hellmuth Jr. in the quarterfinals.
Although he prefers high-stakes cash games, he has as of 2009 won over $2,500,000 in live poker tournaments.[3] His 16 cashes at the WSOP account for $1,446,317 of those winnings.[4] He was inducted into the Poker Hall of Fame in 2002.
According to the James McManus book Positively Fifth Street, Berman has bankrolled T. J. Cloutier in numerous poker tournaments, including the 2000 WSOP main event, where he finished 2nd. The book All-In is about Berman's life.[5]
Berman currently resides in Plymouth, Minnesota and has 4 children.

Business[edit]
Berman grew up in Minnesota and attended the University of Minnesota where he was graduated in 1964 with a degree in business administration. He then went to work for his father's leather business, Berman Buckskin. When the business was sold to W. R. Grace in 1979, he stayed on as president and CEO. The company was then later sold to the Melville Corporation where it became Wilsons Leather. From 1994 to 2000 he was the chairman and CEO of the Rainforest Cafe chain of restaurants and retail stores.[1]
Berman also played an important role in gaming companies. In 1990 he was a co-founder of Grand Casinos, a company that sought to create gambling establishments outside of Las Vegas and Atlantic City. Grand Casinos' Native American casino holdings were spun off into a new company, Lakes Entertainment, and Berman was named CEO. Additionally, Berman is the chairman of the board of the World Poker Tour and Pokertek.[1]
He won the B'nai B'rith Great American Traditions award in 1995 and the Gaming Executive of the Year award in 1996.
Berman was one of the many investors victimized by the massive Ponzi scheme of Bernie Madoff, though his actual losses are unknown.[2]
Poker[edit]
Berman has won 3 World Series of Poker (WSOP) bracelets and is a member of the Poker Hall of Fame.
In 2005, Lyle Berman competed in the National Heads Up Championship. He finished in fifth place losing to eventual champion Phil Hellmuth Jr. in the quarterfinals.
Although he prefers high-stakes cash games, he has as of 2009 won over $2,500,000 in live poker tournaments.[3] His 16 cashes at the WSOP account for $1,446,317 of those winnings.[4] He was inducted into the Poker Hall of Fame in 2002.
According to the James McManus book Positively Fifth Street, Berman has bankrolled T. J. Cloutier in numerous poker tournaments, including the 2000 WSOP main event, where he finished 2nd. The book All-In is about Berman's life.[5]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
