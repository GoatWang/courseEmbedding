Product Description

Intermediate Accounting by James D Stice is available now for quick shipment to any US location and this book can be substituted for ISBN 1133957919 or ISBN 9781133957911 or the more current 19th edition. You will save lots of cash by using this 17th edition which is nearly identical to the newer editions. We have been selling books online for over ten years and we have learned how to save students from the inflated costs of textbooks especially when the updated editions do not contain substantial changes and typically are nearly identical in every way.

Overview

INTERMEDIATE ACCOUNTING, 19th Edition, takes a user/decision-making approach combined with the necessary coverage of GAAP and IFRS which prepares students to understand accounting in terms of the activities of a business, which reflects the broadening definition of accounting today. This edition has a particular focus on codification and includes a thorough integration of today's hot topics, and a robust selection of student and instructor resources. The blend of the core concepts of accounting principles with procedural applications is an approach that is supplemented by online tutorial activities along with CengageNOW, an online homework tool.

Features & Benefits
{{collapseContainerClosed['features'] ? 'Show More' : 'Show Less'}}




Caution and FYI Boxes: Found throughout each chapter, these boxed features frequently emphasize additional points of interest or provide crucial cautions.
The text has been updated to reflect the latest changes in accounting standards, practices, and techniques. The information about real-life companies has been revised to account for recent changes in financial statements and other company reports.
A FASB Codification feature, found in each chapter, is designed to help students understand how to use the FASB's codification research. The feature provides an ethical issue for students to discuss and analyze using FASB standards, with the answer provided at the end of the chapter.
Additional coverage of fair value accounting has been added in Part 1 to follow Time Value of Money Review.
Additional coverage of International Financial Reporting Standards has been added throughout the book (and in Chapter 22 specifically) to reflect the changing nature of the financial reporting environment.
Opening Scenario Questions: Critical-thinking questions follow each company chapter opener, with solutions provided at the end of the chapter so that students can check their answers as they think about how they would respond to accounting-related issues that businesses face.
How and Why Framework: Following each learning objective, the authors provide additional reinforcement of the critical concepts by highlighting the procedural aspects (the "how") as well as the context (or "why") to which the concepts are applied. As students move through the chapter, they gain a greater understanding of both elements and can rationalize why businesses account for things the way they do. To further stress and show this framework as students read the chapter, relevant narrative is flagged by a design element to denote the "why."
Cumulative Spreadsheet Assignment: Found in the case section and featured at the end of Chapters 2 through 22, the cumulative spreadsheet assignment allows students to demonstrate and reinforce their understanding of the chapter topics by creating a spreadsheet that allows numerous variables to be modified and their effects to be monitored.
