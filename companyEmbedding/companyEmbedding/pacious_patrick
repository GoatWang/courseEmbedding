ROCKVILLE, MD—Choice Hotels International Inc. has appointed Patrick Pacious as president and CEO, effective January 1, 2018.
Pacious currently serves as president and COO, and will succeed CEO Stephen Joyce. Joyce will continue in his role as CEO through the end of the year, after which he will assume the role of VP of the board of directors. Pacious is expected to join the board in September. Over the past several years, Joyce has collaborated with the board to identify and prepare his successor, the company said. The board and Joyce identified Pacious as the right person to lead Choice into the future.
"Under Steve's tenure as CEO, Choice Hotels has grown stronger. We are grateful for Steve's leadership, passion for talent development, and his legacy of innovation and growth over the better part of a decade," said Stewart Bainum, Jr., chairman of the board of directors. "When Steve joined Choice as CEO, he was immediately impressed with Pat's strengths and talents, and by enhancing Pat's roles over the years, Steve ensured that Pat is the clear choice to succeed him. Pat demonstrates exceptional vision, and has spearheaded innovations that cement our position as a hospitality and technology leader and pioneer, while further strengthening our strategic differentiation and our core values."
"Choice is in a great position with an amazing leadership team, and I am proud of the outstanding achievements that we have accomplished during my tenure. I expect the company will continue to lead the industry with innovations and technology with Pat as CEO," stated Joyce. "Pat is a natural leader, and I fully endorse the board's decision to appoint him to the helm of Choice Hotels at this time. We have worked closely together since I joined the company in 2008. I believe his strategic thinking and vision will continue to drive growth and profitability for the company. Our shareholders, franchisees, developers, partners and associates are in good hands."
Pacious joined Choice in 2005. Under Pacious' direction, Choice built global technology platforms that resulted in improved profitability and efficiencies for the company's franchised hotel owners, according to the brand. He has led strategies and growth initiatives around brand, marketing, development, franchise services, revenue management and performance analytics. This includes the company's significant growth in the upscale segment with both Cambria Hotels and The Ascend Hotel Collection, as well as the transformation of the Comfort brand. During his tenure at Choice Hotels, Pacious has held roles of increasing responsibility, was appointed COO in January 2014 and additionally became president in May 2016. Previously, he held senior management consulting positions with BearingPoint and Arthur Andersen, during which time he was engaged on several projects for Choice, and is a former U.S. Navy officer.

We have a strong performance-based culture that focuses on agility and speed, creating momentum and opportunity for the company, franchisees, associates and shareholders. I am honored by the confidence that the board and Steve have placed in me, and I look forward to strengthening Choice Hotels' position as an industry leader," said Pacious. "Business is strong.

With Rise in Travel Spending, Dreams Can Come True
        I took a summer vacation to Alaska. This natural beauty of a state might be our 49th, but it was my 50th. Why all this talk of my summer vacation? Well, Allianz Global Assistance (AGA) just released data earlier this week saying that Americans are spending more on summer vacations this year, topping $100 billion for the first time in the AGA survey’s eight-year history. This represents a 12.5% increase over last year.

Rockville, Md.—Choice Hotels International recently promoted two executives and announced a planned transition of the CFO position. COO Patrick Pacious has been promoted to President & COO.

Expert Q&A

            Interview: Choice Hotels COO Patrick Pacious




March 26, 2015











Share








































Patrick Pacious 
Choice Hotels International rapidly is expanding
its portfolio, with 478 hotels opened worldwide in 2014 and another 603 under
construction, approved for development or awaiting conversion as of January
2015. Choice COO and executive vice president Patrick Pacious spoke with BTN lodging editor Julie Sickel about
Choice's shift in attention toward corporate travel.How is Choice reaching out to corporate clients?We're really transitioning the company to more of a business travel company that corporate travel managers will look to book their clients. If you look at where we're headed in the upscale segment, which is where the largest demand is, we're really focused on our Cambria Hotels & Suites and Ascend Hotel Collection brands, which are most attractive to the business traveler. In Cambria's case, in particular, we're opening hotels in key business traveler locations. This past year, we opened a property next to the Walter E. Washington Convention Center in Washington, D.C. We opened one in White Plains, N.Y. We've got two opening in New York City in the next several months, and we just had the grand opening of our Plano, Texas, property.What aspects of those two brands are aimed at
business travelers?They feature larger lobbies that are really focused on a more social atmosphere and that enable guests to conduct meetings. The other piece is in the guest room itself; it's a larger room, and it feels like an upgrade to consumers who come in and see the product. It has separate living space, separate workspace and separate sleeping space, so if a business traveler wants to do work in the hotel room, the environment is amenable to that. We've paid attention to media hub technology in the Cambria hotel rooms, which gives guests the ability to bring any type of media to life in that space.Are those the only brands you're gearing toward
corporate travel?We're doing the same thing in our Comfort brand
with both Comfort Suites and Comfort Inn. We've significantly rejuvenated that
brand over the last couple of years. We did about 300 renovations in 2014
alone. All that work got completed in the fall in time for peak business travel
season, and we're starting to see great feedback. A lot of it has to do with
design elements, such as recharging stations at the desktop and recharging
stations by the bedside; those are key things that our business travelers asked
for and that we're delivering on.What business travel demographic are you going
after?Our Comfort brand is aimed at the midscale to
upper-midscale business traveler. Where those hotels are located is really
designed to meet that demographic; we have a lot of manufacturers'
representatives, transportation industry-type corporate clients, clients who
have multiple distribution companies. With 5,300 hotels across the United
States, we're a company that can accommodate a nationwide business. Cambria and
Ascend are geared more toward that upscale, meeting-frequency business traveler,
the individuals who don't travel enough to get to the elite levels of the
rewards programs at other hotel companies. We've designed both Cambria itself
and our rewards program to make it faster and easier to earn a free night, to
earn upgrades, to earn rewards. Our goal is to make it so those rewards can be
redeemed for services a business traveler would use at our properties, such as
dining services.What's the breakdown of corporate and leisure
business?We're about two-thirds leisure and one-third
business in our domestic portfolio. If you look at Cambria and Ascend, our
upscale segment, that corporate piece is much higher. In our international
portfolio, it's almost reversed, with about two-thirds business and one-third
leisure.What about group versus transient business?Of that one-third domestic business piece, about
one-third of that is group business and two-thirds is transient. We are seeing
group come back in a significant way, and we're putting our Cambria and Ascend
hotels in major group travel markets; we expect that business to increase
significantly. We've changed our loyalty program to be more amenable to meeting
planners, and we've changed our website now to allow much larger groups to book
on the website itself.What are you focused on in the year ahead?We're really focused on attracting midweek business. It's a real opportunity for us to go after a significant segment that's rebounding. We're seeing the demand at the upscale level exceeding supply, so our goal is to attract that business and drive it to our hotels. We know when consumers come into a Cambria Suites and see it, they're really wowed by the product, and so another focus for us is getting that initial trial from a business traveler.
