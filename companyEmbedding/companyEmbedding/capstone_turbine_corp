Capstone Turbine Reports Select Preliminary Q1 Fiscal 2018 Financial Results




















July 17, 2017 08:30 ET

 | Source: Capstone Turbine Corporation






Book-to-Bill Ratio Continues to be Strong on New Energy Efficiency Projects Low Cash Usage on Working Capital Management, Expense Controls and Financing Activities Q1 Fiscal 2018 Financial Results Webcast to be Held August 9, 2017 at 1:45 PM PT, 4:45 PM ET CHATSWORTH, Calif., July  17, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --  In a continued effort to increase investor transparency, Capstone Turbine Corporation (www.capstoneturbine.com) (NASDAQ:CPST), the world’s leading clean technology manufacturer of microturbine energy systems, announced its select preliminary first quarter financial results. Orders for new products were strong for the second straight quarter with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.3 to 1 for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 preliminarily indicating a rebound in the business. Capstone booked $35.9 million in new product orders for the six month period ended June 30, 2017 compared to $20.4 million in the preceding six months. Capstone reported that its cash usage, excluding net proceeds from equity transactions, during the first quarter of fiscal 2018 was $2.7 million lower compared to the same period last year on similar quarterly revenue. Preliminary revenue for the first quarter was approximately $19.2 million compared to $19.1 million in the same period a year ago. The continued improvement in cash usage on similar revenue was achieved by a combined improvement in working capital management and tighter control of expenses. In addition, Capstone set a new record for its Factory Protection Plan (FPP) service contract revenue of approximately $3.7 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 which is an increase of 12% over the same period last year. Capstone has identified growth of its FPP business as a critical part of its profitability plan given the recurring revenue generated by FPP service contracts which typically have higher margins. Darren Jamison, President and Chief Executive Officer of Capstone Turbine said, “I am pleased with our preliminary first quarter of fiscal 2018 results as the business continues to demonstrate improvement in each of our key focus areas.” Mr. Jamison added, “Two straight quarters of robust new product orders and record FPP service contract revenue are positive signs. Additionally, with our concentrated focus on revenue growth and working capital management, we continue to pave the strategic path towards profitability as we leverage our new and significantly lower operating cost structure.” Total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash decreased approximately $0.6 million to $19.1 million as of June 30, 2017, compared to $19.7 million at the end of the prior quarter. Capstone also announced that borrowings on its line of credit decreased approximately $2.0 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2018 and it received approximately $2.5 million from the at-the-market offering program during the period. During the quarter, Capstone secured orders from a diverse set of customers including: One C600S for a small community in West AfricaThirty C65s for CHP projects across the United KingdomTwo C1000S units to provide power for two research facilities in KuwaitTwo C65s to be installed in a flare gas application in North AfricaOne C600S for a wastewater treatment plant in upstate New YorkOne C1000S and one C600S for a hospital in the New York metro areaTwo C1000S units for a commercial customer in FijiNine C65s to upgrade a large chicken egg farm in CaliforniaTwo C1000S units to provide power from waste gas for an oil and gas customer in California “Diversifying our customer base and geographic presence remains a primary focus for us as we look to increase our revenue from the energy efficiency markets while our oil and gas business continues to rebound,” added Mr. Jamison. “As we continue our war on operating costs, we remain persistent in identifying new opportunities to further decrease our cash burn, reduce expenses, increase inventory turns, increase efficiency and improve our overall cash cycle. Substantive progress stemming from our cost cutting efforts, which started in the first quarter of 2016, has materialized as previously reported. We continue to operate at these lower expense levels and have yet to harvest the full benefits of our current plant consolidation efforts,” said Mr. Jamison. “Our efforts are concentrated on shortening our path to profitability as we continually lower our business expenses, grow our product, service and add-on accessory revenue, diversify our geographic and vertical markets, launch new innovative products, create new key partnerships and further emphasize firm balance sheet management,” Mr. Jamison concluded. The select financial results presented in this press release are preliminary and may change. This preliminary financial information includes calculations or figures that have been prepared internally by management and have not been reviewed or audited by our independent registered public accounting firm.

Capstone Turbine Corporation, incorporated in 1988, is a California based gas turbine manufacturer that specializes in microturbine power along with heating and cooling cogeneration systems. Key to the Capstone design is its use of foil bearings, which provides maintenance and fluid-free operation for the lifetime of the turbine and reduces the system to a single moving part. This also eliminates the need for any cooling or other secondary systems.
The company sells micro turbine generators for electrical power generation, cogeneration, biogas-fueled renewable energy, and hybrid vehicle power. Capstone has Microturbine offerings in the following sizes: 30 kW, 60 kW, 65 kW, 200 kW, 600 kW, 800 kW, and 1 MW. Multiple turbines can be combined with Capstone's APS or Advanced Power Server to create multiple megawatt installations. Capstone is a supplier of Microturbines to UTC Power's PureComfort System product.
Capstone turbines have generated some interest as the range extender for hybrid cars. Their light weight, small size, and quick starting time make them ideal as "instant-on" backup power to recharge the main batteries. An example of a hybrid vehicle is the Capstone CMT-380, with a 30 kW gas turbine generator running on diesel, that recharges Li-Poly batteries when necessary. The CMT-380 has a proposed range of 80 miles on battery alone, but when combined with the micro turbine that range is pushed to over 500+ miles.
Capstone is a member of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Combined Heat and Power Partnership, which is committed to improving the efficiency of the nation's energy infrastructure and reducing emissions of pollutants and greenhouse gases. A UL-Certified ISO 9001:2008 and ISO 14001:2004 company, Capstone is headquartered in the Los Angeles area with sales and/or service centers in United States, Mexico, South America, Singapore, China and the United Kingdom.

	DATA CENTER AIR CONDITIONERS

	Liebert® is the market leader in Data Center Air Conditioning because Liebert A/C’s are the highest quality in the world.

	With 25-years of experience buying, selling and remanufacturing used Liebert air conditioners, DCES is the market leader in the secondary market for Liebert air conditioners. With the largest used and surplus inventory of Liebert’s in the world, when you buy from DCES, you are buying the best from the best.  

Liebert air conditioners are rated for a 200,000-hour lifespan. With the extensive remanufacturing process undertaken on our late model Liebert Computer Room Air Conditioners (CRACs); your organization can expect the same 200,000-hours at about half the price of new.

When we buy a used Liebert CRAC, we don’t just hit it with 409® and spit shine like our competitors, we completely remanufacture it. Not only do we paint and return the visible condition of our units to brand new, we replace every moving part, and all electrical contactors, motors, compressors, belts, sheaves, fan blades, bearings, and valves. When we say zero hour condition, we mean it and we guarantee it! Our remanufactured Liebert CRACs are so dependable that we not only match Liebert’s one-year warranty, we beat it by extending the compressor warranty to 3 years.

With hundreds of tons of remanufactured Liebert Computer Room Air Conditioners in stock, we’re confident we have the size and configuration you’re looking for. Whether you’re looking for a single 3-ton Mini-Mate®, or twenty 30-ton CRACs, we’re the partner for your computer room or your colocation facility.  Buying remanufactured from DCES will save you serious capital in this tough economy and our quick turnaround will save you valuable up time. If you need a “new” 22-ton CRAC as an emergency replacement, no one in North America can have one delivered to your facility faster than DCES.

In addition to a huge inventory of ready to ship, remanufactured Liebert Air Conditioning units, we also maintain an enormous inventory of every imaginable Liebert spare part. Whether you need a complete data center solution, or replacement air filters, DCES is your one stop shop for all used and remanufactured Liebert systems, parts and consumables.

Save even more capital by trading in your old equipment. We pay top dollar for late model Liebert CRACs, whether you’re buying from us or are just looking to sell your used equipment.



All of our remanufactured Liebert Air Conditioners carry our industry leading warranty and come with our expert technical support. Every DCES remanufactured Liebert System undergoes a 120-step remanufacturing process, returning the systems to zero hour quality. Your remanufactured DCES Liebert A/C will look and perform just like it did the day Liebert originally shipped it…Guaranteed!

	Buying from DCES is the easiest decision a data center manager can make. Certified Pre-owned systems from DCES have all the original specs and warranty, and because they are half the price of new systems, we can confidently assert that we represent the BEST VALUE anywhere.

	We won’t be beaten by a lower price on any used, non-remanufactured Liebert CRAC. Send us a written quote and we’ll match the price and warranty terms, and upgrade you to a one-year newer model unit.

	All DCES CRACs, whether used or remanufactured include the first air filter replacement (Koch® Merv 8 air filters) for free.

	If you are interested in knowing more about humidity control, air conditioners, Liebert spare or replacement parts, or air conditioner handling, please email us at info@dces.com to speak with one of our data center air conditioning experts.

Capstone Turbine Corporation, incorporated in 1988, is a California based gas turbine manufacturer that specializes in microturbine power along with heating and cooling cogeneration systems. Key to the Capstone design is its use of foil bearings, which provides maintenance and fluid-free operation for the lifetime of the turbine and reduces the system to a single moving part. This also eliminates the need for any cooling or other secondary systems.
The company sells micro turbine generators for electrical power generation, cogeneration, biogas-fueled renewable energy, and hybrid vehicle power. Capstone has Microturbine offerings in the following sizes: 30 kW, 60 kW, 65 kW, 200 kW, 600 kW, 800 kW, and 1 MW. Multiple turbines can be combined with Capstone's APS or Advanced Power Server to create multiple megawatt installations. Capstone is a supplier of Microturbines to UTC Power's PureComfort System product.
Capstone turbines have generated some interest as the range extender for hybrid cars. Their light weight, small size, and quick starting time make them ideal as "instant-on" backup power to recharge the main batteries. An example of a hybrid vehicle is the Capstone CMT-380, with a 30 kW gas turbine generator running on diesel, that recharges Li-Poly batteries when necessary. The CMT-380 has a proposed range of 80 miles on battery alone, but when combined with the micro turbine that range is pushed to over 500+ miles.
Capstone is a member of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Combined Heat and Power Partnership, which is committed to improving the efficiency of the nation's energy infrastructure and reducing emissions of pollutants and greenhouse gases. A UL-Certified ISO 9001:2008 and ISO 14001:2004 company, Capstone is headquartered in the Los Angeles area with sales and/or service centers in United States, Mexico, South America, Singapore, China and the United Kingdom.

Capstone Turbine Corporation, incorporated in 1988, is a California based gas turbine manufacturer that specializes in microturbine power along with heating and cooling cogeneration systems. Key to the Capstone design is its use of foil bearings, which provides maintenance and fluid-free operation for the lifetime of the turbine and reduces the system to a single moving part. This also eliminates the need for any cooling or other secondary systems.
The company sells micro turbine generators for electrical power generation, cogeneration, biogas-fueled renewable energy, and hybrid vehicle power. Capstone has Microturbine offerings in the following sizes: 30 kW, 60 kW, 65 kW, 200 kW, 600 kW, 800 kW, and 1 MW. Multiple turbines can be combined with Capstone's APS or Advanced Power Server to create multiple megawatt installations. Capstone is a supplier of Microturbines to UTC Power's PureComfort System product.
Capstone turbines have generated some interest as the range extender for hybrid cars. Their light weight, small size, and quick starting time make them ideal as "instant-on" backup power to recharge the main batteries. An example of a hybrid vehicle is the Capstone CMT-380, with a 30 kW gas turbine generator running on diesel, that recharges Li-Poly batteries when necessary. The CMT-380 has a proposed range of 80 miles on battery alone, but when combined with the micro turbine that range is pushed to over 500+ miles.
Capstone is a member of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Combined Heat and Power Partnership, which is committed to improving the efficiency of the nation's energy infrastructure and reducing emissions of pollutants and greenhouse gases. A UL-Certified ISO 9001:2008 and ISO 14001:2004 company, Capstone is headquartered in the Los Angeles area with sales and/or service centers in United States, Mexico, South America, Singapore, China and the United Kingdom.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
