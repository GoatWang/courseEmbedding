U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation / About / Kelly Stanley 
Kelly Stanley




General FoundationKelly N. Stanley is the retired President and CEO of Cardinal Health System, Inc (Muncie, Indiana) and the former Chairman  of the BMH Foundation, Inc., a healthcare foundation affiliated with Ball Memorial Hospital. 
Until its merger with Clarian (now Indiana University Health) in 2009, Stanley was President and CEO of Cardinal Health System - an integrated network of hospitals, physician offices, pharmacies, home health services and clinical care located throughout East Central Indiana.  Ball Memorial serves as a tertiary referral center and teaching hospital for East Central Indiana. 
Stanley’s association with Cardinal Health System included 25 years working with the organization as a volunteer board member.  For over ten years he served as both Chairman of Ball Memorial Hospital and Vice Chairman of Cardinal Health System.  He was Chairman of Cardinal Health Alliance since the creation of the managed care organization in 1995 until his retirement in 2009.  He also served as President of the BMH Foundation. 
Stanley is a former Chairman of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. In 2006 he completed twelve years of service on that organization’s Board of Directors and was elected to the Board of the National Chamber Foundation (an affiliate of the U.S. Chamber).   Stanley is a former Chairman of the Muncie Delaware County Chamber of Commerce and a former Director of the Indiana Chamber of Commerce.  He is a Director Emeritus of the Central Indiana Corporate Partnership. 
Stanley is a Director of Old National Bancorp and serves as Chairman of  Old National Insurance Company.  Old National Bancorp is the largest financial holding company headquartered in Indiana. 
In 2006, Stanley joined the Board of Florida Chemical Company, a privately held company headquartered in Orlando, Florida.  Florida Chemical is a leader for the citrus industry by pioneering solvent, chemical synthesis, and flavor/fragrance applications.  He serves as Chairman of Florida Chemical's Governance committee. 
Prior to becoming President and CEO of Cardinal Health System, Stanley was President and CEO of Ontario Corporation, a privately owned manufacturing and service company, with headquarters in Muncie, Indiana, providing precision manufactured components and sub-assemblies, laboratory testing services, and custom hardware and software products.  Subsidiaries of Ontario, each of which Stanley served as Chairman, included Pyromet, Inc., Sherry Laboratories, CDS Engineering, Ontario Systems, Inc., and WFFT-TV.  Prior to his 25 year Ontario career, Stanley practiced corporate and labor law. 
Stanley received his J.D. degree from Indiana University and his B.S. (Business) degree from Miami University.  He and his wife, Donna, have three children and ten grandchildren.
