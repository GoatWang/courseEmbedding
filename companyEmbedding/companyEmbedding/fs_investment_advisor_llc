FSIC IV

1
                      The public offering price of FSIC IV’s shares of Class T common stock is subject to an upfront sales load of up to 4.25%. Shares of FSIC IV’s Class T common stock are also subject to an annual distribution fee of 1.00% of the estimated value of the shares as determined in accordance with applicable FINRA rules. The public offering price is subject to change. FSIC IV’s total expenses as a percentage of average net assets attributable to common stock was 7.74% for the period from January 6, 2016 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2016. Expenses and fees are described more fully in FSIC IV’s prospectus. Please consult the prospectus and read it carefully.
                  

2
                      The annualized distribution rate shown is expressed as a percentage equal to the projected annualized distribution amount per share of Class T common stock (which is calculated by annualizing the regular weekly cash distribution per share of Class T common stock as of the date indicated, without compounding), divided by the public offering price per share of Class T common stock as of the date indicated. The annualized distribution rate and amount shown are net of the 1.00% annual distribution fee and may be rounded. The payment of future distributions on FSIC IV’s shares of Class T common stock is subject to the discretion of FSIC IV’s board of directors and applicable legal restrictions and, therefore, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of any such future distributions. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, 30% of FSIC IV’s distributions were funded through net investment income (prior to expense reimbursement) and 70% of FSIC IV’s distributions were funded through short-term capital gains proceeds from the sale of assets, on a tax basis. The determination of the tax attributes of FSIC IV’s distributions is made annually at the end of FSIC IV’s fiscal year and a determination made on an interim basis may not be representative of the actual tax attributes of FSIC IV’s distributions for a full year. The actual tax characteristics of distributions to stockholders are reported to stockholders annually of Form 1099-DIV.
                  


FSGCO–T2

                      FSGCO–T2’s common shares are subject to an upfront sales load of up to 4.00% of FSGCO–T2’s public offering price per common share, offering costs of up to 1.00% of the aggregate proceeds raised in FSGCO–T2’s continuous public offering, after payment of the upfront sales load, and an annual distribution fee of 1.33% of the net asset value (NAV) of the common shares. Additionally, FSGCO–T2’s common shares will be subject to a contingent deferred sales charge if they are tendered within a certain period of time. See FSGCO–T2’s prospectus for additional information regarding applicable fees and expenses, including additional annual expenses to which FSGCO–T2 is subject.

                      The annualized distribution rate shown is expressed as a percentage equal to the projected annualized distribution amount per share (which is calculated by annualizing the regular weekly cash distribution per share as of the date indicated, without compounding), divided by FSGCO–T2's public offering price per share as of the date indicated. The annualized distribution rate shown may be rounded. The payment of future distributions on FSGCO–T2's common shares is subject to the discretion of FSGCO–T2's board of trustees and applicable legal restrictions and, therefore, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of any such future distributions.
                  


FSEP

1
                        The annualized distribution rate shown is expressed as a percentage equal to the projected annualized distribution amount per share (which is calculated by annualizing the monthly cash distribution per share as of the date indicated, without compounding), divided by net asset value (NAV) per share as of the date indicated. The annualized distribution rate shown may be rounded. The payment of future distributions on FSEP’s common shares is subject to the discretion of FSEP’s board of trustees and applicable legal restrictions and, therefore, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of any such future distributions. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, approximately 75% of FSEP's distributions were funded through net investment income, 2% distributions on account of investments in portfolio companies and 23% on expense reimbursement from sponsor. The determination of the tax attributes of FSEP’s distributions is made annually at the end of FSEP’s fiscal year, and a determination made on an interim basis may not be representative of the actual tax attributes of FSEP’s distributions for a full year. The actual tax characteristics of distributions to shareholders are reported to shareholders annually on Form 1099-DIV. FSEP's total expenses as a percentage of average net assets attributable to common shares was 4.88% for the year ended December 31, 2016.

	FSIC Overview



FS Investment Corporation (NYSE: FSIC) is a publicly traded business development company (BDC) focused on providing customized credit solutions to private middle market U.S. companies.  Investment approach  We seek to invest primarily in the senior secured debt and, to a lesser extent, the subordinated debt of private middle market U.S. companies to achieve the best risk-adjusted returns for our investors. In connection with our debt investments, we may on occasion receive or purchase equity interests such as common and preferred stock, warrants or options.  FSIC is differentiated by our flexible investment strategy which allows us to invest across the corporate capital structure and provide diversified exposure across multiple industries. Our core investment strategy is focused on direct originations and opportunistic investments, such as event-driven investments and anchor orders, which we believe allow us to take advantage of market inefficiencies. In certain circumstances we may also opportunistically invest in the broadly syndicated loan and high yield bond markets. Managers  FSIC is advised by FB Income Advisor, LLC, an affiliate of FS Investments, a leading manager of debt-focused alternative investment funds, and sub-advised by GSO / Blackstone Debt Funds Management LLC, an affiliate of GSO Capital Partners, the credit platform of Blackstone. With approximately $93 billion in assets under management as of March 31, 2017, GSO Capital Partners is one of the world’s largest credit-oriented alternative asset managers with approximately 345 employees in New York, London, Dublin and Houston. We seek to leverage our size and resources with GSO’s global brand, underwriting capabilities, network of relationships and origination platform to maximize returns and preserve capital.  Since FSIC’s inception in January 2009, it has grown to become one of the largest BDCs in the market. As of March 31, 2017, FSIC had approximately $4.3 billion in assets under management and investments in 108 portfolio companies across 16 industries.  FS Investments is the largest sponsor of BDC assets with approximately $18.3 billion in BDC assets under management as of March 31, 2017.

Types of alternatives | FS Investments











































The spectrum of alternatives
 Alternatives include a spectrum of assets, strategies and structures, each designed to deliver different benefits. Alternative investments strategies, while not guaranteed, may help meet specific objectives and complement a traditional portfolio allocation.







Alternatives complement traditional portfolios



Investment Objectives





Investmenttypes
Traditionalinvestments


Equities
Large, mid, small, growth, value,  international, emerging markets




Alternativeinvestments
Capitalpreservation
Growth
Income




An investing strategy that seeks to minimize volatility by profiting from long positions in stocks that are expected to appreciate in value and short positions in stocks that are expected to decline in value.Long/short equity
        									








Venture capital aims to provide financing to promising start-up and early-stage companies in exchange for an equity ownership stake.Venture capital
        									








High net worth individuals and institutions may invest in private equity funds, which purchase and grow private companies. Private equity funds can also provide financing to companies seeking to expand, enhance operational efficiencies and make capital structure improvements, usually in exchange for common equity.Private equity
        									










Fixed income
Treasuries, investment grade, high yield, emerging market debt






Senior secured loans are the primary source of debt financing for private companies. These loans are typically “secured,” or backed by a company’s assets. They also typically have floating rates, which adjust with changes in market interest rates.Senior secured loans
        									








With event-driven credit, an investment is made in the debt of companies experiencing a corporate event, such as an acquisition, merger or reorganization that may result in market price inefficiencies.Event-driven credit
        									








Debt is typically labeled distressed when the issuing company may face difficulties meeting its financial obligations.Distressed debt
        									










Real assets
REITs,long-only commodity






For purposes of investment, real estate generally refers to commercial real estate. Institutional investors, such as endowments and pension funds, may own commercial real estate directly with the goal of achieving rental income. Smaller investors may access real estate through single manager or fund of funds investment vehicles.Real estate
        									








Managed futures are investment funds managed by commodity trading advisors (CTAs) that trade futures on commodities, global currencies, interest rates, equities and energy.Managed futures
        									











Investing in alternatives is different than investing in traditional investments such as stocks and bonds. Alternatives tend to be illiquid and highly specialized. When building a portfolio that includes alternative investments, investors and their financial advisors should first consider an individual’s financial objectives. Investment constraints such as risk tolerance, liquidity needs and investment time horizon should be determined.

	FSIC Overview



FS Investment Corporation (NYSE: FSIC) is a publicly traded business development company (BDC) focused on providing customized credit solutions to private middle market U.S. companies.  Investment approach  We seek to invest primarily in the senior secured debt and, to a lesser extent, the subordinated debt of private middle market U.S. companies to achieve the best risk-adjusted returns for our investors. In connection with our debt investments, we may on occasion receive or purchase equity interests such as common and preferred stock, warrants or options.  FSIC is differentiated by our flexible investment strategy which allows us to invest across the corporate capital structure and provide diversified exposure across multiple industries. Our core investment strategy is focused on direct originations and opportunistic investments, such as event-driven investments and anchor orders, which we believe allow us to take advantage of market inefficiencies. In certain circumstances we may also opportunistically invest in the broadly syndicated loan and high yield bond markets. Managers  FSIC is advised by FB Income Advisor, LLC, an affiliate of FS Investments, a leading manager of debt-focused alternative investment funds, and sub-advised by GSO / Blackstone Debt Funds Management LLC, an affiliate of GSO Capital Partners, the credit platform of Blackstone. With approximately $93 billion in assets under management as of March 31, 2017, GSO Capital Partners is one of the world’s largest credit-oriented alternative asset managers with approximately 345 employees in New York, London, Dublin and Houston. We seek to leverage our size and resources with GSO’s global brand, underwriting capabilities, network of relationships and origination platform to maximize returns and preserve capital.  Since FSIC’s inception in January 2009, it has grown to become one of the largest BDCs in the market. As of March 31, 2017, FSIC had approximately $4.3 billion in assets under management and investments in 108 portfolio companies across 16 industries.  FS Investments is the largest sponsor of BDC assets with approximately $18.3 billion in BDC assets under management as of March 31, 2017.
