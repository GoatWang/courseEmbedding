Where?My current locationSearchHomeNew York, NYYoung Brian DNew York, NY Young Brian DAbout Search ResultsAbout Search ResultsYP - The Real Yellow PagesSM - helps you find the right local businesses to meet your specific needs. Search results are sorted by a combination of factors to give you a set of choices in response to your search criteria. These factors are similar to those you might use to determine which business to select from a local Yellow Pages directory, including proximity to where you are searching, expertise in the specific services or products you need, and comprehensive business information to help evaluate a business's suitability for you. “Preferred” listings, or those with featured website buttons, indicate YP advertisers who directly provide information about their businesses to help consumers make more informed buying decisions. YP advertisers receive higher placement in the default ordering of search results and may appear in sponsored listings on the top, side, or bottom of the search results page.Sort:DefaultDefaultDistanceRatingName (A - Z)Sponsored LinksAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection1. Brian D Rance Lwyr1 Chase Manhattan PlzNew York, NY 10005(212) 530-5136AttorneysGeneral Practice AttorneysAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection2. Cohen Brian D121 Lexington AveNew York, NY 10016(212) 472-4700Medical ClinicsPhysicians & SurgeonsAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection3. Brian D Greet, MD - Greet Brian D MD550 1st AveNew York, NY 10016(212) 263-7300Physicians & SurgeonsAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection4. Golden, Brian D, MD333 E 34th StNew York, NY 10016(212) 889-7217Physicians & SurgeonsWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection5. Caplan, Brian D - Caplan & Ross270 Madison Ave Fl 13New York, NY 10016(212) 907-0842AttorneysWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection6. Fradet Brian D275 Madison AveNew York, NY 10016(212) 213-4491Chiropractors & Chiropractic ServicesWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection7. Brian D Caplan Atty100 Park AveNew York, NY 10017(212) 907-0842AttorneysGeneral Practice AttorneysWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection8. Linder, Brian D305 Madison AveNew York, NY 10165(212) 922-1080AttorneysWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection9. Robbins, Brian D425 Lexington AveNew York, NY 10017(212) 455-3090AttorneysWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection10. Beglin, Brian D399 Park Ave Fl 21New York, NY 10022(212) 207-1204AttorneysWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection11. Cohen, Brian D35 Sutton PlNew York, NY 10022(917) 472-9027Physicians & SurgeonsAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection12. Krawitz, Brian D1000 10th AveNew York, NY 10019(631) 241-4214Physicians & SurgeonsAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection13. Sherman Brian D MD306 E 96th StNew York, NY 10128(212) 241-4029Physicians & SurgeonsAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection14. Radbill, Brian D1 Gustave L Levy PlNew York, NY 10029(212) 241-6500Physicians & SurgeonsWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection15. Brian D.

Specialties & ExpertiseDr. Brian Young has the following 7 areas of expertise and  1 specialty.                     Internal Medicine
    An internist is a physician who focuses on the diagnosis and treatment of conditions that affect the adult population—both acute and chronic.


    These doctors are often who adults see as their primary physicians because they treat a broad range of illnesses that do not require surgical or specialist interventions. They also work to help a patient maintain optimal health in order to prevent the onset of disease.


    In addition to treating the common cold and flu, internists also treat chronic diseases like diabetes and heart disease.
