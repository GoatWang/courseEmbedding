Fortis Inc. is a St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador based international diversified electric utility holding company. It operates in Canada, the United States, Central America, and the Caribbean. In 2015, it earned $6.7 billion CAD.[3]
Fortis was formed in 1987 when shareholders of the regulated transmission and distribution utility Newfoundland Light & Power Co. voted to form a separate holding company. NL&P shares were exchanged for Fortis shares on a one-to-one basis, with the regulated NL&P becoming a 100% owned subsidiary.
Fortis currently owns the following regulated utilities:

FortisBC, a utility in British Columbia
FortisAlberta Inc., a holding company for assets purchased from Aquila, Inc.
Central Hudson Gas & Electric, a utility in New York
Tucson Electric Power and UniSource Energy Services, utilities in Arizona
Newfoundland Power, serving 85% of the population of Newfoundland and Labrador
Maritime Electric, serving 90% of the population of Prince Edward Island
FortisOntario, a holding company for Canadian Niagara Power, Cornwall Electric, and Algoma Power[4]
Caribbean Utilities, a utility in the Cayman Islands
FortisTCI, a utility in the Turks and Caicos Islands
Belize Electricity Limited, a utility in Belize

Fortis also operates three non-regulated companies:

Fortis Generation, hydro generation in New York state and central Newfoundland.
Griffith Energy Services, a petroleum supplier in the eastern United States.

Expansion[edit]
The company expanded into Western Canada in 2003 with its purchase of Aquila, Inc.'s Canadian assets, formerly owned by TransAlta, Canada's largest publicly traded utility. As a result of this acquisition, Fortis became one of Alberta's major regulated electrical distribution companies, serving 415,000 Albertans in 2005. ATCO Electric is Alberta's other regulated distribution company. Also as a result of the 2003 acquisition, Fortis owns regulated generation, transmission, and distribution assets in British Columbia.
In 2007, Fortis acquired Terasen Gas from Kinder Morgan, which had sold the BC gas utility as a non-strategic asset included in its 2005 acquisition of Terasen Inc.
In addition to its regulated Canadian assets, Fortis also owns unregulated assets in Ontario, British Columbia, and Newfoundland. The majority of its unregulated business consists of hydroelectric generating plants.[5]
Fortis' interests in the Caribbean include a 67% interest in Belize Electricity Limited (BEL) and a 95% interest in Belize Electric Co. Ltd. The Belize Association of Non-Government Organisations took Fortis to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in 2003 to have a new environmental assessment of the Chalillo Dam on the Macal River which was a hydroelectricity development project. Ecologists were concerned over the future of species such as the scarlet macaw, the tapir and the black howler monkey as the project would flood 10 km2 of rainforest in Belize. Celebrities such as Harrison Ford and Cameron Diaz supported a movement to stop this dam. Fortis and the Government of Belize supported the project.[6][7]
On May 30, 2011, it was announced that Fortis has plans to acquire Central Vermont Public Service, an electric utility in the US state of Vermont, for US$700 million, pending stockholder and regulatory approval; this acquisition would be Fortis' first utility acquisition in the United States.[8] Gaz Métro offered a higher price and acquired CVPS.[9]
On February 21, 2012, CH Energy Group (a holding company for Central Hudson Gas & Electric, an upstate New York utility), announced a pending acquisition by Fortis valued at $1.5 billion. [10] On June 27, 2013, Fortis Inc. closed on its acquisition of CHG.
In 2013, Fortis announced its acquisition of UNS Energy, an Arizona utility company.[11]
On February 9, 2016, Fortis announced an agreement to acquire ITC Holdings Corp., the largest independent transmission utility in the United States, for US$11.3 billion in cash and stock.[12]

Fortis powers ahead with a significant investment in transmission









On February 9th, Fortis announced a definitive agreement to acquire the largest independent transmission utility in the United States for US$11.8 billion.
“Fortis has grown its business through strategic acquisitions that have contributed to strong organic growth over the past decade. Our performance in 2015 is a clear demonstration of the success of this strategy,” says Mr. Barry Perry, President & CEO. “The acquisition of ITC – a premier pure-play transmission utility – is a continuation of this growth strategy. ITC not only further strengthens and diversifies our business, but it also accelerates our growth.”

Questions and Answers for shareholders of ITC









Q:  What is Fortis Inc. offering for my shares?

A:  Fortis is offering to exchange each share in ITC for a combination of US$22.57 in cash plus 0.7520 of a common share of Fortis Inc.

Q:  What is the Fortis offer worth?

A:  At the time of the announcement the offer was valued at US$44.90 per ITC share.   This value may change over time as a portion of the value depends on the price of Fortis common shares and the foreign exchange rate.

Q:  When will the exchange take place?

A:  The acquisition is expected to close (be completed) in late 2016, subject to receipt of a number of regulatory approvals and customary closing additions.

Q:  What happens to my ITC shares before the acquisition closes?

A:  Prior to close, your ITC shares will be freely tradeable on the New York Stock Exchange.

Q:  I will be getting a portion of the offer in Fortis common shares.  How can I buy and sell Fortis shares?

A:  Fortis shares are currently traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX).  The Corporation has applied to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).  Once the shares are listed on the NYSE, you will be able to buy and sell Fortis shares exactly the same way as ITC shares in the past.

Q:  Do common shareholders of Fortis receive a dividend?

A: Yes they do.  In fact, Fortis has a track record of 42 consecutive years of increasing dividends to its common shareholders and management is targeting average annual dividend growth of 6% through the year 2020. ITC shareholders will benefit from a meaningful increase in their dividend per share as owners of Fortis common shares.

Q:  Will ITC continue paying dividends?

A:  ITC will pay dividends as declared by their Board of Directors of ITC up until closing.  After closing, ITC shareholders will receive dividends on their shares of Fortis common stock as declared by the Board of Directors of Fortis.

Q:  What do I have to do to take advantage of the offer from Fortis Inc.?

A:  If your shares are held in a brokerage account, you have to notify your broker of your intention to accept the offer.  The cash and Fortis shares will be deposited directly into your account.

    If you hold your ITC shares as physical certificates, you will receive a Letter of Transmittal and a Letter of Instruction in the mail.  Please follow the steps indicated on the forms.

Q:  What are the tax implications of this transaction?

A:  Everybody’s tax situation is unique.  We recommend you speak with your accountant or financial advisor to determine how this transaction will impact you.

Q:  Where can I learn more about investing in Fortis Inc.?

A:  Please visit www.fortisinc.com/investor-relations for more information.

Q:  What are the U.S. federal and Canadian federal income tax consequences of the exchange of my common stock of ITC Holdings for common shares of Fortis Inc. in the merger of Fortis and ITC (the "Merger") on October 14, 2016?

A:  The following information is meant to be a general guide but not meant to be construed as legal or tax advice.  We strongly encourage you to contact your advisors to get an assessment of your particular situation.
U.S. and Canadian tax disclosure in respect of the disposition of common stock of ITC in the Merger was provided in the Registration Statement filed on March 17, 2016 which can accessed at:https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1666175/000104746916011289/a2227566zf-4.htm.  
Former Shareholders of ITC who are individual citizens or resident aliens of the United States (“U.S. Holders”)
The material U.S. federal income tax consequences to U.S. Holders of disposing of common stock of ITC in the Merger can be found starting at page 123 of the Registration Statement under the heading "Certain United States Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger" (the "U.S. Tax Disclosure").
The following is a general description of the intended U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger for the former beneficial owners of ITC common stock who are U.S. Holders (as defined above) and that held the ITC common stock as capital assets.  The following is qualified in its entirety by the U.S. Tax Disclosure, including the limitations and assumptions set out therein. 
Was the transaction a taxable transaction?
Yes, the Merger was a taxable transaction for U.S. Holders. 
A U.S. Holder of ITC common stock will have recognized gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between (i) the sum of the fair market value of the Fortis common shares (as of the effective time of the Merger) and the cash received by the U.S. Holder in the Merger, and (ii) the U.S. Holder's adjusted tax basis in the ITC common stock exchanged in the Merger.  See comments below in respect of determining the fair market value of the Fortis common shares at the Merger effective time.
What if I acquired blocks of ITC common stock at different times or at different prices?
If a U.S. Holder acquired different blocks of ITC common stock at different times or at different prices, any gain or loss would be determined separately with respect to each block of ITC common stock, and the cash and Fortis common shares received in the Merger would be allocated pro rata to each such block of stock.
What is my tax basis in the Fortis common shares?
A U.S. Holder's tax basis in Fortis common shares received in the Merger will equal their fair market value as of the effective time of the Merger.  
What was the fair market value of the Fortis common shares at the Merger Effective Time?
U.S. federal income tax law does not specifically identify how one determines the fair market value of the Fortis common shares that you received in the Merger.  Alternative methods to determine fair market value include using, among others, the trading prices on the day immediately prior to the Merger, the trading prices on the day of the Merger (October 14, 2016) or a weighted average of the trading prices over a number of days.  Since the Fortis common shares only began trading on the NYSE on October 14, 2016, U.S. Holders may determine to use the trading prices of the Fortis common shares on this day or the average of the trading prices over a number of days beginning with October 14, 2016 to determine the fair market value of the Fortis common shares at the time of the Merger.
For purposes of broker reporting, it is expected that the exchange agent will use the average of the high and low trading prices of the Fortis common shares on the NYSE on October 14, 2016 (being USD $31.515). 
Former shareholders of ITC who are residents in Canada (“Canadian Holders”)
The material Canadian federal income tax consequences to Canadian Holders of disposing of ITC common stock in the Merger can be found starting at page 129 of the Registration Statement under the heading "Certain Canadian Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger" (the "Canadian Tax Disclosure"). 
The following is a general description of the intended Canadian federal income tax consequences of the Merger for the former beneficial owners of ITC common stock who are Canadian Holders (as defined above) and that held the ITC common stock as capital property.  The following is qualified in its entirety by the Canadian Tax Disclosure, including the limitations and assumptions set out therein. 
Was the Merger a taxable transaction to Canadian Holders?
Yes, the Merger was a taxable transaction to Canadian Holders.
Canadian Holders generally realized a capital gain (or capital loss) on the disposition of their ITC common stock equal to the amount, if any, by which the sum of the fair market value of the Fortis common shares and the cash received in exchange for such Canadian Holders’ ITC common stock, net of any reasonable costs of disposition, exceed (or are less than) the tax cost to such Canadian Holders of their ITC common stock immediately before the disposition. See comments below in respect of determining the fair market value of the Fortis common shares at the Merger effective time.
What is my tax cost of the Fortis common shares?
The cost to a Canadian Holder of the Fortis common shares received by that Canadian Holder in the Merger is equal to their fair market value at the time they were acquired by such Canadian Holder. For purposes of determining the adjusted cost base to a Canadian Holder of the Fortis common shares, the cost of the Fortis common shares received must be averaged with the adjusted cost base of all other Fortis common shares held by the Canadian Holder as capital property.
What was the fair market value of the Fortis common shares at the Merger Effective Time?
The Canada Revenue Agency has no published guidance that would be of assistance in determining the fair market value of the Fortis common shares in this context.  As such, a reasonable estimate of the fair market value of each Fortis common share could be made by reference to their trading price on the Toronto Stock Exchange.   Alternative methods to determine fair market value include using, among others, the trading prices on the day immediately prior to the Merger, the trading prices on the day of the Merger (October 14, 2016) or a weighted average of the trading prices over a number of days.

OUR HISTORY
A look back at the growth and evolution of Fortis Inc.






1885

The international company known today as Fortis Inc. has its roots in St. John’s Electric Light Company formed in 1885.

1900

The Petty Harbour Electric Generating Station was completed in 1900 by St. John’s Street Railway Company. The Petty Harbour hydro plant continues to operate today and is a member of the Hydro Hall of Fame as the first hydro plant in the province now known as Newfoundland and Labrador.

1924

The electric utility company was renamed The Newfoundland Light and Power Company in 1924.

1948

Newfoundland Light and Power Company, Limited became a pure electric utility in 1948 and first issued stock to the public in 1949.

1949

In July 1949, Newfoundland became the tenth province of Canada. Newfoundland Light and Power had 1,600 common shareholders.

1966

Newfoundland Light & Power Co. Limited was formed through the amalgamation of Newfoundland Light and Power Company, Limited; Union Electric Light and Power Company; and United Towns Electric Company Limited.

1985

Newfoundland Light & Power Co. Limited celebrated 100 years of service.  Common shares split 2-for-1.

1987

Shareholders of Newfoundland Light & Power Co. Limited voted to create a holding company known as Fortis Inc. to be the 100% owner of the utility.  On December 29, 1987, each Newfoundland Light & Power Co. Limited common share was exchanged for one common share of Fortis Inc.

1988

Dr. Angus A. Bruneau became Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Fortis Inc.  He served as Chairman of Fortis Inc. for 18 years.  Dr. Bruneau also served as President and Chief Executive Officer of Newfoundland Power from 1986 until 1990.  He was appointed an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1983 and was awarded the Canadian Council of Professional Engineers Gold Medal in 1988.

1990

Maritime Electric, located on Prince Edward Island, was our first electric utility investment in 1990. This was followed by investments in Ontario in 1996.

1996

Stan Marshall was appointed President and CEO of Fortis Inc. in 1996.  His career with Fortis spanned 35 years and, under his leadership, Fortis became the largest investor-owned gas and electric distribution utility in Canada. Total assets grew from less than $1.0 billion in 1996 to $26 billion when Stan retired in December 2014.

1999

Fortis embarked on international expansion with investments in Belize in 1999 and the Cayman Islands in 2000.

2003

Fortis announced an agreement to acquire electric utilities in Alberta and British Columbia from Aquila Inc. The subsidiaries were renamed FortisAlberta and FortisBC in 2004.

2005

Fortis common shares split 4-for-1 after reaching nearly $100 per common share.

2006

Fortis added to its Caribbean interests with the purchase of two utilities on the Turks and Caicos Islands.  The companies were collectively renamed Fortis Turks and Caicos and later FortisTCI.

2007

Fortis expanded its activities to include gas distribution with the purchase of Terasen in British Columbia in 2007. Terasen was later renamed FortisBC Energy.

2012

Fortis announced an agreement to acquire the CH Energy Group of companies for US$1.5 billion.  CH Energy is the parent company of Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corporation, a gas and electric utility in New York State.

2013

2014

At the end of 2014, Stan Marshall retired as President and CEO and Director of the Board of Directors of Fortis Inc.  Mr. Marshall’s career with Fortis spanned 35 years and he was at the helm as President and CEO for more than 18 years.  Barry Perry, Vice President of Finance and CFO of Fortis Inc., succeeded Mr. Marshall as President and CEO of the Corporation, effective December 31, 2014.

COMPANY PROFILE
Fortis Inc:  A leading North American utility
Fortis Inc. has its origin in the formation of St. John’s Electric Light Company in 1885 in the province now known as Newfoundland and Labrador.   That company eventually became Newfoundland Light & Power Co. Limited which became the first wholly owned subsidiary of Fortis Inc.  Fortis was created as a holding company in 1987 with the mission to expand and diversify.  Today, Fortis is a leader in the North American utility industry with assets of approximately $48 billion and 2016 revenue of $6.8 billion. Our 8,800 employees serve utility customers in five Canadian provinces, nine U.S. states and three Caribbean countries.







OUR VISION
In all our operations, Fortis will manage resources prudently and deliver quality service to maximize value to our customers and our shareholders.  We will continue to focus on three primary objectives:



Our growth in assets and market capitalization should be greater than the average of other North American public gas and electric utilities of similar size.






Our earnings should continue at a rate commensurate with that of a well-run North American utility.






The financial and business risks of Fortis should not be substantially greater than those associated with the operation of a North American utility of similar size.






























OUR HISTORY
A look back at the growth and evolution of Fortis






1885

The international company known today as Fortis Inc. has its roots in St. John’s Electric Light Company formed in 1885.

1900

The Petty Harbour Electric Generating Station was completed in 1900 by St. John’s Street Railway Company. The Petty Harbour hydro plant continues to operate today and is a member of the Hydro Hall of Fame as the first hydro plant in the province now known as Newfoundland and Labrador.

1924

The electric utility company was renamed The Newfoundland Light and Power Company in 1924.

1948

Newfoundland Light and Power Company, Limited became a pure electric utility in 1948 and first issued stock to the public in 1949.

1949

In July 1949, Newfoundland became the tenth province of Canada. Newfoundland Light and Power had 1,600 common shareholders.

1966

Newfoundland Light & Power Co. Limited was formed through the amalgamation of Newfoundland Light and Power Company, Limited; Union Electric Light and Power Company; and United Towns Electric Company Limited.

1985

Newfoundland Light & Power Co. Limited celebrated 100 years of service.  Common shares split 2-for-1.

1987

Shareholders of Newfoundland Light & Power Co. Limited voted to create a holding company known as Fortis Inc. to be the 100% owner of the utility.  On December 29, 1987, each Newfoundland Light & Power Co. Limited common share was exchanged for one common share of Fortis Inc.

1988

Dr. Angus A. Bruneau became Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Fortis Inc.  He served as Chairman of Fortis Inc. for 18 years.  Dr. Bruneau also served as President and Chief Executive Officer of Newfoundland Power from 1986 until 1990.  He was appointed an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1983 and was awarded the Canadian Council of Professional Engineers Gold Medal in 1988.

1990

Maritime Electric, located on Prince Edward Island, was our first electric utility investment in 1990. This was followed by investments in Ontario in 1996.

1996

Stan Marshall was appointed President and CEO of Fortis Inc. in 1996.  His career with Fortis spanned 35 years and, under his leadership, Fortis became the largest investor-owned gas and electric distribution utility in Canada. Total assets grew from less than $1.0 billion in 1996 to $26 billion when Stan retired in December 2014.

1999

Fortis embarked on international expansion with investments in Belize in 1999 and the Cayman Islands in 2000.

2003

Fortis announced an agreement to acquire electric utilities in Alberta and British Columbia from Aquila Inc. The subsidiaries were renamed FortisAlberta and FortisBC in 2004.

2005

Fortis common shares split 4-for-1 after reaching nearly $100 per common share.

2006

Fortis added to its Caribbean interests with the purchase of two utilities on the Turks and Caicos Islands.  The companies were collectively renamed Fortis Turks and Caicos and later FortisTCI.

2007

Fortis expanded its activities to include gas distribution with the purchase of Terasen in British Columbia in 2007. Terasen was later renamed FortisBC Energy.

2012

Fortis announced an agreement to acquire the CH Energy Group of companies for US$1.5 billion.  CH Energy is the parent company of Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corporation, a gas and electric utility in New York State.

2013

Fortis announced an agreement to acquire UNS Energy, a gas and electric utility in Arizona for US$4.3 billion.

2014

At the end of 2014, Stan Marshall retired as President and CEO and Director of the Board of Directors of Fortis Inc.  Mr. Marshall’s career with Fortis spanned 35 years and he was at the helm as President and CEO for more than 18 years.  Barry Perry, Vice President of Finance and CFO of Fortis Inc., succeeded Mr. Marshall as President and CEO of the Corporation, effective December 31, 2014.

2016

Fortis announced an agreement to acquire ITC Holdings Corp., the largest independent transmission utility in the United States for US$11.3 billion. ITC owns and operates high-voltage transmission operations in seven states. The transaction closed on October 14.
