Mention of trade names or commercial products does not constitute endorsement or recommendation for use. The views expressed in this article are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views or policies of the USEPA.AbstractRealistic metrics and methods for testing household biomass cookstoves are required to develop standards needed by international policy makers, donors, and investors. Application of consistent test practices allows emissions and energy efficiency performance to be benchmarked and enables meaningful comparisons among traditional and advanced stove types. In this study, 22 cookstoves burning six fuel types (wood, charcoal, pellets, corn cobs, rice hulls, and plant oil) at two fuel moisture levels were examined under laboratory-controlled operating conditions as outlined in the Water Boiling Test (WBT) protocol, Version 4. Pollutant emissions (carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, methane, total hydrocarbons, and ultrafine particles) were continuously monitored. Fine particle mass was measured gravimetrically for each WBT phase. Additional measurements included cookstove power, energy efficiency, and fuel use. Emission factors are given on the basis of fuel energy, cooking energy, fuel mass, time, and cooking task or activity. The lowest PM2.5 emissions were 74 mg MJdelivered–1 from a technologically advanced cookstove compared with 700–1400 mg MJdelivered–1 from the base-case open 3-stone cookfire. The highest thermal efficiency was 53% compared with 14–15% for the 3-stone cookfire. Based on these laboratory-controlled test results and observations, recommendations for developing potentially useful metrics for setting international standards are suggested. Supporting InformationAdditional information on the cookstoves, fuels, pots, facility, and test protocol used in this study; supplemental technical discussion; database for cookstove systems tested, including results for fuel moisture, fuel energy, cookstove power, WBT time-to-boil, efficiency, fuel use, and emissions of CO, PM2.5, CO2, THC, CH4, and UFPs.

Household ...Nearly half the world’s population must rely on solid fuels such as biomass (wood, charcoal, agricultural residues, and animal dung) and coal for household energy, burning them in inefficient open fires and stoves with inadequate ventilation. Household solid fuel combustion is associated with four million premature deaths annually; contributes to forest degradation, loss of habitat and biodiversity, and climate change; and hinders social and economic progress as women and children spend hours every day collecting fuel. Several recent studies, as well as key emerging national and international efforts, are making progress toward enabling wide-scale household adoption of cleaner and more efficient stoves and fuels. While significant challenges remain, these efforts offer considerable promise to save lives, improve forest sustainability, slow climate change, and empower women around the world.Abstract | Full Text HTML | PDF w/ Links | Hi-Res PDFIn-Use Emissions and Estimated Impacts of Traditional, Natural- and Forced-Draft Cookstoves in Rural MalawiEnvironmental Science & TechnologyWathore, Mortimer, and Grieshop2017 51 (3), pp 1929–1938Abstract: Emissions from traditional cooking practices in low- and middle-income countries have detrimental health and climate effects; cleaner-burning cookstoves may provide “co-benefits”.
