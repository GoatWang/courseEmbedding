Mills for Wet Grinding and Dispersion


What is an Immersion Mill?
An Immersion Mill (a quantum improvement over traditional basket mills) combines mixing and milling achieving maximum particle size distribution, increasing production efficiency, and producing extraordinary quality and profitability. Immersion milling is a revolution in wet grinding dispersion technology that defies comparison. Its unique design and method of operation surpasses all other systems, enabling the entire grinding and dispersion process to take place within a single water-cooled milling chamber. HCP Series Immersion Mill are the cutting edge in particle reduction system.

Biotech's billion dollar officer
Ken Howard Wilan *
*Ken Howard Wilan is a contributing writer based in Boston. kenhoward@mindspring.com












Leveraging a background in vaccines and leadership skills learned in the Army, Wayne Hockmeyer made a mid-career shift and built a biotech juggernaut. He is now onto his third career.
Founding a company and taking it to a billion dollars in revenue is not bad for a life's work. For Wayne Hockmeyer, founder and former CEO of MedImmune in Gaithersburg, Maryland, it was all done during his second career, one sandwiched between two other distinguished careers (see Box 1).
Hockmeyer's first job was with the US Army, where he served as an officer for 20 years, earning his doctorate in entomology at the University of Florida in Gainesville along the way. His last six years were as chairman of the department of immunology at Walter Reed Army Institute of Research. Towards the end, he was faced with signing up for another ten years or getting out.

















"If I was going to start a second career, [I thought I] might as well start at 41 rather than 51," says Hockmeyer. "So I took the leap and did it."
What he did was decide to get involved in biotech. Although big pharma seemed like a natural fit for someone with his background and interest in vaccine development, he had already worked in a large research organization and wanted something smaller, he says. Biotech seemed to be it.
"Even in the Army, I had thoughts about starting a company," he explains. And "building a successful company is all about leadership. The military is good at building leaders. Giving up and not succeeding is not part of the culture. It takes that stick-to-itiveness to be a successful entrepreneur. You can't give up."
His first stop was at the startup Praxis Biologics in Rochester, New York, which he joined as vice president of research and development. A year into his first job outside the Army the company went public.
His next big break came from a lunch meeting with seminal venture capitalist and Healthcare Ventures cofounder Wally Steinberg, now deceased, who shared Hockmeyer's interest in vaccines. In the fall of 1987 Hockmeyer arranged a lunch meeting with Steinberg in New York City.
Wally was an "interesting judge of people, he would make decisions by betting on people, and he bet on me," says Hockmeyer. "I never actually asked him why after three or four hours after lunch he would give me $3.5 million to start MedImmune."
One reason, speculates Hockmeyer, may have been his military background. Steinberg had worked with Johnson & Johnson in New Brunswick, New Jersey, which was run in the 1930s by General Robert Wood Johnson, son of the company founder and a brigadier general in World War II, "so the idea of going from the Army to business was not foreign" to him.
Steinberg's bet proved prescient. After switching MedImmune's focus early on from creating and manufacturing raw vaccines to producing antibody products, the company grew consistently. Started in 1988, it had $27 million in revenue and 126 employees by 1994. Its first product, Cytogam, (human IgG against cytomegalovirus) was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 1992. And with the introduction in 1998 of Synagis, the company created the first monoclonal antibody (against respiratory syncytial virus) approved for infectious disease, as well as profitability. By 2003, it had $1.1 billion in revenue. The company currently has approximately 1,900 employees worldwide and a market cap of approximately $6 billion at press time. That impressive trajectory took Hockmeyer from being a research scientist to a businessman.





"Starting a company ... takes lots of hard work, you hope you'll be successful but there are things you can't control. I'm not trying to talk people out of it, but to give them a sense of realism."







"You are forced to [become] a businessperson pretty fast as a CEO," says Hockmeyer. "It's clear you're not going to be a practicing scientist any more. I used to tell our head of research that for me to go into a lab anymore would be dangerous. Because you're engaged in business 125%, you've got to keep those skills sharp all the time. It's a trade-off you have to be willing to make."
Beginning the uphill battle of starting a first company in middle age never phased Hockmeyer. Biotech "companies are not often started by 21 year olds now or then," he observes. "It's still driven by good ideas and good people. It's not linked to age." And in addition to having had the scientific chops to understand the science, he also felt his background allowed him to evaluate how a scientific idea might become a potential product.
"Biotech is successful not just because of good ideas but because you appreciate [that] markets, [which] didn't look quite large [enough], were significant," he says (see Box 2).
He does admit to making mistakes along the way, some that he terms "life threatening" to the company, including forgoing the hiring of experienced people early on in an attempt to save money. "In our first go around with the FDA we made major mistakes and didn't even realize it," he says. Bringing in high level people early on is key, he says, as they can save you from critical mistakes. "A lot of entrepreneurs don't recognize that," says Hockmeyer.
He is trying to spread the word to a current crop of new CEOs in his third career as mentor since stepping down from the top position at MedImmune in 2000 (he remains chairman of the board). In addition to mentoring a number of executives at Maryland-area biotechs, he sits on their boards as well as the boards of Maryland business and technology booster organizations. And he has followed in Wally Steinberg's footsteps by becoming a venture capitalist himself as president of MedImmune Ventures, also in Gaithersburg.
He says that after heading MedImmune for 13 years, "I was out of gas on a day-to-day basis. If I took a sabbatical, I would have been able to do it, but I felt I couldn't drift off and come back."
And harkening back to his decision to go into biotech rather than pharma, he says he enjoyed running the company when it was smaller. "And I feel new leadership is important. I had a candidate to take over. If the stars [are] lined up, do it."
Hockmeyer says he has no interest in becoming a CEO of a new company. Instead, he will focus on looking for new ideas to support with his $100 million venture fund, of which approximately $71 million has already been invested. And he will continue to do his best to council and steer a current crop of new CEOs toward the promise that a company success like MedImmune holds out.
"When meeting with people, I want to make sure people are being realistic about starting a company," says Hockmeyer. "It takes lots of hard work, you hope you'll be successful but there are things you can't control. I'm not trying to talk people out of it, but to give them a sense of realism."
