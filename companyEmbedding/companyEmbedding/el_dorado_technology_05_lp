LSB Industries, Inc. Subsidiary, El Dorado Nitrogen, L.P. Receives OSHA Star Site Award For Baytown, Texas Facility






Business Wire




Mar 9, 2015 8:45 AM EDT













 


























































  LSB Industries, Inc. (NYSE:LXU) ("LSB" or "the Company"), a producer of chemical products for the agricultural, mining and industrial markets and a leading manufacturer of commercial and residential climate control products, today announced that its El Dorado Nitrogen L.P. ("EDNLP") subsidiary's operation at the Bayer MaterialScience complex in Baytown, TX has been recertified by the Occupational and Safety Health Administration ("OSHA") as a Star Site. This represents OSHA's highest award level under its Voluntary Protection Program ("VPP").  OSHA's VPP promotes effective collaboration between facility management, labor and OSHA to establish comprehensive worksite-based safety and health systems. EDNLP has been deemed a Star Site, which is the highest possible recognition for employers and employees who demonstrate exemplary achievement in the prevention and control of occupational safety and health hazards and the development, implementation and continuous improvement of their safety and health management systems.  "We are very proud of our team at Baytown," stated Barry Golsen, LSB's President and Chief Executive Officer. "EDNLP first implemented the program and received Star Site certification in 2003, and has demonstrated continual improvements to its health and safety management system since that time. EDNLP has had no recordable incidents at the facility for nearly ten years, performance that is further recognized by OSHA as being significantly better than the industry average."  About LSB Industries, Inc.  LSB is a manufacturing and marketing company. LSB's principal business activities consist of the manufacture and sale of chemical products for the agricultural, mining, and industrial markets, and the manufacture and sale of commercial and residential climate control products, such as water source and geothermal heat pumps, hydronic fan coils, modular chillers, large custom air handlers and make-up air units.  This press release includes certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements generally are identified by use of the words "believes", "expects", "intends", "anticipates", "plans to", "should", "estimates", "projects", or similar expressions, including, without limitation, ClimateMaster can realize its potential to deliver higher revenues and profitability; increased value for LSB's shareholders; streamline cost structure and margin improvement; strengthen its reputation as a technology leader; and growth of this business. Actual results may differ materially from the forward-looking statements as a result of various future events, including without limitation, the various factors described in the "Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements," and the "Risk Factors" contained in our most recent 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013, and Form 10-Qs for quarters ended March 31, June 30 and September 30, 2014. These forward looking statements speak only as of the date of this press release, and LSB expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to disseminate any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statement contained herein to reflect any change in LSB's expectations with regard thereto or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based.

					Full Description



Delek Logistics Partners, LP, incorporated on April 24, 2012, owns and operates logistics and marketing assets for crude oil, and intermediate and refined products. The Company's business primarily consists of certain crude oil, intermediate and refined products pipelines and transportation, storage, wholesale marketing, terminaling and offloading assets, which were previously owned, operated or held by Delek US Holdings, Inc. (Delek), and assets acquired from unrelated third parties. The Company operates through two segments: Pipelines and Transportation segment, and Wholesale Marketing and Terminalling segment. The Company engaged in the gathering, transporting and storing crude oil; storing intermediate products and feed stocks, and marketing, distributing, transporting, offloading and storing refined products. The Company also provides crude oil, intermediate and refined products transportation services for terminaling, and marketing services to third parties primarily in Texas, Tennessee and Arkansas.Pipelines and Transportation segmentThe pipelines and transportation segment consists of assets, including pipelines and trucks and ancillary assets that provide crude oil gathering and crude oil, intermediate and finished products transportation and storage services primarily in support of Tyler and El Dorado refineries. Additionally, this segment provides crude oil and other products transportation services to certain third parties. As of December 31, 2016, its pipeline assets included approximately 400 miles of operable crude oil transportation pipelines, approximately 366 miles of refined product pipelines and approximately 600 miles of crude oil gathering and trunk lines. Its Lion Pipeline System is a system of common carrier pipelines that transport crude oil to, and refined products from, Delek's El Dorado Refinery. The Lion Pipeline System consists primarily of the Magnolia Pipeline system; the El Dorado Pipeline system; multiple short crude oil pipelines located at the El Dorado Refinery and its Sandhill Station; the Magnolia Station located west of the El Dorado Refinery; a Refined Products Pipeline system, and certain related crude oil pipelines. The Magnolia Pipeline is an approximately 77-mile crude oil pipeline, with a capacity of approximately 68,500 barrels per day (bpd) that runs from a connection with ExxonMobil's LOLA System near Shreveport, Louisiana to its Magnolia Station, where the crude oil is then stored and transferred to its El Dorado Pipeline. In addition, third-party pipelines connect the Magnolia Pipeline near Haynesville, Louisiana, which allows for the receipt of crude oil transported from Longview, Texas. The El Dorado Pipeline is a 28-mile, 12-inch crude oil pipeline, with a capacity of approximately 22,000 bpd that transports crude oil from its Magnolia Station to Delek's Sandhill Station adjacent to the El Dorado Refinery. In addition, the Magnolia Station has storage facilities with approximately 220,000 barrels of active shell capacity, which includes the addition of a new 85,000 barrel crude oil storage tank. It also owns two refined product pipelines that transport gasoline and diesel from the El Dorado Refinery to the nearby Enterprise TE Products Pipeline El Dorado Station (the Refined Products Pipelines). As of December 31, 2016, the Company leased capacity of approximately 11,000 bpd on the Enterprise Products Pipeline from Enterprise's El Dorado Station to its refined products terminal in Memphis, Tennessee. The Refined Products Pipelines along with the leased capacity are collectively referred to as the Refined Products Pipeline System. The pipelines in the Lion Pipeline System also have injection points where crude oil gathered from the SALA Gathering System can be injected and then transported to the El Dorado Refinery. The Lion Pipeline System is capable of transporting crude oil offloaded from rail cars at or near the El Dorado Refinery, including at the two crude oil rail offloading racks.The SALA Gathering System is a system of common carrier pipelines that primarily gathers and transports crude oil and condensate that is purchased from various crude oil producers in Arkansas, Texas and Louisiana by Delek or a third party to whom Delek has assigned certain of its rights. The SALA Gathering System includes approximately 600 miles of 2 to 8 inch crude oil gathering and transportation lines in southern Arkansas and northern Louisiana, located primarily within a 60-mile radius of the El Dorado Refinery. In addition, the gathering system transports small volumes of crude oil that are received from other sources and condensate that is purchased from a third party in east Texas. All such crude oil and other products are transported to the El Dorado Refinery for processing. In addition, a pipeline within the SALA Gathering System transports minimal crude oil for third party shippers pursuant to a common carrier tariff. As of December 31, 2016, the SALA Gathering System included 53 crude oil storage tanks and breakout tanks with a total combined active shell capacity of approximately 0.8 million barrels (including Tank 192 and approximately 42,000 barrels of capacity it leases to an unrelated third party), 14 truck receipt locations, approximately 500 pipeline gathering and receiving stations and 17 relay stations to deliver crude oil to the Magnolia Station, the El Dorado Pipeline System or directly to the El Dorado Refinery. The Company's Paline Pipeline System is primarily a 195-mile, 10-inch crude oil pipeline, with a capacity of approximately 36,000 bpd, running from Longview, Texas to the Phillips 66-operated Beaumont terminal in Nederland, Texas. It includes a three-mile section that runs north from Kilgore, Texas. Its Paline Pipeline System is operated as a common carrier pipeline and the service is regulated by the FERC.The Company's East Texas Crude Logistics System includes two owned and operated crude oil pipeline systems and their related tank farms, which serve the Tyler Refinery: the Nettleton pipeline, a bi-directional 36-mile pipeline, with a capacity of approximately 38,000 bpd, that is capable of transporting crude oil from its tank farms in and around Longview, Texas to the Bullard Junction at the Tyler Refinery and to other of its tank farms in and around Longview, Texas, and the McMurrey Pipeline System, a 65-mile pipeline system, with a capacity of approximately 28,000 bpd, that transports crude oil from its tank farms in and around Longview, Texas and runs roughly parallel to the Nettleton Pipeline. Its East Texas Crude Logistics System also includes five owned or leased crude oil storage terminals, at which it stores crude oil owned by Delek for the Tyler Refinery. As of December 31, 2016, the LaGloria Station consisted of two tanks with an active shell capacity of approximately 450,000 barrels. As of December 31, 2016, the Nettleton Station consisted of five tanks with an active shell capacity of approximately 222,000 barrels. As of December 31, 2016, the Bradford Station consisted of two tanks with an active shell capacity of approximately 65,000 barrels. As of December 31, 2016, the Arp Station consisted of two tanks with an active shell capacity of approximately 110,000 barrels. As of December 31, 2016, the Big Sandy Station consisted of seven tanks with an active shell capacity of approximately 248,000 barrels.The Tyler-Big Sandy Pipeline is the pipeline link between the Tyler Refinery and the Partnership's terminal at Big Sandy, Texas that consists of the following two pipelines, which connect at the Hopewell Station: the Hopewell Pipeline, an approximately 13-mile pipeline with a capacity of approximately 26,000 bpd, which originates at the Tyler Refinery and terminates at the Hopewell Station, and the Big Sandy Pipeline, a 19-mile pipeline with a capacity of approximately 26,000 bpd, which originates at the Hopewell Station and terminates at the Big Sandy Terminal. The Big Sandy Terminal has 13 tanks with an aggregate shell capacity of approximately 177,000 barrels. As of December 31, 2016, the Tyler Tank Assets consisted of 96 storage tanks and certain ancillary assets (such as pumps and piping) located at and adjacent to the Tyler Refinery with an aggregate shell capacity of approximately 2.0 million barrels. The El Dorado Tank Assets consist of 158 storage tanks and certain ancillary assets (such as pumps and piping) located at and adjacent to the El Dorado Refinery with an aggregate shell capacity of approximately 2.5 million barrels. The Greenville-Mount Pleasant Pipeline is a 76-mile pipeline, connecting the Greenville Storage Facility and the Mount Pleasant Terminal. The service provided on the Greenville-Mount Pleasant Pipeline is regulated by the Texas Railroad Commission, subject to a tariff on file with that Commission. The Greenville Storage Facility has four tanks with an aggregate shell capacity of approximately 330,000 barrels and is connected to the Explorer Pipeline System. Its terminal in North Little Rock, Arkansas has five tanks with an aggregate shell capacity of approximately 180,000 barrels. As of December 31, 2016, it owned 123 trucks and 205 trailers used to haul primarily crude oil and other products for third parties and Delek. As of December 31, 2016, the El Dorado Rail Offloading Racks consisted of two crude oil rail offloading racks, which are designed to receive up to 25,000 bpd of light crude oil or 12,000 bpd of heavy crude oil, or any combination of the two, delivered by rail to the El Dorado Refinery and related ancillary assets. The Tyler Crude Tank is a crude oil storage tank and certain ancillary assets located adjacent to the Tyler Refinery. As of December 31, 2016, the Tyler Crude Tank had approximately 350,000 barrels of shell capacity and primarily supported the Tyler Refinery.Wholesale Marketing and Terminalling segmentThe wholesale marketing and terminalling segment provides wholesale marketing and terminaling services to Delek's refining operations and to independent third parties from whom the Company receives fees for marketing, transporting, storing and terminaling refined products. The wholesale marketing and terminalling segment provides marketing services for the refined products output of the Tyler refinery; engages in wholesale activity at its Abilene and San Angelo, Texas terminals, as well as at terminals owned by third parties, whereby it purchases light products for sale and exchange to third parties, and provides terminaling services to independent third parties and Delek. The Company markets the refined products output of the Tyler refinery, other than jet fuel and petroleum coke.In west Texas marketing operations, it generates revenue by purchasing refined products from independent third-party suppliers and from Delek for sale and exchange to third parties at its San Angelo and Abilene, Texas terminals and at third-party terminals located elsewhere in Texas. As of December 31, 2016, the Company owned approximately 104 miles of product pipelines in west Texas that connect its San Angelo and Abilene, Texas terminals to the Magellan Orion Pipeline. The Company provides terminaling services for products to independent third parties and Delek through light products terminals it owns in Nashville, Tennessee and to Delek, or certain third parties to whom Delek has assigned its rights, through its light products terminals in Memphis, Tennessee; Tyler, Texas; Big Sandy, Texas; Mount Pleasant, Texas; El Dorado, Arkansas; and North Little Rock, Arkansas.
