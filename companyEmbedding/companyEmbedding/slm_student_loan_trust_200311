                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Fitch Affirms SLM Student Loan Trust 2003-12 Notes | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Affirms SLM Student Loan Trust 2003-12 Notes
    





May 19, 2015 11:43 AM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has affirmed the SLM Student Loan Trust 2003-12 senior 
      notes at 'AAAsf' and subordinate note at 'BBBsf'. The Rating Outlook 
      remains Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      High Collateral Quality: The trust collateral consists of 100% of 
      Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP) loans. The credit quality 
      of the trust collateral is high, in Fitch's opinion, based on the 
      guarantees provided by the transaction's eligible guarantors and 
      reinsurance provided by the U.S. Department of Education (ED) for at 
      least 97% of principal and accrued interest. The current U.S. sovereign 
      rating is 'AAA' with a Stable Outlook.
    

      Sufficient Credit Enhancement (CE): CE is provided by excess spread and, 
      for the class A notes, subordination provided by the class B notes. As 
      of February 2015, excluding the reserve account, total parity is 100.00% 
      and senior parity is 104.80% (4.58% CE). Including the reserve, total 
      effective parity is 100.38% and senior effective parity is 105.20%. The 
      subordinate notes are receiving principal pro rata as the stepdown date 
      (Dec. 15, 2008) has passed. Cash is being released from the trust given 
      that the target total parity of 100% is maintained.
    

      Adequate Liquidity Support: Liquidity support is provided by a reserve 
      account which is sized at the greater of 0.25% of the pool balance and 
      $3,759,518, currently equal to the floor.
    

      Acceptable Servicing Capabilities: Day-to-day servicing is provided by 
      Navient Solutions, Inc. (formerly known as Sallie Mae, Inc.). In Fitch's 
      opinion, this servicer is an acceptable servicer of FFELP student loans.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Since FFELP student loan ABS rely on the U.S. government to reimburse 
      defaults, 'AAAsf' FFELP ABS ratings will likely move in tandem with the 
      'AAA' U.S. sovereign rating. Aside from the U.S. sovereign rating, 
      defaults and basis risk account for the majority of the risk embedded in 
      FFELP student loan transactions. Additional defaults and basis shock 
      beyond Fitch's published stresses could result in future downgrades. 
      Likewise, a buildup of CE driven by positive excess spread, given that 
      favorable basis factor conditions could lead to future upgrades.
    

      Fitch has affirmed the following ratings with a Stable Outlook:
    

      SLM Student Loan Trust Series 2003-12:
    

      --Class A-5 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class A-6 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class B at 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable.

Fitch Takes Various Actions on Three SLM Trusts | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Takes Various Actions on Three SLM Trusts
    





December 05, 2016 10:14 AM Eastern Standard Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has taken the following rating actions:
    

      SLM Student Loan Trust 2003-11 (SLM 2003-11):
    

      --Class A-5 affirmed at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class A-6 affirmed at 'AAAsf'; removed from Rating Watch Negative and 
      assigned Outlook Negative;
    

      --Class A-7 affirmed at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class B downgraded to 'BBBsf' from 'Asf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      SLM Student Loan Trust 2004-1 (SLM 2004-1):
    

      --Class A-3 affirmed at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class A-4 affirmed at 'AAAsf'; removed from Rating Watch Negative and 
      assigned Outlook Negative;
    

      --Class A-5 downgraded to 'Asf' from 'AAAsf'; removed from Rating Watch 
      Negative and assigned Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class A-6 affirmed at 'AAAsf'; removed from Rating Watch Negative and 
      assigned Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class B affirmed at 'Asf'; removed from Rating Watch Negative and 
      assigned Outlook Stable.
    

      SLM Student Loan Trust 2006-10 (SLM 2006-10):
    

      --Class A-5A affirmed at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class A-5B affirmed at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class A-6 affirmed at 'AAAsf'; removed from Rating Watch Negative and 
      assigned Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class B affirmed at 'Asf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      The SLM 2003-11 class A-6 and SLM 2004-1 A-4 notes miss their maturity 
      date under the 'AAAsf' maturity stresses by a small margin, and are 
      likely to pass given an additional one to two years of pay-down. As 
      such, the notes are assigned Outlook Negative rather than downgraded.
    

      The SLM 2004-1 class A-5 notes pay in full before their maturity in 
      scenarios up to the 'BBBsf' maturity stresses. Because their maturity 
      date of July 2028 is greater than seven years away, and the notes are 
      currently rated 'AAAsf', they are eligible for the downgrade tolerance 
      of one rating category. This results in the downgrade to 'AAsf'.
    

      The downgrade of the SLM 2003-11 class B notes reflects that the notes 
      fail the credit stresses at the 'Asf' level and above, with principal 
      and interest shortfalls.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      U.S. Sovereign Risk: The trust collateral is comprised of 100% Federal 
      Family Education Loan Program (FFELP) loans, with guaranties provided by 
      eligible guarantors and reinsurance provided by the U.S. Department of 
      Education (ED) for at least 97% of principal and accrued interest. The 
      U.S. sovereign rating is currently 'AAA'/Outlook Stable.
    

      Collateral Performance for SLM 2003-11: Fitch assumes a base case 
      default rate of 11.25% and a 33.75% default rate under the 'AAA' credit 
      stress scenario, which is based on recent actual performance. The claim 
      reject rate is assumed to be 0.50% in the base case and 3% in the 'AAA' 
      case. Fitch applies the standard default timing curve in its credit 
      stress cash flow analysis. The trailing 12-month (TTM) average constant 
      default rate, utilized in the maturity stresses, is 2.2%. TTM levels of 
      deferment, forbearance, income-based repayment (prior to adjustment) and 
      constant prepayment rate (voluntary and involuntary) are 5.1%, 8.2%, 
      12.2%, and 8.1%, respectively, and are used as the starting point in 
      cash flow modelling. Subsequent declines or increases are modelled as 
      per criteria. The borrower benefit is assumed to be approximately 0.21%, 
      based on information provided by the sponsor.
    

      Collateral Performance for SLM 2004-1: Fitch assumes a base case default 
      rate of 13.25% and a 39.75% default rate under the 'AAA' credit stress 
      scenario, which is based on Fitch's default model and reflective of 
      recent actual performance. The claim reject rate is assumed to be 0.50% 
      in the base case and 3% in the 'AAA' case. Fitch applies the standard 
      default timing curve in its credit stress cash flow analysis. The 
      trailing-12-month (TTM) average constant default rate, utilized in the 
      maturity stresses, is 1.8%. TTM levels of deferment, forbearance, 
      income-based repayment (prior to adjustment) and constant prepayment 
      rate (voluntary and involuntary) are 4.4%, 6.8%, 8.9%, and 7.1%, 
      respectively, and are used as the starting point in cash flow modelling. 
      Subsequent declines or increases are modelled as per criteria. The 
      borrower benefit is assumed to be approximately 0.30%, based on 
      information provided by the sponsor.
    

      Collateral Performance for SLM 2006-10: Fitch assumes a base case 
      default rate of 16.25% and a 49% default rate under the 'AAA' credit 
      stress scenario, which is based on Fitch's default model and reflective 
      of recent actual performance. The claim reject rate is assumed to be 
      0.50% in the base case and 3% in the 'AAA' case. Fitch applies the 
      standard default timing curve in its credit stress cash flow analysis. 
      The TTM average constant default rate, utilized in the maturity 
      stresses, is 2.3%. TTM levels of deferment, forbearance, income-based 
      repayment (prior to adjustment) and constant prepayment rate (voluntary 
      and involuntary) are 7.2%, 12.5%, 13.3%, and 9.0%, respectively, and are 
      used as the starting point in cash flow modelling. Subsequent declines 
      or increases are modelled as per criteria. The borrower benefit is 
      assumed to be approximately 0.18%, based on information provided by the 
      sponsor.
    

      Basis and Interest Rate Risk: Fitch applies its standard basis and 
      interest rate stresses to this transaction as per criteria.
    

      Payment Structure for SLM 2003-11: Credit enhancement (CE) is provided 
      by excess spread and, for the class A notes, subordination. As of August 
      2016, total and senior effective parity ratios (including the reserve) 
      are 100.44% (0.43% CE) and 105.22% (4.96% CE). Both class A and B are 
      receiving principal since the step-down date of December 2008 has 
      passed. Liquidity support is provided by a reserve equal to its floor of 
      $3,008,024. The transaction will continue to release cash as long as the 
      target parity ratio of 100% (excluding the reserve, as pool factor is 
      below 40%) is maintained.
    

      Payment Structure for SLM 2004-1: Credit enhancement (CE) is provided by 
      excess spread and, for the class A notes, subordination. As of September 
      2016, total and senior effective parity ratios (including the reserve) 
      are 100.40% (0.40% CE) and 104.94% (4.71% CE). Both class A and B are 
      receiving principal since the step-down date of July 2009 has passed. 
      Liquidity support is provided by a reserve equal to its floor of 
      $3,007,834. The transaction will continue to release cash as long as the 
      target parity ratio of 100% (excluding the reserve, as pool factor is 
      below 40%) is maintained.
    

      Payment Structure for SLM 2006-10: Credit enhancement (CE) is provided 
      by excess spread and, for the class A notes, subordination. As of 
      September 2016, total and senior effective parity ratios (including the 
      reserve) are 100% and 105.06% (4.82% CE). Both class A and B are 
      receiving principal since the step-down date of January 2013 has passed. 
      Liquidity support is provided by a reserve equal to its floor of 
      $6,034,845. The transaction will continue to release cash as long as the 
      target parity ratio of 100% (including the reserve, until pool factor is 
      below 40%) is maintained.
    

      Maturity Risk: Fitch's SLABS cash flow model indicates that the notes 
      are paid in full on or prior to the legal final maturity dates under the 
      commensurate rating scenarios, subject to the downgrade tolerance and 
      small misses explained above.
    

      Operational Capabilities: Day-to-day servicing is provided by Navient 
      Solutions, Inc. (formerly known as Sallie Mae, Inc.). Fitch believes 
      Navient to be an acceptable servicer, due to its extensive track record 
      as the largest servicer of FFELP loans.
    

      CRITERIA VARIATIONS
    

      Under the 'Counterparty Criteria for Structured Finance and Covered 
      Bonds', dated July 18, 2016, Fitch looks to its own ratings in analyzing 
      counterparty risk and assessing a counterparty's creditworthiness. The 
      definition of permitted investments for this deal allows for the 
      possibility of using investments not rated by Fitch, which represents a 
      criteria variation. Since the only available funds to invest in are 
      those held in the Collection Account, and the funds can only be invested 
      for a short duration of three months given the payment frequency of the 
      notes, Fitch does not believe such variation has a measurable impact 
      upon the ratings assigned.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      'AAAsf' rated tranches of most FFELP securitizations will likely move in 
      tandem with the U.S. sovereign rating, given the strong linkage to the 
      U.S. sovereign by nature of the reinsurance and SAP provided by ED. 
      Sovereign risks are not addressed in Fitch's sensitivity analysis.
    

      Fitch conducted a CE sensitivity analysis by stressing both the related 
      lifetime default rate and basis spread assumptions. In addition, Fitch 
      conducted a maturity sensitivity analysis by running different 
      assumptions for the IBR usage and prepayment rate. The results below 
      should only be considered as one potential model implied outcome as the 
      transaction is exposed to multiple risk factors that are all dynamic 
      variables.

      It is important to note that the stresses are intended to provide an 
      indication of the rating sensitivity of the notes to unexpected 
      deterioration in trust performance. Rating sensitivity should not be 
      used as an indicator of future rating performance.

      All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in 
      making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on 
      factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from 
      other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable 
      investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance 
      with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of 
      that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources 
      are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The 
      manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party 
      verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated 
      security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the 
      jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the 
      issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public 
      information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, 
      the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit 
      reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, 
      engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third 
      parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party 
      verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the 
      particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. 
      Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an 
      enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can 
      ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a 
      rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer 
      and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information 
      they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other 
      reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
      work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to 
      financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax 
      matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other 
      information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and 
      predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified 
      as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, 
      ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions 
      that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or 
      affirmed.
    

      The information in this report is provided "as is" without any 
      representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or 
      warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the 
      requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion 
      as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made 
      by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch 
      is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports 
      are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of 
      individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating 
      does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, 
      unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the 
      offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. 
      Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not 
      solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are 
      named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is 
      neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, 
      verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in 
      connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or 
      withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. 
      Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
      recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not 
      comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security 
      for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of 
      payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from 
      issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for 
      rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 
      (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, 
      Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, 
      or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
      single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to 
      US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, 
      publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute 
      a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any 
      registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, 
      the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or 
      the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative 
      efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may 
      be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to
