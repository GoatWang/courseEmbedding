Mark L. Gordon, M.D.






For 
Prevention and Quality of Life Issues.





 


Â 
Â Â Â 

I began my Traditional 
Medical education completing a four
year residency program inÂ Family Medicine. I graduated 
first in my class receiving the highest honors.Â  Little did they know that 
I would subsequently be redirected into the area of Alternative and 
Complementary Medicine. Â 
Â Â Â Â  At 
that time, anything besides classical medicine was perceived as bunk, junk, 
snake oil and voodoo! Understandable so, it was because there was just too 
little good information that was getting into the mainstream medical 
publications. The great Parma saw to that. 
Â Â Â  None-the-less,
was well trained in critical 
thinking and as a medical
investigator while working at Cedar-Sinai/UCLA. I sought 
after the hard science which would either
support or deny the claims being made aboutÂ  products
that I would eventually offer toÂ  my patients.Â  
I broke down each product into its components and found articles to support or 
deny the claims made about any 
benefits.Â  Those that passed this rigorous evaluation were 
added to my list of approved for patients.Â  This became my hallmark 
procedure for 
all products that were offer to me.Â  
Â  Â Â  Since
1994, I have reviewed reams of 
documents on
Herbs, Minerals, Homeopathic Medicines, and Amino Acids.Â  I aligned myself with a few
good, reputable manufacturers and product development companies and have participated in
bringing to patients a natural product for Alzheimer's Disease, 
Growth Hormone Stimulator, Vitamins and  MyoboostÂ.Â  At this time, I
continue to review 200-400 abstracts 

a week on interesting advances in medicine that could improve 
upon the manner in which we age; it is now more an issue of

QUALITY of 
Life and not just the quantity.

Â Justin GordonAge: 31*Fairlane Products/FixtureworksFraser, MI
Thereâs a lot of tradition in Justin Gordonâs life, traditions that begin and end with his family and the family businesses, Fairlane Products, a designer and manufacturer of workholding and positioning components for automation, and Fixtureworks, a distributor of workholding technologies. At the age of 26, fate thrust him into the role of running both companies, as General Manager and co-owner with his sister, Kelsey, after the untimely deaths of both his father, Mark Gordon, and his grandfather, Richard, within four months of one another.Justin grew up in the family business. âMy entire family was involved in manufacturingâin our own shop, in an industrial real estate side of the business which leased commercial space to other manufacturers, and in our own Fairlane Tool contract manufacturing business. I was always around shop floors, whether ours or somebody elseâs. Weekends, and after school, I was put to work on manual machines, probably to encourage me to get an education. What really happened was that I could see beyond the monotonous side of the work to being able to see how smaller processes fit into the bigger picture.âJustin graduated from Michigan State University with a degree in supply chain management, a discipline that is especially well-suited to the family business. âWhen I graduated, one of the first things that I did was get involved in bringing a new ERP system in. I wasnât the person implementing the system. I was the one gathering information to populate the system. A lot of the information was kept in Excel files, in separate binders, or simply in the legacy knowledge of the people on the shop floor. My job was to go around and gather that information from everybody and put it into a consistent format that could be entered into the system. By the end of the project, I had learned a lot about our operations, and we had an accurate costing system, an ability to track all of our jobs and work in process, and a sophisticated way to control our inventory and warehouse.âIn Justinâs capacity, he is responsible for all operations including new product development, manufacturing, sales, customer service and marketing as well as for more than 30 employees of the two companies. He works closely with the principals of the companies and the leading brands that Fixtureworks represents. âIâm very comfortable talking to our customers about how our products work in their applications and how they should and should not be used.â And thatâs saying something as Fixtureworks provides more than 20,000 clamping, workholding, fixturing and material handling components all designed to promote higher productivity through faster speeds and feeds.âFairlane Products has always been more niched in products like serrated grippers and other replaceable contact points in one line, our rollers and bumpers and our quick release pins. For the future, I want to focus on workholding and positioning products that mirror manufacturing trends and innovative technologies.â Family tradition will come full circle when Justin and his fiancÃ©e Nicole are married on the top of a mountain in Utah in the future. Every year, Justinâs family spent a week skiing in Utah at their favorite chalet.
