New Orleans Saints long snapper Thomas Gafford takes part in a NFL Minicamp at the Saints Training Facility in Metairie, La. Tuesday, June 13, 2017.


Advocate staff photo by MATTHEW HINTON





























































The New Orleans Saints are expected to sign veteran long snapper Thomas Gafford on Thursday afternoon, a league source told The Advocate.The team also informed defensive end Royce LaFrance that he will be signed before training camp, according to a league source.New Orleans waived long snapper Jesse Schmitt, offensive guard Cameron Lee and wide receiver Dan Arnold to make room for the signings. Arnold, who did not participate in this week's minicamp, was waived with an injury designation.
With Schmitt gone, Gafford, a long-time member of the Kansas City Chiefs who has 125 NFL games under his belt, joins Chase Dominguez in the battle to replace former long snapper Justin Drescher. A 34-year-old who is listed at 6-foot-2, 250 pounds, Gafford was the Chiefs starter from 2008 to 2014, and he's spent parts of the last two seasons with the Chicago Bears, Oakland Raiders and Denver Broncos. LaFrance, a product of Tulane, spent time with the Saints last year and was invited to rookie minicamp earlier this offseason. He showed up with an interception during practice Tuesday's practice.

The team told LaFrance he will be signed at some point during the next month, in time for the start of training camp.Nick Underhill contributed to this report.

Specialties & ExpertiseDr. Thomas Long has the following 1 specialty.                     Family Medicine
    A family practitioner is a doctor who specializes in caring for people of all ages, at all stages of life. Rather than focusing on the treatment of one disease or patient population, family practitioners are often the doctors that people see for their everyday ailments, like cold and flu or respiratory infections, and health screenings. When necessary, family practitioners will provide referrals for conditions that require the expertise of another specialist.


    The doctors may also provide physicals, inoculations, prenatal care, treat chronic diseases, like diabetes and asthma, and provide advice on disease prevention.
