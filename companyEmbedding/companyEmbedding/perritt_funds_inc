 Our Firm

 


With thirty years of experience in the micro-cap space, not only does Perritt have a commitment to small companies—we operate as a small company.
Sharing a boots-to-the-ground mentality with the micro-cap companies we invest in, our commitment and knowledge of the micro-cap space is consistent across all of our investment strategies. Other firms may offer investments in micro-cap securities as part of a larger whole philosophy. We only invest in fundamentally and financially sound micro-cap companies and do not stray from this focus.

Fund Strategy
Investment Criteria The Fund invests in companies that are listed in the bottom decile of the major stock exchanges as ranked by market capitalization. Today, the Fund invests in companies that at the time of initial investment have a market capitalization below $300 million.
Bottom-Up Process The management team uses a bottom up approach, with ideas provided by in-house research and an external network of small company research boutiques and regional brokerage firms that has been cultivated over twenty-five  years.
Nine-Point Evaluation Companies are subjected to a nine-point evaluation based on balance sheets, cash flow and income statements that the management team believes demonstrate whether a company is acting in the interests of its shareholders.
Fundamental Research For companies whose fundamentals look favorable based on the nine point evaluation, the next step is to assess its broader business prospects. The management team meets with 3-5 company executives each week to identify what in our opinion are growing, niche companies with innovative products and/or services and the potential to build franchises and brands.
Valuation Assessment Stocks are assessed based on valuations, favoring companies with modest valuation multiples relative to long term growth prospects. Companies are considered for purchase if they fall under a range of valuation determinations, including GARP or Deep Value.
Investment Objective
The Perritt Ultra MicroCap Fund seeks long-term capital appreciation.


Fund managers named to the Barron’s list of the industry’s Top 100 have consistently outperformed their peers. The Barron’s/Value Line annual rankings system awards points to managers who generate more stable returns and subtracts points from funds deemed to volatile. Value Line first screens out those Funds with more than two lead managers and managers with less than three years’ tenure. The remaining funds are then organized by investment objective, and then sector funds and those with less than $200 million in assets are eliminated. The Barron’s Value/Line Survey was discontinued after 2007.
The sector classifications represented in the graph are in accordance with Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS®), which was developed by and/or is the exclusive property of MSCI, Inc. and Standard & Poor Financial Services LLC.

 Our Funds

What 30 Years of Investment Experience Tells Us
The Perritt Funds seek to capture the benefits of the "small firm effect"1 through bottom-up, fundamental stock selection. We are devoted to the micro-cap space and focuses only on investing in micro-cap companies. Our two micro-cap investment strategies offer investors distinct exposure to the micro-cap asset class without risk of style drift.
Perritt MicroCap Opportunities Fund (PRCGX)
The Perritt MicroCap Opportunities Fund invests in a diversified portfolio of equity securities that at the time of purchase have a market capitalization (equity market value) of $500 million or less. The Fund seeks micro-cap companies that management believes have the potential for long-term capital appreciation based on superior or niche products or services, favorable operating characteristics, superior management, and/or other exceptional factors. Investors should expect the Fund to contain a mix of both value and growth stocks.
Perritt Ultra MicroCap Fund (PREOX)
The Perritt Ultra MicroCap Fund invests in a diversified portfolio of equity securities that at the time of purchase have a market capitalization (equity market value) of $300 million or less. The Fund seeks to invest in very small companies that have a significant percentage of stock owned by management, low levels of long-term debt, above average revenue and earnings growth rates, and those that possess reasonable valuations based on the ratios of price-to-sales, price-to-earnings, and price-to-book values.
Perritt Low Priced Stock Fund (PLOWX)
The Perritt Low Priced Stock Fund is a no load mutual fund that seeks long-term capital appreciation by investing mainly in common stocks of companies with market capitalizations that are below $3 billion at the time of initial purchase. The Fund will invest in low priced stocks which we define as those companies trading at or below $15 per share at the time of initial purchase. Investments will be made in companies in which we believe have the potential for long-term capital appreciation based on superior or niche products or services, favorable operating characteristics, superior management, and/or other exceptional factors.

			For The Low Priced Stock Fund, the investment adviser has voluntarily agreed to waive fees and/or reimburse operating expenses (other than interest, brokerage commissions, dividend expense on short sales, taxes, extraordinary expenses and acquired fund fees and expenses) so that total annual operating expenses are not expected to exceed 1.39% through February 2017.  The net expense ratio represents what investors have paid.

Performance data quoted represents past performance; past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance of the fund may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Performance data current to the most recent month end may be obtained by calling 800-331-8936. The funds impose a 2% exchange and redemption fee for shares held 90 days or less. Performance data quoted does not reflect the redemption or exchange fee. If reflected, total return would be reduced.

Performance data quoted of the Low Priced Stock Fund for periods on or prior to 2/28/14 represents past performance of the fund’s predecessor, a separately managed account.  The fund is the successor to a separately managed account.  The investment policies, objectives, guidelines and restrictions of the fund are in all material respects equivalent to those of the predecessor, and the predecessor’s portfolio managers are the current portfolio managers of the fund.  However, the predecessor was not a registered investment company.  Had the predecessor been registered under the Investment Company Act and been subject to the provisions of the Investment Company Act and the Internal Revenue Code to which the fund is subject, its investment performance may have been adversely affected.  The performance information reflects the gross expenses of the predecessor adjusted to reflect the higher fees and expenses of the fund.  The performance is shown net of the annual management fee of 1.00% and other expenses.  The performance was achieved by the predecessor when assets were relatively small; the same strategies may not be available, and similar performance may not be achieved, when the fund’s assets are larger.

The MicroCap Opportunities Fund (PRCGX) is a successor to the investment performance of the Perritt MicroCap Opportunities Fund, the fund’s predecessor. Performance information shown for periods on or prior to March 31, 2014 is that of the fund’s predecessor. The MicroCap Opportunities Fund was advised by the same adviser, has the same investment objective and strategies as the predecessor fund.			

1 “The Neglected and Small Firm Effects.” Avner Arbel & Paul Strebel, The Financial Review, vol. 18, issue 4, 1982.


Price to Cash Flow is calculated by dividing the current price of the stock by the company’s cash flow per share.
Price to Book Value Ratio is calculated by dividing the current price of the stock by the company’s book value per share.
Price to Sales Ratio is a tool for calculating a stock’s valuation relative to other companies, calculated by dividing a stock’s current price by its revenue per share.
Price to Earnings Ratio is calculated by dividing current price of the stock by the company’s trailing 12 months’ earnings per share.
Earnings Growth is the measurement of any increase in company earnings over a set time period.
Diversification does not assure a profit or protect against a loss in a declining market.
Earnings Growth is not representative of the fund’s future performance.
While the fund is no-load, management and other expenses still apply.

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The MSCI India Index (NDEUSIA) is designed to measure the performance of the large- and mid-capitalization segments of the Indian market, covering approximately 85% of companies in the Indian equity securities market.  One cannot invest directly in an Index.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 0.95%.  The Fund’s Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with the Fund, under which Rafferty has contractually agreed to cap all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse the Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2018, to the extent that the Fund’s Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.95% of the Fund’s daily net assets other than the following:  taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The MSCI India Index (NDEUSIA) is designed to measure the performance of the large- and mid-capitalization segments of the Indian market, covering approximately 85% of companies in the Indian equity securities market.  One cannot invest directly in an Index.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 0.95%.  The Fund’s Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with the Fund, under which Rafferty has contractually agreed to cap all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse the Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2018, to the extent that the Fund’s Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.95% of the Fund’s daily net assets other than the following:  taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

 The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance for one year and under are cumulative, not annualized. Short term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. For additional information, see the fund(s) prospectus.
Each Direxion Fund share price is calculated as of the close of regular trading, usually as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, each day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Each fund seeks to meet its investment objective relative to the value of the target index or benchmark as of 4:00 p.m.
Shares of Direxion Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market Price returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 PM Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Fund returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV. Some performance results reflect expense subsidies and waivers in effect during certain periods shown. Absent these waivers, results would have been less favorable.
After-Tax and After-Tax, Post Sales Returns
Tax-adjusted returns and tax cost ratio are estimates of the impact taxes have had on a fund. We assume the highest tax rate in calculating these figures. These returns follow the SEC guidelines for calculating returns before sale of shares. Tax-adjusted returns show a fund’s annualized after tax total return for the one, three and five year periods, excluding any capital-gains effects that would result from selling the fund at the end of the period. To determine this figure, all income and short-term capital gains distributions are taxed at the maximum federal rate at the time of distribution. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a 15% rate. The after tax portion is then assumed to be reinvested in the fund. State and local taxes are not included in our calculations. For more information, please consult your tax consultant.
Distribution Dates

Payable and Ex-Date – With regard to mutual funds, this is the day on which declared distributions (dividends or capital gains) are deducted from the fund’s assets before it calculates its net asset value (NAV). The NAV per share will drop by the amount of the distribution per share.
Record Date – Date by which a shareholder must officially own shares in order to be entitled to a dividend.

Types of Distributions

Income Dividend – A portion of a company’s profit paid to common and preferred shareholders.
Long Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for more than one year.
Short Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for less than one year

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
