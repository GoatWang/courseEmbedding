Retirement Plan Services 

Thompson Investment Management believes that the best way to achieve financial independence in retirement is to receive sound investment guidance during employment. This is why we offer personal, one-on-one education to all employees of our Retirement Plan Services clients.

We use decades of knowledge and expertise to educate participants about what is important when investing for the long-term. We also work closely with plan sponsors to ensure that they’re fulfilling their duties, and often act as plan co-fiduciary. We work with the following retirement plans:


401(k)
403(b)
Profit Sharing
Defined Benefit




SIMPLE IRAs
SEPs
Cash Balance



Thompson Investment Management works with third party administrators (TPAs), record keepers and custodians to insure excellent customer service throughout all levels of a retirement plan. We listen to our clients’ needs to ensure we find the correct retirement plan for both business owners and employees.
To find out how we can help you, or to receive a free side-by-side cost comparison with your current plan, please contact us today: Retirement@ThompsonInvest.com

Performance data quoted represents
                    past performance: past performance does not guarantee future
                    results. The investment returns and principal value of an
                    investment will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when
                    redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
                    Current performance of the Fund may be lower or higher than
                    the performance quoted. Performance data current to the most
                    recent month-end may be obtained by clicking the following

Thompson Investment Management, Inc. Announces Promotions




















March 25, 2015 12:00 ET

 | Source: Thompson Investment Management, Inc.





MADISON, Wis., March 25, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Thompson Investment Management, Inc. is pleased to announce the promotion of John W. Thompson to Chairman of the Board of Directors of Thompson Investment Management, Inc. and Jason L. Stephens to the roles of Chief Executive Officer of Thompson Investment Management, Inc. and Chief Executive Officer of Thompson IM Funds, Inc. on March 31, 2015.

	"My goals with these promotions are two-fold. First, I'm happy to publicly recognize Jason for his ongoing expertise in managing the firm. At the same time, I'm excited to shed various administrative responsibilities and dedicate more of my time to managing our three mutual funds and individual client accounts," said John W. Thompson.

	Mr. Thompson will continue to be an active member of the investment research team and co-manager of the firm's three mutual funds and also will continue to work with individual clients and serve as the President and a Director of both Thompson Investment Management, Inc. and Thompson IM Funds, Inc. The current investment strategy and portfolio management team will not change. This team has been together since 2009 and has contributed to the firm's strong growth to over $3.5 billion in assets under management.

	Mr. Stephens has worked at Thompson Investment Management for 13 years, most recently serving as Chief Operating Officer. He also serves on the Board of Directors of Thompson IM Funds, Inc, and co-manages the firm's three mutual funds with Mr. Thompson and Chief Investment Officer James T. Evans. 

	"John has long served as a valued mentor to me and I'm grateful for the trust he's placed in me with these promotions. His leadership has allowed me along with key employees Penny Hubbard, who has played an important role in managing the operations of the company for 30 years, and James T. Evans to better serve our clients and our firm," said Jason L. Stephens.

About Thompson Investment Management, Inc.
