	Legal Proceedings


	Nationwide Life and Annuity Insurance Company


	Nationwide Financial Services, Inc. (NFS, or collectively with
	its subsidiaries, "the Company") was formed in November 1996. NFS is the holding company for Nationwide Life Insurance Company (NLIC), Nationwide Life and Annuity Insurance Company (NLAIC) and other companies that comprise the life insurance and
	retirement savings operations of the Nationwide group of companies (Nationwide). This group includes Nationwide Financial Network (NFN), an affiliated distribution network that markets directly to its customer base. NFS is incorporated in Delaware
	and maintains its principal executive offices in Columbus, Ohio.


	The Company is subject to legal and regulatory proceedings in
	the ordinary course of its business. The Company's legal and regulatory matters include proceedings specific to the Company and other proceedings generally applicable to business practices in the industries in which the Company operates. These
	matters are subject to many uncertainties, and given their complexity and scope, their outcomes cannot be predicted. Regulatory proceedings could also affect the outcome of one or more of the Company's litigation matters. Furthermore, it is often
	not possible to determine the ultimate outcomes of the pending regulatory investigations and legal proceedings or to provide reasonable ranges of potential losses with any degree of certainty. Some matters, including certain of those referred to
	below, are in very preliminary stages, and the Company does not have sufficient information to make an assessment of the plaintiffs' claims for liability or damages. In some of the cases seeking to be certified as class actions, the court has not
	yet decided whether a class will be certified or (in the event of certification) the size of the class and class period. In many of the cases, the plaintiffs are seeking undefined amounts of damages or other relief, including punitive damages and
	equitable remedies, which are difficult to quantify and cannot be defined based on the information currently available. The Company believes, however, that based on currently known information, the ultimate outcome of all pending legal and
	regulatory matters is not likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company's condensed consolidated financial position. Nonetheless, given the large or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these matters and the inherent unpredictability
	of litigation, it is possible that such outcomes could materially affect the Company's condensed consolidated financial position or results of operations in a particular quarter or annual period.


	The various businesses conducted by the Company are subject to
	oversight by numerous federal and state regulatory entities, including but not limited to the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Department of Labor, the Internal Revenue Service, and state insurance
	authorities. Such regulatory entities may, in the normal course, be engaged in general or targeted inquiries, examinations and investigations of the Company and/or its




	PROS-0272













	affiliates. The financial services industry has been the subject of
	increasing scrutiny in connection with a broad spectrum of regulatory issues; with respect to all such scrutiny directed at the Company and/or its affiliates, the Company is cooperating with regulators. The Company will cooperate with Nationwide
	Mutual Insurance Company (NMIC) insofar as any inquiry, examination or investigation encompasses NMIC's operations.


	On August 15, 2001, NFS and NLIC were named in a lawsuit filed
	in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut entitled

	Lou Haddock, as trustee of the Flyte Tool & Die, Incorporated Deferred Compensation Plan, et al v. Nationwide Financial Services, Inc.
	and Nationwide Life Insurance Company

	. On November 18, 2009, the plaintiffs filed a sixth amended complaint amending the list of named plaintiffs and claiming to represent a class of qualified retirement plan trustees under the Employee
	Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) that purchased variable annuities from NLIC. The plaintiffs allege that they invested ERISA plan assets in their variable annuity contracts and that NLIC and NFS breached ERISA fiduciary duties by
	allegedly accepting service payments from certain mutual funds. The complaint seeks disgorgement of some or all of the payments allegedly received by NFS and NLIC, other unspecified relief for restitution, declaratory and injunctive relief, and
	attorneys' fees. On November 6, 2009, the Court granted the plaintiffs' motion for class certification. On October 21, 2010, the District Court dismissed NFS from the lawsuit. On February 6, 2012, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the
	November 6, 2009 order granting class certification and remanded the case back to the District Court for further consideration. On September 6, 2013, the District Court granted the plaintiffs' motion for class certification. NLIC filed a motion for
	summary judgment on March 17, 2014. Oral argument on the motion for summary judgment is scheduled for July 11, 2014. The case is set for trial beginning February 9, 2015. NLIC continues to defend this lawsuit vigorously.


	On November 20, 2007, Nationwide Retirement Solutions, Inc.
	(NRS) and NLIC were named in a lawsuit filed in the Circuit Court of Jefferson County, Alabama entitled

	Ruth A. Gwin and Sandra H. Turner, and a class of similarly situated individuals v. Nationwide Life Insurance
	Company, Nationwide Retirement Solutions, Inc., Alabama State Employees Association, PEBCO, Inc. and Fictitious Defendants A to Z

	. On March 12, 2010, NRS and NLIC were named in a Second Amended Class Action Complaint filed in the Circuit
	Court of Jefferson County, Alabama entitled

	Steven E. Coker, Sandra H. Turner, David N. Lichtenstein and a class of similarly situated individuals v. Nationwide Life Insurance Company, Nationwide Retirement
	Solutions, Inc., Alabama State Employees Association, Inc., PEBCO, Inc. and Fictitious Defendants A to Z

	claiming to represent a class of all participants in the Alabama State Employees Association, Inc. (ASEA) Plan, excluding members of the
	Deferred Compensation Committee, ASEA's directors, officers and board members, and PEBCO's directors, officers and board members. On October 22, 2010, the parties to this action executed a court approved stipulation of settlement that agreed to
	certify a class for settlement purposes only, that provided for payments to the settlement class, and that provided for releases, certain bar orders, and dismissal of the case. The settlement fund has been paid out. On December 6, 2011, the Court
	entered an Order that NRS owed indemnification to ASEA and PEBCO for only the Coker (Gwin) class action, and dismissed NLIC. The Company resolved the indemnification claims of ASEA. On February 15, 2013, the Court issued its Order determining the
	amount of fees due to PEBCO on its indemnification claim. On March 28, 2014, the Alabama Supreme Court reversed the trial Court decision awarding PEBCO its attorney fees and remanded the case back to the trial court to enter a judgment in favor of
	NRS. PEBCOs counsel has asked the court to reconsider its decision. NRS continues to defend this case vigorously.


	Lehman Brothers Holdings, Inc. (Debtors) and Giddens, James v
	NLIC and NMIC, et al.



	In 2012 the Plaintiff, Debtor in Possession Lehman Brothers Special Financing, Inc., filed a class action in the United States Bankruptcy
	Court for the Southern District of New York seeking the recovery of certain assets from approximately 200 defendants, including NLIC and NMIC (the "Distributed Action"). The claims against NLIC and NMIC arise from the bankruptcy filings in 2008 of
	the Plaintiff and its parent company, Lehman Brothers Holding, Inc., which triggered the early termination of two collateralized debt obligation transactions, resulting in payments to NLIC and NMIC. The Plaintiff seeks to have certain sums returned
	to the bankruptcy estate in addition to prejudgment interest and costs. The case is currently stayed. In 2013, Plaintiff sent correspondence to all defendants inviting settlement discussions and has served NMIC and NLIC with a "SPV Derivatives ADR
	Notice," formally starting the Alternative Dispute Resolution process. NMIC and NLIC have responded, and are currently taking part in the ADR process. On January 10, 2014, Lehman filed a final motion to extend the stay, which continues to be in
	effect. On May 14, 2014, the court held a hearing on a scheduling order governing the Distributed Action. The parties are continuing to negotiate the proposed scheduling order prior to submission to the court. On July 17, 2014, the parties reached a
	settlement of this matter. The settlement paperwork is currently being prepared.

	7.






	Effective May 1, 2009 the principal underwriter and general distributor will change from Nationwide Securities, LLC to Nationwide Investment Services Corporation ("NISC").








	 



	Any and all references to Nationwide Securities, LLC (“NSLLC”) are replaced with Nationwide Investment Services Corporation ("NISC").

	 

	NISC is located at One Nationwide Plaza, Columbus, Ohio 43215.




	 



	In addition, the following changes are made effective:




	 



	The Distribution of Policies or the Sale of a Policies provision is replaced as follows:




	 



	The current distributor of the Policies is Nationwide Investment Services Corporation ("NISC") located at One Nationwide Plaza, Columbus, Ohio 43215, an affiliate of NLICA.  Until May 1, 2009, the Policies were distributed by Nationwide Securities, LLC (“NSLLC”) (formerly, 1717 Capital Management Company), located at
	One Nationwide Plaza, Columbus, Ohio 43215, a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of NLICA.



	 



	The Policies were sold on a continuous basis until December 31, 2008 by licensed insurance agents in those states where the Policies could lawfully be sold. Beginning January 1, 2009 no new policies will be sold, but agents may continue to accept additional premium on existing Policies.  Agents are registered representatives of broker
	dealers registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 who are member firms of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ("FINRA").



	 



	Gross first year commissions paid by NLICA on the sale of these Policies provided by NISC are approximately 91% of the target premium plus 2% of any excess premium payments.  We pay gross renewal commissions in years 2 through 10 on the sale of the Policies provided by NISC that will not exceed 2% of actual premium payment, and will
	be 0% in

	policy years 11 and thereafter.  Expense allowances and bonuses may also be paid, and firms may receive annual renewal compensation of up to 0.25% of the unloaned Policy Account Value.



	 



	NISC received no compensation as principal underwriter of variable life insurance policies and variable annuity contracts offered by insurance company subsidiaries of Nationwide Financial Services, Inc. during 2008, 2007, or 2006.  NSLLC received $11,699,242, $16,493,648, and $16,865,494 during 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively,
	as principal underwriter of the Policies and of other variable life insurance policies and variable annuity contracts offered by NLICA and its affiliates.  However, NSLLC did not retain any of the compensation it received as principal underwriter during the past 3 fiscal years.



	 



	8.           The “Legal Proceedings” section of your prospectus is replaced with the following:






	 



	Nationwide Financial Services, Inc. (NFS, or collectively with its subsidiaries, the Company) was formed in November 1996. NFS is the holding company for Nationwide Life Insurance Company (NLIC), Nationwide Life and Annuity Insurance Company (NLAIC) and other companies that comprise the life insurance and retirement savings operations of the
	Nationwide group of companies (Nationwide). This group includes Nationwide Financial Network (NFN), which refers to Nationwide Life Insurance Company of America (NLICA), Nationwide Life and Annuity Company of America (NLACA) and subsidiaries, including the affiliated distribution network. NFS is incorporated in Delaware and maintains its principal executive offices in Columbus, Ohio.



	 



	The Company is a party to litigation and arbitration proceedings in the ordinary course of its business. It is often not possible to determine the ultimate outcome of the pending investigations and legal proceedings or to provide reasonable ranges of potential losses with any degree of certainty. Some matters, including certain of those referred
	to below, are in very preliminary stages, and the Company does not have sufficient information to make an assessment of the plaintiffs’ claims for liability or damages. In some of the cases seeking to be certified as class actions, the court has not yet decided whether a class will be certified or (in the event of certification) the size of the class and class period. In many of the cases, the plaintiffs are seeking undefined amounts of damages or other relief, including punitive damages and equitable remedies,
	which are difficult to quantify and cannot be defined based on the information currently available. The Company does not believe, based on information currently known by management, that the outcomes of such pending investigations and legal proceedings are likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position. However, given the large and/or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these matters and inherent unpredictability of litigation, it is possible that an adverse
	outcome in certain matters could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations in a particular period.



	 



	In recent years, life insurance companies have been named as defendants in lawsuits, including class action lawsuits relating to life insurance and annuity pricing and sales practices. A number of these lawsuits have resulted in substantial jury awards or settlements against life insurers other than the Company.



	 



	The financial services industry, including mutual fund, variable annuity, retirement plan, life insurance and distribution companies, has also been the subject of increasing scrutiny by regulators, legislators and the media over the past few years. Numerous regulatory agencies, including the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority
	and the New York State Attorney General, have commenced industry-wide investigations regarding late trading and market timing in connection with mutual funds and variable insurance contracts, and have commenced enforcement actions against some mutual fund and life insurance companies on those issues. The Company has been contacted by or received subpoenas from the SEC and the New York State Attorney General, who are investigating market timing in certain mutual funds offered in insurance products sponsored by
	the Company. The Company has cooperated with these investigations. Information requests from the New York State Attorney General and the SEC with respect to investigations into late trading and market timing were last responded to by the Company and its affiliates in December 2003 and June 2005, respectively, and no further information requests have been received with respect to these matters.



	 



	In addition, state and federal regulators and other governmental bodies have commenced investigations, proceedings or inquiries relating to compensation and bidding arrangements and possible anti-competitive activities between insurance producers and brokers and issuers of insurance products, and unsuitable sales and replacements by producers
	on behalf of the issuer. Also under investigation are compensation and revenue sharing arrangements between the issuers of variable insurance contracts and mutual funds or their affiliates, fee arrangements in retirement plans, the use of side agreements and finite reinsurance agreements, funding agreements issued to back medium-term note (MTN) programs, recordkeeping and retention compliance by broker/dealers, and supervision of former registered representatives. Related investigations, proceedings or inquiries
	may be commenced in the future. The Company and/or its affiliates have been contacted by or








	 




	NLACA Survivor Options Premier

	received subpoenas from state and federal regulatory agencies and other governmental bodies, state securities law regulators and state attorneys general for information relating to certain of these investigations, including those relating to compensation, revenue sharing and bidding arrangements, anti-competitive activities, unsuitable sales
	or replacement practices, fee arrangements in retirement plans, the use of side agreements and finite reinsurance agreements, and funding agreements backing the NLIC MTN program. The Company is cooperating with regulators in connection with these inquiries and will cooperate with Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company (NMIC) in responding to these inquiries to the extent that any inquiries encompass NMIC’s operations.



	 



	A promotional and marketing arrangement associated with the Company’s offering of a retirement plan product and related services in Alabama is under investigation by the Alabama Securities Commission. The Company currently expects that any damages paid to settle this matter will not have a material adverse impact on its consolidated
	financial position. It is not possible to predict what effect, if any, the outcome of this investigation may have on the Company’s retirement plan operations with respect to promotional and marketing arrangements in general in the future.



	 



	These proceedings are expected to continue in the future and could result in legal precedents and new industry-wide legislation, rules and regulations that could significantly affect the financial services industry, including mutual fund, retirement plan, life insurance and annuity companies. These proceedings also could affect the outcome
	of one or more of the Company’s litigation matters. There can be no assurance that any such litigation or regulatory actions will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations in the future.



	 



	Nationwide Financial Services, Inc. (NFS), NMIC, Nationwide Mutual Fire Insurance Company (NMFIC), Nationwide Corporation and the directors of NFS have been named as defendants in several class actions brought by NFS shareholders. These lawsuits arose following the announcement of the joint offer by NMIC, NMFIC and Nationwide Corporation to
	acquire all of the outstanding shares of NFS’ Class A common stock. The defendants deny any and all allegations of wrongdoing and have defended these lawsuits vigorously. On August 6, 2008, NFS and NMIC, NMFIC and Nationwide Corporation announced that they had entered into a definitive agreement for the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of NFS’ Class A common stock for $52.25 per share by Nationwide Corporation, subject to the satisfaction of specific closing conditions.
	Simultaneously, the plaintiffs and defendants entered into a memorandum of understanding for the settlement of these lawsuits. The memorandum of understanding provides, among other things, for the settlement of the lawsuits and release of the defendants and, in exchange for the release and without admitting any wrongdoing, defendant NMIC shall acknowledge that the pending lawsuits were a factor, among others, that led it to offer an increased share price in the transaction. NMIC shall agree to pay plaintiffs’
	attorneys’ fees and the costs of notifying the class members of the settlement. The memorandum of understanding is conditioned upon court approval of the proposed settlement. The court has scheduled the fairness hearing for approval of the proposed settlement for June 23, 2009. The lawsuits are pending in multiple jurisdictions and allege that the offer price was inadequate, that the process for reviewing the offer was procedurally unfair and that the defendants have breached their fiduciary duties
	to the holders of the NFS Class A common stock. NFS continues to defend these lawsuits vigorously.



	 



	On November 20, 2007, Nationwide Retirement Solutions, Inc. (NRS) and NLIC were named in a lawsuit filed in the Circuit Court of Jefferson County, Alabama entitled

	Ruth A. Gwin and Sandra H. Turner, and a class of similarly situated individuals v Nationwide Life Insurance Company, Nationwide
	Retirement Solutions, Inc., Alabama State Employees Association, PEBCO, Inc. and Fictitious Defendants A to Z

	. On December 2, 2008, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint. The plaintiffs claim to represent a class of all participants in the Alabama State Employees Association (ASEA) Plan, excluding members of the Deferred Compensation Committee, members of the Board of Control, ASEA’s directors, officers and board members, and PEBCO’s directors, officers and board members. The class
	period is from November 20, 2001, to the date of trial. In the amended class action complaint, the plaintiffs allege breach of fiduciary duty, wantonness and breach of contract. The amended class action complaint seeks a declaratory judgment, an injunction, an appointment of an independent fiduciary to protect Plan participants, disgorgement of amounts paid, reformation of Plan documents, compensatory damages and punitive damages, plus interest, attorneys’ fees and costs and such other equitable and
	legal relief to which plaintiffs and class members may be entitled. Also, on December 2, 2008, the plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunction seeking an order requiring periodic payments made by NRS and/or NLIC to ASEA or PEBCO to be held in a trust account for the benefit of Plan participants. On December 4, 2008, the Alabama State Personnel Board and the State of Alabama by, and through the State Personnel Board, filed a motion to intervene and a complaint in intervention. On December 16,
	2008, the Companies filed their Answer. On February 4, 2009, the court provisionally agreed to add the State of Alabama, by and through the State Personnel Board as a party. NRS and NLIC continue to defend this case vigorously.

	On July 11, 2007, NLIC was named in a lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington at Tacoma entitled

	Jerre Daniels-Hall and David Hamblen, Individually and on behalf of All Others Similarly Situated v. National Education Association, NEA Member
	Benefits Corporation, Nationwide Life Insurance Company, Security Benefit Life Insurance Company, Security Benefit Group, Inc., Security Distributors, Inc., et. al

	. The plaintiffs seek to represent a class of all current or former National Education Association (NEA) members who participated in the NEA Valuebuilder 403(b) program at any time between January 1, 1991 and the present (and their heirs and/or beneficiaries). The plaintiffs allege that the defendants violated the Employee Retirement Income
	Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA) by failing to prudently and loyally manage plan assets, by failing to provide complete and accurate information, by engaging in prohibited transactions, and by breaching their fiduciary duties when they failed to prevent other fiduciaries from breaching their fiduciary duties. The complaint seeks to have the defendants restore all losses to the plan, restoration of plan assets and profits to participants, disgorgement of endorsement fees, disgorgement of service fee payments,
	disgorgement of excessive fees charged to plan participants, other unspecified relief for restitution, declaratory and injunctive relief, and attorneys’ fees. On May 23, 2008, the Court granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss. On June 19, 2008, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal. On October 17, 2008, the plaintiffs filed their opening brief. On December 19, 2008 the defendants filed their briefs. On January 26, 2009, the plaintiffs filed Appellants’ Reply Brief.
	NLIC continues to defend this lawsuit vigorously.



	 



	On November 15, 2006, NFS, NLIC and NRS were named in a lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio entitled

	Kevin Beary, Sheriff of Orange County, Florida, In His Official Capacity, Individually and On Behalf of All Others Similarly Situated v.
	Nationwide Life Insurance Co., Nationwide Retirement Solutions, Inc. and Nationwide Financial Services, Inc.

	The plaintiff seeks to represent a class of all sponsors of 457(b) deferred compensation plans in the United States that had variable annuity contracts with the defendants at any time during the class period, or in the alternative, all sponsors of 457(b) deferred compensation plans in Florida that had variable annuity contracts with the defendants during the class period. The class period is from
	January 1, 1996 until the class notice is provided. The plaintiff alleges that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties by arranging for and retaining service payments from certain mutual funds. The complaint seeks an accounting, a declaratory judgment, a permanent injunction and disgorgement or restitution of the service fee payments allegedly received by the defendants, including interest. On January 25, 2007, NFS, NLIC and NRS filed a motion to dismiss. On September 17, 2007, the Court
	granted the motion to dismiss. On October 1, 2007, the plaintiff filed a motion to vacate judgment and for leave to file an amended complaint. On September 15, 2008, the Court denied the plaintiffs’ motion to vacate judgment and for leave to file an amended complaint. On October 15, 2008, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal. NFS, NLIC and NRS continue to defend this lawsuit vigorously.



	 



	On February 11, 2005, NLIC was named in a class action lawsuit filed in Common Pleas Court, Franklin County, Ohio entitled

	Michael Carr v. Nationwide Life Insurance Company

	. The complaint seeks recovery for breach of contract, fraud by omission, violation of the Ohio Deceptive Trade
	Practices Act and unjust enrichment. The complaint also seeks unspecified compensatory damages, disgorgement of all amounts in excess of the guaranteed maximum premium and attorneys’ fees. On February 2, 2006, the court granted the plaintiff’s motion for class certification on the breach of contract and unjust enrichment claims. The court certified a class consisting of all residents of the United States and the Virgin Islands who, during the class period, paid premiums on a modal basis to NLIC
	for term life insurance policies issued by NLIC during the class period that provide for guaranteed maximum premiums, excluding certain specified products. Excluded from the class are NLIC; any parent, subsidiary or affiliate of NLIC; all employees, officers and directors of NLIC; and any justice, judge or magistrate judge of the State of Ohio who may hear the case. The class period is from February 10, 1990 through February 2, 2006, the date the class was certified. On January 26, 2007, the plaintiff
	filed a motion for summary judgment. On April 30, 2007, NLIC filed a motion for summary judgment. On February 4, 2008, the Court granted the class’s motion for summary judgment on the breach of contract claims arising from the term policies in 43 of 51 jurisdictions. The Court granted NLIC’s motion for summary judgment on the breach of contract claims on all decreasing term policies. On November 7, 2008, the case was settled.



	 



	On April 13, 2004, NLIC was named in a class action lawsuit filed in Circuit Court, Third Judicial Circuit, Madison County, Illinois, entitled

	Woodbury v. Nationwide Life Insurance Company

	. NLIC removed this case to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Illinois
	on June 1, 2004. On December 27, 2004, the case was transferred to the United States District Court for the District of Maryland and included in the multi-district proceeding entitled

	In Re Mutual Funds Investment Litigation

	. In response, on May 13, 2005, the plaintiff filed the first amended complaint purporting to represent, with certain exceptions, a class of all persons who held (through their ownership of an NLIC annuity or insurance
	product) units of any NLIC sub-account invested in mutual funds that included foreign securities in

	their portfolios and that experienced market timing or stale price trading activity. The first amended complaint purports to disclaim, with respect to market timing or stale price trading in NLIC’s annuities sub-accounts, any allegation based on NLIC’s untrue statement, failure to disclose any material fact, or usage of any manipulative
	or deceptive device or contrivance in connection with any class member’s purchases or sales of NLIC annuities or units in annuities sub-accounts. The plaintiff claims, in the alternative, that if NLIC is found with respect to market timing or stale price trading in its annuities sub-accounts, to have made any untrue statement, to have failed to disclose any material fact or to have used or employed any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance, then the plaintiff purports to represent a class, with
	certain exceptions, of all persons who, prior to NLIC’s untrue statement, omission of material fact, use or employment of any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance, held (through their ownership of an NLIC annuity or insurance product) units of any NLIC sub-account invested in mutual funds that included foreign securities in their portfolios and that experienced market timing activity. The first amended complaint alleges common law negligence and seeks to recover damages not to exceed $75,000
	per plaintiff or class member, including all compensatory damages and costs. On June 1, 2006, the District Court granted NLIC’s motion to dismiss the plaintiff’s complaint. On January 30, 2009, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed that dismissal. NLIC continues to defend this lawsuit vigorously.



	 



	On August 15, 2001, NFS and NLIC were named in a lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut entitled

	Lou Haddock, as trustee of the Flyte Tool & Die, Incorporated Deferred Compensation Plan, et al v. Nationwide Financial Services, Inc. and
	Nationwide Life Insurance Company.

	Currently, the plaintiffs’ fifth amended complaint, filed March 21, 2006, purports to represent a class of qualified retirement plans under ERISA that purchased variable annuities from NLIC. The plaintiffs allege that they invested ERISA plan assets in their variable annuity contracts and that NLIC and NFS breached ERISA fiduciary duties by allegedly accepting service payments from certain mutual funds. The complaint seeks disgorgement of some or all of the
	payments allegedly received by NFS and NLIC, other unspecified relief for restitution, declaratory and injunctive relief, and attorneys’ fees. To date, the District Court has rejected the plaintiffs’ request for certification of the alleged class. On September 25, 2007, NFS’ and NLIC’s motion to dismiss the plaintiffs’ fifth amended complaint was denied. On October 12, 2007, NFS and NLIC filed their answer to the plaintiffs’ fifth amended complaint and amended counterclaims.
	On November 1, 2007, the plaintiffs filed a motion to dismiss NFS’ and NLIC’s amended counterclaims. On November 15, 2007, the plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification. On February 8, 2008, the Court denied the plaintiffs’ motion to dismiss the amended counterclaim, with the exception that it was tentatively granting the plaintiffs’ motion to dismiss with respect to NFS’ and NLIC’s claim that it could recover any “disgorgement remedy” from
	plan sponsors. On April 25, 2008, NFS and NLIC filed their opposition to the plaintiffs’ motion for class certification. On September 29, 2008, the plaintiffs filed their reply to NFS’ and NLIC’s opposition to class certification. The Court has set a hearing on the class certification motion for February 27, 2009. NFS and NLIC continue to defend this lawsuit vigorously.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Following is a summary of the Application; the complete Application is available for a fee from the Public Reference Branch of the Commission, 450 Fifth Street NW, Washington, DC 20549-0102 (tel. (202) 942-8090).
Applicants' Representations
1. NWL, a stock life insurance company organized under Ohio law, is a wholly owned subsidiary of Nationwide Financial Services, Inc. (“NFS”). NFS is ultimately controlled by Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company (95.24%) and Nationwide Mutual Fire Insurance Company (4.76%). NWL is the depositor and sponsor of the Nationwide Multi-Flex Variable Account, Nationwide Variable Account-5 and Nationwide VLI Separate Account-3.
2. NWLAIC, a stock life insurance company organized under Ohio law, is a wholly owned subsidiary of NWL. NWLAIC is the depositor and sponsor of Nationwide VA Separate Account-A and Nationwide VL Separate Account-A.
3. Each of the Separate Accounts is registered under the 1940 Act as a unit investment trust (File Nos. 811-3338, 811-8692, 811-6140, 811-5606 and 811-6137). Nationwide Multi-Flex Variable Account, Nationwide Variable Account-5 and Nationwide VA Separate Account-A issue flexible premium variable annuity contracts that are registered under the Securities Act of 1933 (the “1933 Act”) on Form N-4 (File Nos. 2-75174, 33-71440 and 33-22940). Nationwide VL Separate Account-3 and Nationwide VL Separate Account-A issue flexible premium and single premium variable life insurance contracts. Nationwide VL Separate Account-A also issues multiple payment variable life insurance contracts. The contracts issued by both separate accounts are registered under the 1933 Act on Form S-6 (File Nos. 33-44296, 33-44790, 33-44300, 33-44792 and 33-35775).
4. Each Separate Account maintains multiple sub-accounts each of which invests exclusively in the shares of a single portfolio that is a series of an open-end management investment company registered on Form N-1A. All Separate Accounts maintain sub-accounts that invest in shares of VP Advantage and VP Balanced. The two sub-accounts are included among the investment options available under all contracts issued by any of the Separate Accounts (the “Contracts”).
5. The Contracts reserve to NWL and NWLAIC, as relevant, the right, subject to Commission approval, to substitute shares of another open-end management investment company for the shares of an open-end management investment company held by any sub-account. The reservation is disclosed in the prospectus for the Contracts.
6. Although the Contracts reserve to Nationwide the right to restrict transfer privileges, Contract Owners currently may make transfers among the sub-accounts once per business day without the imposition of any transfer charge. The substitution will not count as a transfer among the sub-accounts for the purpose of the daily transfer limit.
7. Within 45 days of receiving the Order of Approval requested by the application, Applicants propose to substitute shares of VP Balanced for shares of VP Advantage. On the date that the substitution is effected (the “Exchange Date”), all shares held by the Separate Accounts in VP Advantage will be redeemed and, contemporaneously with the redemption, the Separate Accounts will purchase shares in VP Balanced. All shares will be purchased and redeemed at prices based on the current net asset values per share in a manner consistent with Rule 22c-1 under the 1940 Act.
8. The investment objective of VP Advantage is to seek long-term growth and current income. The fund achieves its objective by investing approximately 40% of its assets in equity securities, 40% in fixed income securities and the remaining 20% in cash and cash equivalents.
9. The investment objective of VP Balanced is to seek long-term growth and current income. The fund achieves its objectives by investing approximately 60% of its assets in equity securities and the remainder in bonds and other fixed income securities.
10. American Century Investment Management, Inc., the adviser VP Advantage and VP Balanced, has informed Applicants that its wishes to halt all management and operations associated with VP Advantage because the fund, since its inception on June 4, 1987, has not attracted sufficient assets to grow to an efficient size. Furthermore, because VP Advantage is not being actively marketed, it is not expected to attain economies of scale. American Century Investment Management, Inc. has informed Applicants that as of January 10, 2000, VP Advantage had assets totaling $21,832,751.26. As of the same date, VP Balanced had assets of $281,394,733.05.
11. The following table shows the average annual total returns for VP Advantage and VP Balanced for periods of one, three and five years and since inception as well as expense ratios for the funds for the year ended December 31, 1999.
 Management feesOther expensesAverage annual total returns (performance) 11 year3 year5 yearSince inceptionVP Advantage (in percent)(inception: 8/1/91)1.000.0014.512.312.09.4VP Balanced 2 (in percent) (inception: 5/1/91)0.990.0011.412.413.310.81 Performance as of September 30, 1999.2 With expense reimbursement, the management fees and other expenses were 0.97% and 0.00% respectively.
Start Printed Page 36180
12. On September 27, 1999, Nationwide supplemented the separate account prospectuses informing all existing and prospective Contract Owners that it is the process of applying for approval from the Commission to effect a substitution of VP Balanced for VP Advantage. In addition, the prospectus supplements state that Nationwide will not exercise any right reserved by it under the Contracts to impose an restriction or fee on transfers until at least 30 days after the proposed substitutions.
13. All Contract Owners have received a copy of the prospectus for VP Balanced because the portfolio is currently offered as an investment option under all contracts issued through the Separate Accounts.
14. Following the establishment of the Exchange Date, Contract Owners with interests remaining VP Advantage will be advised that the fund will be replaced on the Exchanged Date and that they are free to make any allocation change changes among the available investment options in advance of the Exchange Date.
15. Within five days of the Exchange Date, all Contract Owners affected by the substitution will receive a written confirmation of the substitution. The confirmation will state that Contract Owners may transfer all cash value in the affected sub-account to any other available sub-account(s). The confirmation will reiterate that Nationwide will not exercise any right reserved by it under the Contracts to impose any restriction or fee on transfers until at least 30 days after the proposed substitution.
16. The proposed substitution will take place at relative net asset value with no increase or decrease in the amount of any Contract Owner's policy value. The substitution will not result in any additional fees for Contract Owners nor will current charges increased. Contract Owners will not bear any added cost or expense, including any additional brokerage costs or expenses, associated with the proposed substitution. None of the contractual obligations currently assumed by Nationwide will in any way be abridged or modified as a result of the substitution. The proposed substitution will in no way alter a Contract Owner's right to surrender the contract at any time prior to or after the substitution in accordance with the terms of the contract. Finally, the substitution should in no way affect whatever tax benefits Contract Owners currently enjoy and will not engender any adverse tax consequences.
Applicants' Legal Analysis
1. Section 26(b) of the 1940 Act requires the depositor of a registered unit investment trust holding the securities of a single issuer to obtain Commission approval before substitution of the securities held by the trust. The section further provides that the Commission shall issue an order approving such substitution if the evidence establishes that the substitution is consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policies and provisions of the 1940 Act.
2. Applicants assert that the proposed substitution meets the standards that the Commission has applied to past substitutions.
3. Applicants assert that the investment objectives and policies of VP Advantage and VP Balanced are sufficiently comparable that the investment strategies currently employed by Contract Owners may be maintained after the substitution. Both funds seek to provide investors with the benefits of a balanced portfolio of fixed income and equity securities that serves as a more conservative alternative to traditional growth funds and as a more aggressive alternative to traditional bond funds.
4. Applicants further assert that Contract Owners will benefit from the proposed substitution because VP Balanced has greater assets than VP Advantage. Accordingly, VP Balanced should continue to have lower expenses as a percentage of net asset than does VP Advantage, creating the opportunity for better performance.
Conclusion
Applicants assert, for the reasons stated above, that the proposed substitution is consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act and the requested order approving the substitution should be granted.
