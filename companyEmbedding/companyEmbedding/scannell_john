John Jay Scannell (1841 – March 5, 1918) was a Tammany Hall politician who was the leader of the Eleventh Assembly District.[1] He was appointed the first New York City Fire Commissioner of the new consolidated New York City.
Biography[edit]
He was born in 1841 and had two brothers: Florence Scannell who was killed in 1869 in a bar-room fight; and Edward A. Scannell, who on Christmas Eve of 1875 killed a man named Henry Wilson, in what appeared to be a random attack.[1][2] However, John J. Scannell had already shot and killed Thomas Donahue in revenge for the killing of his brother in 1872.[3] He was arrested and was acquitted on the grounds of emotional insanity.[1] While he was imprisoned in The Tombs, he met Richard Croker, the future head of Tammany Hall and they developed a friendship. Croker was at the time also imprisoned and charged with murder, for which he was found innocent.[4]
In 1893 he was appointed a 6-year term as the New York City Fire Commissioner by Mayor Thomas F. Gilroy replacing S. Howland Robbins, the salary was $5,000 per year (approximately $133,000 today in current dollars).[1] He was appointed the 1st Fire Commissioner of the Consolidated City of New York by Tammany Hall Mayor Robert A. Van Wyck on January 1, 1898. He served in that position until the end of the Van Wyck Administration on December 31, 1901. In 1901 he was indicted for being involved in a kickback scheme for the purchasing of supplies by the New York City Fire Department.[5]
By 1902 he bought a farm on Newburgh, New York.[6][7] He later purchased Chateau Ophelia in Saratoga, New York for $53,000.[8]
He died on March 5, 1918 of pneumonia at St. Mary's Hospital in Queens, New York.[4]

Robert Scannell
Robert Scannell is President and Founder of Scannell Properties and its affiliated companies. He founded the company in 1990. Bob oversees all aspects of the company’s client services and build-to-suit developments. Specific responsibilities on new projects include site selection/evaluation, building design, lease negotiation and financing of all projects.
From the inception of Scannell Properties, Bob’s vision for the company was to focus on build to suit leased projects with clients who would have a need for such projects on a repeat basis. These projects could be located anywhere in the US. His goal was to structure the company in such a way that a superior building could be delivered no matter where a particular project was to be located. That vision has resulted in the company doing over one billion in new development in 2016.

John Scannell | 2014 Election






 




General Election: November 4, 2014



An information resource for Washington voters




 




















 

John (Zamboni) Scannell

 



Washington Supreme Court
Position 7
 


Legal/Judicial Experience: John Scannell organized and filed a 
		class action lawsuit which won millions of dollars for City of Seattle 
		employees. He blocked/delayed the building of sports stadiums by 
		challenging their public financing. He was elected employee 
		representative by the City of Seattle employees on the Civil Service 
		Commission.

Other Professional Experience: No information submitted

Education: Graduated with honors at Renton High School. Graduated 
		with honors University of Washington with major in Physics, minor in 
		mathematics Became the second person to complete the State of Washington 
		Law Clerk program in the minimum of four years

Community Service: Performed pro bono legal work for low income 
		clients and prisoners.

Statement: Zamboni John Scannell has been one of the few 
		attorneys in the State that has actively been supporting the American 
		Bar Associations long standing criticism of the Washington attorney 
		disciplinary system. He has filed a federal RICO lawsuit citing the 
		problems the Washington State Bar Association has created by 
		administering the system. The Washington State Supreme Court is in 
		charge of the system, but the court has come under sharp criticism for 
		40 years for its practice of delegating its responsibility to the 
		Washington State Bar Association. The ABA rightly likens this to the 
		practice of putting the fox in charge of the henhouse, with Washington 
		being one of the few state that still continue this practice. The 
		practice of putting a politically elected bar leadership in charge of 
		attorney discipline has resulted in low charging rates, discipline 
		directed at attorney who represent unpopular clients, as well as 
		discipline directed at minority attorneys in disproportionate numbers. 
		John Scannell appears to be the only candidate that advocates taking the 
		bar association out of the disciplinary process. Scannell will protect 
		the rights of Washington citizens with decisions that are intelligent, 
		just and ethical.

Education

Elections
2016
Scannell filed to challenge Chief Justice Barbara Madsen in the 2016 state supreme court election.[1] Because he has been disbarred, he cannot serve on the state supreme court under the state constitution, which requires that justices be admitted to practice law in the state.[5] However, he was able to remain on the ballot because no legal challenge was brought against his candidacy.[5] Scannell, Greg Zempel, and Justice Madsen faced each other in a primary on August 2. Madsen and Zempel defeated Scannell and advanced to the November 8 general election.

Race background
The 2016 election was the first since the 1990s in which all three state supreme court justices up for re-election faced opponents.[6] At least one justice in every election typically runs unopposed, but this year all three incumbents drew challengers. Republican state Representative Matt Manweller said he and other lawmakers actively recruited candidates to run against the justices.[6] This was partly because of the court's decisions in the long-running school funding case McCleary v. Washington, over which the court drew criticism from both Republicans and Democrats for holding the state in contempt of court, and in a separate case about the state funding of charter schools.
Those in favor of replacing the justices said the court has overstepped its boundaries into legislation and policymaking and failed to respect the autonomy of the state legislature.[6] In the McCleary school funding case, the court both found the state government in contempt and fined the state $100,000 per day until the state complied with the court's orders.[7][8]
In a separate case, the court ruled unconstitutional the state funding of charter schools right before those schools were set to open in 2015. 

Outside spending
The political action committee arm of the group Stand for Children spent $116,000 promoting the campaign of Greg Zempel, who challenged Chief Justice Barbara Madsen for her seat on the court.[9] Madsen authored the court's 2015 decision declaring Washington's charter schools, in their form at that time, unconstitutional. The legislature passed a new bill in 2016 that allowed charter schools to continue; opponents threatened to sue over this law as well.[9] Stand for Children's spending on Zempel's campaign was funded by several of the backers of charter schools who were opposed to the court's 2015 decision. The primary donors include Connie Ballmer, wife of former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer; Reed Hastings, founder and CEO of Netflix; and Vulcan Inc., owned by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen. Vulcan and Ballmer were also among the primary backers of the ballot initiative that paved the way for the charter schools.[9]

 Scannell ran for election to the Washington Supreme Court.General: He was defeated in the general election on November 4, 2014, after receiving 21.9 percent of the vote. He competed against Debra L. Stephens.[2][10]



Noteworthy events
Disbarred Scannell fights to practice law by running for election
In 2005, Scannell was investigated by the Washington State Bar Association regarding a case he had in Virginia. Scannell argued that this was outside the bar's jurisdiction. Scannell, however, was subsequently disbarred in the State of Washington, not for any misconduct involving the Virginia case (which was dismissed), but because he had obstructed the bar association's investigation of that case.[11] He continued fighting his disbarment in other ways.[5]
One attempt involved running for the office of justice of the Washington Supreme Court. Scannell was on the ballot, but only symbolically since the Washington State Constitution required a candidate for judicial office to be an attorney and admitted to practice in the state's courts.[12] To remove Scannell from the ballot, someone would have had to bring a legal challenge. However, Debra L. Stephens, his challenger for the seat, said she had no plans to do so.[5]
Scannell had filed suit against the bar association in federal court, reportedly in hopes of being able to at least practice in federal courts. He was successful with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which only gave him a two-year suspension, and Scannell was back to practicing before the court in 2012.[5]
Scannell received the nickname "Zamboni" for the many years he drove the Zamboni at Seattle hockey games. He was also known as the man who bit the head off the fish that was thrown onto the ice by a fan.[5]
