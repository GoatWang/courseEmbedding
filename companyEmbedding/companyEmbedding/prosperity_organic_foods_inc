Meg Carlson and Prosperity Organic Foods wins 2012 consumer products company award | My Story staff '12
Categories: 1980s | Award or honor | Featured

Prosperity Organic Foods, Inc. of Boise, Idaho, is pleased to announce it was recently named a silver award winner in the Consumer Products Company of the Year category at the 2012 Stevie® Awards for Women in Business. Meg Carlson (’82 MBA), Prosperity Organic’s President and Washington State University graduate, was on hand to receive the award at the Marriott Marquis Hotel in New York on Friday, November 9.
The Stevie Awards for Women in Business honor executives, entrepreneurs, and the companies they run – worldwide. The Stevie Awards have been hailed as the world’s premier business awards.
In 2011, Ms. Carlson and her Boise-based team launched a breakthrough new brand of Melt Organic buttery spreads—a line of luscious, all-natural, health-conscious spreads made from healthier fruit- and plant-based organic oils. The line was developed by a Sun Valley, Idaho resident when a digestive disorder forced her to give up butter. After discovering Melt, Ms. Carlson and company optimized the product and packaging, located a production facility, raised funding, garnered national distribution, and launched a marketing campaign.
Rapidly, the company’s two flagship products, Melt and Honey Melt, have gained wide distribution across the country at grocers such as Whole Foods, Albertsons, H-E-B, The Fresh Market, Jewel-Osco, Wegmans, and Winn-Dixie. Both varieties won Progressive Grocer’s Editor’s Picks for best new consumer products of 2012, and Melt Organic was featured on the Dr. Oz Show last April.
“I am honored that Prosperity Organic Foods was chosen as Consumer Product Company of the Year,” said Prosperity Organic Foods President and CEO Meg Carlson. “Melt is an incredible line of products and we have an amazingly dedicated team moving it forward. We continue our mission to reach each and every butter lover seeking a luscious buttery spread that is truly good for you.”
Ms. Carlson graduated from the University of Idaho in 1976 with a degree in psychology before receiving her MBA from Washington State University in 1982. She launched her business career at Ore-Ida Foods in Boise, progressing from marketing assistant to vice-president during her 16-year tenure. In 2002, Meg co-founded The C & H Group, LLC, which facilitates mergers and acquisitions for private companies in the Intermountain West. Continuing her entrepreneurial bent, Meg agreed to lead the start-up Prosperity Organic Foods in 2010.

Our Products
MELT Organic spreads are North America’s first line of luscious butter improvements that are truly good for you. Each variety of MELT Organic features the Perfect Blendtm of the healthiest oils that we’ve carefully chosen for you. Our Perfect Blend is made from natural, fruit- and plant-based organic oils: virgin coconut, palm fruit, flaxseed, sunflower and canola. Each serving of MELT Organic is a rich source of Medium Chain Fatty Acids (the “good fats“) that your body burns as energy instead of storing as fat, thereby boosting metabolism.
Each square of MELT Organic spreads are truly good for you: certified organic, non-GMO (Non-GMO Project Verified), kosher pareve, halal, and made with Fair Trade Fair for Life certified organic virgin coconut oil and Rainforest Alliance certified palm fruit oil. And MELT Organic spreads are also soy free, gluten free, and dairy-free.
MELT Organic spreads are sold in bright red square 13 oz. packages in the butter section of grocery stores throughout the country. Rich & Creamy MELT Organic, Honey MELT Organic and Chocolate MELT Organic are all on their way to more stores now. Locate your nearest MELT retailer here

Rich & Creamy MELT® Organic
 

 
MELT Organic spreads are North America’s first line of luscious butter improvements that are truly good for you. MELT Organic is made with the Perfect Blendtm of fruit- and plant-based oils in a luscious dairy-free and vegan spread.
MELT’s Perfect Blend features virgin coconut oil – a stable, saturated fat, and a rich fruit-based source of medium chain fatty acids (MCFAs) – smoothly blended with flaxseed, hi-oleic sunflower, palm fruit and canola oils.
Our flagship product, Rich & Creamy MELT is a luscious butter improvement – an Organic ‘Butter 2.0®‘ – that is a delicious alternative to butter. Rich & Creamy MELT Organic cooks, bakes and melts just like butter, but with half the saturated fat and fewer calories.
Each square of Rich & Creamy MELT Organic is truly good for you: certified organic, non-GMO (Non-GMO Project Verified), kosher pareve, halal, vegan, and made with Fair for Life Fair Trade certified organic virgin coconut oil and Rainforest Alliance certified palm fruit oil. Rich & Creamy MELT Organic is also soy free, gluten free, and dairy-free. Each serving of MELT is a rich source of the ‘good fats’ with an ideal balance of Omega-6 to Omega-3 ALAs (that are optimally metabolized with virgin coconut oil), and has 425 mg of Omega-3 ALA (or 26% RDA).
Visit our Featured Recipes and Tips for easy ways to replace butter or other oils with MELT every day.
So go ahead and drizzle, spread, top, sauté – you get the idea – it’s all good!
