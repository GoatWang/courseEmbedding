Master John Douglas




Master John Douglas, a world renowned theologian, prophetic minister, spiritual healer and extraordinary teacher is a frequent lecturer in The Church of the Master Angels.
Trauma, emotional and mental stress, false belief systems and blocks to our personal growth can be stored in the energy fields of our bodies, impacting our ability to function at our full potential. These blocks obstruct the vital flow of energy through our body and systems that is necessary for our health and well being. Over time this leads to illness and depleted mental and emotional reserves. Energetic healing can restore these vital flows.

 Educational Background



B.A. 


Middlebury College

                  Middlebury College is a private liberal arts college located in Middlebury, Vermont, in the United States. Founded in 1800, it is one of the oldest liberal arts colleges in the United States. Drawing 2,500 undergraduates from all 50 states and over 70 countries, Middlebury offers 44 majors in the arts, humanities, literature, foreign languages, social sciences, and natural sciences. Middlebury follows a 4–1–4 academic calendar, with two four-course semesters and a one-course January term. Middlebury is the first American institution of higher education to have granted a bachelor's degree to an African-American, graduating Alexander Twilight in the class of 1823. Middlebury was also one of the first formerly all-male liberal arts colleges in New England to become a coeducational institution, following the trustees' decision in 1883 to accept women.

                  RPX helps corporations manage their exposure to patent risk by providing a rational alternative to traditional litigation strategy.

Today, RPX has become the industry leader in comprehensive patent risk management through our defensive acquisition, litigation insurance, patent intelligence and strategic advisory services.  For our clients, the result is strong, broad-based defense against NPE litigation and dramatically lower operating costs and financial risk

John Masters Organics have a deep rooted history in the creation of all organic skin care products. The creator, John Masters, has been held in high regards for his talent in the beauty industry since the 1970's. However, his understanding and knowledge of the types of beauty products being produced during the 70's and 80's triggered his interest in alternative methods. These alternative methods would include the use of all organic ingredients because of the health risks that are often associated with the inhalation and handling of chemically rich beauty products. Someone like John Masters would truly understand this danger and that is what really propelled him to developing organic skin care products.
The line, John Masters Organics, essentially hit the scene in 1991 when the lines first product Dry Hair Nourishment and Defrizzer was developed. Since then John Masters Organics has gone on to include over 30 products that fall into a variety of categories.
The first category, hair care, includes cleansing shampoos which utilize various plant based ingredients. There are five different shampoos to choose from that have been developed for different hair types. Each shampoo contains carefully selected ingredients that will work specifically with different hair types. Ingredients used include lavender, rosemary, zinc, sage, evening primrose, and herbal cider. From there, John Masters Organics also includes five different nourishing conditioners that compliment each shampoo. Lastly, there are John Masters styling agents which will treat, nourish and style your hair using all organic ingredients.
John Masters Organics also includes organic skin care products for your face. Within it you will find refreshing cleansers which include ingredients like rose, ginseng, and jojoba. You will also find hydrating moisturizers and mists which will help keep your skin well hydrated and healthy. For more targeted treatments, John Masters Organics also offers serums and masks filled with rich antioxidants and skin reviving agents.
Like the skin on your face, you should also care for your body's skin. John Masters Organics offers simple hydrating washes that will infuse your skin with softening and moisturizing ingredients. Your skin will look and feel softer and smoother.
Lastly, not too many skin care lines offer these products, but they should! John Masters Organics has exclusively developed products for your dog! Yes, your dog needs the same type of care and cleansing you do and with John Masters, you can give your pet a refreshing thorough wash using all organic ingredients. These natural products are safe for your dog, for you, and the environment.
John Masters's use of organic ingredients, as we said earlier, stemmed from his worry about the harmful side effects of working with chemically rich salon products. However, the use of organic ingredients is also rooted in the firm belief in what is good for us should be good for the earth as well. In addition, the John Masters has recently become part of the Global Green USA's New York Committee. Global Green is a world renowned environmental organization that works to solve the globe's greatest environmental challenges.
This deep philosophy in organic products has fueled John Masters Organics to not only become one of the most respected organic skin care lines, but one of the most effective lines available. With John Masters Organics, you can treat both yourselves well as well as the earth.Shop All Brands

























































  



  








	Anarchism Today by Randall AmsterForeword by John Clark - Praeger - ABC-CLIO













































ABC-CLIO












Anarchism Today

 
From World Trade Organization protests to the thwarted 2010 letter-bomb campaign in Europe, actions taken in the name of anarchy continue to make headlines. But these sensational, sometimes off-putting events obscure the fact that anarchism itself is a sophisticated, centuries-old school of political thought that has the potential for positive contributions to our future.

With all of the provocative, sometimes highly destructive acts committed in the name of anarchy, this enlightening volume invites readers to discover the true meaning of anarchism, exploring its vivid history and its resurgent relevance for addressing today's most vexing social problems.
In Anarchism Today, an acclaimed scholar and one of the world's foremost advocates for the anarchistic tradition cuts through common misconceptions and caricatures to explore what is perhaps the most poorly understood of all political theories.As author Randall Amster explains, rather than being an anti-everything rationale for defiance and destruction, anarchism is in fact a coherent set of values and practices with a rich history and contemporary relevance. Passionate and provocative, Amster's book offers readers an expert's perspective on what anarchism really means, including its relationship to other political approaches, its careful balancing of individual liberty and a functioning society, and its controversial image as a wellspring of violence. Along the way, Amster addresses a number of current issues from the perspective of anarchism, including corporate globalization, environmentalism, warfare, nationalism, education, technology, alternative economics, criminal justice, and even spirituality. He concludes with a frank assessment of anarchism's impact and the role it can play in building a more just, peaceful, and sustainable world.
Highlights
Explains the fundamentals of anarchism to a general audience, including those repelled by its inaccurate portrayalsMakes sense of a theory often viewed as violent, incoherent, and even irreconcilably contradictoryExamines the role of anarchism in addressing critical issues that define our era, from environmentalism to economicsShows how applying the tenets of anarchism can potentially lead to a better, safer, and more just worldExplores anarchism's relationship to local actions and global visions, linking its theories and practices to a wide range of contemporary movements, including anti-globalization, economic justice, criminal justice reform, homelessness & housing, and alternative education

Reviews/Endorsements
Reviews"A professor and respected philosopher in his own right, Amster's approach to anarchism is a refreshing break from scholars who've historically dismissed the movement as a kind of “anti-everything” ideology. Anarchism Today is a much-needed contemporary read. . . . From self-described anarchists and amateur sociologists to political scholars and concerned citizens, Amster's book is sure to broaden the conversation about an important theory that continues to shape the current social and political landscape."—Philadelphia City PaperEndorsements“In clear, concise language, Anarchism Today explains historical anarchist theories and explores how they manifest in many of today's movements for justice. A must-read for those both new to and already familiar with anarchism.”—Victoria Law, Author of Resistance Behind Bars: The Struggles of Incarcerated Women and coeditor of Don't Leave Your Friends Behind“Anarchism Today presents a new and fresh look at anarchism, both as a philosophy and a practice. It contains bold and courageous ideas that will engage the novice and challenge those well-versed in the tradition. In these difficult times, this book leaves you with a sense of hope for the future.”—Luis A. Fernandez, Director of the Program on Sustainable Communities, Northern Arizona University, and Author of Policing Dissent and Shutting Down the Streets“Clearly written and calmly argued, equal parts a compendium of contemporary anarchism and a quiet manifesto for what’s to come, Randall Amster’s Anarchism Today is just the right book at the right time. Ably guiding the reader through the many currents of history, theory, and activism that make anarchism the force it is today, Amster persuasively suggests the shape of an anarchist tomorrow as well.”—Jeff Ferrell, Author of Tearing Down the Streets: Adventures in Urban Anarchy“Deeply insightful, up-to-the-minute, and a pleasure to read. Amster's outstanding introduction will be admired by veterans and newcomers alike.”—Uri Gordon, Author of Anarchy Alive!“If you're looking for intelligent and well-informed writing on anarchism, read this book.”—Gabriel Kuhn, Editor/translator of Gustav Landauer: Revolution and Other Writings

RPX Corporation (Rational Patent EXchange)(NASDAQ: RPXC) is an American worldwide provider of patent risk management services, offering defensive buying, acquisition syndication, patent intelligence and advisory services. Since the company was founded in March, 2008,[1] RPX claims to have introduced efficiency to the patent market by providing a rational alternative to litigation. RPX is based in San Francisco. By acquiring patents that pose potential problems and providing information on litigation, RPX seeks to reduce patent assertions directed at its clients.[2]
RPX provides a Defensive Patent Aggregation service to mitigate clients’ risk of litigation from non-practicing entities (NPEs) – also called patent trolls – which acquire patents for the sole purpose of licensing and asserting their patent rights.[3][4]
RPX identifies and purchases patent assets they identify as of high value, relevance and risk that could be used offensively against members of the company's client network. Depending on the situation, RPX may acquire assets from a third party or directly from an NPE. [5] When necessary and possible, RPX will buy patent rights out of an active litigation.
RPX promises to never assert or litigate the patents in its portfolio.[6][7]

Business[edit]
RPX's service is designed to mitigate members’ litigation risk and costs from NPEs by purchasing patents and patent rights before patents are asserted, or to resolve an ongoing litigation.
RPX clients receive a license to all of the patents and associated rights aggregated in the RPX portfolio. Over time, RPX clients receive perpetual license to the patents held when they became members or purchased after they joined, as well as any patents sold during their membership.
The service is structured on an annual membership. Annual membership fees may increase each year to account for the growing value of the RPX portfolio, but early-joining members lock in a lower rate. Companies that join the RPX client network later receive the same benefits, but must pay the then-current rates.
RPX provides data services as part of its membership.[8] The RPX client portal provides data related to patents and patents available for sale, historical and current patent litigation and NPEs.[9] however the product is not publicly available (exclusive to RPX members)[10] and it has yet to be seen how the RPX portal compares to other services. In May 2014, to increase transparency, the company released RPX Search - a search engine that provides free public access to most of its data - independent of RPX membership.[11]
History[edit]
RPX was founded in 2008 by John Amster, Geoffrey Barker and Eran Zur. The company was initially financed by Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Charles River Ventures,[12] and Index Ventures.
In its first year, RPX generated $0.8 million revenue in that year. Revenue grew to $32.8 million in 2009, reaching profitability. In the first nine months of 2010 RPX earned $10 million in profit on $65.2 million in revenue.[13]. RPX's revenue for the year 2016 was $333.1 million[14].
RPX filed an S1[15] on January 21, 2011 and RPX began publicly trading on the NASDAQ exchange as "RPXC" in May 2011.
RPX arranged a consortium to purchase 4000 Nortel patents from the Rockstar Consortium in December 2014.[16][17]

RPX Corporation (Rational Patent EXchange)(NASDAQ: RPXC) is an American worldwide provider of patent risk management services, offering defensive buying, acquisition syndication, patent intelligence and advisory services. Since the company was founded in March, 2008,[1] RPX claims to have introduced efficiency to the patent market by providing a rational alternative to litigation. RPX is based in San Francisco. By acquiring patents that pose potential problems and providing information on litigation, RPX seeks to reduce patent assertions directed at its clients.[2]
RPX provides a Defensive Patent Aggregation service to mitigate clients’ risk of litigation from non-practicing entities (NPEs) – also called patent trolls – which acquire patents for the sole purpose of licensing and asserting their patent rights.[3][4]
RPX identifies and purchases patent assets they identify as of high value, relevance and risk that could be used offensively against members of the company's client network. Depending on the situation, RPX may acquire assets from a third party or directly from an NPE. [5] When necessary and possible, RPX will buy patent rights out of an active litigation.
RPX promises to never assert or litigate the patents in its portfolio.[6][7]

Business[edit]
RPX's service is designed to mitigate members’ litigation risk and costs from NPEs by purchasing patents and patent rights before patents are asserted, or to resolve an ongoing litigation.
RPX clients receive a license to all of the patents and associated rights aggregated in the RPX portfolio. Over time, RPX clients receive perpetual license to the patents held when they became members or purchased after they joined, as well as any patents sold during their membership.
The service is structured on an annual membership. Annual membership fees may increase each year to account for the growing value of the RPX portfolio, but early-joining members lock in a lower rate. Companies that join the RPX client network later receive the same benefits, but must pay the then-current rates.
RPX provides data services as part of its membership.[8] The RPX client portal provides data related to patents and patents available for sale, historical and current patent litigation and NPEs.[9] however the product is not publicly available (exclusive to RPX members)[10] and it has yet to be seen how the RPX portal compares to other services. In May 2014, to increase transparency, the company released RPX Search - a search engine that provides free public access to most of its data - independent of RPX membership.[11]
History[edit]
RPX was founded in 2008 by John Amster, Geoffrey Barker and Eran Zur. The company was initially financed by Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Charles River Ventures,[12] and Index Ventures.
In its first year, RPX generated $0.8 million revenue in that year. Revenue grew to $32.8 million in 2009, reaching profitability. In the first nine months of 2010 RPX earned $10 million in profit on $65.2 million in revenue.[13]. RPX's revenue for the year 2016 was $333.1 million[14].
RPX filed an S1[15] on January 21, 2011 and RPX began publicly trading on the NASDAQ exchange as "RPXC" in May 2011.
RPX arranged a consortium to purchase 4000 Nortel patents from the Rockstar Consortium in December 2014.[16][17]
