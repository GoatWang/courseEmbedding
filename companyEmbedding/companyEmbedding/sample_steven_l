About
Rychetnik is the sole Alaska-based Director of Photography member of IATSE Local 600, the International Cinematographers Guild, and the only local cinematographer who is selected to shoot the major feature films shot in the state. Represented by:Matt BirchSenior Vice PresidentCo-Head, Physical Production | APA405 S. Beverly Drive, Beverly Hills, CA 90212mbirch@apa-agency.com | O: (310) 888-4206  With more than 30 years of experience, Rychetnik is known for his ability to capture heroic scenics, intimate scenes and vividly cast characters. Rychetnik’s work spans commercial shoots on primeval glaciers to tight, run-and-gun shoots embedded with the U.S. Army Special Forces training operations. He moves easily between UHD and film formats, achieving superior results for feature films, network programming and news, documentary films, high-end commercials, corporate marketing films and social media. His broad range of experience—including being a lifelong recording and performing musician—creativity, easy-going manner and get-the- shot work ethic has made him a highly sought-after cinematographer. Although Alaska is Rychetnik’s backyard, he travels to the “Lower 48”, Hawaii and internationally for productions.
