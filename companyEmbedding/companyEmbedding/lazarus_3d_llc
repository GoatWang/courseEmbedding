Here's What Our Clients Are Saying:
"I believe your 3D Model of my kidney played a critical role in the success of my surgery. It enabled the very skilled Dr. Link to do a complex partial nephrectomy, which preserved the vast majority of my kidney function. Since I already had multiple myeloma, my renal function was (and is) essential to my continued well being."~Mr. Charles Lewis, a patient whose kidney and tumor we modeled"This Is the Best Model for Partial nephrectomy I have ever seen" ~Dr. Richard Link, director of the the BCM Division of Endourology and Minimally Invasive Surgery BCM

Partial Nephrectomy Models






Lazarus 3D produces on demand, patient specific kidney/tumor models for robotic partial nephrectomy training. We are currently testing these models in collaboration with Dr. Link's Lab at Baylor College of Medicine to determine their suitability for medical training and pre-clinical rehearsal of difficult cases. The results from this collaboration were presented in the American Urological Association meeting in May 2016 and published in the British Journal of Urology (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bju.13712/full)

ERCP and Digestive Track Models











 






 



Our 3D printed digestive tract models allow for realistic surgical simulation. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (or ERCP), for example, is an extremely difficult procedure that takes years to master.  Our models may help improve resident performance and confidence by enabling realistic, hands on training whenever it is convenient, and allowing for practice prior to actual patient operations. Above, one of our models is viewed through a side facing endoscope. The major papilla is cannulated, allowing access to the biliary system.  Next, iodine is injected into the biliary system, enhancing contrast in the model ductal system when viewed by X-ray (below). The model imaged here has no pathology, but pathologies can be included and our models can be modified as desired. Our manufacturing approach allows for the rapid production of realistic medical training models.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
