	First Trust Portfolios Launches Dividend Yield UIT based on Sabrient System’s Proprietary Research
A unique product designed to capitalize on current state of the bond market 
Santa Barbara, Calif. – April 15, 2013 – – Sabrient Systems, LLC, an independent equity research firm that specializes in alpha extraction through quantitative and qualitative analysis, announced today its collaboration with First Trust Portfolios L.P. (First Trust) to launch a dividend yield unit investment trust (UIT), the Sabrient Dividend Portfolio, to focus on dividends in light of the current state of the bond market. The UIT leverages Sabrient’s proprietary Earnings Quality Rank (EQR) and marks the strategy’s debut in an income-oriented product.
	“Investors have pulled more than $50 billion out of bonds and bond funds throughout January and February of this year and moved the investments into equity mutual funds, ETFs, and UITs,” according to research by David Brown, Chief Market Strategist for Sabrient Systems.
	Through its research, Sabrient Systems has identified high-yield stocks with growing dividends that have the potential for increased price which will be included in the UIT’s portfolio.
	“Given a combination of low interest rates and high risk in the bond market, it is an opportune time to allocate assets to a dividend portfolio, and there is evidence of such a shift taking place,” said Brown. “By leveraging our expertise in forensic accounting, we are able to identify a portfolio that will give investors an improved chance of increased dividends.”
	In collaboration with Gradient Analytics, a global equities research firm and wholly owned subsidiary of Sabrient Systems, this offering focuses on portfolio gains through both income and stock price growth. The algorithm used to rank the stocks is evenly weighted between four factors including high current dividend, growing dividends, and safety of dividends (based on the stock’s EQR), as well as strong earnings growth. .

How Venezuela chaos could spark oil rally OPEC has failed to achieve 
              
              Political and economic turmoil in Venezuela could fuel a rise in oil prices—something the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, despite it’s efforts to cut back production, hasn’t been able to do.

What a constant stream of oil company spending cuts means for crude prices

Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks 
              
              Still, a chart of the S&P 500 reveals an undercurrent of bullishness, says Lawrence G. McMillan.

Who trades options the most? Millennial investors
              
              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

Dollar turns lower for the week following GDP report

How Venezuela chaos could spark oil rally OPEC has failed to achieve 
              
              Political and economic turmoil in Venezuela could fuel a rise in oil prices—something the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, despite it’s efforts to cut back production, hasn’t been able to do.

What a constant stream of oil company spending cuts means for crude prices
              
              Oil companies are sounding a recurring theme: lower exploration and production spending estimates. Will that lead to a rally in oil prices?

Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks 
              
              Still, a chart of the S&P 500 reveals an undercurrent of bullishness, says Lawrence G. McMillan.

Who trades options the most? Millennial investors
              
              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.
