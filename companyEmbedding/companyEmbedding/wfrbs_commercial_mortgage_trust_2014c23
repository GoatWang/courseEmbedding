      The expected ratings are based on information provided by the issuer as 
      of September 10, 2014. Fitch does not expect to rate the $156,416,000 
      interest-only class X-B, $39,986,629 interest-only class X-E, 
      $39,033,711 interest-only class X-Y, or the $39,986,629 class G.
    

      The certificates represent the beneficial ownership in the trust, 
      primary assets of which are 92 loans secured by 111 commercial 
      properties having an aggregate principal balance of approximately $940.8 
      million as of the cutoff date. The loans were contributed to the trust 
      by Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, The Royal Bank of Scotland, 
      Liberty Island Group I LLC, NCB, FSB, C-III Commercial Mortgage LLC and 
      Basis Real Estate Capital II, LLC.
    

      Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, 
      including site inspections on 73.8% of the properties by balance, cash 
      flow analysis of 78.3%, and asset summary reviews on 78.3% of the pool.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Fitch Leverage: The pool's Fitch DSCR and LTV are 1.31x and 109.2%, 
      respectively, compared with the first half 2014 averages of 1.19x and 
      105.6%, respectively. However, excluding the 20 co-op properties (4.8% 
      of the pool), the pool's Fitch DSCR and LTV are 1.10x and 113.3%, 
      respectively. This represents higher leverage than other recent 
      Fitch-rated fixed-rate deals, excluding the 19 loans collateralized by 
      cooperative housing (co-op) properties.
    

      Pool Concentration: The 10 largest loans represent 53.2% of the total 
      pool balance and the top 3 loans represent 28.3% of the total pool 
      balance. The LCI for the pool is 431 and the SCI is 444 - both are 
      higher than recent comparable transactions.
    

      Limited Amortization: Approximately 16.1% of the pool is full-term 
      interest-only and 57.8% is partial term interest-only. The remainder of 
      the pool (43 loans, 26.1%) consists of amortizing balloon loans with 
      loan terms of five to 10 years. Based on the scheduled balance at 
      maturity, the pool will pay down 12.8%.
    

      California Concentration: 37.7% of the pool is located in California, 
      including five of the top ten loans. Further, 13.7% of the pool is 
      secured by retail properties in California, including three of the top 
      ten loans. The California properties are located in distinct markets 
      throughout ten counties situated in both northern and southern 
      California, including: Los Angeles, Riverside, Contra Costa, Ventura, 
      Kern, Merced, Marin, Sonoma, Imperial, and Santa Cruz.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 3.0% below the 
      most recent NOI (for properties that a recent NOI was provided, 
      excluding properties that were stabilizing during this period). 
      Unanticipated further declines in property-level NCF could result in 
      higher defaults and loss severities on defaulted loans, and could result 
      in potential rating actions on the certificates. Fitch evaluated the 
      sensitivity of the ratings assigned to WFRBS 2014-C23 certificates and 
      found that the transaction displays average sensitivity to further 
      declines in NCF. In a scenario in which NCF declined a further 20% from 
      Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'A-sf' 
      could result. In a more severe scenario, in which NCF declined a further 
      30% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 'AAAsf' certificates to 
      'BBBsf' could result. The presale report includes a detailed explanation 
      of additional stresses and sensitivities on pages 88 - 89.
    

      The master servicers will be Wells Fargo Bank, National Association and 
      NCB, FSB, rated 'CMS1-' and 'CMS2-', respectively, by Fitch. The special 
      servicers will be CWCapital Asset Management, LLC and NCB, FSB rated 
      'CSS1-' and 'CSS3+', respectively, by Fitch.

For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
