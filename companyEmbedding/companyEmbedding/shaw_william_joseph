MANSFIELD: William Joseph “Bill” Shaw, 85, of South Trimble Road, and formerly of Dirlam Lane, Mansfield, died Friday morning May 26, 2006 in Lexington Court Care Center following a short illness.
He was born January 25, 1921 in Brooklyn, New York, to Archie C. and Helen (O’Neill) Shaw, was graduated from Jamestown (New York) High School and attended Jamestown Business College.
Bill was a WWII Navy veteran, serving as Yeoman First Class in the Asiatic-Pacific Theater.
His career in the accounting department of the telecommunications industry included positions as purchasing agent and inventory control. He served firms in New York and Florida before moving to Hudson in the early 1960s.
While serving the Western Reserve Telephone Co. (now Alltel), Bill became active in a church plant: Hudson Covenant Church. His home in Hudson was literally moved down the street, so the church could build on the same property.
After moving to Mansfield 30 years ago, Bill accepted a position with Sprint, a firm he served 17 years, and retired in 1983, and was a member of Telephone Pioneers.
He was a member of First Alliance Church, and formerly served the congregation as church treasurer, and board member.
An antique car aficionado, Bill enjoyed spending winters in Fort Myers. He will be remembered for his great attention to and love for his family, and his sense of humor.
He is survived by his wife Vera (Swanson) Shaw, whom he married November 17, 1945; their sons and daughters-in-law Carl and Jeannie Shaw of Fort Myers, Florida, and Peter and Elizabeth Shaw of Houston, Texas; grandchildren Krystal Bruce and her husband William Bruce, III, Russell Shaw, Kevin Shaw, Jason Shaw, Erika Shaw, David Shaw, and Andrew Shaw; brothers and sisters-in-law John and Eleanor Shaw of Saugus, California, and Irwin and Lois Shaw of Richmond, Virginia; cousins including Virginia Darling of Frewsburg, New York; and nieces and their husbands Sandra and Donald Stewart of Jamestown, New York and Patricia and Douglas Hunter of Dunkirk, New York.
The family will receive friends Monday, May 29, 2006 from 5 – 8 pm in the Lexington Avenue Snyder Funeral Home, where the funeral service will be held Tuesday at 10:30 am. Pastor Steve Burgraff will officiate. Burial will follow in Mansfield Memorial Park, where the Richland County Joint Veterans Burial Detail will hold graveside military honors.
Memorial contributions to the Great Commission Fund of First Alliance Church may be made at the funeral home.
Online condolences may be made to the family by visiting: www.snyderfuneralhomes.com

mugshots.com definitions:
Arrest or booked: An arrest is the act of depriving a person of his or her liberty usually in relation to the purported investigation or prevention of crime and presenting (the arrestee) to a procedure as part of the criminal justice system. The term is Anglo-Norman in origin and is related to the French word arrêt, meaning "stop".
The question whether the person is under arrest or not depends not on the legality of the arrest, but on whether the person has been deprived of personal liberty of movement. Including but not limited to; a traffic stop, citation issuance or initial investigation of alleged crime scene.
The word "arrest" on Mugshots.com means the apprehension of a person or the deprivation of a person's liberty.
The word "booked", when used by mugshots.com, is identical in meaning to the word "arrest".
