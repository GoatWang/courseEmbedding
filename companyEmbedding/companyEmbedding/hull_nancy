Shipwreck of the Schooner "Nancy" Nantasket Beach Night Light




$ 25.00







Default Title - $ 25.00



Quantity











On February 20, 1927, The Schooner Nancy came ashore at Nantasket Beach in the Town of Hull, MA in a raging Nor 'Easter. Coming hard and straight into the beach's abundant sands, the ship was relatively unscathed and its crew were removed safely by a crew from the nearby Humane Society Life Saving Station in Point Allerton.
Efforts to refloat and salvage the vessel proved fruitless, but by then Nantasket had a new landmark. The vessel became an immediate attraction in the summer resort on Boston's South Shore and folks paid admission to climb aboard and see the ship which hucksters had dubbed the "Nancy on The Sands."
The Nancy would over time become a giant billboard and, not too long after that, her dismantling became a WPA project during the Great Depression. She is still fondly remembered by many of Nantasket's older citizens and many now-dated images of this schooner's decks five stories above the beach continue to grace the walls of homes in the town.
