  ISAM Systematic Trend  

A pure trend following program, with a transparent
approach to reporting and research










About Us






ISAM is an alternative investment manager which specialises in
            quantitative investing.  The management team has amassed over 150 years of experience in the institutional
            alternative asset management space and in systematic investing in particular.
        

            ISAM believes that markets are fundamentally inefficient. The application of scientific analysis across a
            wide range of financial markets allows us to capture those inefficiencies.  This approach relies on a
            systematic approach to managing risk using our own sophisticated mathematical techniques.
        

            In January 2015 ISAM also launched its FX prime of prime service,
            IS Prime.
        









ISAM Systematic Trend

            “ISAM Systematic”
            is a pure trend following system tracing its roots back to 1981. It is the firm’s flagship strategy, with a
            transparent approach to reporting and research. The strategy is applied to over 200 global
            financial and commodity futures markets, capturing profits from market divergence, utilizing adaptive
            trend-seeking methods on a medium-term time-frame, with a shorter-term focus on risk management.
