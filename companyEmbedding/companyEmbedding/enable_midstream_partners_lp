Enable Midstream Partners, LP Reports Unaudited Consolidated Earnings and Production Results for the First Quarter Ended March 31, 2017; Updates Capital Expenditure Guidance for the Full Year of 2017
May 3 17
Enable Midstream Partners, LP reported unaudited consolidated earnings and production results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017. For the quarter, the company reported total revenues of $666 million against $509 million a year ago. Operating income was $140 million against $103 million a year ago. Income before income taxes was $121 million against $87 million a year ago. Net income attributable to the common and subordinated units was $111 million or $0.26 per basic and diluted common units and $0.25 per basic and diluted subordinated units against $86 million or $0.19 per diluted common units and $0.20 per basic and diluted subordinated units a year ago. Net income attributable to limited partners was $120 million against $86 million a year ago. Adjusted EBTIDA was $221 million against $215 million a year ago. Maintenance capital expenditures were $14 million against $13 million a year ago. Dcf was $171 million against $174 million a year ago. Net cash provided by operating activities was $156 million against $117 million a year ago. Capital expenditures were $61 million compared to $130 million for first quarter 2016. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to an increase in net income, partially offset by a decrease related to the timing of cash receipts and disbursements and changes in other working capital assets and liabilities. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily a result of higher gross margin, partially offset by changes in the fair value of derivatives and higher distributions from equity method affiliates for first quarter 2016 as a result of a change from receiving quarterly distributions to monthly distributions from Southeast Supply Header, LLC (SESH) starting in first quarter 2016. The decrease in DCF was primarily a result of higher Adjusted interest expense due to higher interest rates on debt outstanding and higher distributions on the Series A Preferred Units as a result of a prorated first-quarter 2016 distribution. These DCF decreases were partially offset by higher Adjusted EBITDA.

Natural gas gathered volumes were 3.29 trillion British thermal units per day (TBtu/d) for first quarter 2017, an increase of 8% compared to 3.05 TBtu/d for first quarter 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher gathered volumes in the Anadarko and Ark-La-Tex Basins. Natural gas processed volumes were 1.87 TBtu/d for first quarter 2017, an increase of 5% compared to 1.78 TBtu/d for first quarter 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher processed volumes in the Anadarko Basin, partially offset by lower processed volumes in the Ark-La-Tex Basin. NGLs produced were 79.76 thousand barrels per day (MBbl/d) for first quarter 2017, an increase of 9% compared to 73.47 MBbl/d for first quarter 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher NGL production in the Anadarko Basin, partially offset by NGL production declines in the Ark-La-Tex Basin. Crude oil gathered volumes were 21.18 MBbl/d for first quarter 2017, a decrease of 27% compared to 28.85 MBbl/d for first quarter 2016. The decrease was primarily due to inclement weather and producer well shut-ins while completing new wells. 


For the year of 2017, the company updated outlook of capital spending to $500 million to $600 million to account for spend related to Project Wildcat and the CaSE project and revised capital projections for other projects.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
