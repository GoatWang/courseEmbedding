Countertop Installation reviews in Granite City

        Real People ~ Real Reviews ~ Real Results      




Great company to work with.  Our initial phone call to find out more information was very informative. Provider name locked. gave us a few Granite supply companies to go look at granite.  He explained the various grades of granite and was able to give us some rough estimates over the phone.  We went to look at the different Granite slabs and found one that we liked and put it on hold for Provider name locked. . The Granite supplier was very familiar with Provider name locked. and their great service. This was good to know that we were hiring the right company for our granite install.   Provider name locked. came out on time to give us a firm estimate. We were impressed with Provider name locked. 's professionalism and honesty. We hired Provider name locked. based on this and all the great review's posted here on Angie's list.   All of the next scheduled appointments with Provider name locked. crew from template making to installation were on-time. No waiting around wondering when they would show up.  During the installation,  Provider name locked. called a few hours into the job to check to see how everything was going.  Then he showed up personally to talk to make sure he was meeting our expectations.  I also used Provider name locked. plumber to install the sink plumbing/faucet.  Once the Countertops were installed,  Provider name locked. did another follow up to ensure we were satisfied with the countertops.  It is easy to tell that Provider name locked. is dedicated to great customer service and wants to make sure the job is done right.  We would hire them again for any future Granite needs.
 

            - Duane H.          




The process was very smooth.  They came out and measured in order to create a template, I went to the showroom so that I could pick exactly what I wanted, and then they came out and installed it in a timely manner.   The installers were very professional and courteous.  I was very happy with the entire process.
 

            - Jan H.          




I dealt with Provider name locked. before making the decision to have the work done by Onyx, and she could not have been more helpful and patient answering my many questions.  I went and met her in person to view samples, get final questions answered, and I decided then to have them do the job after getting many other estimates.  There was no sales pressure at all, which I really appreciated!  Provider name locked. set up appointments for the measuring, and then the installation.  Both crews were timely, and extremely friendly.  The job was done on time, with only $40 added to the original estimate after exact measurements were taken, which is reasonable.  I would say that the new countertops are absolutely perfect, and look magnificent.  I would strongly recommend Onyx to anyone.  Excellent company.  Thanks!
 

            - Emily G.

Jonathan's® Wild Cherry Spoons
 Wooden spoons are some of the simplest tools in our homes, yet have an unlimited variety of uses and designs to explore.
The Johnathan’s Wild Cherry Spoons collection of handcrafted natural wild cherry wood utensils has evolved over 30 years of experimentation in the woodshop and kitchen. These spoons can serve anything, from soup to spaghetti, pudding to pie; they can spread, scoop, strain, whisk, ladle, grab, cut, peel, paddle, or pour. Use them at the stove or on the table.
Jonathan's® Wild Cherry Spoons ~ THE LEADER IN WOODEN SPOON DESIGN ~ The perfect gift for holiday giving. Handcrafted in Pennsylvania from sustainably harvest wood. Beautiful and functional these wooden utensils bring a sense of beauty and inspiration to any kitchen. The Original Lazy Spoon® is a favorite of Rachael Ray and was featured as one of Oprah's favorite things in 'O' Magazine. Christina Perillo, health advocate, and host of the PBS cooking show ‘Christina Cooks’ loves Jonathan’s® Wild & Crazy collection. Jonathan’s® Spoons create spoons for all your kitchen needs: baking, cooking, mixing and stirring; plus we offer spoons for left handed chefs! Our folding tongs are fantastic for serving salads and baked potatoes, as well as multiple kitchen tasks. Every kitchen in America needs a collection of these wooden spoons and utensils.




All utensils come from beautiful wild cherry wood that is sustainably harvested from well managed forests. Our spoons are the perfect choice for the all-natural kitchen and use with Xtrema Cookware.




Every spoon handmade in the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.
  
 How to Care for Your Cherry Wooden Utensils
Love your spoons and they'll love you back! With proper care, your new Jonathan's™ Wild Cherry Spoon will last a lifetime. I recommend that you scrub them with a Scotchbrite® pad using soap and water. Occasionally oil them when you want them to look their best – natural coconut oil is my favorite! I do not recommend using a dishwasher for any wood, as the drying cycle dehydrates wood too rapidly which can cause it to crack, and cleaning agents may age the surface of the wood. Other than that, people say my spoons survive their dishwasher’s just fine. The color of my spoons will deepen with use, and with age their beauty goes beyond skin deep, becoming the cherished utensils that we always reach for – embodying the internal beauty of usefulness.
Happy cooking - Johnathan

Frequently Asked Questions
Q. What is Xtrema made of?
A. Xtrema – All Ceramic Cookware is made of 100% natural minerals, clay and water and fired in Natural Gas Fired Kilns at 2,500 degrees.
Q. Where is Xtrema made?
A. Xtrema is handcrafted in our ceramics manufacturing facility in Southern China, the country that founded ceramics over 5,000 years ago.
How do I clean my Xtrema?
A. Just like metal cookware – SOS pads, Comet, Scotch Brite pads, nylon brushes cannot hurt the tough Xtrema surface.
Q. Why is Xtrema Gloss Black?
A. The color is a black high gloss ceramic glaze because black provides the best thermal properties and our ceramic glossy surface makes it easier to clean than any other type of cooking surface.
Q. Is Xtrema non-stick?
A. Xtrema is 100% Ceramic and 100% Non-Scratch.  There is no synthetic chemical based non-stick ceramic or PTFE plastic coating on our Xtrema Cookware. As with all types of cookware skillets, you should use a cooking spray or your favorite cooking oil when cooking with our Xtrema skillets, omelet pan and wok.   
Q. Can I cook with my Xtrema on electric coil, gas and glass top stoves?
A. Yes.
Q. Can I cook with my Xtrema on an Induction Stove?
A. Yes but you would need special induction disk which is designed to fit on top of the induction burner.
Q. Do I need to season my Xtrema?
A. No, just wash with soapy water, rinse and you are ready to cook.
Q. Why are the covers loose fitting?
A. Xtrema’s ceramic material creates additional moisture when heated and the loose fitting covers allow excess moister to escape.
Q. Will the bottom of my Xtrema scratch my glass top stove or counter top?
A. No. The bottom of Xtrema is glazed and polished but we do not suggest sliding Xtrema on any surface.
Q. Why is Xtrema not made in the USA?
A. Presently there are no Ceramic factories in the USA which have the materials or the trained artisans to make our unique high temperature, handcrafted Xtrema Cookware.
Q. What is the Xtrema Warranty?
A. There is a 50 year warranty against thermal shock breaking during cooking. Xtrema also has a 50 warranty against scratching. We suggest using nylon, wooden or silicone tools when cooking with Xtrema since metal utensils will leave gray marks on the Xtrema surface, not scratches.
Q. Do I need to use cooking spray, oil or butter when cooking with my Xtrema?
A. Yes – we suggest olive oil, coconut oil, vegetable oil or any other high temperature oil spray. We do not recommend that you use butter since it has a lower flash point and can smoke and burn when exposed to high temperatures.
Q. Is Xtrema Dishwasher Safe?
A. Yes – but it is better to wash your Xtrema by hand because other items in the dishwasher may bang into your Xtrema cookware and chip its surface.
Q. Can Xtrema chip or break if I drop it on to a hard surface?
A. Just like any other cookware product that is made of glass or ceramic it can chip or break when dropped onto a hard surface.
Q. Do I cook with Xtrema just like I do any other cookware?
A. Xtrema is designed to be used on multiple heat sources: stove top, in the oven, under the broiler, in the microwave on the grill in a microwave oven, in a convection oven and in the toaster oven.
Q. Does Xtrema contain any lead?
A. No. Xtrema is made of 100% all-natural minerals, clay and water and it does not contain lead or any other harmful metals. Unlike many types of metal cookware Xtrema all ceramic cookware does not leach any heavy and harmful s into your food during the cooking process because it is 100% all ceramic.
Q. Are there any special instructions for storing my Xtrema?
A. Store Xtrema separately if space permits. Do not nest with other Xtrema since the weight of Xtrema nested inside Xtrema can cause damage. If you must nest Xtrema place a towel inside each piece. Another tip is to reverse the covers when storing each pot separately. This will help prevent the covers from chipping.
Q. Can Xtrema Bakeware go on top of the Stove?
A. Yes!
Q. Can I use Metal Utensils with Xtrema Cookware?
A. Please use Nylon, Wood or Silicone tools when cooking with Xtrema. Ceramic is much harder than metal, so metal utensils will leave gray marks on the cooking surface (not scratches).
Q. Can I sear meat in the skillets?
A. Yes, but first heat the skillet at 450 degrees in the oven for 5 minutes then place on the stove, turn on the burner to sear your meat.
Q. Can I pour cold water in a hot Xtrema Pot?
A. No, let Xtrema cool first, then pour hot or warm water in your (now warm) Xtrema skillet or sauce pot.
Q. Will a chipped lid effect Xtrema's Performance?
A. No, a chipped lid is only cosmetic and it will not affect the performance of the cookware.

Care for Your Wood Utensils with Spoon Wax
Wood utensils are some of the most popular picks for homeowners who want all-natural ways to prepare and serve healthier meals. As you increase the number of Woodtensils from Ceramcor in your household, you need the proper way to care for them: Jonathan’s® Spoon Wax.
What is spoon wax? It’s a special polish made from organic coconut oil and beeswax. As with most amazing products, it started as a solution to a problem: how to keep wooden spoons, tongs and other implements looking great. When wood is untreated with chemicals, it tends to crack and splinter over time. Jonathan’s® Spoon Wax preserves the beautiful state of the wood by keeping it moisturized. An added benefit is that it’s non-toxic and easy to use, plus, if you get it on your hands, you never have to worry. Just rub it in and get a little extra moisture for you, too.
Use Spoon Wax on All Untreated Wooden Utensils
At Ceramcor, we only sell solid cherry USA made wooden kitchen utensils. This means anything you buy from us in this category is pure. We never use wood-polymer composites or other types of plastic coatings over the natural cherry wood. As a result, you can feel free to use spoon wax with any of our Woodtensils. However, if you purchase wooden kitchen utensils from another supplier, your spoon wax may not work because their products may have been covered with unnatural substances. Spoon wax is designed to be a polish and hydrator for 100 percent solid cherry wooden utensils, not imitations.
Keep your Jonathan’s® Spoon Wax in a cool place and use it occasionally to season and treat your wooden utensils. No need to oil them after every wash — the coconut and beeswax made-in-the-USA will last. To keep your wooden spoons and more looking amazing, only wash them by hand. Dishwashers can be rough and drying, dehydrating the wood and breaking it down rapidly.
Order your spoon wax from Ceramcor today and keep your favorite wooden utensils in tiptop shape. Be sure to pick up Jonathan’s® Spoon Wax as a complement to any Woodtensils you buy for friends and family!

Frequently Asked Questions
Q. What is Xtrema made of?
A. Xtrema – All Ceramic Cookware is made of 100% natural minerals, clay and water and fired in Natural Gas Fired Kilns at 2,500 degrees.
Q. Where is Xtrema made?
A. Xtrema is handcrafted in our ceramics manufacturing facility in Southern China, the country that founded ceramics over 5,000 years ago.
How do I clean my Xtrema?
A. Just like metal cookware – SOS pads, Comet, Scotch Brite pads, nylon brushes cannot hurt the tough Xtrema surface.
Q. Why is Xtrema Gloss Black?
A. The color is a black high gloss ceramic glaze because black provides the best thermal properties and our ceramic glossy surface makes it easier to clean than any other type of cooking surface.
Q. Is Xtrema non-stick?
A. Xtrema is 100% Ceramic and 100% Non-Scratch.  There is no synthetic chemical based non-stick ceramic or PTFE plastic coating on our Xtrema Cookware. As with all types of cookware skillets, you should use a cooking spray or your favorite cooking oil when cooking with our Xtrema skillets, omelet pan and wok.   
Q. Can I cook with my Xtrema on electric coil, gas and glass top stoves?
A. Yes.
Q. Can I cook with my Xtrema on an Induction Stove?
A. Yes but you would need special induction disk which is designed to fit on top of the induction burner.
Q. Do I need to season my Xtrema?
A. No, just wash with soapy water, rinse and you are ready to cook.
Q. Why are the covers loose fitting?
A. Xtrema’s ceramic material creates additional moisture when heated and the loose fitting covers allow excess moister to escape.
Q. Will the bottom of my Xtrema scratch my glass top stove or counter top?
A. No. The bottom of Xtrema is glazed and polished but we do not suggest sliding Xtrema on any surface.
Q. Why is Xtrema not made in the USA?
A. Presently there are no Ceramic factories in the USA which have the materials or the trained artisans to make our unique high temperature, handcrafted Xtrema Cookware.
Q. What is the Xtrema Warranty?
A. There is a 50 year warranty against thermal shock breaking during cooking. Xtrema also has a 50 warranty against scratching. We suggest using nylon, wooden or silicone tools when cooking with Xtrema since metal utensils will leave gray marks on the Xtrema surface, not scratches.
Q. Do I need to use cooking spray, oil or butter when cooking with my Xtrema?
A. Yes – we suggest olive oil, coconut oil, vegetable oil or any other high temperature oil spray. We do not recommend that you use butter since it has a lower flash point and can smoke and burn when exposed to high temperatures.
Q. Is Xtrema Dishwasher Safe?
A. Yes – but it is better to wash your Xtrema by hand because other items in the dishwasher may bang into your Xtrema cookware and chip its surface.
Q. Can Xtrema chip or break if I drop it on to a hard surface?
A. Just like any other cookware product that is made of glass or ceramic it can chip or break when dropped onto a hard surface.
Q. Do I cook with Xtrema just like I do any other cookware?
A. Xtrema is designed to be used on multiple heat sources: stove top, in the oven, under the broiler, in the microwave on the grill in a microwave oven, in a convection oven and in the toaster oven.
Q. Does Xtrema contain any lead?
A. No. Xtrema is made of 100% all-natural minerals, clay and water and it does not contain lead or any other harmful metals. Unlike many types of metal cookware Xtrema all ceramic cookware does not leach any heavy and harmful s into your food during the cooking process because it is 100% all ceramic.
Q. Are there any special instructions for storing my Xtrema?
A. Store Xtrema separately if space permits. Do not nest with other Xtrema since the weight of Xtrema nested inside Xtrema can cause damage. If you must nest Xtrema place a towel inside each piece. Another tip is to reverse the covers when storing each pot separately. This will help prevent the covers from chipping.
Q. Can Xtrema Bakeware go on top of the Stove?
A. Yes!
Q. Can I use Metal Utensils with Xtrema Cookware?
A. Please use Nylon, Wood or Silicone tools when cooking with Xtrema. Ceramic is much harder than metal, so metal utensils will leave gray marks on the cooking surface (not scratches).
Q. Can I sear meat in the skillets?
A. Yes, but first heat the skillet at 450 degrees in the oven for 5 minutes then place on the stove, turn on the burner to sear your meat.
Q. Can I pour cold water in a hot Xtrema Pot?
A. No, let Xtrema cool first, then pour hot or warm water in your (now warm) Xtrema skillet or sauce pot.
Q. Will a chipped lid effect Xtrema's Performance?
A. No, a chipped lid is only cosmetic and it will not affect the performance of the cookware.
