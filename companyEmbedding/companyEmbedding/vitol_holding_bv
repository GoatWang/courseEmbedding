The Vitol Group is a global energy and commodity trading company that was founded in Rotterdam in 1966 by Henk Viëtor and Jacques Detiger.[1][2][4] Though physical trading, logistics and distribution are at the core of the business, these are complemented by refining, shipping, terminals, exploration and production, power generation, mining and retail businesses. Vitol has 40 offices worldwide and its largest operations are in Geneva, Houston, London, and Singapore. With revenues of $152 billion in 2016, it is the largest independent energy trader in the world, and would rank eighth on the Fortune Global 500 list.[5] Because Vitol does not publish its profits widely, much like most of its competitors in commodity trading, it is largely excluded from rankings. But the company does provide financial information to its lenders and some energy groups with which it trades.[6] The company ships more than 350 million tonnes of crude oil per year and controls 250 supertankers and other vessels to move it around the world. On average it handles more than 7 million barrels a day of oil and products - roughly equivalent to the daily consumption of Japan - the world's third largest oil consumer after the United States and China.[7][8]
The company’s chief executive is Ian Taylor. Vitol is a private company which is owned significantly by a proportion of its employees, who are known for their culture of privacy and secrecy, from both competitors and the general public.[4] In March 2015, the FT suggested that Vitol appeared to make a $1.2 billion dividend distribution.[9] [10][11]

Activities[edit]
Trading[edit]
In addition to the global crude and product trading businesses, the company trades coal, natural gas, power, ethanol, methanol, gasoline, LNG, LPG, naphtha, bitumen, base oils and carbon emissions.[12][13]
Terminals and infrastructure[edit]
In total, Vitol has around 16 million cubic meters of storage capacity across the globe.[14]
Vitol is the sole owner of VTTI B.V., a storage and terminals business with a capacity of around 8.7 million cubic meters (MCM) in 11 countries: Netherlands (1.328 MCM + 1.118 MCM), Latvia (1.195 MCM), UAE (1.180 MCM), Belgium (0.965 MCM), Malaysia (0.893 MCM), Cyprus (0.544 MCM), USA (0.452 MCM), Argentina (0.218 MCM), Kenya (0.111 MCM), Russia (0.049 MCM), Nigeria (0.016 MCM).[15] MISC Berhad held a 50% stake in VTTI from May 2010 until August 2015.[16]
In January 2012 Vitol acquired a stake in a subsidiary of the South African shipping firm Grindrod, which gives it access to a coal terminal in Mozambique.[17]
Refining[edit]
In addition to offices in Dubai and Bahrain, Vitol's key strategic asset in the Middle East is the Fujairah Refinery Company Limited (FRCL), which operates an 82,000 barrel per day refinery and a 1,034,000 cubic meter tank farm. FRCL has further development plans in place, which include a 140,000 cubic meter expansion of the tank farm, refurbishment of existing refining units and the installation of additional processing units.[18] Vitol also has invested in refining assets in Bayernoil, Germany, Cressier, Switzerland, Antwerp, Belgium and the Geelong refinery near Melbourne, Australia.
Exploration and production[edit]
Vitol, through its wholly owned subsidiaries Arawak Energy Limited and Vitol E&P, has interests in various exploration and production projects worldwide. Arawak Energy is mainly focused on the FSU where it produces oil and gas in Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan, while Vitol E&P holds a portfolio of exploration and development assets along the West African Transform Margin in Ghana and the Ivory Coast.
In February 2014, it was reported that Vitol, in concert with the Abu Dhabi Investment Council, had bought the downstream businesses of Shell Australia (excluding aviation) for a total of approximately AU$2.9 billion. The purchase included Shell's Geelong Refinery and its 870-site retail business, along with its bulk fuels, bitumen, chemicals and part of its lubricants businesses in Australia.[19] The business trades as Viva Energy Australia, although the Shell brand remains on many of its retail products.[20]
Further in January 2015, Vitol in collaboration with Eni signed a $7 billion agreement with the government, for the production of oil and gas at Cape Three Points in Western Region of Ghana. The contract is expected to help meet Ghana's burgeoning energy needs.[21]
Aviation[edit]
Vitol Aviation is focused on Europe, North America and Africa, serving the world’s largest airlines and military customers with 5.7 million tonnes of jet fuel a year into wing.
Power[edit]
In 2013 Vitol invested in its first power plant, VPI Immingham in the UK. The combined heat and power plant (CHP) is one of the largest of its kind in Europe, capable of generating 1,240 MW and up to 930 tonnes of steam per hour which is used by nearby refineries. The gas-fired plant provides approximately 2.5% of UK peak electricity demand.
Figures[edit]
In 2016, Vitol traded:[13]

Oil: 351 million tonnes of crude oil and product sales
Natural Gas: over 20 billion cubic meters of physical gas globally
LPG: 10 million tonnes
Naphtha: 27 million tonnes
Gasoline: 1 million barrels of physical gasoline traded per day
Coal: over 30 million tonnes
Power: 102 TWh of power sales contracted
Carbon: 108 mm tonnes of contracted carbon volume
Methanol: 1.4 million tonnes
Chemicals: 4 million tonnes (Benzene and Paraxylene)

Controversies[edit]
A 2001 article in the Observer stated that in 1995 Vitol had secretly paid US$1 million to Serbian war criminal Arkan to settle a deal with a Serbian Oil company, Orion.[22][23] Vitol has denied all charges, arguing that no government agency has ever prosecuted the company in this respect.[24]
In 2007, Vitol pleaded guilty to grand larceny in a New York court for paying surcharges to Iraq's national oil company during Saddam's regime and circumventing the UN oil-for-food program. Vitol subsequently paid $17.5 million in restitution for its actions.[25]
According to an article in the Financial Times, Vitol was the company to organise the first controversial sale of Libyan rebel oil to Tesoro Corporation in early April 2011.[26] According to the Financial Times, the company was approached by the Qatari national oil company to sell a cargo of crude oil supplied by the Libyans in exchange for technological supplies and fuel for the National Transitional Council of Libya.[27]
In September 2012, an article in Reuters alleged that the company had bought and sold Iranian fuel oil, bypassing an EU embargo against Tehran. Vitol bought 2 million barrels using a ship-to-ship transfer off the coast of Malaysia from a National Iranian Tanker Company vessel and sold it to Chinese traders. The article stated that as Vitol is based in Switzerland, which did not implement Western sanctions, Vitol had skirted the charges.[28]
In 2013, The Telegraph alleged that the company had been using for over a decade an Employee Benefit Trust, avoiding paying income tax for its UK staff.[29]

In addition to offices in Dubai and Bahrain, Vitol's key strategic asset in the Middle East is the Fujairah Refinery Company Limited (FRCL), which operates an 82,000 barrel per day refinery and a 1,034,000 cubic meter tank farm. FRCL has further development plans in place, which include a 140,000 cubic meter expansion of the tank farm, refurbishment of existing refining units and the installation of additional processing units.[18] Vitol also has invested in refining assets in Bayernoil, Germany, Cressier, Switzerland, Antwerp, Belgium and the Geelong refinery near Melbourne, Australia.
Exploration and production[edit]
Vitol, through its wholly owned subsidiaries Arawak Energy Limited and Vitol E&P, has interests in various exploration and production projects worldwide. Arawak Energy is mainly focused on the FSU where it produces oil and gas in Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan, while Vitol E&P holds a portfolio of exploration and development assets along the West African Transform Margin in Ghana and the Ivory Coast.
In February 2014, it was reported that Vitol, in concert with the Abu Dhabi Investment Council, had bought the downstream businesses of Shell Australia (excluding aviation) for a total of approximately AU$2.9 billion. The purchase included Shell's Geelong Refinery and its 870-site retail business, along with its bulk fuels, bitumen, chemicals and part of its lubricants businesses in Australia.[19] The business trades as Viva Energy Australia, although the Shell brand remains on many of its retail products.[20]
Further in January 2015, Vitol in collaboration with Eni signed a $7 billion agreement with the government, for the production of oil and gas at Cape Three Points in Western Region of Ghana. The contract is expected to help meet Ghana's burgeoning energy needs.[21]
Aviation[edit]
Vitol Aviation is focused on Europe, North America and Africa, serving the world’s largest airlines and military customers with 5.7 million tonnes of jet fuel a year into wing.
Power[edit]
In 2013 Vitol invested in its first power plant, VPI Immingham in the UK. The combined heat and power plant (CHP) is one of the largest of its kind in Europe, capable of generating 1,240 MW and up to 930 tonnes of steam per hour which is used by nearby refineries. The gas-fired plant provides approximately 2.5% of UK peak electricity demand.
Figures[edit]
In 2016, Vitol traded:[13]

Oil: 351 million tonnes of crude oil and product sales
Natural Gas: over 20 billion cubic meters of physical gas globally
LPG: 10 million tonnes
Naphtha: 27 million tonnes
Gasoline: 1 million barrels of physical gasoline traded per day
Coal: over 30 million tonnes
Power: 102 TWh of power sales contracted
Carbon: 108 mm tonnes of contracted carbon volume
Methanol: 1.4 million tonnes
Chemicals: 4 million tonnes (Benzene and Paraxylene)

Controversies[edit]
A 2001 article in the Observer stated that in 1995 Vitol had secretly paid US$1 million to Serbian war criminal Arkan to settle a deal with a Serbian Oil company, Orion.[22][23] Vitol has denied all charges, arguing that no government agency has ever prosecuted the company in this respect.[24]
In 2007, Vitol pleaded guilty to grand larceny in a New York court for paying surcharges to Iraq's national oil company during Saddam's regime and circumventing the UN oil-for-food program. Vitol subsequently paid $17.5 million in restitution for its actions.[25]
According to an article in the Financial Times, Vitol was the company to organise the first controversial sale of Libyan rebel oil to Tesoro Corporation in early April 2011.[26] According to the Financial Times, the company was approached by the Qatari national oil company to sell a cargo of crude oil supplied by the Libyans in exchange for technological supplies and fuel for the National Transitional Council of Libya.[27]
In September 2012, an article in Reuters alleged that the company had bought and sold Iranian fuel oil, bypassing an EU embargo against Tehran. Vitol bought 2 million barrels using a ship-to-ship transfer off the coast of Malaysia from a National Iranian Tanker Company vessel and sold it to Chinese traders. The article stated that as Vitol is based in Switzerland, which did not implement Western sanctions, Vitol had skirted the charges.[28]
In 2013, The Telegraph alleged that the company had been using for over a decade an Employee Benefit Trust, avoiding paying income tax for its UK staff.[29]

Our customers and their requirements are as diverse as the world in which we live. Our colleagues comprise over 60 nationalities located in 40 offices worldwide. We have regional hubs in Bahrain, Geneva, Houston, London, Moscow, Rotterdam and Singapore and are invested in energy infrastructure across six continents.






The Americas
Vitol has a long-established presence across the Americas. From our main office in Houston, we manage trade flows within and to and from the continent, using our extensive network of storage and infrastructure to optimise the flow of crude oil and petroleum products. We are also a major participant in other key markets, including power and gas.

From a number of key locations around Europe, our European operations work closely with offices worldwide, supplying crude and products to European refineries, industrials and retail networks. As well as a significant physical presence in key energy hubs within the region, we are invested in three European refineries and a diverse portfolio of storage assets. We also supply Europe’s power sector and are actively involved in regional LNG, gas and power markets.

Middle East
With a history of working closely with national oil companies (NOCs) across the region, Vitol also has the only independent, long-standing refinery in Fujairah. We serve both regional and long haul markets, including Africa, and our global network enables us to help balance Middle Eastern incremental production across the regional refining system.

Africa
We have a growing footprint in Africa. We work closely with NOCs across the continent to help them optimise the value of their crude oil and to provide an efficient and reliable supply of key products to these growing markets. In addition, we are investing in infrastructure and have a growing downstream platform, with more than 2,000 service stations and over one million cubic metres of storage across 16 countries in Africa, as well as a unique gas-to-power project in Ghana, in collaboration with Eni, the World Bank and GNPC.

Worldwide location
We understand that every market is different and that our customers and their requirements are as diverse as the world in which we live.

The Vitol Group is a global energy and commodity trading company that was founded in Rotterdam in 1966 by Henk Viëtor and Jacques Detiger.[1][2][4] Though physical trading, logistics and distribution are at the core of the business, these are complemented by refining, shipping, terminals, exploration and production, power generation, mining and retail businesses. Vitol has 40 offices worldwide and its largest operations are in Geneva, Houston, London, and Singapore. With revenues of $152 billion in 2016, it is the largest independent energy trader in the world, and would rank eighth on the Fortune Global 500 list.[5] Because Vitol does not publish its profits widely, much like most of its competitors in commodity trading, it is largely excluded from rankings. But the company does provide financial information to its lenders and some energy groups with which it trades.[6] The company ships more than 350 million tonnes of crude oil per year and controls 250 supertankers and other vessels to move it around the world. On average it handles more than 7 million barrels a day of oil and products - roughly equivalent to the daily consumption of Japan - the world's third largest oil consumer after the United States and China.[7][8]
The company’s chief executive is Ian Taylor. Vitol is a private company which is owned significantly by a proportion of its employees, who are known for their culture of privacy and secrecy, from both competitors and the general public.[4] In March 2015, the FT suggested that Vitol appeared to make a $1.2 billion dividend distribution.[9] [10][11]

Activities[edit]
Trading[edit]
In addition to the global crude and product trading businesses, the company trades coal, natural gas, power, ethanol, methanol, gasoline, LNG, LPG, naphtha, bitumen, base oils and carbon emissions.[12][13]
Terminals and infrastructure[edit]
In total, Vitol has around 16 million cubic meters of storage capacity across the globe.[14]
Vitol is the sole owner of VTTI B.V., a storage and terminals business with a capacity of around 8.7 million cubic meters (MCM) in 11 countries: Netherlands (1.328 MCM + 1.118 MCM), Latvia (1.195 MCM), UAE (1.180 MCM), Belgium (0.965 MCM), Malaysia (0.893 MCM), Cyprus (0.544 MCM), USA (0.452 MCM), Argentina (0.218 MCM), Kenya (0.111 MCM), Russia (0.049 MCM), Nigeria (0.016 MCM).[15] MISC Berhad held a 50% stake in VTTI from May 2010 until August 2015.[16]
In January 2012 Vitol acquired a stake in a subsidiary of the South African shipping firm Grindrod, which gives it access to a coal terminal in Mozambique.[17]
Refining[edit]
In addition to offices in Dubai and Bahrain, Vitol's key strategic asset in the Middle East is the Fujairah Refinery Company Limited (FRCL), which operates an 82,000 barrel per day refinery and a 1,034,000 cubic meter tank farm. FRCL has further development plans in place, which include a 140,000 cubic meter expansion of the tank farm, refurbishment of existing refining units and the installation of additional processing units.[18] Vitol also has invested in refining assets in Bayernoil, Germany, Cressier, Switzerland, Antwerp, Belgium and the Geelong refinery near Melbourne, Australia.
Exploration and production[edit]
Vitol, through its wholly owned subsidiaries Arawak Energy Limited and Vitol E&P, has interests in various exploration and production projects worldwide. Arawak Energy is mainly focused on the FSU where it produces oil and gas in Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan, while Vitol E&P holds a portfolio of exploration and development assets along the West African Transform Margin in Ghana and the Ivory Coast.
In February 2014, it was reported that Vitol, in concert with the Abu Dhabi Investment Council, had bought the downstream businesses of Shell Australia (excluding aviation) for a total of approximately AU$2.9 billion. The purchase included Shell's Geelong Refinery and its 870-site retail business, along with its bulk fuels, bitumen, chemicals and part of its lubricants businesses in Australia.[19] The business trades as Viva Energy Australia, although the Shell brand remains on many of its retail products.[20]
Further in January 2015, Vitol in collaboration with Eni signed a $7 billion agreement with the government, for the production of oil and gas at Cape Three Points in Western Region of Ghana. The contract is expected to help meet Ghana's burgeoning energy needs.[21]
Aviation[edit]
Vitol Aviation is focused on Europe, North America and Africa, serving the world’s largest airlines and military customers with 5.7 million tonnes of jet fuel a year into wing.
Power[edit]
In 2013 Vitol invested in its first power plant, VPI Immingham in the UK. The combined heat and power plant (CHP) is one of the largest of its kind in Europe, capable of generating 1,240 MW and up to 930 tonnes of steam per hour which is used by nearby refineries. The gas-fired plant provides approximately 2.5% of UK peak electricity demand.
Figures[edit]
In 2016, Vitol traded:[13]

Oil: 351 million tonnes of crude oil and product sales
Natural Gas: over 20 billion cubic meters of physical gas globally
LPG: 10 million tonnes
Naphtha: 27 million tonnes
Gasoline: 1 million barrels of physical gasoline traded per day
Coal: over 30 million tonnes
Power: 102 TWh of power sales contracted
Carbon: 108 mm tonnes of contracted carbon volume
Methanol: 1.4 million tonnes
Chemicals: 4 million tonnes (Benzene and Paraxylene)

Controversies[edit]
A 2001 article in the Observer stated that in 1995 Vitol had secretly paid US$1 million to Serbian war criminal Arkan to settle a deal with a Serbian Oil company, Orion.[22][23] Vitol has denied all charges, arguing that no government agency has ever prosecuted the company in this respect.[24]
In 2007, Vitol pleaded guilty to grand larceny in a New York court for paying surcharges to Iraq's national oil company during Saddam's regime and circumventing the UN oil-for-food program. Vitol subsequently paid $17.5 million in restitution for its actions.[25]
According to an article in the Financial Times, Vitol was the company to organise the first controversial sale of Libyan rebel oil to Tesoro Corporation in early April 2011.[26] According to the Financial Times, the company was approached by the Qatari national oil company to sell a cargo of crude oil supplied by the Libyans in exchange for technological supplies and fuel for the National Transitional Council of Libya.[27]
In September 2012, an article in Reuters alleged that the company had bought and sold Iranian fuel oil, bypassing an EU embargo against Tehran. Vitol bought 2 million barrels using a ship-to-ship transfer off the coast of Malaysia from a National Iranian Tanker Company vessel and sold it to Chinese traders. The article stated that as Vitol is based in Switzerland, which did not implement Western sanctions, Vitol had skirted the charges.[28]
In 2013, The Telegraph alleged that the company had been using for over a decade an Employee Benefit Trust, avoiding paying income tax for its UK staff.[29]

The Vitol Group is a global energy and commodity trading company that was founded in Rotterdam in 1966 by Henk Viëtor and Jacques Detiger.[1][2][4] Though physical trading, logistics and distribution are at the core of the business, these are complemented by refining, shipping, terminals, exploration and production, power generation, mining and retail businesses. Vitol has 40 offices worldwide and its largest operations are in Geneva, Houston, London, and Singapore. With revenues of $152 billion in 2016, it is the largest independent energy trader in the world, and would rank eighth on the Fortune Global 500 list.[5] Because Vitol does not publish its profits widely, much like most of its competitors in commodity trading, it is largely excluded from rankings. But the company does provide financial information to its lenders and some energy groups with which it trades.[6] The company ships more than 350 million tonnes of crude oil per year and controls 250 supertankers and other vessels to move it around the world. On average it handles more than 7 million barrels a day of oil and products - roughly equivalent to the daily consumption of Japan - the world's third largest oil consumer after the United States and China.[7][8]
The company’s chief executive is Ian Taylor. Vitol is a private company which is owned significantly by a proportion of its employees, who are known for their culture of privacy and secrecy, from both competitors and the general public.[4] In March 2015, the FT suggested that Vitol appeared to make a $1.2 billion dividend distribution.[9] [10][11]

According to an article in the Financial Times, Vitol was the company to organise the first controversial sale of Libyan rebel oil to Tesoro Corporation in early April 2011.[26] According to the Financial Times, the company was approached by the Qatari national oil company to sell a cargo of crude oil supplied by the Libyans in exchange for technological supplies and fuel for the National Transitional Council of Libya.[27]
In September 2012, an article in Reuters alleged that the company had bought and sold Iranian fuel oil, bypassing an EU embargo against Tehran. Vitol bought 2 million barrels using a ship-to-ship transfer off the coast of Malaysia from a National Iranian Tanker Company vessel and sold it to Chinese traders. The article stated that as Vitol is based in Switzerland, which did not implement Western sanctions, Vitol had skirted the charges.[28]
In 2013, The Telegraph alleged that the company had been using for over a decade an Employee Benefit Trust, avoiding paying income tax for its UK staff.[29]

Where we work



Home  Working with us  Where we work
Our customers and their requirements are as diverse as the world in which we live. Our colleagues comprise over 60 nationalities located in 40 offices worldwide. We have regional hubs in Bahrain, Geneva, Houston, London, Moscow, Rotterdam and Singapore and are invested in energy infrastructure across six continents.






The Americas
Vitol has a long-established presence across the Americas. From our main office in Houston, we manage trade flows within and to and from the continent, using our extensive network of storage and infrastructure to optimise the flow of crude oil and petroleum products. We are also a major participant in other key markets, including power and gas.

Europe
From a number of key locations around Europe, our European operations work closely with offices worldwide, supplying crude and products to European refineries, industrials and retail networks. As well as a significant physical presence in key energy hubs within the region, we are invested in three European refineries and a diverse portfolio of storage assets. We also supply Europe’s power sector and are actively involved in regional LNG, gas and power markets.

Middle East
With a history of working closely with national oil companies (NOCs) across the region, Vitol also has the only independent, long-standing refinery in Fujairah. We serve both regional and long haul markets, including Africa, and our global network enables us to help balance Middle Eastern incremental production across the regional refining system.

Africa
We have a growing footprint in Africa. We work closely with NOCs across the continent to help them optimise the value of their crude oil and to provide an efficient and reliable supply of key products to these growing markets. In addition, we are investing in infrastructure and have a growing downstream platform, with more than 2,000 service stations and over one million cubic metres of storage across 16 countries in Africa, as well as a unique gas-to-power project in Ghana, in collaboration with Eni, the World Bank and GNPC.

Asia Pacific
From our network of offices, we serve the energy needs of customers across the region. Our global trading network enables us to source the optimal feeds tocks for the region’s refiners, serve the needs of industrial companies and ensure the timely delivery of petroleum products to growing consumer markets. We are also invested in the Geelong refinery and the second largest downstream business in Australia, with over 920 service stations.






Worldwide location
We understand that every market is different and that our customers and their requirements are as diverse as the world in which we live. With 40 offices worldwide our colleagues comprise over 60 nationalities giving us a diversity of thinking which we believe translates into a greater understanding of our customers and enabling us to make better and more informed decisions.
Our office addresses can be found on the contact page.

The Vitol Group is a global energy and commodity trading company that was founded in Rotterdam in 1966 by Henk Viëtor and Jacques Detiger.[1][2][4] Though physical trading, logistics and distribution are at the core of the business, these are complemented by refining, shipping, terminals, exploration and production, power generation, mining and retail businesses. Vitol has 40 offices worldwide and its largest operations are in Geneva, Houston, London, and Singapore. With revenues of $152 billion in 2016, it is the largest independent energy trader in the world, and would rank eighth on the Fortune Global 500 list.[5] Because Vitol does not publish its profits widely, much like most of its competitors in commodity trading, it is largely excluded from rankings. But the company does provide financial information to its lenders and some energy groups with which it trades.[6] The company ships more than 350 million tonnes of crude oil per year and controls 250 supertankers and other vessels to move it around the world. On average it handles more than 7 million barrels a day of oil and products - roughly equivalent to the daily consumption of Japan - the world's third largest oil consumer after the United States and China.[7][8]
The company’s chief executive is Ian Taylor. Vitol is a private company which is owned significantly by a proportion of its employees, who are known for their culture of privacy and secrecy, from both competitors and the general public.[4] In March 2015, the FT suggested that Vitol appeared to make a $1.2 billion dividend distribution.[9] [10][11]

Activities[edit]
Trading[edit]
In addition to the global crude and product trading businesses, the company trades coal, natural gas, power, ethanol, methanol, gasoline, LNG, LPG, naphtha, bitumen, base oils and carbon emissions.[12][13]
Terminals and infrastructure[edit]
In total, Vitol has around 16 million cubic meters of storage capacity across the globe.[14]
Vitol is the sole owner of VTTI B.V., a storage and terminals business with a capacity of around 8.7 million cubic meters (MCM) in 11 countries: Netherlands (1.328 MCM + 1.118 MCM), Latvia (1.195 MCM), UAE (1.180 MCM), Belgium (0.965 MCM), Malaysia (0.893 MCM), Cyprus (0.544 MCM), USA (0.452 MCM), Argentina (0.218 MCM), Kenya (0.111 MCM), Russia (0.049 MCM), Nigeria (0.016 MCM).[15] MISC Berhad held a 50% stake in VTTI from May 2010 until August 2015.[16]
In January 2012 Vitol acquired a stake in a subsidiary of the South African shipping firm Grindrod, which gives it access to a coal terminal in Mozambique.[17]
Refining[edit]
In addition to offices in Dubai and Bahrain, Vitol's key strategic asset in the Middle East is the Fujairah Refinery Company Limited (FRCL), which operates an 82,000 barrel per day refinery and a 1,034,000 cubic meter tank farm. FRCL has further development plans in place, which include a 140,000 cubic meter expansion of the tank farm, refurbishment of existing refining units and the installation of additional processing units.[18] Vitol also has invested in refining assets in Bayernoil, Germany, Cressier, Switzerland, Antwerp, Belgium and the Geelong refinery near Melbourne, Australia.
Exploration and production[edit]
Vitol, through its wholly owned subsidiaries Arawak Energy Limited and Vitol E&P, has interests in various exploration and production projects worldwide. Arawak Energy is mainly focused on the FSU where it produces oil and gas in Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan, while Vitol E&P holds a portfolio of exploration and development assets along the West African Transform Margin in Ghana and the Ivory Coast.
In February 2014, it was reported that Vitol, in concert with the Abu Dhabi Investment Council, had bought the downstream businesses of Shell Australia (excluding aviation) for a total of approximately AU$2.9 billion. The purchase included Shell's Geelong Refinery and its 870-site retail business, along with its bulk fuels, bitumen, chemicals and part of its lubricants businesses in Australia.[19] The business trades as Viva Energy Australia, although the Shell brand remains on many of its retail products.[20]
Further in January 2015, Vitol in collaboration with Eni signed a $7 billion agreement with the government, for the production of oil and gas at Cape Three Points in Western Region of Ghana. The contract is expected to help meet Ghana's burgeoning energy needs.[21]
Aviation[edit]
Vitol Aviation is focused on Europe, North America and Africa, serving the world’s largest airlines and military customers with 5.7 million tonnes of jet fuel a year into wing.
Power[edit]
In 2013 Vitol invested in its first power plant, VPI Immingham in the UK. The combined heat and power plant (CHP) is one of the largest of its kind in Europe, capable of generating 1,240 MW and up to 930 tonnes of steam per hour which is used by nearby refineries. The gas-fired plant provides approximately 2.5% of UK peak electricity demand.
Figures[edit]
In 2016, Vitol traded:[13]

Oil: 351 million tonnes of crude oil and product sales
Natural Gas: over 20 billion cubic meters of physical gas globally
LPG: 10 million tonnes
Naphtha: 27 million tonnes
Gasoline: 1 million barrels of physical gasoline traded per day
Coal: over 30 million tonnes
Power: 102 TWh of power sales contracted
Carbon: 108 mm tonnes of contracted carbon volume
Methanol: 1.4 million tonnes
Chemicals: 4 million tonnes (Benzene and Paraxylene)

Controversies[edit]
A 2001 article in the Observer stated that in 1995 Vitol had secretly paid US$1 million to Serbian war criminal Arkan to settle a deal with a Serbian Oil company, Orion.[22][23] Vitol has denied all charges, arguing that no government agency has ever prosecuted the company in this respect.[24]
In 2007, Vitol pleaded guilty to grand larceny in a New York court for paying surcharges to Iraq's national oil company during Saddam's regime and circumventing the UN oil-for-food program. Vitol subsequently paid $17.5 million in restitution for its actions.[25]
According to an article in the Financial Times, Vitol was the company to organise the first controversial sale of Libyan rebel oil to Tesoro Corporation in early April 2011.[26] According to the Financial Times, the company was approached by the Qatari national oil company to sell a cargo of crude oil supplied by the Libyans in exchange for technological supplies and fuel for the National Transitional Council of Libya.[27]
In September 2012, an article in Reuters alleged that the company had bought and sold Iranian fuel oil, bypassing an EU embargo against Tehran. Vitol bought 2 million barrels using a ship-to-ship transfer off the coast of Malaysia from a National Iranian Tanker Company vessel and sold it to Chinese traders. The article stated that as Vitol is based in Switzerland, which did not implement Western sanctions, Vitol had skirted the charges.[28]
In 2013, The Telegraph alleged that the company had been using for over a decade an Employee Benefit Trust, avoiding paying income tax for its UK staff.[29]

Press Article, Trading, 22 Feb 2017		
PRESS RELEASE: ADNOC signs 10-year deal for the sale of 528,000 tonnes per year of LPG 
Agreement creates long-term value and will help protect ADNOC from energy market fluctuations.
The Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) has signed an agreement with Vitol, the world’s largest independent energy trader, for the sale of up to 528,000 tonnes per year of LPG, to Vitol, over the next 10 years.
The long-term agreement, backdated to January 1, 2017 and which will expire on the 31st of December 2026, was signed on the side-lines of International Petroleum Week (IP WEEK), taking place in London, by Abdulla Salem Al Dhaheri, ADNOC Sales and Marketing Director and Russell Hardy, a member of Vitol’s Executive Committee.
Al Dhaheri said: “ADNOC has implemented a new strategy toward its LPG sales by negotiating longer term contracts to cope with the oversupply market especially after the Shale Gas Revolution.
“This agreement, which strengthens the long-standing relationship between ADNOC and Vitol, is a prime example of the innovative and different thinking we are bringing to our business deals. It will create reliable, long-term value and maximise our gas resources to ensure the company is resilient to future fluctuations in the global energy markets.”
Vitol is a private company founded in Rotterdam in 1966. It has over 40 offices worldwide and its largest operations are in Geneva, Houston, London and Singapore. Its primary business is the trading and distribution of energy products globally including over 6 million bpd of crude oil and products and 10 million tonnes of LPG annually. Revenues in 2015 were $168 billion.
Hardy said: “We are delighted to be working with ADNOC on this long-term supply agreement. LPG is an important clean fuel and this will support our growing downstream LPG business.”
Vitol’s energy assets globally include over 15.5 million cubic metres of storage across six continents; 390,000 bpd of refining capacity and Shell-branded downstream businesses in 16 African countries, as well as Australia. Vitol also has the only independent, long-standing refinery in Fujairah. Vitol’s customers include national oil companies, multinationals, leading industrial and chemical companies and the world’s largest airlines.

An introduction to the Vitol Group
5441 employees across Vitol & its key investmentsIt isn’t ships or terminals or cargoes that create our success: it’s the calibre of our people.
Being a global business, they come from all over the world and represent a vibrant mix of different nationalities, educational backgrounds and life experiences. In fact, today, people from around 60 different countries work for the Vitol Group, all around the world. They continue to build our reputation as a leading player in the energy markets through their creativity, commitment, professionalism and entrepreneurial spirit.
Below is a very brief summary of what we do and the way we work. However, before applying for any opportunity we may have, we recommend you explore the main pages of this website and familiarise yourself more fully with our business.
Who are we? What do we do?
The Vitol Group is one of the largest independent energy trading groups in the world and operates through a global group of companies.
Although mainly a physical oil trader, the Group is now broadly based – with active trading operations in gas, coal, power, non-ferrous metals, derivatives and sugar. Essentially, we trade energy: we create markets for fuel products; we deliver cargoes, safely, on-specification and on-time; we provide extensive terminal and storage facilities; and we engineer innovative financing structures to the benefit of our customers. Through the Vitol Foundation, we are also active in charitable funding to benefit severely deprived children in Asia, Africa, Latin America and CIS.
Where are we?
We have offices all over the world, with the majority of our people located in the six key locations of Geneva, Houston, London, Moscow, Rotterdam and Singapore. We are active wherever our customers and the markets dictate, and this inevitably gives rise to some exciting, challenging and rewarding career assignments and opportunities.

We are always pleased to hear from talented individuals.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
