More About Lucidia











We think of allergies differently than what you’re used to hearing, but what we have to offer is rooted in Traditional Chinese Medicine and has been acknowledged and applied for thousands of years.
To us, allergies are an entry-point to healing; and although most people experience the same type of symptoms, the reasons for experiencing them varies. Your allergies could manifest from physical, emotional and/or nutritional reasons.

We are committed to authentic study of the natural world, to it’s beauty and preservation, and to a vibrant and healthy humanity.

The medicines are grown by US organic farmers and processed and made with care and attention every step of the way.


Simplicity
Nature is the most simple, and the most complex.  By keeping it simple, we access the greater wisdom and healing power the plants and our bodies have to offer and end the competition with the natural world.


Love and Respect
Self love and self respect–simply, this is the path to healing and happiness. This could be all we need to read!

This practice is to be done daily and can stand alone or be a warm up before a regular meditation or yoga practice. It will be posted weekly, but should be done daily.
It is a basic self awareness and qi cultivation practice to coordinate 3 main aspects (bodies) of our being: body, mind and emotion.

More About Lucidia











We think of allergies differently than what you’re used to hearing, but what we have to offer is rooted in Traditional Chinese Medicine and has been acknowledged and applied for thousands of years.
To us, allergies are an entry-point to healing; and although most people experience the same type of symptoms, the reasons for experiencing them varies. Your allergies could manifest from physical, emotional and/or nutritional reasons.

The teachings and product we bring forward are from real education, personal experience, clinical practice, scientific research, and traditional wisdom ways.  We live what we teach, and use what we offer. The medicines are grown by US organic farmers and processed and made with care and attention every step of the way.


Simplicity
Nature is the most simple, and the most complex.  By keeping it simple, we access the greater wisdom and healing power the plants and our bodies have to offer and end the competition with the natural world.


Love and Respect
Self love and self respect–simply, this is the path to healing and happiness. This could be all we need to read!
