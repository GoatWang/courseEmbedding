Steven M. Johnson's "Patent Depending" series of inventions range from social commentary to plain ol' bizarre, and they always give us a laugh. So we've contracted him to let us publish one every week.

Last time we covered the brilliant cartoonist/inventor Steven M. Johnson, he'd just released a book of his transportation designs. Now he's got a new book out and it spans every design field under the sun. Johnson has graciously allowed us to show you some of the images from "Patent Depending: Armbrella, Sofa Shower, Unzipped Fly Alarm and Other Essential Products." Here are just a fraction of the literally hundreds of concepts he's got in the book. (Note that we added the headings; he's got a different chapter titling convention in the book.)ArchitectureEnter a caption (optional)Fashion DesignEnter a caption (optional)Flatware DesignEnter a caption (optional)Footwear DesignEnter a caption (optional)Furniture DesignEnter a caption (optional)Interface DesignEnter a caption (optional)Landscape DesignEnter a caption (optional)Multi-Tool DesignEnter a caption (optional)Office Furniture DesignEnter a caption (optional)Enter a caption (optional)Product DesignEnter a caption (optional)Sporting Goods DesignEnter a caption (optional)Transportation DesignEnter a caption (optional)Then there's the random stuff that just cracks us up:Enter a caption (optional)Enter a caption (optional)Enter a caption (optional)Enter a caption (optional)You can order the book here.

An uncomfortable materials question
Artist Nadja Buttendorf snagged my attention with an invention that is simultaneously intriguing and skin crawling: soft fingernails. Anyone who's grown long nails can attest that they come with a host of structural and environmental issues. Typing, opening lids, and navigating anything with push buttons can be tricky or even

Steven M. Johnson
The year 2017 represents my 55nd year as an occasional inventor, whimsicalist and possibilitist. Though creating invention-themed cartoons has been for me nothing more than a sideline business, I’ve never stopped amusing myself by tinkering with ideas for plausible or outrageous products, or by trying to anticipate future trends and inventions.  Sometimes I have actually foreseen a trend, as in 1975 when I drew pre-torn clothing, or in 1992 when I drew a product similar to Google Glass, long before others came up with the same idea. Many of my 1991 predictions in Public Therapy Buses have come true. Many have not. Some are yet to come true, thereby shocking the world.
