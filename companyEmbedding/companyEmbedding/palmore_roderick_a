Roderick A. Palmore Elected to Goodyear Board









August 7, 2012










AKRON, Ohio, August 7, 2012 – Roderick A. Palmore, executive vice president, general counsel, chief compliance and risk management officer, and secretary for General Mills, Inc., has been elected to the Board of Directors of The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company.
“We are pleased to have Rick join the Goodyear Board of Directors,” said Goodyear Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Richard J. Kramer.  “His broad business knowledge and public board experience, as well as his strong leadership skills, will be valuable assets to the Goodyear Board and the senior leadership team as we execute our strategic roadmap.”
Palmore, 60, joined General Mills’ senior leadership team in 2008. In his role, he is responsible for the company’s worldwide legal activities, corporate ethics, compliance, and corporate security. From 1996 to 2008, he worked for the Sara Lee Corporation in a variety of legal leadership roles, ultimately becoming executive vice president, general counsel, and secretary.  Between 1977 and 1996, he worked for a series of law firms and the U.S. Department of Justice.
Palmore has been recognized by the National Law Journal, Inside Counsel Magazine and Corporate Board Member Magazine as one of the most influential general counsels in America. He holds a bachelor’s degree in economics from Yale University and a J.D. degree from the University of Chicago School of Law.  He currently is a director of CBOE Holdings Inc. and is on the executive committee of the Association of General Counsel as its immediate past chairman.
The election of Palmore brings the size of Goodyear’s board to 11 members.
Goodyear is one of the world’s largest tire companies.  It employs approximately 72,000 people and manufactures its products in 53 facilities in 22 countries around the world.  Its two Innovation Centers in Akron, Ohio and Colmar-Berg, Luxembourg strive to develop state-of-the-art products and services that set the technology and performance standard for the industry.  For more information about Goodyear, go to www.goodyear.com/corporate.

Roderick A. Palmore Returns to Dentons















 



July 23, 2015
CHICAGO—Dentons announced today that Roderick A. Palmore, formerly General Counsel, Executive Vice President and Chief Compliance and Risk Management Officer of General Mills Inc., has rejoined the Firm as Senior Counsel in Chicago.  Palmore has nearly 20 years of experience as a general counsel and as a public company director. He also is a nationally-recognized advocate for diversity in the legal industry.   Palmore was a litigation partner with Sonnenschein Nath & Rosenthal, a Dentons US legacy firm, in the same Chicago office from 1993-96.
At Dentons, Palmore will work with lawyers and professionals across practices and industry sectors to advise public and private corporations and their leadership suites on risk management and governance issues. He will focus on issues such as regulation, internal investigations, board responsibilities and performance, due diligence, litigation, brand protection, advertising, and marketing and labeling. 
"Rick's extraordinary career now comes full circle back to Dentons as we regain his remarkable depth of experience as a general counsel, board member, and business leader," said Dentons' US Managing Partner Mike McNamara. "The role of general counsel forever has changed in large part due to Rick's vision and execution in corporate board rooms and the executive leadership. Through his tireless push for transparency in the recruiting, retention and promotion of diverse lawyers in corporations and their law firms, Rick has been at the forefront of championing inclusion, which is one of the foundational principles of Dentons."
From 1996 to 2008, Palmore was an executive and counsel at Sara Lee Corporation, serving as general counsel from 1999 to 2008 and ultimately holding the title Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary for the consumer food giant from 2004 to 2008. Earlier in his career, Palmore was an Assistant United States Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois. 
"Rick's experience as a global corporate director, executive, general counsel and practitioner will be an invaluable asset to our clients," said Senior Counsel Mary Ann Hynes, the first female general counsel of a Fortune 500 company, who joined Dentons more than two years ago after an impressive in-house career. In addition to Hynes, who served as general counsel to Commerce Clearing House (CCH), Inc., Palmore will join a number of other Dentons lawyers with general counsel and executive experience including David Allgood, the former general counsel of Royal Bank of Canada (RBC); Bill Ide, the former general counsel of Monsanto; Jorge Alers, the former general counsel of Inter-American Development Bank; Phil Bradley, the former general counsel of Duane Reade Holdings, RT Oncology Services, and Gentiva Health Services; Mike Rule, the former general counsel of Prandium Inc. and Koo Koo Roo Enterprises; among others. 
Throughout his career, Palmore has been a tireless champion for diversity in the profession.  He is the author of A Call to Action:  Diversity in the Legal Profession, a legal industry manifesto urging general counsel to drive diversity by demanding results in the law firms with which they work as well as in their departments. The initiative later grew into the Leadership Council on Legal Diversity (LCLD), a collaboration between general counsel and managing partners, which was formed in May 2009 and now includes more than 225 corporate chief legal officers and law firm managing partners.  Palmore was the founding chair of the LCLD Board of Directors and continues to serve on its executive committee.
"He is a legend in the legal community and living proof of the tremendous impact one person can have on an entire industry," said Steven Velkei, Litigation partner and Chair of Dentons' US Diversity Committee. "In private practice and as a general counsel, he was a trailblazer in setting guidelines for how corporations could gauge their own staffing and evaluate their outside counsel to affect real change in the hiring and retention of lawyers of color both in-house and in private practice."
Palmore has been the recipient of numerous honors for his work and contributions to the legal profession. In 2010, he was named one of the 40 Most Influential Lawyers of the Decade by the National Law Journal.  His other honors include the Corporate Exemplar Award from the National Legal Aid & Defender Association, the Spirit of Excellence Award from the American Bar Association, the Scales of Justice Award from the Equal Justice Works Foundation, as well as the Pinnacle Award for Lifetime Achievement from the National Bar Association.  
He serves on the Boards of Directors of the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, Express Scripts and the Chicago Board Options Exchange. He is a former chair of the Association of General Counsel.  He also has previously served on the boards of the Boys & Girls Clubs of Chicago, the Public Interest Law Initiative, the Legal Assistance Foundation of Chicago and the United Way of Metropolitan Chicago.
Palmore earned his JD from the University of Chicago Law School and his BA from Yale University.
