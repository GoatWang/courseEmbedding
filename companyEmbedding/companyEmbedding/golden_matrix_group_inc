Golden Matrix Group Letter to Shareholders


Press Release
-

												May 12, 2016						
 





			Las Vegas, NV, 
			May 12, 2016			(Newswire.com) -
	​Golden Matrix Group Inc. (OTCPK: GMGI) a provider of social gaming technology services to Social Gaming Operators released the following letter to its shareholders from its Chairman and CEO, Brian Goodman:
Dear Shareholders,
As this is the first letter to you as Chairman of Golden Matrix Group’s Board of Directors, I thought it would be appropriate to briefly discuss recent changes to the Company as well as the Company’s strategic plans, going forward.
The Company has recently acquired valuable Gaming Technology and on the 7th of April Source Gold Corp. (SRGL) changed its name to the Golden Matrix Group (GMGI). GMGI now has an advanced social gaming software platform and marketing back-end for the online social gambling industry.
The Opportunity
Asia is the world’s largest social gaming market, and GMGI is structured to focus on this market with its lucrative gaming opportunities afforded it by the unique Gaming IP and access to an existing Asian distribution network. The gaming applications will include popular casino games, poker, bingo, Slots and table games all to be offered in a Social Environment.  GMGI will be unique in that it will offer a social gaming platform that is distinct from what is available in the current market place, as well as offer state of the art well known branded Casino Games that are currently available in real licensed casinos around the world (distinct from basic animated games currently being offered by Social Gaming businesses). GMGI has commitments from social gaming operators to utilize the GMGI Social Gaming platform and as such will achieve immediate and extensive distribution as well as significant revenues from the outset.
Market Place
The Growth of the Mobile Game market is fueled by an increase in the number of players as well as the increasing average investment spent per player. With already over 378 Million consumers globally, the Asia Pacific region is by far the biggest market for mobile games and revenues from South East Asia will be $2.2 Billion USD by 2017. 
Generating long-term shareholder value
The company’s new focus on the rapidly growing multi billion dollar marketplace will form a strategic framework for long-term shareholder value creation. The recent Strategic investments and new management will drive long-term shareholder value and capitalize on the ownership of its unique technology in one of the world’s most lucrative industries.
As we look at 2016 and beyond, we remain focused on success for the long term. We believe we are in a great position to leverage our momentum, capitalize on our unique technology and relationships and position as one of the world’s leading social gaming providers.
Brian Goodman
Chairman
Golden Matrix Group Inc.
