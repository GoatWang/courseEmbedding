		What I Should Know 
Before Investing




An investment in the Fund is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the principal. Diversification does not ensure a profit or guarantee against loss. Fixed income securities involve interest rate, credit, inflation, and reinvestment risks; and possible loss of principal. As interest rates rise, the value of fixed income securities falls. The risks of lower-rated, higher-yielding securities include greater price volatility, illiquidity and possibility of default. Municipal securities purchased by the Fund may be adversely affected by changes in the financial condition of municipal issuers and insurers, regulatory and political developments, uncertainties and public perceptions, and other factors. The Fund may use derivatives, such as options and futures, which can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses, and have a potentially large impact on Fund performance. Leverage may result in greater volatility of NAV and the market price of common shares and increases a shareholder’s risk of loss. Certain investors may be subject to the federal Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT), and state and local taxes may apply. Capital gains, if any, are fully taxable.

Distributions are not guaranteed and are subject to change. 

Tapering of the Federal Reserve Board’s quantitative easing program and a general rise in interest rates may lead to increased portfolio volatility.

Performance








IMPORTANT PERFORMANCE INFORMATION: Performance shown represents past performance and is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance shown. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than the original cost. Returns based on Market Price or NAV, and assume the reinvestment of all distributions at the Dividend Reinvestment Plan Price or NAV, respectively. All returns include the deduction of management fees, operating expenses and all other fund expenses, and do not reflect the deduction of brokerage commissions or taxes that investors may pay on distributions or the sale of shares. Returns for periods of less than one year are not annualized.

 Net Asset Value (NAV) is total assets less total liabilities divided by the number of shares outstanding.

 Market Price, determined by supply and demand, is the price an investor purchases or sells the fund. The Market Price may differ from a fund’s NAV.
*Distribution rate is calculated by annualizing the most recent distribution amount paid, excluding special distributions, divided by the closing market price or NAV. As of 06/30/2017, the fund estimates that the distributions will be paid from: 100.00% investment income;0.00% realized capital gains; and, 0.00% return of capital. The Distribution Rate is subject to change and is not a quotation of Fund performance. The Board of Directors may terminate or suspend the managed distribution policy at any time. Any such termination or suspension could have an adverse effect on the market price of the Fund's shares. A return of capital is not taxable and results in a reduction in the tax basis of a shareholder's investment. For more information about a distribution's composition refer to the Fund's distribution press release or, if applicable, the Section 19 notice located in the Press Releases section below.



























A NOTE ABOUT FEES & EXPENSES: Based on the Fund’s net assets of the common shares, as of the most recent Annual Report.
Management fees: Under the investment management agreement, the Fund pays an annual fee, paid monthly, as a portion of the Fund's average weekly net assets.  For purposes of calculating this fee, the liquidation value of any outstanding Preferred Stock of the Fund is not deducted in determining the Fund’s net assets. Please see the fund’s Annual Report for more information on expenses.

IMPORTANT CHARACTERISTICS INFORMATION: Portfolio characteristics and holdings are subject to change at any time. Percentages are based on total portfolio as of quarter-end and are subject to change at any time. For informational purposes only and not to be considered a recommendation to purchase or sell any security. Negative allocations and allocations in excess of 100% are primarily due to the Fund's unsettled trade activity.
The difference between total assets and net assets, if any, is due primarily to the Fund’s use of borrowings and other liabilities; net assets do not include borrowings. The Fund may employ leverage in the form of loans, preferred stock, reverse repurchase agreements and/or other instruments. When the Fund engages in transactions that have a leveraging effect on the Fund’s portfolio, the value of the Fund will be more volatile and all other risks will tend to be compounded. 

Percentages are based on total portfolio as of quarter-end and are subject to change at any time. For informational purposes only and not to be considered a recommendation to purchase or sell any security. Negative allocations and allocations in excess of 100% are primarily due to the Fund's unsettled trade activity.
 


Weighted Average Life (WAL) is the average number of years for which each dollar of unpaid principal on a loan or mortgage remains outstanding. Once calculated, WAL tells how many years it will take to pay half of the outstanding principal. 


Effective duration is a duration calculation for bonds with embedded options. Effective duration takes into account that expected cash flows will fluctuate as interest rates change. Duration measures the sensitivity of price (the value of principal) of a fixed-income investment to a change in interest rates. The higher the duration number, the more sensitive a fixed-income investment will be to interest rate changes.


Credit quality is a measure of a bond issuer's ability to repay interest and principal in a timely manner. The credit ratings shown are based on each portfolio security's rating as provided by Standard and Poor's, Moody's Investors Service and/or Fitch Ratings, Ltd. and typically range from AAA (highest) to D (lowest), or an equivalent and/or similar rating. For this purpose, when two or more of the agencies have assigned differing ratings to a security, the highest rating is used. Securities that are unrated by all three agencies are reflected as such. The credit quality of the investments in the Fund's portfolio does not apply to the stability or safety of the Fund. These ratings are updated monthly and may change over time. Please note, the Fund itself has not been rated by an independent rating agency.

IMPORTANT HOLDINGS INFORMATION: Portfolio holdings are based on total portfolio, and are subject to change at any time. Holdings are provided for informational purposes only and should not be construed as a recommendation to purchase or sell any security. Any negative allocations or allocations in excess of 100% are primarily due to unsettled trade activities.
Derivatives, such as options and futures, which can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses and have a potentially large impact on Fund performance.

 Distributions 






Distributions









IMPORTANT DISTRIBUTION INFORMATION: Distributions paid by the Fund may be comprised of income, capital gains, and/or return of capital. At year-end the Fund will issue a Form 1099 with the final composition of the distribution for tax purposes. A current estimate of the distribution's composition can be found in the performance section on this page or in the most recent distribution press release and/or Section 19 notice located in the press release section below. The Distribution Rate is not guaranteed, subject to change, and is not a quotation of Fund performance. A return of capital is not taxable and results in a reduction in the tax basis of a shareholder's investment.

IMPORTANT INFORMATION: All investments involve risk, including loss of principal. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Please see each product’s web page for specific details regarding investment objective, risks associated with hedge funds, alternative investments and other risks, performance and other important information. Review this information carefully before you make any investment decision.
The Closed-End Funds are not sold or distributed by Legg Mason Investor Services, LLC ("LMIS") or any affiliate of Legg Mason, Inc. Unlike open-end funds, shares are not continually offered. Like other public companies, closed-end funds have a one-time initial public offering, and once their shares are first issued, are generally bought and sold through non-affiliated broker/dealers and trade on nationally recognized stock exchanges. Share prices will fluctuate with market conditions and, at the time of sale, may be worth more or less than your original investment. Shares of exchange-traded closed-end funds may trade at a discount or premium to their original offering price, and often trade at a discount to their net asset value. Net Asset Value (NAV) is total assets less total liabilities divided by the number of shares outstanding. Market Price, determined by supply and demand, is the price an investor purchases or sells the fund. Investment return, market price and net asset value will fluctuate with changes in market conditions. The Funds are subject to investment risks, including the possible loss of principal invested.
