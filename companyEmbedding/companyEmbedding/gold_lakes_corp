Welcome to Elephant Country
 ABOUT GOLD LAKES 
 
As a new exploration play in the exceptionally prolific Abitibi Greenstone area, Gold Lakes (GLLK: OTCQB) represents compelling investment and takeover potential. 
Gold has spiked over $1,300 for the first time in two years, and the Gold Miners ETF (GDX) has risen 50% since the start of 2016.
Gold Lakes Corporation strategy is to identify and acquire prospective properties in well-mineralized mining areas and advancing these properties toward making new discoveries within the Abitibi Greenstone Belt. For slightly over a century, the legendary Abitibi-Greenstone belt has produced hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of mostly gold, silver, copper and zinc.
This area of Northern Ontario and Quebec is comparable to Nevada's Carlin Trend. 
The Abitibi Greenstone belt is an established gold mining district having produced over 100 mines and 180 million ounces of gold since 1901.

Takeover Activity

 
In June 2015 Oban Mining (OBM: TSX), with a market cap of north of $60 million, acquired five juniors in the region and has taken out several more to date. Oban is focused on a clear strategy of consolidation in the Abitibi Greenstone Belt and plans to become an intermediate producer within the near future.
Oban’s mandate is to drill test targets rapidly, advance or divest the rest. Oban is well financed with approximately $73 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.
In January 2016 Kirkland Lake Gold Inc. (TSX: KGI) closed a $178 million agreement to acquire all the outstanding shares of St Andrew Goldfields Ltd. (TSX: SAS) (OTCQX: STADF). 
The new entity will have a strong production growth profile and is expected to produce 260-310k oz gold in 2016 with attractive cash costs between US$600-690/oz gold. Over 50% increase in proven & probable gold reserves to a combined 2.3m oz Au, and over 100% increase in measured & indicated gold resources, supporting long-term sustainable production profile.

 Golden Opportunities
 THE PLAN
 
Under the direction of industry veteran Ed Morrow GLLK’s VP of Mining Exploration, the Company plans to be on the property presently to ascertain the areas and targets to commence its aggressive drilling program.

The Big Monty lies within the prolific Porcupine-Destor Fault Zone “PDFZ” (110 Million ounces of Au produced to date and adjacent to the North and Northwest borders by St. Andrews Goldfield’s Holt Property (SAS: TSXV) which has 2.8 Million Ounces of measured and indicated resources and 1.1 Million Ounces of inferred resources as of December 31, 2013.
GLLK management intends to prove that the Holt property gold system continues onto its claims.
The 2,846 acre Big Monty was acquired by GLLK in a deal with Flex Mining Ltd. A November 2012 Airborne Survey noted a variety of features characteristic of gold bearing fields within the seven claims making up the property.
Initially, the Company plans to do extensive groundwork and rock sampling, once the current geological report is interpreted, Eventually, an NI-43-101 report will be commissioned to delineate the indicated and reserve figures.
The Company fully intends to explore financing and JV opportunities with potential partners within the Abitibi Greenstone Belt.
Gold Lakes plans to conduct extensive geophysical work and a minimum 2000 metre drill program once financing is secured. The Porcupine-Destor fault system is believed to run generally East-West through the Big Monty property with numerous North East-South West cross faults providing several possible intersecting structural features which could possibly host economic mineralization. 
The Abitibi Greenstone Belt area is also noteworthy for impressive grades:
•	Bonterra Resources north of Val D’or Quebec, Gladiator Project in a recent announcement generated a high-grade intersection of 137.4 g/t over 2.5 m with coarse visible gold having been observed in the core.
• Oban Mining Corporation in a recent announcement genereated 41.8 g/t Au Over 2.5 Metres at Windfall Lake gold project located in Urban Barry Township, Québec.
•	The Hislop mine reported 5.2 g/t of gold in ore. Hislop mine located in the prolific Timmins gold mining district, which lies within the Abitibi Greenstone Belt.
•	Macassa gold operations owned by Kirkland Lake Gold Inc., is part of one of Canada’s oldest and richest systems.  The Kirkland Lake Main Break system boasts production of 24 million troy ounces of gold over a span of 86 years and average historic grade of 16.5 g/t.

THUNDER   SOURCE: HELLO HERE IS THE NEWS YOU ASKED FOR:     $480,000        July 10, 2017 09:00 ET | Source: Gold Lakes Corp.   Beachwood, Ohio, July 10, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Gold Lakes Corp., (the “Company”) (OTC PINK: GLLK) an exploration stage Blue-Sky company that specializes in acquiring and developing mining assets today announced that it has retired all its convertible notes taken from July thru November 2016 thru issuances of shares in a strong effort to reenergize its balance sheet.    "With these transactions we have removed $480,000 of debt from the balance sheet, thus strengthening our financial position. This will be very important as we pursue additional funding opportunities and work towards uplisting back to the OTCQB Market," Mr. Vallos, CEO of Gold Lakes Corp concluded.    Going forward, the Company will try to avoid convertible notes at all costs, and we will be more judicious in any future financings. Over the past several months, Gold Lakes Corp has focused on reducing the debt exposure on its balance sheet and it is our goal to have all of these convertible notes extinguished from our balance sheet by the end of the year.    We have tightened our belts and will continue to run very lean, and once all of these notes are off our books, we can finally see a relief to the dilution that has plagued the stock for months. It is our goal to improve shareholder value, and we feel that the current price does not reflect the value of the company, and we are confident that our approach will result in a significant increase in our stock price in the future." states Christopher Vallos, President of Gold Lakes Corp.    Gold Lakes Corporation strategy is to identify and acquire prospective properties in well-mineralized mining areas and advancing these properties toward making new discoveries within the Abitibi Greenstone Belt.    About Gold Lakes Corp.: Gold Lakes Corp. is an exploration stage Blue Sky company that specializes in acquiring and developing mining assets. The Company primary asset is known as the "Big Monty" property, located in the prolific Abitibi Greenstone Belt region, in Ontario, Canada. The Big Monty property is bordered by producing gold mines and is situated within the Porcupine-Destor Fault Zone "PDFZ" and Larder Lake Cadillac Fault Zone.

Goldcorp Inc. is a gold production company headquartered in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The company employs about 15,800 people worldwide,[4] engaged in gold mining and related activities including exploration, extraction, processing and reclamation. Goldcorp’s operating assets include four mines in Canada, two mines in Mexico, and four in Central and South America.[citation needed] As of the third quarter of 2014, Goldcorp was the world's fourth-largest producer of gold.[5]
In June 2016, Goldcorp was named one of Corporate Knights magazine's Best 50 Corporate Citizens in Canada.[6] In the same year, the company was also ranked among Canada's Top 100 Employers. Goldcorp has repeatedly been accused of harming the environment, livestock, and public health in multiple studies by advocacy groups and activists, contaminating areas with toxic heavy metals by its mining activities. These allegations have been refuted by the company and none of these allegations have been proved in a court of law.[7] The company's track record around transparency, policies and practices has improved[8] since a damning 2010 study accused the company of human rights violations.

History[edit]
Goldcorp was officially incorporated in 1994. Following a period of M&A activity, the company quickly grew to become a leading gold producer. The company is focused on responsible mining practices with safe, low-cost production in areas of low political risk. Through the consistent application of its business strategy, Goldcorp has achieved significant growth, industry recognition, and numerous awards.
In 2000, Goldcorp founder Rob McEwen launched the Goldcorp Challenge, sharing with the public the company’s geological data with the offer of $575,000 in prizes to those who could help locate Red Lake mine’s next six million ounces of gold. The challenge was successful, with more than 110 sites identified and more than 80 per cent of sites yielding significant gold reserves. The challenge helped turn the company from a struggling enterprise into one of the most profitable in the industry.
In January 2017 Goldcorp announced it had divested two non-core assets through the sales of the Cerro Blanco Gold Project in Guatemala to Bluestone Resources[16] as well as the Los Filos Mine in Mexico to Leagold Mining.[17]
In January 2017 Goldcorp reported preliminary full year 2016 production totaling 2.873 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of around $850 per ounce. The Company expects to increase total annual gold production by over 20% over the next five years to more than three million ounces annually.[18]
In February 2017 Goldcorp announced it had purchased New Gold's 4% gold stream on the El Morro deposit. The El Morro deposit is part of NuevaUnión, a 50/50 joint venture with Teck Resources that combines the Relincho and El Morro deposits. [19]
Environmental impact[edit]
Goldcorp has been working to improve its approach to environmental stewardship. The company publicly reports on its environmental performance on an annual basis and has been a member of the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM) since 2009. The company’s El Sauzal mine in Mexico was also the first mine in the world to be successfully decommissioned in accordance with the International Cyanide Management Code (“ICMC”).
Despite this, the environmental, economic and human impact of the company’s Latin American mines has been a controversial topic for a number of years.
San Martin Mine, Honduras[edit]
A study by Italian activist Flaviano Bianchini in 2006 found dangerous levels of arsenic and lead in the blood of Hondurans living downstream from Goldcorp's San Martin mine, located in the Siria Valley.[20] While people living in the valley had equated their health problems with the mine's operations since it opened in 1999, both the company and the Honduran government disputed the study's findings. Honduran authorities, the company said, took water samples during three visits in 2008 and all pH measurements were normal. They also reviewed and approved the mine's closure plan.
In 2009, two studies commissioned by the UK-based advocacy group CAFOD have found the company's methods to extract gold from low-grade deposits also releases other toxic heavy metals such as arsenic, mercury and lead, contaminating streams and groundwater. The first study from Newcastle University detected acidic mine drainage, whereby sulphides in the rock are exposed to oxygen and water and produce sulphuric acid, which can have devastating effects on animals and plants. A follow-up study by the same university found evidence of "severe" contamination in the form of highly acidic and metal-rich water from the mine site flowing into a stream used by villagers for agriculture and domestic purposes.[21]
Since the closure of San Martin mine in 2008, the 1,500 hectare former mine site has been reclaimed into agricultural farmland and the former camp facilities remodeled into an ecotourism hotel. These developments have since provided employment, skills training and new investment to the area.
Marlin Mine, Guatemala[edit]
An investigative report by the CTV Television Network's W5, published on their website on April 17, 2010, reported criticism by human rights workers about the damage they believe mining companies were doing to the people, the land, and the culture of Guatemala.[22] The same news program ran a four-part documentary entitled "Paradise Lost" which explored some of the controversy surrounding Goldcorp's Marlin mine operation, and investigated the economic, environmental, and social costs and benefits of Canadian mining operations in Central America.[23]
At the request of Goldcorp shareholders, an independent human rights impact assessment (HRIA) was conducted by external auditors in 2010.[24] Goldcorp has since implemented all recommendations from the HIRA, including the publishing of an official Human Rights Policy in 2010.
On July 14–15, 2012 the self-organized International Peoples’ Health Tribunal, a panel of twelve "judges" with backgrounds in science, health, ecology, and human rights met in Guatemala to hear testimony relating to the effects of Goldcorp's South American mines. After the two-day tribunal, the panel found Goldcorp financially liable for health and ecological damages to the communities near its mines in Honduras, Guatemala, and Mexico.[25] As a "self organized" tribunal, the panel findings carry no legal bearing, however, the company did voluntarily secure financial bonds to ensure responsible closure.
The Marlin mine has since been lauded as a model of responsible mine closure and was named one of the 21 Most Socially Responsible Companies in Central America by El Economista (The Economist) Magazine.
Pueblo Viejo mining project, Dominican Republic[edit]
Pueblo Viejo mining project takes place in the Dominican Republic and is operated by Barrick Pueblo Viejo, a firm owned by Barrick Gold and Goldcorp.[26] 25 years of operation are scheduled for this project, which is likely to raise the exports of the Dominican Republic clearly.[26] The project is accused of having caused contamination and illegal logging.[27] The illegal logging has since been attributed to local village people. In 2012, Barrick Gold opened a water treatment plant that has since successfully rehabilitated the contaminated area.[28]

These allegations have been refuted by the company and none of these allegations have been proved in a court of law.[7] The company's track record around transparency, policies and practices has improved[8] since a damning 2010 study accused the company of human rights violations.

History[edit]
Goldcorp was officially incorporated in 1994. Following a period of M&A activity, the company quickly grew to become a leading gold producer. The company is focused on responsible mining practices with safe, low-cost production in areas of low political risk. Through the consistent application of its business strategy, Goldcorp has achieved significant growth, industry recognition, and numerous awards.
In 2000, Goldcorp founder Rob McEwen launched the Goldcorp Challenge, sharing with the public the company’s geological data with the offer of $575,000 in prizes to those who could help locate Red Lake mine’s next six million ounces of gold. The challenge was successful, with more than 110 sites identified and more than 80 per cent of sites yielding significant gold reserves. The challenge helped turn the company from a struggling enterprise into one of the most profitable in the industry.
In January 2017 Goldcorp announced it had divested two non-core assets through the sales of the Cerro Blanco Gold Project in Guatemala to Bluestone Resources[16] as well as the Los Filos Mine in Mexico to Leagold Mining.[17]
In January 2017 Goldcorp reported preliminary full year 2016 production totaling 2.873 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of around $850 per ounce. The Company expects to increase total annual gold production by over 20% over the next five years to more than three million ounces annually.[18]
In February 2017 Goldcorp announced it had purchased New Gold's 4% gold stream on the El Morro deposit. The El Morro deposit is part of NuevaUnión, a 50/50 joint venture with Teck Resources that combines the Relincho and El Morro deposits. [19]
Environmental impact[edit]
Goldcorp has been working to improve its approach to environmental stewardship. The company publicly reports on its environmental performance on an annual basis and has been a member of the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM) since 2009. The company’s El Sauzal mine in Mexico was also the first mine in the world to be successfully decommissioned in accordance with the International Cyanide Management Code (“ICMC”).
Despite this, the environmental, economic and human impact of the company’s Latin American mines has been a controversial topic for a number of years.
San Martin Mine, Honduras[edit]
A study by Italian activist Flaviano Bianchini in 2006 found dangerous levels of arsenic and lead in the blood of Hondurans living downstream from Goldcorp's San Martin mine, located in the Siria Valley.[20] While people living in the valley had equated their health problems with the mine's operations since it opened in 1999, both the company and the Honduran government disputed the study's findings. Honduran authorities, the company said, took water samples during three visits in 2008 and all pH measurements were normal. They also reviewed and approved the mine's closure plan.
In 2009, two studies commissioned by the UK-based advocacy group CAFOD have found the company's methods to extract gold from low-grade deposits also releases other toxic heavy metals such as arsenic, mercury and lead, contaminating streams and groundwater. The first study from Newcastle University detected acidic mine drainage, whereby sulphides in the rock are exposed to oxygen and water and produce sulphuric acid, which can have devastating effects on animals and plants. A follow-up study by the same university found evidence of "severe" contamination in the form of highly acidic and metal-rich water from the mine site flowing into a stream used by villagers for agriculture and domestic purposes.[21]
Since the closure of San Martin mine in 2008, the 1,500 hectare former mine site has been reclaimed into agricultural farmland and the former camp facilities remodeled into an ecotourism hotel. These developments have since provided employment, skills training and new investment to the area.
Marlin Mine, Guatemala[edit]
An investigative report by the CTV Television Network's W5, published on their website on April 17, 2010, reported criticism by human rights workers about the damage they believe mining companies were doing to the people, the land, and the culture of Guatemala.[22] The same news program ran a four-part documentary entitled "Paradise Lost" which explored some of the controversy surrounding Goldcorp's Marlin mine operation, and investigated the economic, environmental, and social costs and benefits of Canadian mining operations in Central America.[23]
At the request of Goldcorp shareholders, an independent human rights impact assessment (HRIA) was conducted by external auditors in 2010.[24] Goldcorp has since implemented all recommendations from the HIRA, including the publishing of an official Human Rights Policy in 2010.
On July 14–15, 2012 the self-organized International Peoples’ Health Tribunal, a panel of twelve "judges" with backgrounds in science, health, ecology, and human rights met in Guatemala to hear testimony relating to the effects of Goldcorp's South American mines. After the two-day tribunal, the panel found Goldcorp financially liable for health and ecological damages to the communities near its mines in Honduras, Guatemala, and Mexico.[25] As a "self organized" tribunal, the panel findings carry no legal bearing, however, the company did voluntarily secure financial bonds to ensure responsible closure.
The Marlin mine has since been lauded as a model of responsible mine closure and was named one of the 21 Most Socially Responsible Companies in Central America by El Economista (The Economist) Magazine.
Pueblo Viejo mining project, Dominican Republic[edit]
Pueblo Viejo mining project takes place in the Dominican Republic and is operated by Barrick Pueblo Viejo, a firm owned by Barrick Gold and Goldcorp.[26] 25 years of operation are scheduled for this project, which is likely to raise the exports of the Dominican Republic clearly.[26] The project is accused of having caused contamination and illegal logging.[27] The illegal logging has since been attributed to local village people. In 2012, Barrick Gold opened a water treatment plant that has since successfully rehabilitated the contaminated area.[28]

The challenge was successful, with more than 110 sites identified and more than 80 per cent of sites yielding significant gold reserves.

In January 2017 Goldcorp announced it had divested two non-core assets through the sales of the Cerro Blanco Gold Project in Guatemala to Bluestone Resources[16] as well as the Los Filos Mine in Mexico to Leagold Mining.[17]
In January 2017 Goldcorp reported preliminary full year 2016 production totaling 2.873 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of around $850 per ounce. The Company expects to increase total annual gold production by over 20% over the next five years to more than three million ounces annually.[18]
In February 2017 Goldcorp announced it had purchased New Gold's 4% gold stream on the El Morro deposit. The El Morro deposit is part of NuevaUnión, a 50/50 joint venture with Teck Resources that combines the Relincho and El Morro deposits. [19]
Environmental impact[edit]
Goldcorp has been working to improve its approach to environmental stewardship. The company publicly reports on its environmental performance on an annual basis and has been a member of the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM) since 2009. The company’s El Sauzal mine in Mexico was also the first mine in the world to be successfully decommissioned in accordance with the International Cyanide Management Code (“ICMC”).
Despite this, the environmental, economic and human impact of the company’s Latin American mines has been a controversial topic for a number of years.

An investigative report by the CTV Television Network's W5, published on their website on April 17, 2010, reported criticism by human rights workers about the damage they believe mining companies were doing to the people, the land, and the culture of Guatemala.[22] The same news program ran a four-part documentary entitled "Paradise Lost" which explored some of the controversy surrounding Goldcorp's Marlin mine operation, and investigated the economic, environmental, and social costs and benefits of Canadian mining operations in Central America.[23]

Pueblo Viejo mining project takes place in the Dominican Republic and is operated by Barrick Pueblo Viejo, a firm owned by Barrick Gold and Goldcorp.[26] 25 years of operation are scheduled for this project, which is likely to raise the exports of the Dominican Republic clearly.[26] The project is accused of having caused contamination and illegal logging.[27] The illegal logging has since been attributed to local village people. In 2012, Barrick Gold opened a water treatment plant that has since successfully rehabilitated the contaminated area.[28]

Goldcorp Inc. is a gold production company headquartered in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The company employs about 15,800 people worldwide,[4] engaged in gold mining and related activities including exploration, extraction, processing and reclamation. Goldcorp’s operating assets include four mines in Canada, two mines in Mexico, and four in Central and South America.[citation needed] As of the third quarter of 2014, Goldcorp was the world's fourth-largest producer of gold.[5]
In June 2016, Goldcorp was named one of Corporate Knights magazine's Best 50 Corporate Citizens in Canada.[6] In the same year, the company was also ranked among Canada's Top 100 Employers. Goldcorp has repeatedly been accused of harming the environment, livestock, and public health in multiple studies by advocacy groups and activists, contaminating areas with toxic heavy metals by its mining activities. These allegations have been refuted by the company and none of these allegations have been proved in a court of law.[7] The company's track record around transparency, policies and practices has improved[8] since a damning 2010 study accused the company of human rights violations.

[9]
In April 2017 Goldcorp closed on the sale of its Los Filos gold mine Guerrero State, Mexico to Leagold Mining for US$350 million. The transaction included US$279 million in cash and $71 million in common shares of Leadgold. Goldcorp also nominated Russell Ball the Leagold's board of directors. [10]

History[edit]
Goldcorp was officially incorporated in 1994. Following a period of M&A activity, the company quickly grew to become a leading gold producer. The company is focused on responsible mining practices with safe, low-cost production in areas of low political risk. Through the consistent application of its business strategy, Goldcorp has achieved significant growth, industry recognition, and numerous awards.
In 2000, Goldcorp founder Rob McEwen launched the Goldcorp Challenge, sharing with the public the company’s geological data with the offer of $575,000 in prizes to those who could help locate Red Lake mine’s next six million ounces of gold. The challenge was successful, with more than 110 sites identified and more than 80 per cent of sites yielding significant gold reserves. The challenge helped turn the company from a struggling enterprise into one of the most profitable in the industry.
In January 2017 Goldcorp announced it had divested two non-core assets through the sales of the Cerro Blanco Gold Project in Guatemala to Bluestone Resources[16] as well as the Los Filos Mine in Mexico to Leagold Mining.[17]
In January 2017 Goldcorp reported preliminary full year 2016 production totaling 2.873 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of around $850 per ounce. The Company expects to increase total annual gold production by over 20% over the next five years to more than three million ounces annually.[18]
In February 2017 Goldcorp announced it had purchased New Gold's 4% gold stream on the El Morro deposit. The El Morro deposit is part of NuevaUnión, a 50/50 joint venture with Teck Resources that combines the Relincho and El Morro deposits. [19]
Environmental impact[edit]
Goldcorp has been working to improve its approach to environmental stewardship. The company publicly reports on its environmental performance on an annual basis and has been a member of the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM) since 2009. The company’s El Sauzal mine in Mexico was also the first mine in the world to be successfully decommissioned in accordance with the International Cyanide Management Code (“ICMC”).
Despite this, the environmental, economic and human impact of the company’s Latin American mines has been a controversial topic for a number of years.
San Martin Mine, Honduras[edit]
A study by Italian activist Flaviano Bianchini in 2006 found dangerous levels of arsenic and lead in the blood of Hondurans living downstream from Goldcorp's San Martin mine, located in the Siria Valley.[20] While people living in the valley had equated their health problems with the mine's operations since it opened in 1999, both the company and the Honduran government disputed the study's findings. Honduran authorities, the company said, took water samples during three visits in 2008 and all pH measurements were normal. They also reviewed and approved the mine's closure plan.
In 2009, two studies commissioned by the UK-based advocacy group CAFOD have found the company's methods to extract gold from low-grade deposits also releases other toxic heavy metals such as arsenic, mercury and lead, contaminating streams and groundwater. The first study from Newcastle University detected acidic mine drainage, whereby sulphides in the rock are exposed to oxygen and water and produce sulphuric acid, which can have devastating effects on animals and plants. A follow-up study by the same university found evidence of "severe" contamination in the form of highly acidic and metal-rich water from the mine site flowing into a stream used by villagers for agriculture and domestic purposes.[21]
Since the closure of San Martin mine in 2008, the 1,500 hectare former mine site has been reclaimed into agricultural farmland and the former camp facilities remodeled into an ecotourism hotel. These developments have since provided employment, skills training and new investment to the area.
Marlin Mine, Guatemala[edit]
An investigative report by the CTV Television Network's W5, published on their website on April 17, 2010, reported criticism by human rights workers about the damage they believe mining companies were doing to the people, the land, and the culture of Guatemala.[22] The same news program ran a four-part documentary entitled "Paradise Lost" which explored some of the controversy surrounding Goldcorp's Marlin mine operation, and investigated the economic, environmental, and social costs and benefits of Canadian mining operations in Central America.[23]
At the request of Goldcorp shareholders, an independent human rights impact assessment (HRIA) was conducted by external auditors in 2010.[24] Goldcorp has since implemented all recommendations from the HIRA, including the publishing of an official Human Rights Policy in 2010.
On July 14–15, 2012 the self-organized International Peoples’ Health Tribunal, a panel of twelve "judges" with backgrounds in science, health, ecology, and human rights met in Guatemala to hear testimony relating to the effects of Goldcorp's South American mines. After the two-day tribunal, the panel found Goldcorp financially liable for health and ecological damages to the communities near its mines in Honduras, Guatemala, and Mexico.[25] As a "self organized" tribunal, the panel findings carry no legal bearing, however, the company did voluntarily secure financial bonds to ensure responsible closure.
The Marlin mine has since been lauded as a model of responsible mine closure and was named one of the 21 Most Socially Responsible Companies in Central America by El Economista (The Economist) Magazine.
Pueblo Viejo mining project, Dominican Republic[edit]
Pueblo Viejo mining project takes place in the Dominican Republic and is operated by Barrick Pueblo Viejo, a firm owned by Barrick Gold and Goldcorp.[26] 25 years of operation are scheduled for this project, which is likely to raise the exports of the Dominican Republic clearly.[26] The project is accused of having caused contamination and illegal logging.[27] The illegal logging has since been attributed to local village people. In 2012, Barrick Gold opened a water treatment plant that has since successfully rehabilitated the contaminated area.[28]

Goldcorp has been working to improve its approach to environmental stewardship. The company publicly reports on its environmental performance on an annual basis and has been a member of the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM) since 2009. The company’s El Sauzal mine in Mexico was also the first mine in the world to be successfully decommissioned in accordance with the International Cyanide Management Code (“ICMC”).
Despite this, the environmental, economic and human impact of the company’s Latin American mines has been a controversial topic for a number of years.
San Martin Mine, Honduras[edit]
A study by Italian activist Flaviano Bianchini in 2006 found dangerous levels of arsenic and lead in the blood of Hondurans living downstream from Goldcorp's San Martin mine, located in the Siria Valley.[20] While people living in the valley had equated their health problems with the mine's operations since it opened in 1999, both the company and the Honduran government disputed the study's findings. Honduran authorities, the company said, took water samples during three visits in 2008 and all pH measurements were normal. They also reviewed and approved the mine's closure plan.
In 2009, two studies commissioned by the UK-based advocacy group CAFOD have found the company's methods to extract gold from low-grade deposits also releases other toxic heavy metals such as arsenic, mercury and lead, contaminating streams and groundwater. The first study from Newcastle University detected acidic mine drainage, whereby sulphides in the rock are exposed to oxygen and water and produce sulphuric acid, which can have devastating effects on animals and plants. A follow-up study by the same university found evidence of "severe" contamination in the form of highly acidic and metal-rich water from the mine site flowing into a stream used by villagers for agriculture and domestic purposes.[21]
Since the closure of San Martin mine in 2008, the 1,500 hectare former mine site has been reclaimed into agricultural farmland and the former camp facilities remodeled into an ecotourism hotel. These developments have since provided employment, skills training and new investment to the area.
Marlin Mine, Guatemala[edit]
An investigative report by the CTV Television Network's W5, published on their website on April 17, 2010, reported criticism by human rights workers about the damage they believe mining companies were doing to the people, the land, and the culture of Guatemala.[22] The same news program ran a four-part documentary entitled "Paradise Lost" which explored some of the controversy surrounding Goldcorp's Marlin mine operation, and investigated the economic, environmental, and social costs and benefits of Canadian mining operations in Central America.[23]
At the request of Goldcorp shareholders, an independent human rights impact assessment (HRIA) was conducted by external auditors in 2010.[24] Goldcorp has since implemented all recommendations from the HIRA, including the publishing of an official Human Rights Policy in 2010.
On July 14–15, 2012 the self-organized International Peoples’ Health Tribunal, a panel of twelve "judges" with backgrounds in science, health, ecology, and human rights met in Guatemala to hear testimony relating to the effects of Goldcorp's South American mines. After the two-day tribunal, the panel found Goldcorp financially liable for health and ecological damages to the communities near its mines in Honduras, Guatemala, and Mexico.[25] As a "self organized" tribunal, the panel findings carry no legal bearing, however, the company did voluntarily secure financial bonds to ensure responsible closure.
The Marlin mine has since been lauded as a model of responsible mine closure and was named one of the 21 Most Socially Responsible Companies in Central America by El Economista (The Economist) Magazine.
Pueblo Viejo mining project, Dominican Republic[edit]
Pueblo Viejo mining project takes place in the Dominican Republic and is operated by Barrick Pueblo Viejo, a firm owned by Barrick Gold and Goldcorp.[26] 25 years of operation are scheduled for this project, which is likely to raise the exports of the Dominican Republic clearly.[26] The project is accused of having caused contamination and illegal logging.[27] The illegal logging has since been attributed to local village people. In 2012, Barrick Gold opened a water treatment plant that has since successfully rehabilitated the contaminated area.[28]
