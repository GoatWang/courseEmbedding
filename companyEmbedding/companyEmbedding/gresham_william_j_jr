Prior to 1980, Mr. Gresham served as President of Gresham Realty Company, an office leasing and management company, which he founded in October 1969. From 1987 to 1990, Mr. Gresham served as a member of the Georgia House of Representatives and, from 1990 to 2007, on the Board of the Georgia Department of Transportation where he served as Chairman of the Board for two separate terms. He currently serves on the Boards of Directors for Bank of North Georgia, the Cobb Galleria Authority and the Georgia Sports Hall of Fame, and has served on the Board of Directors of Healthdyne, Inc., as well as the Georgia Tech Advisory Board and the Georgia Tech Industrial Management Board. Mr. Gresham has also served in leadership positions for numerous other civic organizations. Mr. Gresham received his bachelor's degree in industrial management from Georgia Institute of Technology.
We believe Mr. Gresham's extensive experience in commercial real estate, his experience as a legislator in Georgia and his experience with the Georgia Department of Transportation, including as the chairman, make him well qualified to serve as a member of our Board.
