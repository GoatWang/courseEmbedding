Reminder - Hudson Global (HSON) Goes Ex-Dividend Soon
Looking at the universe of stocks we cover at Dividend Channel, on 6/10/16, Hudson Global Inc will trade ex-dividend, for its quarterly dividend of $0.05, payable on 6/24/16. As a percentage of HSON's recent stock price of $2.19, this dividend works out to approximately 2.28%, so look for shares of Hudson Global Inc to trade 2.28% lower — all else being equal — when HSON shares open for trading on 6/10/16.

History[edit]
Hudson Global, Inc. was originally spun off as Hudson Highland Group (NASDAQ : HHGP) on March 31, 2003,[4] from the former eResourcing and Executive Search business units of TMP Worldwide Inc. - a human capital provider.
On April 26, 2012, Hudson announced a corporate name change to Hudson Global, Inc. and company's shares began trading in NASDAQ, under its new symbol "HSON" from April 30, 2012.[3]
Hudson was founded in 2003 and was previously part of the TMP Worldwide Group. In 1999, TMP Worldwide Group engaged in an unprecedented period of strategic acquisition, buying 67 specialist recruitment companies worldwide to become one of the largest staffing companies in the world. The recruitment division of TMP Worldwide Group de-merged from the wider business on 1 April 2003 to form Hudson Global Resources, and on the 1 January 2004 Hudson Global Resources Ltd re-branded as Hudson to provide a single brand identity with which to approach the market. However the legacy of the business can be traced back to 1967.
Organization and operations[edit]
Hudson operates in 12 countries with three geographic business segments:[6]

Hudson Americas (based in New York City)
Hudson Asia Pacific (based in Sydney)
Hudson Europe (based in London )

Services[edit]
In recent years, Hudson has made efforts to establish a reputation as more than just a recruiter and cement itself as a company thats offers end to end talent solutions.
As such, they now also focus on everything from specialised professional staffing and interim management to recruitment process outsourcing and talent management services.
In various blog articles and press releases, the company has claimed this move is in response to the changing nature of the global workplace and workforce - something they have since dubbed the new world of work.
Hudson operates in a wide range of industries, including Banking and Financial Services, Sales and Marketing, IT, Pharmaceuticals and more.
Hudson delivers enterprise as well as smaller scale assignments to businesses operating in many industries. Its services focus on providing specialized professional staffing, interim management and recruitment process outsourcing, related project management, management consulting and talent management services.[2]

History[edit]
Hudson Global, Inc. was originally spun off as Hudson Highland Group (NASDAQ : HHGP) on March 31, 2003,[4] from the former eResourcing and Executive Search business units of TMP Worldwide Inc. - a human capital provider.
On April 26, 2012, Hudson announced a corporate name change to Hudson Global, Inc. and company's shares began trading in NASDAQ, under its new symbol "HSON" from April 30, 2012.[3]
Hudson was founded in 2003 and was previously part of the TMP Worldwide Group. In 1999, TMP Worldwide Group engaged in an unprecedented period of strategic acquisition, buying 67 specialist recruitment companies worldwide to become one of the largest staffing companies in the world. The recruitment division of TMP Worldwide Group de-merged from the wider business on 1 April 2003 to form Hudson Global Resources, and on the 1 January 2004 Hudson Global Resources Ltd re-branded as Hudson to provide a single brand identity with which to approach the market. However the legacy of the business can be traced back to 1967.
Organization and operations[edit]
Hudson operates in 12 countries with three geographic business segments:[6]

Hudson Americas (based in New York City)
Hudson Asia Pacific (based in Sydney)
Hudson Europe (based in London )

Services[edit]
In recent years, Hudson has made efforts to establish a reputation as more than just a recruiter and cement itself as a company thats offers end to end talent solutions.
As such, they now also focus on everything from specialised professional staffing and interim management to recruitment process outsourcing and talent management services.
In various blog articles and press releases, the company has claimed this move is in response to the changing nature of the global workplace and workforce - something they have since dubbed the new world of work.
Hudson operates in a wide range of industries, including Banking and Financial Services, Sales and Marketing, IT, Pharmaceuticals and more.
Hudson delivers enterprise as well as smaller scale assignments to businesses operating in many industries. Its services focus on providing specialized professional staffing, interim management and recruitment process outsourcing, related project management, management consulting and talent management services.[2]

History[edit]
Hudson Global, Inc. was originally spun off as Hudson Highland Group (NASDAQ : HHGP) on March 31, 2003,[4] from the former eResourcing and Executive Search business units of TMP Worldwide Inc. - a human capital provider.
On April 26, 2012, Hudson announced a corporate name change to Hudson Global, Inc. and company's shares began trading in NASDAQ, under its new symbol "HSON" from April 30, 2012.[3]
Hudson was founded in 2003 and was previously part of the TMP Worldwide Group. In 1999, TMP Worldwide Group engaged in an unprecedented period of strategic acquisition, buying 67 specialist recruitment companies worldwide to become one of the largest staffing companies in the world. The recruitment division of TMP Worldwide Group de-merged from the wider business on 1 April 2003 to form Hudson Global Resources, and on the 1 January 2004 Hudson Global Resources Ltd re-branded as Hudson to provide a single brand identity with which to approach the market. However the legacy of the business can be traced back to 1967.
Organization and operations[edit]
Hudson operates in 12 countries with three geographic business segments:[6]

Hudson Americas (based in New York City)
Hudson Asia Pacific (based in Sydney)
Hudson Europe (based in London )

Services[edit]
In recent years, Hudson has made efforts to establish a reputation as more than just a recruiter and cement itself as a company thats offers end to end talent solutions.
As such, they now also focus on everything from specialised professional staffing and interim management to recruitment process outsourcing and talent management services.
In various blog articles and press releases, the company has claimed this move is in response to the changing nature of the global workplace and workforce - something they have since dubbed the new world of work.
Hudson operates in a wide range of industries, including Banking and Financial Services, Sales and Marketing, IT, Pharmaceuticals and more.
Hudson delivers enterprise as well as smaller scale assignments to businesses operating in many industries. Its services focus on providing specialized professional staffing, interim management and recruitment process outsourcing, related project management, management consulting and talent management services.[2]

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
