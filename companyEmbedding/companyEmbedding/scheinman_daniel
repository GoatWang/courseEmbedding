Senior Vice President and General Manager, Cisco Systems, Inc.




Daniel Scheinman, Senior Vice President and General Manager of the Cisco Media Solutions Group, is responsible for developing and marketing infrastructure products that help digital media content owners improve the content experience for consumers. In this role, he reports directly to Cisco’s Chairman and CEO John Chambers.
Scheinman has been with Cisco since 1992 and previously led Corporate Development, overseeing the merger and acquisition, venture investment, strategic alliance, and technology incubation functions within Cisco. Under his leadership, Corporate Development helped define how the network can serve as an innovation platform in emerging markets such as India and China. The group also completed more than 40 acquisitions, including Linksys and Scientific Atlanta. These acquisitions, in addition to Cisco’s partnering and internal engineering efforts, have positioned the Cisco Media Solutions Group as a valuable partner to companies navigating the digital disruption of the media and entertainment industry.
Scheinman has been a long-time champion for developing new, network-based distribution models for digital content. One example of Scheinman’s sponsorship is [email protected], an online portal launched in 2000 with multi-media information on Cisco’s opinion, strategy and news. To better serve the three million annual visitors to [email protected], Dan oversaw the development of technology that became the basis for Cisco’s Digital Media Management business unit (DMMBU) launched in 2006 as part of Cisco’s Emerging Technologies Group.
Prior to assuming the role of Senior Vice President of Corporate Development in 2001, Scheinman was the general counsel at Cisco. He holds a doctor of jurisprudence degree from Duke University Law School and a political science degree from Brandeis University.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/28/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Biography of Daniel Scheinman


Daniel Scheinman, Senior Vice President and General Manager of the Cisco Media Solutions Group, is responsible for developing and marketing infrastructure products that help digital media content owners improve the content experience for consumers. In this role, he reports directly to Cisco’s Chairman and CEO John Chambers.Scheinman has been with Cisco since 1992 and previously led Corporate Development, overseeing the merger and acquisition, venture investment, strategic alliance, and technology incubation functions within Cisco. Under his leadership, Corporate Development helped define how the network can serve as an innovation platform in emerging markets such as India and China. The group also completed more than 40 acquisitions, including Linksys and Scientific Atlanta. These acquisitions, in addition to Cisco’s partnering and internal engineering efforts, have positioned the Cisco Media Solutions Group as a valuable partner to companies navigating the digital disruption of the media and entertainment industry.Scheinman has been a long-time champion for developing new, network-based distribution models for digital content. One example of Scheinman’s sponsorship is News@Cisco, an online portal launched in 2000 with multi-media information on Cisco’s opinion, strategy and news. To better serve the three million annual visitors to News@Cisco, Dan oversaw the development of technology that became the basis for Cisco’s Digital Media Management business unit (DMMBU) launched in 2006 as part of Cisco’s Emerging Technologies Group.Prior to assuming the role of Senior Vice President of Corporate Development in 2001, Scheinman was the general counsel at Cisco. He holds a doctor of jurisprudence degree from Duke University Law School and a political science degree from Brandeis University.

Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results.

Daniel Scheinman, Senior Vice President and General Manager of the Cisco Media Solutions Group, is responsible for developing and marketing infrastructure products that help digital media content owners improve the content experience for consumers. In this role, he reports directly to Cisco™s Chairman and CEO John Chambers.
Scheinman has been with Cisco since 1992 and previously led Corporate Development, overseeing the merger and acquisition, venture investment, strategic alliance, and technology incubation functions within Cisco. Under his leadership, Corporate Development helped define how the network can serve as an innovation platform in emerging markets such as India and China. The group also completed more than 40 acquisitions, including Linksys and Scientific Atlanta. These acquisitions, in addition to Cisco™s partnering and internal engineering efforts, have positioned the Cisco Media Solutions Group as a valuable partner to companies navigating the digital disruption of the media and entertainment industry.
Scheinman has been a long-time champion for developing new, network-based distribution models for digital content. One example of Scheinman™s sponsorship is News@Cisco, an online portal launched in 2000 with multi-media information on Cisco™s opinion, strategy and news. To better serve the three million annual visitors to News@Cisco, Dan oversaw the development of technology that became the basis for Cisco™s Digital Media Management business unit (DMMBU) launched in 2006 as part of Cisco™s Emerging Technologies Group.
Prior to assuming the role of Senior Vice President of Corporate Development in 2001, Scheinman was the general counsel at Cisco. He holds a doctor of jurisprudence degree from Duke University Law School and a political science degree from Brandeis University.
