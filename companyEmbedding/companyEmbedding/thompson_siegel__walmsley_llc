Thompson, Siegel and Walmsley's (TSW)'s experienced team of investment professionals and operations teams
 











We see ourselves differently



            Like other investment firms, we've attracted some of the smartest and best people in the business. 
            Unlike others, we keep them for a long time. No bouncing from one firm to another.
        

            Why?
        

            We value them. We encourage them to think independently. Our culture is one of intellectual rigor and 
            competition; but competition in a friendly, collegial way. When our client succeeds, we all succeed.

Read this important information
Performance represents average annual total returns, assumes the reinvestment of all distributions and reflects applicable sales charges. Total returns reflect a waiver of part of each Fund’s fees for certain periods since inception, without which returns would have been lower. Average annual total returns illustrate the annual compounded returns that would have produced the cumulative total return if each Fund’s performance had remained constant throughout the period indicated. Returns for periods less than one year are not annualized.
Expense Ratios
Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus. The difference between gross and net operating expenses reflects contractual fee waivers. Please see the Fund's prospectus for more detail. Expense ratios for Nationwide Bond Fund, Nationwide Government Bond Fund, Nationwide HighMark Bond Fund, Nationwide HighMark Small Cap Core Fund and Nationwide U.S. Small Cap Value Fund have been restated to reflect the reduction of contractual advisory fees effective May 1, 2017. The difference between gross and net operating expenses reflects contractual expense waivers in place through February 28, 2018 for all Funds except, Nationwide Loomis All Cap Growth Fund with waivers in place through February 28, 2019. Please see the Fund's prospectus for more details.

Morningstar Ratings disclosure
Morningstar Ratings reflect risk-adjusted performance. The Morningstar RatingTM is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with the Fund's 3-, 5- and 10-year (if applicable) periods.
Morningstar Ratings metrics. Morningstar Ratings are based solely on a proprietary mathematical formula based on measures of risk and performance that it recalculates each month. The ratings formula measures the amount of variation in a fund's or ETF’s monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads and redemption fees) emphasizing downward variations and rewarding consistency. Ratings are subject to change every month. The top 10% of funds and ETFs in the category receive 5 stars; the next 22.5%, 4 stars; the next 35%, 3 stars; the next 22.5%, 2 stars; and the bottom 10%, 1 star. As of November 1, 2016, Morningstar will no longer provide ratings for load-adjusted share classes.
Ratings are based on specific class performance of each fund. Ratings are based on specific class performance of each fund. Current fund performance may be higher or lower, which may change a fund’s star rating. Despite high ratings, funds may have experienced negative performance during the period. Performance may reflect a waiver of part of a fund’s fees for certain periods since inception, without which returns would have been lower.
Ratings (with load) reflect class-specific sales charges, if any. A class share ratings no longer reflect sales charges. As of November 1, 2016, Morningstar will no longer provide ratings for load-adjusted share classes.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
