P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades.

About


Company Profile




Enterprise Grade VideoQumu (NASDAQ: QUMU) got its start in the late 1990s as a video media publishing company. Back then, our founders saw two critical needs converging among our clients. First, they simply couldn’t get enough of the power video brought to business communications and learning. Second, they wanted to deliver it—reliably and securely, live and on demand—over their existing computer networks, which weren’t built to handle video.
Today, Qumu helps many of the world’s largest companies realize the value of putting video to work for their digital workforce.
They use our software to create, manage and share video. Live, streaming and on demand, we turn video into an always-on resource, connecting thousands of stakeholders across a single enterprise.
Qumu’s mobile apps and other tools make video capture and creation easy. But the real magic goes on behind the scenes. Our enterprise-grade, video delivery and content management hub brings everything together—one centralized, pivotal video solution that scales as the digital revolution builds momentum in your enterprise.

Video is in our DNA




Video expertsOur passion is video. We became a technology company purely out of a need to provide a better enterprise video solution for our clients, early believers in the power of video.
Even now, our deep expertise in networking and software technology has one purpose: making video a lot less technical and much more powerful for you.





Enterprise provenWhat do you learn from more than a decade of working with the world’s largest companies? Every project is different. Cookie cutter doesn’t cut it.
Consultation begins the minute you contact us and we understand that this isn’t an over-the-phone decision. If we’re not the right fit, you’ll hear it from us first.





Software excellenceQumu’s Qx is a highly open and extensible enterprise video architecture, allows you to make better use of your existing systems across your networks.
Across VDI, mobile, video conferencing hardware, unified communications software and more—in the cloud or behind the firewall, Qumu delivers a quality and seamless video experience across your enterprise.





Mobile mindsetWe build every solution with mobile in mind because the digital workforce is increasingly consuming and creating video on mobile devices.
Mobile users need seamless access and performance and we bring the same attention to security and management you’d expect from Qumu.
