About Mike Gallagher | The Gallagher Law Firm, Houston, TX



























































 (888) 222-7052 2905 Sackett St.Houston, TX 77098 









 














Mike Gallagher's Bio


 
 











Mike Gallagher began his legal career as an insurance defense lawyer at Fulbright & Jaworski. After five years and a vast amount of trial experience, he joined the firm of Fisher, Roch, Blackstock, McClendon & Gallagher.
Litigation
For most of his legal career, Mike Gallagher has handled general products litigation, such as oil field explosions, aviation, and rollovers.
Legislative Leader
A tireless and influential advocate for individual rights, he has been quoted as saying, “A lawyer’s obligation to his client does not stop in the courtroom. It continues on through the legislative process.” He admirably supports his statements with action, having just returned from Austin, TX where he fights aggressively against additional devastating intrusions on individual rights. It’s a hard fight, since the opposition is financed by some of the wealthiest corporations and individuals in the State of Texas. He receives no compensation for his time or his expenses, nor does he believe he should. He is backed by his own commitment.
Texas Governor, Rick Perry, recently called Mike Gallagher “an honorable man” and even most of his opponents would admit a grudging respect for this adversary. 
Memberships & Associations
Mike Gallagher is a past president of Texas Trial Lawyers Association, Fellow of the American College of Trial Lawyers, member of the International Society of Barristers, American Board of Trial Advocates, and International Society of Trial Lawyers. He has also served on numerous House, Senate, and Supreme Court committees — at both the state and national levels — on selection, compensation and tenure of judges, disciplinary procedures, workers compensation, oversight, and higher education.
The Gallagher Law Firm
The Gallagher Law firm makes a commitment to the success of their clients and understand that a successful outcome can come in many forms. Mr. Gallagher works with clients to understand their unique scenarios and include a group of medical consultants and support staff to ensure nothing is left to chance.

(more...)An extraordinary and unexpected natural event, such as a hurricane, tornado, earthquake or even the sudden death of a person. An act of God may be a defense against liability for injuries or damages. Under the law of contracts, an act of God often serves as a valid excuse if one of the parties to the contract is unable to fulfill his or her duties -- for instance, completing a construction project on time.
