Raymond James

 


The right advice
starts with a trusted relationship. 


We believe financial advice is about more than just having a plan. It’s about having the right plan for you. And that only happens with a true understanding of your whole life, beyond just your finances. Because as your needs become more complex, sophisticated advice and a relationship built for the long term become even more important.

What Makes Us Different




Why a Raymond James Advisor
Trust builds from an understanding of what’s most important to you. And with a relationship that deepens over time. When you work with a Raymond James advisor, your plan is individual. Personal. And built for the long term. Each advisor is empowered with the latest technology so you get the information you need, when you need it, from virtually anywhere. From tracking all of your accounts in one secure place to access to industry-leading research, it all starts right here.

About Raymond James
Our deliberate nature and thoughtful approach to financial planning have led to a history of strength and steady, stable growth. Our company’s conservative approach began in 1962 when Robert James put the word “Investments” after his name. And since then, Raymond James advisors have been crafting meticulously tailored, holistic financial plans to help ensure their clients can retire and realize their individual financial goals.

About Raymond James

 


Our "about us"
is really about you.

We have always been a different kind of financial services firm, embracing long-term planning, valuing methodical decision-making and remaining focused on what matters most: You.













About Us 


When Bob James founded Raymond James, he did so based on a belief that clients deserved more than help with investment decisions, they needed advice that considered their entire financial picture.
Today, that client-focused approach has extended to serve more than 3 million client accounts through 7,200 financial advisors in the United States, Canada and overseas. Further, the company has expanded through the years to serve corporations, institutions and municipalities through significant capital markets, banking and asset management services.


No matter the business, we believe if we do what’s right for clients,
we’ll help them achieve success while also realizing our own.
It’s that simple.

It starts by being personal.
Your relationship with a Raymond James advisor begins with a meaningful conversation – about you. Your goals, your wants, your needs, your concerns, your family, your passion, your vision for the future. It’s about working together to understand the strategies and services that will give you the optimal chance to fulfill your objectives – to live the life you want.
Next, you and your advisor will develop a comprehensive plan.
 Just like you, your plan is unique. It will be customized to help you reach major milestones – the ones you know are coming, and perhaps a few you haven’t considered yet. With comprehensive, institutional-quality resources, your advisor can provide a wide array of wealth management services, from investment strategies backed by award-winning research to estate planning vehicles that ensure your wishes are carried out exactly as you intend.
In implementing the plan, your advisor will work in collaboration with other professionals, such as attorneys and accountants, to assure your financial plan is holistic – all aspects working together. Through Investor Access, you will have online access to up-to-date account information, all while your accounts and information are protected by cybersecurity technology that goes well beyond the industry standard.
Through the years, your plan will evolve with you.
 The relationship with your advisor will grow deeper as you monitor the progress of your investments and review your strategy. Life events might require adjustments. Whatever the need, whatever phase of life you are in, your advisor will see you through.

Working with a Raymond James advisor means you have more than a financial planner. 
You have a trusted financial partner – for life.

About Raymond James

 


Our "about us"
is really about you.

We have always been a different kind of financial services firm, embracing long-term planning, valuing methodical decision-making and remaining focused on what matters most: You.













About Us 


When Bob James founded Raymond James, he did so based on a belief that clients deserved more than help with investment decisions, they needed advice that considered their entire financial picture.
Today, that client-focused approach has extended to serve more than 3 million client accounts through 7,200 financial advisors in the United States, Canada and overseas. Further, the company has expanded through the years to serve corporations, institutions and municipalities through significant capital markets, banking and asset management services.


No matter the business, we believe if we do what’s right for clients,
we’ll help them achieve success while also realizing our own.
It’s that simple.

Raymond James Products and Services

TFCU Financial Advisors is small enough to give you the personal attention you deserve, while our advisors can offer the full array of products and services of a large firm, through our broker/dealer, Raymond James Financial Services. It's the best of both worlds!



 Financial Planning/Insurance and Investment Analysis 




Realizing the investment goals and insurance needs of each client are unique and those needs change over the years, we like to start our relationship with new clients by providing a free insurance and investment analysis. Or, we can provide a more in-depth, personal financial plan that shows you the probability of reaching your financial goals and what it will take to get there.For the federal employees among TFCU's membership, we have a Chartered Federal Employee Benefits Consultant on staff, who can provide a free benefits analysis and explain retirement options. 





Securities/Investments 





The focus of our Raymond James Financial Advisors is to help you build personal wealth. We offer mutual funds from dozens of mutual fund families, as well as stocks, bonds, and annuities.  The investments can be held in several different account types, such as Traditional IRA's, Roth IRA's, 401(k)'s, SEP IRA's, individual accounts, joint accounts, trust accounts, etc.We also offer education savings alternatives, such as 529 Plans, Coverdell Education Savings accounts, UTMA.s, etc.



Insurance 




Our insurance representative can help you determine if your insurance coverage is adequate for your current life stage.  Being over-insured wastes your hard-earned money, but being under-insured can jeopardize your or your family's future financial freedom.  Frequently, insurance policies are misunderstood and do not provide adequate coverage.  We offer life, health, long-term care, disability and Medicare supplement policies.



Financial Education 




We also provide ongoing financial education through free seminars and articles on our Web site.  Our clients have excellent research tools available to them through Raymond James, as well.



Small Business Services 




Small business owners may be interested in speaking with one of our investment representatives to develop a benefit plan for their employees that includes insurance and/or an employer sponsored retirement plan.  For their employees, we can provide on-site educational seminars and luncheons, as well as individual investment and insurance consultations.
