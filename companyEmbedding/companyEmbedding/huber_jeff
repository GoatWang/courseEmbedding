This Exec May Have The Hardest Job At Google, And His Colleagues Are Tired Of Seeing Him Get Trashed In The Press

GoogleLet's return to the case of Jeff Huber, Google's senior vice president of Geo and Commerce.
Last week, we published a story headlined: "Depending On Whom You Ask, This Google Exec Is Either 'Weak' Or He Just Drew The Short Straw."
The story posed this question: Is Huber, as one source told us, the "weakest and least respected member" on Google CEO Larry Page's staff – OR – has Huber unfairly earned that reputation over the past year because he took on a difficult and sometimes messy job, making some talkative enemies in the process?
In the week since, we've spoken to several senior sources at Google, and it's become clear that in the perspective of these long-time executives the answer is the latter. 
Their view is that Huber is a top-notch Google executive who asked for the hardest challenge his boss could give him and he got it – in the form of nascent, unproven products and an executive reporting to him that ended up being vastly under-qualified for her job.
This is the story those sources told us. Google declined to comment. We were unable to reach Huber.

About Huber, Jeff
Gallery


After finishing his own diving career highlighted with Big Ten finals, U.S. National Championships, and U.S. Olympic Trials, Jeff Huber used his talent and ability past his own athletic career to teach and mentor many of the U.S. and world’s best divers. Coaching at the collegiate level for 33 years, he has created a name for himself in the sport, as well as the programs and teams he has been a part of.
The Dynasty of Indiana Diving
Coach Huber joined the Indiana University men’s and women’s swimming and diving team 20 years ago, and has since helped grow the program into a Division I and Big Ten powerhouse.
Since coming to Bloomington, Indiana to lead the Hoosiers, divers have acquired 35 Big-Ten titles and 17 have been named the conference’s highest honor as Big Ten Diver of the Year. The accomplishments of his student-athletes teamed with the 13 occasions he was named Big Ten Coach of the Year speak to his coaching ability in the conference.
Most recently in the 2009 season, Huber, along with the entire coaching staff at the university, witnessed the culmination of the season’s hard work as the women’s team captured the Big Ten Championship title. The diving squad contributed a total of 174 points to the overall 823 points the team scored to take over the conference. Individually, an Indiana diver won the 3-meter event, and was named the meet and conference’s Diver of the Meet. The honor marked the fifth straight year a Hoosier has won the Diver of the Year award for the conference. Following the meet, Huber and his diver went to the NCAA Championships in College Station, Texas where she won title in the 3-meter dive while setting an NCAA record in the process. This marked the first time an IU diver won the event-further proving the influence of Huber’s coaching since his arrival to the school.
The previous year at the men’s 2008 Big Ten Championships, Huber guided a true freshman to the Big Ten Diver of the Year and Meet award as well as the Big Ten Freshman of the Year.
Huber at the Olympics
Although recognized as an incredibly strong college coach, the USA Olympic Committee has relied on Huber to guide the nation’s best at three consecutive Olympic Games. The 2008 games in Beijing proved to be an extra honor for him as his IU alum qualified first for the games at the Olympic trials in the 3-meter event. This marked the third straight female Hoosier diver on the U.S. team. Huber has placed a diver on either the men’s or women’s side at the Olympic games every season since 1992. He has also coached an Olympic gold medalist.

Jeff Huber (BSCompE ’89) grew up on a small dairy farm near Galena, Ill., and has a vivid memory of standing in the cow yard as a young boy, with manure coming to the top of his boots.
“There has to be a better way,” he recalls thinking. “I loved growing up on the farm, but that moment convinced me that I should explore another option.”
That “other option” became computing. Today, this ECE ILLINOIS alumnus recently completed his 11th year as an executive with the search-engine giant, Google, where he has played leadership roles in developing and improving landmark products, such as Google Maps, Google Earth, and Gmail. He also led technology development for Google Ads, the part of the business that transformed the company from a $1 billion business to a $50 billion business.
Jeff Huber
At ECE ILLINOIS, Huber was inspired by Illinois’ pioneering work on Internet technologies. But his passion for computers goes back to age 13 when his family received its first Apple II computer. 
“To the horror of my parents, I took it apart and then put it back together, modifying it, doing anything that could be done,” he says. 
Huber is the youngest of five children, and his parents told each of them that the first year of college would be covered, but they would have to make money to pay for rest of their education. 
This inspired Huber to be an entrepreneur and start his own computer business at age 14, selling computer supplies and software, as well as developing software. When he came to Illinois, he continued to operate the company full-time at the Business and Technology Center, a business incubator near campus. 
“It was a phenomenal experience,” he says. “I learned what it takes to be an entrepreneur, how to create something from nothing, and how to prioritize among the many things you can do.”
This early experience served him well when he worked as a vice president for both Excite@Home and eBay before joining Google in 2003. When he started at Google, the search engine had been established as a great product, but he says the system for how Google was going to make money was still “a bit of a backwater.” With his leadership, Google Ads flourished. “A huge part of the task was defining the strategy and building the team and the culture to make it work,” he says.
Google encourages employees to spend 20 percent of their time pursuing passion projects, so Huber made bootstrapping Google Apps his side project. He went on to lead development in Google Apps from 2005 to 2010 — a period when one of its most popular apps, Gmail, took off. Gmail set itself apart from other email systems because of its massive amount of storage and ability to run email searches.
As he explains, “If Google could index every page on the Web and give you a result back within 250 milliseconds, why couldn’t people be able to find the attachment someone sent them last week in their email inboxes?”
In 2011, Huber moved to Google Maps, where he already had some involvement. When he first joined the company, he helped Google connect with and purchase a small company, Keyhole, which served as a prototype for what became Google Earth —the system that allows people to view satellite and street-level images just about anywhere in the world.
In 2013, he began looking for new challenges, because as the head of Google Maps and Commerce, he ran a 5,000-person organization in 20 locations around the world, and that meant a lot of time spent on administrative chores.
“I wanted to get back to creating and building,” he says. Therefore, he switched to Google[x], the secretive division that tackles projects that seem more science fiction than reality. Google calls them “moonshots,” and they include such high-profile projects as Google Glass (wearable computing) and self-driving cars. To qualify as a Google[x] project, it has to be something that solves a huge problem affecting a billion or more people and uses breakthrough technology created at Google[x] that might lead to a radically innovative product within five to 10 years.
Huber is a senior vice president in Google[x]’s life sciences area, which has announced several initiatives. One product is a contact lens that diabetics can use to continuously monitor glucose levels in tear fluid. The contact lenses send glucose level readings to smartphones, but a future version may allow wearers to do a “long blink” to trigger a visual display in the lens. Another project includes using nanoparticles to detect disease within the body, with the first target being early diagnosis of cancer. 
Google[x] sets its sights high with these moonshots, increasing the risk of failure — but also increasing the rewards of success. 
“With the ambitious projects we're working on, there's a 90-percent chance of failure,” Huber says. “But in the 10 percent where we succeed, we can have a huge impact on the world. I'll take those odds any day.”
