The market for blood glucose monitoring devices is intensely competitive, 
subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product 
introductions. Four companies, Roche Disetronic, a division of Roche 
Diagnostics; LifeScan, Inc., a division of Johnson & Johnson; the MediSense 
and TheraSense divisions of Abbott Laboratories; and Bayer Corporation, 
currently account for substantially all of the worldwide sales of self-
monitored glucose testing systems. These competitors’ products use a meter and 
disposable test strips to test blood obtained by pricking the finger or, in 
some cases, the forearm. 

In addition, other companies are developing or marketing minimally invasive or 
noninvasive glucose testing devices and technologies that could compete with 
our devices. There are also a number of academic and other institutions 
involved in various phases of technology development regarding blood glucose 
monitoring devices. We believe that the majority of noninvasive blood glucose 
monitors in development monitor glucose via trend analysis, rather than spot 
or continuous measurement. Trend analysis devices do not provide specific 
glucose measurements, as do spot or continuous testing devices, rather they 
alert a patient that their blood glucose levels are increasing or decreasing, 
and require frequent calibrations (from a few hours to a few days, compared to 
initially once a month for GlucoTrack and less frequently as the device is 
used). Accordingly, patients using such devices must also use conventional spot
finger stick devices in order to determine optimal timing and dosage for 
corrective treatments such as insulin, whereas GlucoTrack provides patients 
with noninvasive spot blood glucose measurements that can be used for this 
purpose without the need for trend analysis. Among the companies developing 
noninvasive glucose testing devices are Echo Therapeutics, Inc., GlucoLight, 
C8 and Grove Instruments. Cygnus, a company subsequently acquired by Johnson & 
Johnson, obtained FDA approval and a CE Mark in 2001 for a noninvasive trend 
analysis device that was marketed under the name GlucoWatch, however, the 
device is no longer commercially available. Other companies developing 
continuous measurement devices, based on minimally invasive methods, such as 
implants or subdermal needles include Medtronic, Inc., Abbot Laboratories and 
Dexcom, Inc. 
  
Some of our competitors are either publicly traded or are divisions of 
publicly-traded companies, and they enjoy several competitive advantages, 
including: 
  
   ·  significantly greater name recognition;  

   ·  established relations with healthcare professionals, customers and third-
      party payors;  

   ·  established distribution networks;  

   ·  additional lines of products, and the ability to offer rebates or bundle 
      products to offer higher discounts or incentives to gain a competitive 
      advantage;  

   ·  greater experience in conducting research and development, manufacturing,
      clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approval for products and marketing
      approved products; and  

   ·  greater financial and human resources for product development, sales and 
      marketing, and patent litigation.  

Some of our other competitors also enjoy these competitive advantages. As a 
result, we cannot assure that we will be able to compete effectively against
these companies or their products. 
  
To our knowledge, a summary of potential competitors with non-invasive products
in development is set forth below:

Company Description
We are a development stage medical device company focused on the design, 
development and commercialization of non-invasive glucose monitoring devices 
for use by persons suffering from diabetes.  Our wholly-owned subsidiary, 
Integrity Israel, was founded in 2001 with a mission to develop, produce


 and 
market non-invasive glucose monitors for home use by diabetics.  We have 
developed a non-invasive blood glucose monitor, the GlucoTrack® glucose 
monitoring device, which is designed to help people with diabetes obtain 
blood glucose level readings without the pain, inconvenience, cost and 
difficulty of conventional (invasive) spot finger stick devices.  The 
GlucoTrack DF-F utilizes a patented combination of ultrasound, electromagnetic 
and thermal technologies to obtain blood glucose measurements in less than one 
minute via a small sensor that is clipped onto one’s earlobe and connected 
to a small, handheld control and display unit, all without drawing blood.   

We expect to begin the performance and safety stage of formal clinical 
trials in Israel and Europe by the second quarter of 2012 and, expect 
to begin clinical trials in the United States by late 2012, if our 
clinical trial protocol is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.  
The GlucoTrack DF-F has not yet been approved for commercial sale in the 
United States, the European Union or any other jurisdiction.  There can be 
no assurance that approval for commercial sale in any jurisdiction will be 
obtained. We have not yet generated any revenues from our operations and 
have incurred losses of $2,788,446 during the year ended December 31, 2010 
and $516,657 during the six months ended June 30, 2011.   We are dependent 
upon external sources for financing our operations and there can be no 
assurance that we will succeed in obtaining the necessary financing to 
continue our operations.  As a result, our independent registered public 
accounting firm has expressed substantial doubt about our ability to 
continue as a going concern. 

Pre-Clinical Trials 

Integrity Israel conducted pre-clinical trials involving over 5,000 readings 
from approximately 350 patients over the last seven years.  Clinical data 
collected during 2009 at the Soroka University Medical Center in Be’er Sheva, 
Israel indicate a positive correlation between GlucoTrack DF-F readings and 
those obtained from conventional invasive devices.  More specifically, a 
set of pre-clinical trials conducted on 89 patients of various weights, 
ages, diabetes types and genders involved 1,772 measurements, of which 96% 
were within the clinically acceptable zones (zones A and B) of the Clarke 
Error Grid, which we refer to as the CEG.  Similarly, approximately 90% of 
the measurements in an at home study of four participants were within 
clinically acceptable zones A and B of the CEG.  Measurements are clinically 
acceptable, as compared to a referenced invasive device, when the variance, 
if any, between the devices would have no worse than a benign effect on the 
patients.  These pre-clinical trials involved small patient populations. 
Because of the small sample size, the results of these pre-clinical trials 
may not be indicative of future results.  Analyses from the at home study 
show that there are a few parameters that reduce accuracy, such as the 
learning curve, the use of a home use device as a reference, failure to 
properly follow instructions for use, including use of the reference 
(invasive) device , and the variability of the ambient temperature in 
a given testing environment .  We have already made some modifications 
to the GlucoTrack DF-F to limit the effect of these parameters and further 
modifications are in process , including the addition of a sensor to gauge 
the ambient temperature in the testing environment, and modifications to 
the software utilized by the GlucoTrack device to take the ambient 
temperature into account in determining the patient’s blood glucose level.  
While we believe that these modifications will improve the results of the 
GlucoTrack device, no assurance can be given as to the extent (if any) to 
which these modifications will improve the effectiveness of the device .  
We believe that the results of the home study show that with some 
modifications to the GlucoTrack DF-F, we will be able to improve the 
accuracy and reliability measurements of glucose levels in the home and 
home-like environments.
