Company Description


McClain Value Management's investment strategies include Select Value, Core Valueand Small Cap Value. These strategies are offered as actively managed discretionary accounts. Each strategy employs a concentrated, out-of-favor value-based investment approach. McClain creates long-term, value-based portfolios that invest in publicly-traded stocks. The firm's all-cap strategies, Core Value and Select Value, differ primarily in risk tolerance, sector diversification and the number of stocks in each portfolio. McClain's Small Cap Value strategy is similar to their Select Value strategy except for a limitation on the size of the companies and a difference in the number of stocks held. Stock overlap exists among all three products. Within each of the strategies, all accounts are managed alike, except with respect to any client-specific restrictions or tax timing considerations. Also, weightings in specific stocks may differ based on McClain's judgment of the relative merits of each stock at the time the account was initiated.
