Mark Fields
Previous President and Chief Executive Officer, Ford Motor Company
Mark Fields served as president and chief executive officer of Ford Motor Company and was a member of the company’s board of directors. He announced his retirement May 22, 2017.
Fields’ strong leadership was critical to the company’s North American restructuring, turnaround at the end of the last decade, and record profits in both 2015 and 2016.
He joined Ford in 1989 and progressed through a number of leadership positions in the United States, South America, Asia and Europe. Throughout his career, he has managed a series of turnarounds in many of Ford’s businesses around the world, most notably as president of The Americas, where he led a transformation of the company’s North America operations.
Fields formerly served as chief operating officer, Ford Motor Company, a position to which he was named in December 2012. In this role, and as CEO, he was responsible for overseeing Ford’s fastest global manufacturing expansion in 50 years, and managing the most aggressive global product introduction schedule in the company’s history. Prior to this, Fields served as executive vice president, Ford Motor Company. He was named president, The Americas, in October 2005.
He also formerly served as executive vice president, Ford of Europe and Premier Automotive Group, where he led all activities for Ford’s premium vehicle business group, and for Ford brand vehicles manufactured and sold in Europe. Prior to this, Fields was chairman and chief executive officer, Premier Automotive Group.
From 2000 to 2002, he was president and chief executive officer, Mazda Motor Corporation, leading the company through a significant transformation. Fields was named a Global Leader of Tomorrow by the World Economic Forum in 2000 and CNBC Asia Business Leader – Innovator of the Year in 2001.
Earlier in his career, Fields held a number of positions in both North America and South America, including managing director, Ford Argentina.
He was elected to the IBM board of directors in January 2016.
Fields served as chair of the U.S.-China Business Council from June 2015 to May 2017. He was named to Fast Company’s 2016 Most Creative People in Business list for steering Ford in a more adventurous direction. In May 2016, Fields and his wife Jane served as co-chairs for the annual benefit for Robin Hood Foundation – New York’s largest poverty-fighting organization. Fields served as chair for United Way for Southeastern Michigan’s 2013-14 campaign.
Born in January 1961, Fields holds an economics degree from Rutgers University and an MBA from Harvard Graduate School of Business.

DETROIT - Ford Motor (F) is replacing CEO Mark Fields as questions swirl about the company's current performance and future strategy, according to a person familiar with the situation.CEO Mark Fields is retiring at age 56 after 28 years at the company, said this person, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the official announcement hasn't been made.Fields will be replaced by Jim Hackett, who joined Ford's board in 2013, the person said. Hackett has led Ford's mobility unit since last year. He is the former CEO of office furniture maker Steelcase.As CEO, Fields began Ford's transition from a traditional automaker into a "mobility" company, laying out plans to build autonomous vehicles and explore new services such as ride-hailing and car-sharing. Under Fields, Ford achieved a record pretax profit of $10.8 billion in 2015 after the company's new, aluminum-sided F-150 pickup went on sale.

Ford CEO foresees "positive U.S. manufacturing business climate" under Trump

                                            Ford announced Tuesday it is canceling plans to build a $1.6 billion plant in Mexico. The company will instead invest $700 million to expand a pl...
                                    

But there were rumblings that Fields wasn't focusing enough on Ford's core business, as popular products like the Fusion sedan grew dated and Ford lagged behind rivals in bringing long-range electric cars to the market. Electric car maker Tesla Inc. even passed the 114-year-old Ford in market value this year. Ford's stock price has fallen almost 40 percent in the three years since Fields became CEO."Mark Fields was given the nearly impossible task of making the utterly conventional auto manufacturer, Ford Motor Company, into a high-tech information-style company with share values to match," said Jack Nerad, the editorial director of Kelley Blue Book, the car shopping site. "Despite turning in credible profits, Fields was unable to turn Ford into a stock market darling, and that may well prove elusive going forward."As part of its plan to boost its shares, Ford plans to lay off nearly one-tenth of its global workforce, the company announced earlier this month.Incoming CEO Hackett is the former CEO of Steelcase Inc., one of the world's largest office furniture companies. He is credited with transforming that company, in part by predicting the shift away from cubicles and into open office plans. But he also cut thousands of jobs and moved furniture production from the U.S. to Mexico to stem massive losses at the company.Hackett also served as the interim athletic director at the University of Michigan from 2014 to 2016, where he lured star football coach Jim Harbaugh to the university.

Tesla investing in new solar initiative

                                            Tesla is investing in a new solar initiative. CNET editor Dan Ackerman joins CBSN to discuss Elon Musk's newest ambitions in the tech world.
                                    

Hackett will have to placate investors worried about Ford's sliding U.S. market share and product decisions. Ford's U.S. sales are down this year in part because it doesn't have offerings in popular segments like subcompact SUVs and midsize pickups. Investors also worry that Ford is falling behind its rivals. GM's Chevrolet Bolt electric car, with 238 miles of range, went on sale last year; Ford is working on an electric SUV with 300 miles of range, but it's not due out until 2020.Mary Barra - who became GM's CEO about six months before Fields became Ford's - has also made a series of headline-grabbing moves, such as forming a partnership with the ride-hailing company Lyft and pulling GM out of unprofitable markets, including Europe, India and South Africa. Ford also made investments in new mobility companies and announced it would have a self-driving shuttle on the road by 2021, but its efforts haven't swayed investors. GM's shares are worth around $33, while Ford's languish below $11.Ford's stock rose 1.7 percent in early trading Monday.Fields had the tough job of following CEO Alan Mulally, another auto industry outsider who was hired away from Boeing to lead Ford. Mulally, who joined Ford in 2006 when it was near bankruptcy, was widely credited with ending internal bickering at Ford and streamlining manufacturing.As part of the shake-up, several Ford executives are taking on new roles. Jim Farley, who led the company's European division back to profitability in recent years, will become vice president of global markets and will oversee Lincoln, sales and marketing. Joe Hinrichs, president of Ford's Americas division, will oversee global product development, manufacturing and quality. Marcy Klevorn, Ford's chief technical officer, will replace Hackett as the head of Ford Smart Mobility LLC, Ford's future mobility unit.

Do you have a product for stretch marks? 




Stretch marks are a form of scarring on the skin with an off-color hue. They are caused by tearing of the dermis, which over time may diminish, but will not disappear completely. At this point in time, there are no products that Dr. Rodan and Dr. Fields feel adequately address stretch marks.

            COMMENTEMAILMORESAN FRANCISCO  — Ford is planning for success in a future with more congestion, fewer cars and fewer people driving them.Instead of fighting public transportation, bicycles and car-sharing services, Ford is looking to join them. And still make money even if fewer people are buying cars.Ford is trying to reinvent itself as a mobility company and address the trend in urban areas of cities growing and becoming more congested, CEO Mark Fields said in an interview. "People value access more than ownership. We need to understand customers' concerns and make their lives easier."Related: Ford cars will see around cornersIn researching ways for people to share the road and forms of transportation and individual vehicles, Ford hopes to uncover business opportunities along the way. Fields said the company is pivoting from just products to offering more services to make life and mobility easier."We are testing the thesis of satisfying demand and make money at it," Fields said from San Francisco. The concept is that making peoples' lives better is good business and if, decades from now, the world is buying fewer vehicles, Ford wants to have a big slice of that smaller pie.Related: Ford's next step to making autonomous driving a realityBuy Photo (Photo: Detroit Free Press)As the automaker takes research projects into autonomous driving and starts to implement them, Ford is also piloting some car sharing programs, CEO Mark Fields announced in a speech at the automaker's Research and Innovation Center in Palo Alto Tuesday.It is part of the larger Ford Smart Mobility plan that incorporates connectivity, mobility, autonomous vehicles and big data. Ford introduced the plan in January, along with 25 experiments aimed at better understanding consumers' mobility needs around the globe."My great-grandfather helped put the world on wheels so everyone could enjoy the benefits of mobility," said Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford in a statement.  "Our vision today is to expand that same thinking using advanced technology and new business models, and addressing the mobility challenges people face around the world."After gathering data and consumer insights for six months, Ford is using that data to proceed in two areas: car sharing and alternative ways of getting around increasingly congested cities where many forms of transportation share the road.Ford Motor Credit will team with two car-sharing companies: Getaround in the U.S. and easyCar Club in London. The idea is a customer can rent a car that was financed through Ford Credit to pre-screened clients.The Peer-2-Peer Car Sharing pilot program will run through November and involve 14,000 customers in six U.S. cities who will use Getaround software.  It will be offered to customers in Berkeley, Oakland and San Francisco in California; as well as in Portland, Oregon; Chicago and Washington, D.C. It runs through November.Related: Mark Fields earns $18.6M in first year as Ford CEOBuy Photo (Photo: Alisa Priddle, Detroit Free Press)Fields is hoping the program will make Ford owners more loyal customers and expose those who don't own a car to what Ford has to offer for when they are in the market."It will raise awareness and is a bridge to ownership," Fields said.Another 12,000 Ford owners in London will use easyCar Club to rent out their car.  It is a way to offset monthly payments."Consumers tell us they are interested in sharing the costs of vehicle ownership, and this program will help us understand how much that extends to customers who are financing a Ford vehicle," said David McClelland, Ford Credit vice president of marketing. "As most vehicles are parked and out of use much of the time, this can help us gauge our customers' desires to pick up extra cash and keep their vehicles in use."A third of millennials are interested in renting out their own belongings to supplement their income, according to independent researchers Penn Schoen Berland. And they say after lending a book, a car is the item they are most open to sharing and half are open to the idea.Half of millennial and Generation Z consumers say they would share a car for the cost savings; 40% say it is a good way to try a new product.Buy Photo (Photo: Alisa Priddle/Detroit Free Press)And Ford will participate in an Uber-like model with GoDrive, an on-demand car sharing pilot in London where you order a car and pay for a one-way trip with guaranteed parking. There will be 50 cars positioned in 20 locations available for pay-as-you-go, per-minute pricing in cars such as the Focus Electric car.As part of the research into how people get around today, Ford is introducing a new electric bike concept, MoDe:Flex, and an extension of the MoDe:Link prototype smartphone app to use the ebike. The app provides real-time information on weather, congestion, parking costs, time, traffic and public transportation as well as navigation, route planning, and health and fitness information.There is even a version of the app for the smartwatch.Fields did not rule out making ebikes in the future, if the research suggests that is a viable business to pursue."We now are moving from experimentation to implementation," said Fields. "We have learned a lot in the past six months, and now are ready to put insights into action. Our goal is to make people's lives better by helping them more easily navigate through their day, address societal issues and, over time, change the way the world moves – just as Henry Ford did more than 100 years ago."Contact Alisa Priddle: 313-222-5394 or apriddle@freepress.com.
