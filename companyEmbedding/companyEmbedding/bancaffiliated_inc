New Deposit Products








        We are launching new Deposit Account Products!

There is a minimum balance requirement of $1,500.00 and the interest rate tiers at $1,500.00, $100,000.00, and $200,000.00.  There is a monthly debit limit of 25, however, debit card purchases are unlimited.
      

        We have also made some changes to our Health Savings Accounts.  If you have a high deductible health insurance plan, then you qualify to have a Health Savings Account with an attached debit card to be used for medical purchases.  To hear more details regarding our Health Savings Accounts, or any of our other deposit accounts, call and speak with one of our personal bankers today.
