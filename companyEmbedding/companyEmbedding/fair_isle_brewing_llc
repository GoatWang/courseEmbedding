	Posted in Fair Isle Brewing, Jester King Brewery, New Releases



Jester King Fair Voyage, a collaboration with Fair Isle Brewing




 







		Founder, BeerStreetJournal.com. Stormtrooper.	

 by reidramsay March 2, 2017 




Jester King Fair Voyage, a collaboration with Seattle, Washington’s Fair Isle Brewing, debuts Friday.
The American wild ale is brewed with Washington fireweed. Don’t worry, we’ve never heard of it either. It’s a perennial herbaceous plant that produces a unique spiced flavor. In Alaska it’s used for jellies, candies and ice creams. The fireweed was dried, and added to the wort at the end of the boil.
Besides fireweed, the beer was fermented with a blend of both Jester King and Fair Isle native yeasts and bacterias in stainless steel.
Interesting fact. Andrew Pogue of Fair Isle Brewing used to live in Jester King’s hometown of Austin, Texas. He used to assist the brewery with carpentry, photography, and more. When it came time to open Fair Isle, Jester King accepted a small stake in the brewery in exchange for guidance and business advice.
Jester King Fair Voyage will be available by the glass and bottles starting Friday, March 3rd at 4 pm.
Style: American Wild Ale (w/ Fireweed)
Availability: Bottles, Draft.
Debut: 3/3/17
4.9% ABV

COMMERCIAL DESCRIPTION

        We took to the higher elevation of the Cascades and gathered enough fireweed to brew a full batch. We dried the leaves and flowers to use in this beer by steeping them at the end of the boil. We then cooled the wort and inoculated it with a blend of our mixed culture and Jester King’s house culture of native yeast and bacteria from the Texas Hill Country. Fair Voyage was fermented in stainless steel for about two months and then bottled in early January.

Fair Voyage is 100% naturally refermented in bottles and kegs, unfiltered, and unpasteurized. At the time of bottling, it was 1.002 specific gravity and 3.8 pH.

What We're Building




"Fair Isle is going to be a big deal among beer drinkers come 2018."
- Draft Magazine
Fair Isle is a joint venture between co-founders Andrew Pogue and Geoffrey Barker and Jester King Craft Brewery, LLC in Austin, Texas. Fair Isle will fill a neglected niche in Seattle’s vibrant craft beer scene by entering the market as the first brewery focused one hundred percent on brewing wild farmhouse and sour beers. Similarly, our beers will be made with our own unique house culture with a mix of commercial and wild yeast and bacteria cultures. A majority of our beers will then be aged in barrels – allowing these cultures to develop a uniquely complex flavor profile. While most breweries opening up in Seattle are production breweries focused on distribution, our initial focus will be towards on-premise sales of our tasting room.

COMMERCIAL DESCRIPTION

        We’re excited to announce Fair Voyage — a farmhouse ale brewed with fireweed in collaboration with Fair Isle Brewing in Seattle, Washington!

Back in November, 2016, Andrew Pogue and Geoffrey Barker of Fair Isle came to brew with us at Jester King. They brought fireweed foraged from around their area in Seattle. Fireweed is native to the Pacific Northwest and Alaska and is known for its culinary and medicinal uses. Andrew and Geoffrey dried the fireweed, which we steeped in the wort at the end of the boil.
Fair Voyage was 100% naturally refermented in bottles and kegs, unfiltered, and unpasteurized. At the time of bottling, it was 4.9% alcohol by volume, 1.002 specific gravity, 28 IBU, and 3.8 pH.

Photo by Tyler MaloneGeoffrey BarkerGeoffrey has spent the last 32 years honing his skills in the IT world (no, he will not help you with with that weird email problem).  Since starting his own consultancy in 1998, he has worked long term engagements in large and small businesses in several industries including healthcare, venture capital, restaurants, tech startups and fire services.  In addition to this broad background, Geoffrey built a large sophisticated 1bbl, 3 vessel electric pilot brewery from scratch - closely mimicking the processes of a large commercial brewhouse. In fact many small (nano) professional breweries start on a system this size.  Fair Isle will benefit from this pilot system. It will be used to test new ideas, recipes and ingredients in small batches before committing to a full sized batch.  Andrew PogueAs an architectural photographer, Andrew understands building a business from scratch and has developed a client base in Seattle, Portland and Austin. He’s seen first hand the value of marketing, continually being relevant and delivering a product and service valued by his clients. His vision for Fair Isle is an intersection of farmhouse beers, rooted in the northwest, in an aesthetically pleasing place, with on-site sales directly to the patron; creating a destination like only a few breweries across the nation have achieved. While living in Austin in 2008, Andrew met Jester King Brewery partners Jeffrey Stuffings and Michael Steffing --- just prior to their first brew day. He was intimately involved with the brewery from 2008-2011: designing and building their bar, assisting with brewing and bottling and inspiring/developing their recipe for Bonnie the Rare - a Berliner Weisse. Fair Isle Brewing is a venture between Co-founders Geoffrey Barker, Andrew Pogue and Jester King Brewery out of Austin, Texas.
