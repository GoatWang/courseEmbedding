Women’s Pants are the Other Half of the Style Equation
While it’s tempting to place emphasis on what you’ll be wearing up top, always remember the value of a stylish pair of women’s pants! From comfy and casual to dressy and formal, we’ve got all the bottom pieces you’ll ever need to create all of your favorite outfits. Simple and easy-to-wear capri pants are perfect for complementing peasant blouses or tunic-style top. When comfort is the top priority, there’s no going wrong with wide-leg pants in gauzy, breathable cotton or rayon fabric. Dress it up a bit by slipping on some slim-leg trousers topped off with a nice blouse and blazer that’ll have you looking clean and professional. Or, try on a clean pair of khaki pants for women that can effortlessly shift from casual settings to the office without a sweat.

Plenty of Comfortable Khaki and Dress Pants and Styles for Women
Have your clothing pull double duty—after all, it’s great to have your wardrobe work as hard as you do. Pick up a few pairs of slacks that will look splendid with casual or office outfits. Cut down on time spent fretting over what you’ll wear throughout the week! Instead, lean back and rest easy knowing that all your fashion bases are covered by our sweet selection of women’s pants. From capris and cropped ankle pants to slacks, trousers, and cargo pants for women--you'll find all of your favorite bottoms here in our diverse assortment of clothing for women here at JCPenney!

Men’s Pants Offer Top-Notch Comfort and Style


We did mention a fancy gala—and khakis and cargo pants won’t quite cut it there, no matter how much you may like them. Instead, wear one of our impeccably fashionable dress pants. They definitely give a new meaning to the term ‘fancy pants’. Finally, pick up one of our men’s belts, a pair of dress shoes, and cufflinks to finish off that spiffy outfit—and make sure the belt matches your shoes!

Straight, classic, slim, or relaxed? What’s your favorite fit? Whatever it may be you can find it here. From jeans to dress pants, we offer a plethora of fit selections for you.

At JCPenney, you can get all of the essential pants your need to build your wardrobe. You get all of this at amazing prices!

        Best Diaper Ever!
We switched from the Snugglers to Little Movers when our son started crawling and its one of the best decisions we've ever made! No leaks, they keep their great fit, and allow him to crawl and walk around with no mess and no fuss! They're the best diapers we've ever used!

        Great Fit!!!
My son is very tall (98% in his age group) but is very skinny (30% in his age group). These are the only diapers that fit him comfortably without causing pinched skin or leaking.

        Great diapers
The Huggies Little Movers are wonderful diapers! They are very absorbent and soft. They fit very well and stay on while little one wiggles away!

        Love but missing 1 feature
I love the fit of these diapers but I wish they had a wetness indicator. For the most part I can tell when my baby needs changed but the indicator would be nice for someone else that can't tell as easily.

        Works great compared to any diapers I've tried
It's works well to hold in everything but the only problem is that when she crawls it sags. But it still holds in everything.

        The only type of diapers I buy
Huggies Little Movers are our favorite brand and type of diapers by far! No other brand stays on or fits as well and keeps messes contained like they do!

I love these diapers!!!!! I tried pampers on my daughter but she would pee through them and then tried luvs and found out she is allergic to them. Then I tried theses out and they work the best with her. She sleeps through the night in one and doesn't pee though it.

I love these diapers!!!!! I tried pampers on my daughter but she would pee through them and then tried luvs and found out she is allergic to them. Then I tried theses out and they work the best with her. She sleeps through the night in one and doesn't pee though it.

Why Huggies?





Thank you for making the best diapers around! :) huggies is my absolute favorite brand for my two little ladies. No leaks & zero rashes! :) we♡ huggies!



Jennifer Sonnenberg

The inside of it, honest to goodness, when I opened these up and I felt the liner for the first time, I was in shock. I have never in my life felt a diaper as absorbent, as soft, cuddly as this. And I have several children, and I have gone through a lot of diapers, a lot of different diaper brands. Changed a lot of diapers and I have, like I said, other than a cloth diaper, this is the softest one I've ever felt. These are the little bumps, the little pillows. This is the liner and it is so soft. I can't say that enough. It really truly is. It's so gentle against your baby's skin. I have found that these diapers wick away the moisture really, really well, and keep my baby's skin really dry and protected.

Having 3 children still in diapers, Huggies Little Movers are simply my favorite diaper by far. My kids are constantly playing, and exploring, and aren't wetting themselves as often as they did a yr ago, but the gel beads that form when the diaper is ready to be changed is simply genius. The children can play, n play without rashes, diapers falling apart, or wetting their clothes. It saves on diaper creams, changing them every 1-2 hrs (depending on how much they had to drink), and on wet clothing because of leaks. We only buy Huggies diapers because we save in the long run when we compare the cheaper diapers and how often we have to change them, or put on a new outfit because other brands don't hold up as well. Finding the right diaper for the price took some trial n error but I wouldn't use any other brand since we tried Huggies

I am so happy that these diapers exist, my baby couldn't be more comfortable, she is always smiling and sleeps well through the night and her diaper is never soaking :-) I am so glad that they have all sizes because I will keep using these only!

We use them only, you know, for diaper changes, but for a lot of other purposes like face cleaning and hand wiping and What I love about them is they're extremely tough. They basically leave the skin extremely soft and they're not irritating, they had aloe in it. Which helps with any irritation that he's having. Since I've been using them I hardly have to use ever any diaper rash cream, so that's wonderful.

Why Movement Matters








Expert Advice from Dr. Sears


                            Pediatrician, Dr. William Sears, explains why every little movement matters to your thriving baby, and why Huggies® Little Movers Diapers are the only diaper designed to encourage movement.

Movement helps the young body and brain grow, and builds stronger muscles and bones. Most importantly, movement increases blood flow to the brain, which grows more tiny blood vessels. The more blood supplied to the growing brain, the better it grows. So when your little one is ready to move, set them free with Huggies® Little Movers Diapers, designed specifically for the way babies move.

A kicking baby isn’t an unhappy baby. Kicking is a great way to further baby’s hip development. Huggies® Little Movers Diapers feature a new Moving Baby System* that lets your baby move and kick. When the hips are ready, your baby will start crawling and eventually walk.

Babies soon realize their hands are fun, easily accessible toys. Reaching and hand play are great ways for your baby to learn and gain better hand-eye coordination. With every hand-eye coordinating movement your baby makes, thousands of brain cells are developing new connections to make this happen. Help your baby get the most out of every reach with Huggies® Little Movers Diapers, designed specifically for the way babies move.

When babies start to roll, they’re finally starting to really move! Rolling is natural, happens at different times for every baby, and is a good sign that baby is learning balance. Rolling may mean it’s time to start baby proofing your home or move the changing table to the floor for safety. There’s no saying when your baby will roll, but specially designed Huggies® Little Movers Diapers will make rolling comfy for your moving baby.

Babies move naturally and develop skills at their own pace. Some move more than others, and that’s perfectly fine. To help encourage movement, try placing toys or interesting objects far apart in open, safe areas and let your baby explore. It also helps to limit the time your baby spends in strollers, cribs and other equipment that restricts movement, including diapers. Huggies® Little Movers Diapers feature a new Moving Baby System* that provides comfort to moving babies as they reach, kick, rock and roll.

I love these diapers!!!!! I tried pampers on my daughter but she would pee through them and then tried luvs and found out she is allergic to them. Then I tried theses out and they work the best with her. She sleeps through the night in one and doesn't pee though it.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
