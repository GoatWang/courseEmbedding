What makes our system uniquely qualified to do this...? Simply put, it’s the input from thousands of Subcontractors in dozens of trades that assisted in building a tool to proactively track changes throughout the course of the project so you can get paid. With GCs adopting online project management tools to protect their own interests, they can shoot down changes to the Subcontractor faster than ever.   The only way for Subcontractors to survive and thrive in this market is for them to initiate documentation to track changes and delays at the time they occur, instead of simply performing the work and then trying to figure out how to get paid. We’ve worked with Subcontractors for almost 20 years in developing documentation and project management procedures.
