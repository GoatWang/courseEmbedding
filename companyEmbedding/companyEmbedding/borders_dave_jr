Specialties of Borders, Dave S., Jr. Attorney:

Attorneys
Banking & Investment Lawyers
Corporate Business Lawyers
Corporate Finance & Securities Lawyers













Attorneys: A lawyer is a person who practices law, as an advocate, barrister, attorney, counselor or solicitor or chartered legal executive. Working as a lawyer involves the practical application of abstract legal theories and knowledge to solve specific individualized problems, or to advance the interests of those who hire lawyers to perform legal services. The role of the lawyer varies greatly across legal jurisdictions, and so it can be treated here in only the most general terms.


Banking & Investment Lawyers: Despite a changing economy, investment banking and law remain popular career paths for ambitious young people. Both careers offer the chance to make a lot of money right out of school. Moreover, prestige and upward mobility, two additional defining characteristics, attract the best and brightest into both investment banking and law.


Corporate Business Lawyers: A corporate lawyer is also known as In-House Counsel, Staff Attorney, Deputy General Counsel, General Counsel and Chief Legal Officer. Their primary objective is to serve the interests of the corporation, not the owners of the business or the officers who run it. In addition to legal counsel, they may also be called upon to provide business advice. They may practice other areas of law concerning mergers and acquisitions, trademarks, tax law bankruptcy, employment, securities, real estate or international commercial law.
