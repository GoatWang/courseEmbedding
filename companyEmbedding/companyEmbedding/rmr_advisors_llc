Governance






RIF is governed by a board of five (5) trustees. The Board of Trustees has established an Audit Committee, a Compensation Committee, and a Nominating Committee. Trustees who are independent of the Fund's Advisor serve on each of these Board Committees.  Each Committee carries out specific responsibilities that are described in its charter. You may view the charters of the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, or the Nominating Committee by clicking on the applicable link below.
RIF and the Advisor have adopted a Joint Code of Ethics that is based on the principle that the Trustees and officers of the Fund, and the personnel of the Advisor who provide services to the Fund, owe a fiduciary duty to the Fund to conduct their personal securities transactions in a manner that does not interfere with the Fund's transactions or otherwise take unfair advantage of their relationship with the Fund. We have also adopted a Code of Ethics for Principal Executive and Senior Financial Officers for the purpose of promoting honest and ethical conduct; full, fair, accurate, timely, and understandable disclosure in reports and documents and in other public communications made by the Fund; compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and regulations; the prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and accountability for adherence to the Code. 
We are committed to compliance with all applicable securities laws and regulations, accounting standards, accounting controls, and audit practices. We encourage reporting violations or possible violations to our Audit Committee. We prohibit any retaliatory action for reporting violations or suspected violations in good faith. 
We have also developed a Privacy Policy. 
The following web site page describes how to contact our senior management, our Trustees or our Audit Committee.

Welcome to RMR Wealth Management, LLC

        RMR Wealth Management, LLC is an SEC-registered investment advisory firm that provides high net worth individuals and institutional clients with comprehensive and personalized wealth management planning expertise. RMR Wealth Management was founded by three senior investment officers with over 50 years of combined financial services and wealth management experience. 

        Our investment approach is built on identifying each client’s unique objectives and establishing a customized investment plan to meet them. Our independent financial advisors address each critical step in the investment management process including: goal setting and risk/return profiling; asset allocation modeling and execution; rigorous investment selection, monitoring and reporting. We work with you to develop the foundation for a long-term strategy designed to meet your specific wealth management needs. 

        The first step is the analysis of your goals and requirements. What is your overall financial picture? What are your short and long term investment objectives? What are your current and future cash flow needs? What is your comfort level with respect to risk and yield? The answers to these fundamental wealth management questions provide the primary building blocks for professionally and responsibly managing your assets.

        RMR Wealth Management works with you through every step of the process in an open and transparent way, and every investment decision we make is determined by and geared toward the strategy that we design and implement together. We provide wealth management services tailored to your financial needs.  At all times, we maintain the flexibility to alter the plan should circumstances change and require us to modify the strategy. We understand and appreciate our role as financial advisors. As partners in the wealth management process, we work hand in hand with you to address both the financial opportunities and challenges along the way.
