Is Seadrill Ltd. (SDRL) a Suitable Pick for Value Investors?

 Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn't want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?    One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let's put Seadrill Limited SDRL  stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:   PE Ratio    A key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock's current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.    On this front, Seadrill has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 0.29, as you can see in the chart below       This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20.07. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Seadrill's current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years. Moreover, the current level is fairly below the highs for this stock over the past five years, suggesting it might be a good entry point.      Further, the stock's PE also compares highly favorably with the Zacks classified Oil & Gas Drilling industry's trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 48.15. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.      P/S Ratio  Another key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock's price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.    Right now, Seadrill has a P/S ratio of about 0.06. This is considerably lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.11 right now.       If anything, SDRL is trading at the lower end of its range in the time period from a P/S metric, suggesting some level of undervalued trading-at least compared to historical norms.   Broad Value Outlook  In aggregate, Seadrill currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of 'A', putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Seadrill a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.    For example, the Price/book (P/B) ratio for Seadrill Limited is 0.02, a level that is lower than the industry average of 0.50. The Price to Book ratio or P/B is calculated as market capitalization divided by its book value. Additionally, its P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) comes in at 0.16, which is better than the industry average of 1.48. Clearly, SDRL is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.   What About the Stock Overall?    Though Seadrill might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of 'D' and a Momentum score of 'A'. This gives SDRL a Zacks VGM score-or its overarching fundamental grade-of 'B'. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>  )    Meanwhile, the current quarter has seen one upward estimate revision in the past sixty days compared to none downward, while the current year estimate has seen three upward and no downward revisions in the same time frame.    As a result, the current quarter consensus estimate now stands at break even from a loss of 1 cent per share two months ago. Meanwhile, the current year estimate has narrowed from a loss 18 cents per share to a loss of 10 cents per share. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:   Seadrill Limited Price and Consensus         Seadrill Limited Price and Consensus    |      Seadrill Limited Quote  This somewhat favorable trend is why the stock has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and why we are looking for better performance from the company in the near term.   Bottom Line    Seadrill is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its good lineup of statistics on this front. Moreover, a strong industry rank (Top 44% out of more than 250 industries) and a Zacks Rank #2 further support the growth potential of the stock. However, over the past two years, the Zacks Oil & Gas Drilling industry has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:      So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick. Moreover, broader factors at the industry level support the growth potential of the company as well.   Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?    Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.    With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.    It's not the one you think.

Seadrill Ltd.: A Speculative Buy - Seadrill Limited (NYSE:SDRL) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Seadrill Ltd.: A Speculative BuyFeb.20.17 | About: Seadrill Limited (SDRL) Achilles Research Long/short equity, special situationsSummarySeadrill is standing with its back to the wall; the company needs to restructure its balance sheet, and it needs to do so fast.The company has said recently that negotiations with lenders have not yet been successful, but that may change moving forward.Almost all negative outcomes are now priced into the stock, lending a lot of upside to Seadrill in case a restructuring agreement is reached.SDRL remains a speculative buy.Negative investor sentiment with respect to offshore drilling contractor Seadrill Ltd. (NYSE:SDRL) is off the charts. After the company gave an ill-received restructuring update at the end of January, investors dumped the stock, and kicked it into the bargain bin. I think that bad news are now sufficiently priced into Seadrill's shares, and that the offshore drilling company will be able to secure lender concessions and a financing package. Therefore, Seadrill's shares are a speculative buy. When it comes to selecting investments with compelling reward-to-risk combinations, one wouldn't necessarily come up with offshore drilling companies. The sector has been plagued by oversupply issues, lower contracting rates, and a cutback in investment spending on the part of big oil and gas companies that has thrown the offshore drilling sector into chaos. Seadrill has pushed back against those market forces by suspending its dividend, slashing operating costs for rigs, and deferring capital expenditures. Nonetheless, Seadrill - still - has a significant amount of debt sitting on its balance sheet, and that needs to be serviced. The company reported ~$8.9 billion in net interest bearing debt at the end of the September quarter, which is all that investors see these days. But Seadrill should not be counted out just yet. 


 Source: StockCharts.com Seadrill Should Be Able To Secure Lender Concessions And A Financing Package In a nutshell, Seadrill's capital structure is unsustainable, and needs to change, and it needs to change fast. In an effort to put the company on more stable financial footing, it has entered into negotiations with lenders to transition to a new capital structure, which would include the extension of bank maturities, the amendment of financial covenants, and raising new capital of at least $1.0 billion. Seadrill also wants to extend the maturity of unsecured claims. In the restructuring update the offshore drilling company provided in January, Seadrill said that negotiations with creditors were ongoing and difficult, but that they have not yielded positive results yet. What ticked investors off was the notion that Seadrill was "actively preparing various contingency plans" in case negotiations would go nowhere, and creditors would not want to play a role in SDRL's ongoing restructuring. After the announcement of the restructuring update, the shares slumped ~30 percent, reflecting concerns that Seadrill may slide into bankruptcy. That said, though, a lot of energy companies have been supported by their lenders during the energy market downturn, tilting the odds in favor of a restructuring solution for Seadrill also. As far as I am concerned, chances are that Seadrill will be able to hammer out an agreement with its lenders shortly, and be able to raise new capital before the West Eminence credit facility matures in April. Your Takeaway Seadrill will report fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday, and the company will likely give investors an update about its restructuring, and the progress it has made in terms of securing concessions from lenders. While there are certainly some bumps ahead in the road for Seadrill, I think the company will ultimately be able to come to an agreement with its creditors, and transition its capital structure to one that is more sustainable over the long haul. Almost the entire set of negative restructuring outcomes are now priced into Seadrill's shares, leaving a lot of headroom for a fast and hard recovery if the company reports a mutually beneficial restructuring agreement. Speculative Buy.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Current operations[edit]
The company operates semi-submersibles, jack-ups and drillships. The company provides quarterly online updates on the status of each rig in its fleet on its website.[2]
As of 2015, founder John Fredriksen owned 119 million shares of the company. [3]
Scorpion Offshore[edit]
Scorpion Offshore (OSE: SCORE) is an international jackup drilling rig operator that through May 2007 to November 2008 will take delivery of five rigs from KEPPEL AmFELS yard in Brownsville, Texas, United States.
The company was founded on April 22, 2005 and registered on Bermuda with an initial equity of USD 111 million. Main offices are located in Houston. On September 2, 2005 Scorpion was listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange OTC, with full listing on December 2. On November 3, 2006 the first vessel, Offshore Courageous, was delivered.
In 2010, drilling rig operators Seadrill and Ensco made take-over bids to acquire Scorpion Offshore.[4] On 31 May 2010 Ensco abandoned its bid after Seadrill raised its bid to Nkr40.50 ($6.26) per share. Seadrill already owns about 40% of Scorpion Offshore.[5]
History[edit]
Seadrill was incorporated as a Bermuda company in May 2005 by the Norwegian-born shipping tycoon John Fredriksen and listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange in November 2005. In July 2005, it acquired the drilling company Odfjell. [6]
In September 2006, it purchased a controlling share of Smedvig by outbidding Noble Energy. [7]
In 2007, Seadrill acquired Eastern Drilling.[8]
In May 2010, Seadrill outbid Ensco plc for Scorpion Offshore, valuing the company at $567 million.[9]
In 2014, Seadrill conducted an initial public offering of its North Atlantic Drilling subsidiary, which owns harsh environment rigs.[10] Seadrill continued to own 70% of North Atlantic Drilling. [11]
In 2013, the company sold the majority of its tender rig and semi-tender operation to SapuraKencana. [12]
The company also sold Tender rigs T-15, T16 and the West Vencedor to Seadrill Partners LLC. [13]
In June 2013, Seadrill acquired a majority interest in Sevan Drilling. [14]
In September 2013, a financial company, Heirs Holdings made a “substantial” investment in Seadrill’s Nigerian unit.[15]
In November 2014, the company suspended dividend payments as a result of a downturn in the industry. [16]
Controversies[edit]
Bribery allegations[edit]
In 2015, Petrobras alleged bribery in the negotiations of rig contracts signed by Sevan Drilling, a subsidiary of Seadrill, in 2005-2008. [1]
Environmental damage due to rig fire[edit]
Main article: Montara oil spill
In November 2009, Seadrill's West Atlas jackup rig, which was located on Montara field, about 690 kilometers offshore of Darwin, Australia, caught fire after the field had been leaking oil for ten weeks. The rig was operated by the Thai firm PTTEP. For 74 days, gas and oil ran into the Timor Sea, in what was one of the worst environmental disasters in Australian history. [17]

Drillship
Drillships are self-propelled ships equipped for drilling. They keep station over the well by means of a computer-controlled thruster system known as dynamic positioning. Drillships operate in water depths in which jack-ups rigs are incapable of working and can drill in deep and ultra-deep waters.









Semi-submersibles
Semi-submersible rigs consist of a deck containing the working areas and equipment and the living quarters, supported by a hull which consists of vertical columns connected to horizontal pontoons. Such rigs operate in a 'semi-submerged' position, with the lower hull ballasted down below the waterline. In the case of a dynamically-positioned (DP) semisub, the rig keeps station over the wellhead location by means of a computer-controlled thruster system. In the semi-submerged position, it provides a stable platform for drilling, due in part to its wave transparency characteristics at the water line. The 'generation' to which a semi sub belongs is often given - this indicates the period when the rig was built and, to a certain extent, its water depth and deck-load capabilities. The latest rigs are sixth-generation. A semi-submersible rig with DP capability can drill in conventional, deep and ultra-deep waters.

The latest rigs are sixth-generation. A semi-submersible rig with DP capability can drill in conventional, deep and ultra-deep waters.









Jack-up
Jack-up rigs are mobile, self-elevating drilling platforms equipped with tubular structure legs that are lowered to the sea floor. Tugboats tow a jack-up rig to the drill-site as a vessel, with its hull riding the sea and its leg raised. At the drill-site, the legs are lowered until they rest on the seabed and jacking continues until the hull is elevated above the surface of the water. Drilling operations can then begin. When they are completed, the hull is lowered until it rests in the water, the legs are raised and the rig can be relocated to another drill-site.









Tender rig
Self-erecting tender rigs allow for drilling operations to be performed from a wellhead platform without the need for a permanently installed drilling package. The tender is moored next to the platform where wells are to be drilled and the modularised drilling package is lifted onto the platform. Drilling operations are supported by facilities on the tender, including storage for drilling supplies, power generation facilities for running the drilling equipment and well completion equipment. The tender also has living quarters and a helicopter deck. Tender rigs are either barge-based or have semi-submersible hulls. Both carry the same equipment, but the semi-submersible rig is able to operate in rougher weather conditions.
