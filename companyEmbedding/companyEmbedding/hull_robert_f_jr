CHARLOTTE, N.C., March 7, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- SPX FLOW, Inc. (NYSE:    FLOW) announced today that its Board of Directors has elected Robert (Bob) F. Hull, Jr., a current independent director of SPX FLOW, as Chairman of the Board, effective upon the retirement of the current Chairman, Chris Kearney. Mr. Kearney recently informed the Board of Directors of his intention to retire from his role as a Director and the Chairman of the Board following the adjournment of the Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held on or around May 10, 2017.








"Bob is an experienced leader with a strong background in finance, strategic development and operational performance improvement. He brings broad experience and proven boardroom leadership to the role of Chairman of the Board of Directors for SPX FLOW," said Kearney.
"The Board joins me in thanking Chris for his many years of service to the SPX family and his invaluable leadership through the building, development and spin-off of SPX FLOW. We wish Chris and his family all the best," said Hull. "I'm honored to succeed him in the role of Chairman and I recognize the significant responsibility I have to our associates, shareholders and the Board." 
Mr. Hull, 52, has served as Chief Financial Officer of Lowe's Companies, Inc., a Fortune 50 company, since March 2003 and recently announced plans to retire from that role in March 2017. He joined Lowe's in 1999 and has more than 25 years of public company leadership experience, including expertise in finance, accounting, tax, treasury and investor relations in addition to strong experience in mergers and acquisitions, risk management, supply chain and human resources.
Mr. Hull has served on the SPX FLOW Board since its spin-off from SPX Corporation in 2015.  Prior to that he served on the Board of Directors of SPX Corporation, beginning in August 2014. He was also a member of the Board of Trustees of the University of North Carolina at Charlotte from 2005 to 2015.
Upon Mr. Kearney's retirement, SPX FLOW's Board of Directors will be comprised of seven directors, including six independent members:  Bob Hull, Emerson Fullwood, Terry Lisenby, David Singer, Pat Campbell and Anne Altman. This team of proven leaders is joined on the Board of Directors by Marc Michael, President and CEO of SPX FLOW.
Mr. Kearney has served a combined 20 years for SPX Corporation and SPX FLOW. He joined SPX Corporation in 1997 as Vice President, Secretary and General Counsel. He served as President and CEO of SPX Corporation from 2004 to 2015 and was elected Chairman of the Board in 2007. Under Mr. Kearney's leadership, SPX Corporation underwent a significant transformation that narrowed the focus of the company and positioned the business in higher growth, higher return markets. A key element of this transformation included the acquisitions of several flow businesses that were ultimately combined to create SPX FLOW in the spinoff transition completed on September 26, 2015. Mr. Kearney has served as Chairman of the Board of SPX FLOW since the spin-off.

Natasha, Oklahoma
Nursing Student
"My daughter recently went out for soccer. I decided it would be a good idea to run another player’s father through BeenVerified. Turns out this guy had been charged with indecent exposure and was on parole."


Maryann, New Jersey
Analyst
"I used BeenVerified to check into a guy that I had met online. It turns out he had lied to me about where he lived and his family. Needless to say, thanks to BV I severed contact with him and have not heard from him since. Thank you BV!"


Bob M, New Jersey
Retired Detective
"I am retired and have a ministry helping the dying and sick. I found a son and the mother was dying of cancer. She held on waiting for her son who had not been in touch for years."


Rhonda, Missouri
Caring Mom
"I'm a single mother dating online and I use BeenVerified to help protect my family!"
