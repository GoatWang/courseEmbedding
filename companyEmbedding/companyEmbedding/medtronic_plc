History[edit]
Early history[edit]




Medtronic Operational Headquarters in Fridley, Minnesota, a suburb of Minneapolis.


Medtronic was founded in 1949 in northeastern Minneapolis by Earl Bakken and his brother-in-law, Palmer Hermundslie, as a medical equipment repair shop.[10]
Through his repair business, Bakken came to know C. Walton Lillehei, a doctor of heart surgery at the University of Minnesota Medical School. The deficiencies of the pacemakers of the day were made painfully obvious following a power outage over Halloween in 1957, which affected large sections of Minnesota and western Wisconsin.[11] A pacemaker-dependent paediatric patient of Lillehei died because of the blackout. The next day, Lillehei spoke with Bakken about developing some form of battery-powered pacemaker. Bakken modified a design for a transistorised metronome and created the first battery-powered external artificial pacemaker.




Medtronic's old headquarters in St. Anthony, Minnesota


The company expanded through the 1950s, mostly selling equipment built by other companies but also developing some custom-made devices. Bakken built a small pacemaker that could be strapped to the body and powered by batteries. Work in the new field later produced an implantable pacemaker in 1960. The company built headquarters in the Minneapolis suburb of St. Anthony, Minnesota, in 1960[12] and the company moved to Fridley in the 1970s. Medtronic's main competitors in the cardiac rhythm field include Boston Scientific and St. Jude Medical. In 1998, Medtronic acquired Physio-Control for $538 million.[13]
Animal rights[edit]
In 2005, 2008, and 2010 PETA threatened to submit a shareholder resolution to improve animal welfare standards in the company. In 2005, PETA attempted to stop five specific animal experiments that it deemed "crude and cruel". In 2008, PETA protested the outsourcing of animal testing to countries with lax animal welfare laws, such as China. In 2010, PETA attempted to stop Medtronic's reported use of live animals in testing and training. In response, Medtronic conducted a feasibility study that found that banning the use of live animals was impractical. Medtronic continues to use live animals for testing and training but has said that it will look for alternatives in the future. In each case, PETA withdrew its shareholder resolution after talks with Medtronic's leadership.[14][15]
Recent history[edit]
After 2008 and the global financial crisis, its stock value dropped dramatically. Despite sales and gross margins well above the average of most industries, with steady revenue growth since 2008 and a gross margin above 60%, Medtronic initiated a series of restructurings in 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011, including Physio-Control's spin-off for $487 million.[16] Its stock price now approaches pre-recession values.
In May 2014, Medtronic agreed to pay over $1 billion to settle patent litigation with Edwards Lifesciences, after years of protracted legal battles.[clarification needed][17]
In June 2014, Medtronic announced its acquisition, the largest in its history, of Covidien, plc of Ireland, for $42.9 billion in cash and stock.[18] Following the acquisition, Medtronic ceased to be a Minnesota-based company. It moved its headquarters to low-tax Ireland, allowing it to avoid taxation on more than $14 billion held overseas.[5][19]
In February 2016, the company announced that it would acquire Bellco from private equity firm Charme Capital Partners.[20]
In June 2016, the company announced its acquisition of HeartWare International Inc. for $1.1 billion.[21]

Business units[edit]
Medtronic has six main business units, which develop and manufacture devices and therapies to treat more than 30 chronic diseases, including heart failure, Parkinson's disease, urinary incontinence, Down's syndrome, obesity, chronic pain, spinal disorders and diabetes.
Cardiac rhythm disease management[edit]
Cardiac rhythm disease management is the oldest and largest of Medtronic's business units. Its work in heart rhythm therapies dates back to 1957, when Bakken developed the first wearable heart pacemaker to treat abnormally-slow heart rates. Since then, it has expanded its expertise in electrical stimulation to treat other cardiac rhythm diseases. It has also made an effort to address overall disease management by adding diagnostic and monitoring capabilities to many of its devices. An independently-operating Dutch pacemaker manufacturer, Vitatron, acquired by Medtronic in 1986, is now a European subsidiary of the unit.[50] Medtronic and Vitatron pacemakers are interrogated and programmed by Medtronic Carelink Model 2090 Programmer for Medtronic and Vitatron Devices; they use separate interfaces.[51]
In 2007, Medtronic recalled its Sprint Fidelis product, the flexible wires, or leads, which connect a defibrillator to the interior of the heart. The leads were found to be failing at an unacceptable rate, resulting in unnecessary shocks or no shocks when needed; either can be lethal. The scope of the problem continues to be a matter of research. Studies since the recall, disputed by Medtronic, suggest that the failure rate of already-implanted Sprint Fidelis leads is increasing exponentially. Medtronic's liability is limited by various court decisions.[52]
Spinal and biologics[edit]
Spinal and biologics is Medtronic's second-largest business. Medtronic is the world leader in spinal and musculoskeletal therapies. In 2007, Medtronic purchased Kyphon, a manufacturer and seller of spinal implants thst are necessary for procedures like kyphoplasty.[53]
In May 2008, Medtronic Spine agreed to pay the US government $75 million to settle a qui tam lawsuit after a whistleblower alleged that Medtronic committed Medicare fraud. The company was charged with illegally convincing healthcare providers to offer kyphoplasty, a spinal fracture repair surgery, as an inpatient, not an outpatient, procedure to make thousands of dollars more in profits per surgery.[54]
A "special report" by writer Steven Brill in Time showed that according to Medtronic's quarterly SEC filing of October 2012, the company had, on average, a 75.1% profit margin on its spine products and therapies.[55]
Cardiovascular[edit]
Medtronic's cardiovascular therapies span the major specialities of interventional cardiology, cardiac surgery and vascular surgery. The products are used to reduce the potentially debilitating effects of coronary, aortic and structural heart disease.
Neuromodulation[edit]
Neuromodulation is the second-oldest and third-largest department of Medtronic. Its products include neurostimulation systems and implantable drug delivery systems for chronic pain, common movement disorders and urologic and gastrointestinal disorders. It relies on innovative development methodologies to build cutting-edge medical technology devices, with embedded software. The department's revenues in 2014 amounted to $1.9 billion, or 11% of Medtronic’s total revenues.[56]
Diabetes[edit]
The diabetes management manufacturing and sales division of Medtronic is based in Northridge, California.[57] The original company, Minimed Technologies, was founded in the early 1980s by Alfred E. Mann and spun off from Pacesetter Systems to design a practical insulin pump for lifelong wear.[58] Most devices then were either too large or impossible to program and were extremely unreliable. The release of the lightweight, menu-driven MiniMed 500 series changed the landscape, and it was a major factor in bringing insulin pump usage to the mainstream.
In 1996, the MiniMed was redesigned by the innovation consulting RKS Design to look both more flashy and more elegant and to resemble a beeper. The friendliness of the device boosted adoption rate, and sales increased by 357%.[59] In the early 2000s, Medtronic purchased Minimed, to form Medtronic Minimed.[60]
On 11 May 2009, Medtronic announced it had chosen San Antonio, Texas, for the location of its new Diabetes Therapy Management and Education Center. The company announced that it expected 1400 new jobs would be created to staff the 150,000-square-foot (14,000 m2) facility.[61]
In September 2016, the FDA approved a device, MiniMed 670G, which automatically pumps insulin to a diabetic patient's body on sensing its absence or reduction.[62]
Surgical technologies[edit]




O-arm Surgical Imaging System. Federal Center of Neurosurgery in Tyumen, 2013


The surgical technologies business group designed and manufactured products for the diagnosis and treatment of ear, nose and throat (ENT) diseases and cranial, spinal and neurologic conditions. It also encompassed a surgical navigation division to design "StealthStation" systems, software and instruments for Computer Assisted Surgery (CAS) and a special intraoperative X-ray imaging system, known as the O-arm Imaging System. Many of the products are used for minimally-invasive surgical procedures. In 2016, the business unit was dissolved, and each site folded into new business groups.
Technology safety[edit]
In 2011, Jay Radcliffe, an independent black hat security researcher, revealed a security vulnerability in a Medtronic insulin pump, allowing an attacker to take control of the pump. Medtronic responded by assuring users of the full safety of its devices.[63]
In 2008, a team of computer security researchers was able to take remote control of a Medtronic cardiac implant. The team, using an unused implant in a lab, was able to control the electrical shocks delivered by the defibrillator component and even glean patient data from the device.[64]

History[edit]
Early history[edit]




Medtronic Operational Headquarters in Fridley, Minnesota, a suburb of Minneapolis.


Medtronic was founded in 1949 in northeastern Minneapolis by Earl Bakken and his brother-in-law, Palmer Hermundslie, as a medical equipment repair shop.[10]
Through his repair business, Bakken came to know C. Walton Lillehei, a doctor of heart surgery at the University of Minnesota Medical School. The deficiencies of the pacemakers of the day were made painfully obvious following a power outage over Halloween in 1957, which affected large sections of Minnesota and western Wisconsin.[11] A pacemaker-dependent paediatric patient of Lillehei died because of the blackout. The next day, Lillehei spoke with Bakken about developing some form of battery-powered pacemaker. Bakken modified a design for a transistorised metronome and created the first battery-powered external artificial pacemaker.




Medtronic's old headquarters in St. Anthony, Minnesota


The company expanded through the 1950s, mostly selling equipment built by other companies but also developing some custom-made devices. Bakken built a small pacemaker that could be strapped to the body and powered by batteries. Work in the new field later produced an implantable pacemaker in 1960. The company built headquarters in the Minneapolis suburb of St. Anthony, Minnesota, in 1960[12] and the company moved to Fridley in the 1970s. Medtronic's main competitors in the cardiac rhythm field include Boston Scientific and St. Jude Medical. In 1998, Medtronic acquired Physio-Control for $538 million.[13]
Animal rights[edit]
In 2005, 2008, and 2010 PETA threatened to submit a shareholder resolution to improve animal welfare standards in the company. In 2005, PETA attempted to stop five specific animal experiments that it deemed "crude and cruel". In 2008, PETA protested the outsourcing of animal testing to countries with lax animal welfare laws, such as China. In 2010, PETA attempted to stop Medtronic's reported use of live animals in testing and training. In response, Medtronic conducted a feasibility study that found that banning the use of live animals was impractical. Medtronic continues to use live animals for testing and training but has said that it will look for alternatives in the future. In each case, PETA withdrew its shareholder resolution after talks with Medtronic's leadership.[14][15]
Recent history[edit]
After 2008 and the global financial crisis, its stock value dropped dramatically. Despite sales and gross margins well above the average of most industries, with steady revenue growth since 2008 and a gross margin above 60%, Medtronic initiated a series of restructurings in 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011, including Physio-Control's spin-off for $487 million.[16] Its stock price now approaches pre-recession values.
In May 2014, Medtronic agreed to pay over $1 billion to settle patent litigation with Edwards Lifesciences, after years of protracted legal battles.[clarification needed][17]
In June 2014, Medtronic announced its acquisition, the largest in its history, of Covidien, plc of Ireland, for $42.9 billion in cash and stock.[18] Following the acquisition, Medtronic ceased to be a Minnesota-based company.

The surgical technologies business group designed and manufactured products for the diagnosis and treatment of ear, nose and throat (ENT) diseases and cranial, spinal and neurologic conditions. It also encompassed a surgical navigation division to design "StealthStation" systems, software and instruments for Computer Assisted Surgery (CAS) and a special intraoperative X-ray imaging system, known as the O-arm Imaging System. Many of the products are used for minimally-invasive surgical procedures. In 2016, the business unit was dissolved, and each site folded into new business groups.
Technology safety[edit]
In 2011, Jay Radcliffe, an independent black hat security researcher, revealed a security vulnerability in a Medtronic insulin pump, allowing an attacker to take control of the pump. Medtronic responded by assuring users of the full safety of its devices.[63]
In 2008, a team of computer security researchers was able to take remote control of a Medtronic cardiac implant. The team, using an unused implant in a lab, was able to control the electrical shocks delivered by the defibrillator component and even glean patient data from the device.[64]

History[edit]
Early history[edit]




Medtronic Operational Headquarters in Fridley, Minnesota, a suburb of Minneapolis.


Medtronic was founded in 1949 in northeastern Minneapolis by Earl Bakken and his brother-in-law, Palmer Hermundslie, as a medical equipment repair shop.[10]
Through his repair business, Bakken came to know C. Walton Lillehei, a doctor of heart surgery at the University of Minnesota Medical School. The deficiencies of the pacemakers of the day were made painfully obvious following a power outage over Halloween in 1957, which affected large sections of Minnesota and western Wisconsin.[11] A pacemaker-dependent paediatric patient of Lillehei died because of the blackout. The next day, Lillehei spoke with Bakken about developing some form of battery-powered pacemaker. Bakken modified a design for a transistorised metronome and created the first battery-powered external artificial pacemaker.




Medtronic's old headquarters in St. Anthony, Minnesota


The company expanded through the 1950s, mostly selling equipment built by other companies but also developing some custom-made devices. Bakken built a small pacemaker that could be strapped to the body and powered by batteries. Work in the new field later produced an implantable pacemaker in 1960. The company built headquarters in the Minneapolis suburb of St. Anthony, Minnesota, in 1960[12] and the company moved to Fridley in the 1970s. Medtronic's main competitors in the cardiac rhythm field include Boston Scientific and St. Jude Medical. In 1998, Medtronic acquired Physio-Control for $538 million.[13]
Animal rights[edit]
In 2005, 2008, and 2010 PETA threatened to submit a shareholder resolution to improve animal welfare standards in the company. In 2005, PETA attempted to stop five specific animal experiments that it deemed "crude and cruel". In 2008, PETA protested the outsourcing of animal testing to countries with lax animal welfare laws, such as China. In 2010, PETA attempted to stop Medtronic's reported use of live animals in testing and training. In response, Medtronic conducted a feasibility study that found that banning the use of live animals was impractical. Medtronic continues to use live animals for testing and training but has said that it will look for alternatives in the future. In each case, PETA withdrew its shareholder resolution after talks with Medtronic's leadership.[14][15]
Recent history[edit]
After 2008 and the global financial crisis, its stock value dropped dramatically. Despite sales and gross margins well above the average of most industries, with steady revenue growth since 2008 and a gross margin above 60%, Medtronic initiated a series of restructurings in 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011, including Physio-Control's spin-off for $487 million.[16] Its stock price now approaches pre-recession values.
In May 2014, Medtronic agreed to pay over $1 billion to settle patent litigation with Edwards Lifesciences, after years of protracted legal battles.[clarification needed][17]
In June 2014, Medtronic announced its acquisition, the largest in its history, of Covidien, plc of Ireland, for $42.9 billion in cash and stock.[18] Following the acquisition, Medtronic ceased to be a Minnesota-based company. It moved its headquarters to low-tax Ireland, allowing it to avoid taxation on more than $14 billion held overseas.[5][19]
In February 2016, the company announced that it would acquire Bellco from private equity firm Charme Capital Partners.[20]
In June 2016, the company announced its acquisition of HeartWare International Inc. for $1.1 billion.[21]

Business units[edit]
Medtronic has six main business units, which develop and manufacture devices and therapies to treat more than 30 chronic diseases, including heart failure, Parkinson's disease, urinary incontinence, Down's syndrome, obesity, chronic pain, spinal disorders and diabetes.
Cardiac rhythm disease management[edit]
Cardiac rhythm disease management is the oldest and largest of Medtronic's business units. Its work in heart rhythm therapies dates back to 1957, when Bakken developed the first wearable heart pacemaker to treat abnormally-slow heart rates. Since then, it has expanded its expertise in electrical stimulation to treat other cardiac rhythm diseases. It has also made an effort to address overall disease management by adding diagnostic and monitoring capabilities to many of its devices. An independently-operating Dutch pacemaker manufacturer, Vitatron, acquired by Medtronic in 1986, is now a European subsidiary of the unit.[50] Medtronic and Vitatron pacemakers are interrogated and programmed by Medtronic Carelink Model 2090 Programmer for Medtronic and Vitatron Devices; they use separate interfaces.[51]
In 2007, Medtronic recalled its Sprint Fidelis product, the flexible wires, or leads, which connect a defibrillator to the interior of the heart. The leads were found to be failing at an unacceptable rate, resulting in unnecessary shocks or no shocks when needed; either can be lethal. The scope of the problem continues to be a matter of research. Studies since the recall, disputed by Medtronic, suggest that the failure rate of already-implanted Sprint Fidelis leads is increasing exponentially. Medtronic's liability is limited by various court decisions.[52]
Spinal and biologics[edit]
Spinal and biologics is Medtronic's second-largest business. Medtronic is the world leader in spinal and musculoskeletal therapies. In 2007, Medtronic purchased Kyphon, a manufacturer and seller of spinal implants thst are necessary for procedures like kyphoplasty.[53]
In May 2008, Medtronic Spine agreed to pay the US government $75 million to settle a qui tam lawsuit after a whistleblower alleged that Medtronic committed Medicare fraud. The company was charged with illegally convincing healthcare providers to offer kyphoplasty, a spinal fracture repair surgery, as an inpatient, not an outpatient, procedure to make thousands of dollars more in profits per surgery.[54]
A "special report" by writer Steven Brill in Time showed that according to Medtronic's quarterly SEC filing of October 2012, the company had, on average, a 75.1% profit margin on its spine products and therapies.[55]
Cardiovascular[edit]
Medtronic's cardiovascular therapies span the major specialities of interventional cardiology, cardiac surgery and vascular surgery. The products are used to reduce the potentially debilitating effects of coronary, aortic and structural heart disease.
Neuromodulation[edit]
Neuromodulation is the second-oldest and third-largest department of Medtronic. Its products include neurostimulation systems and implantable drug delivery systems for chronic pain, common movement disorders and urologic and gastrointestinal disorders. It relies on innovative development methodologies to build cutting-edge medical technology devices, with embedded software. The department's revenues in 2014 amounted to $1.9 billion, or 11% of Medtronic’s total revenues.[56]
Diabetes[edit]
The diabetes management manufacturing and sales division of Medtronic is based in Northridge, California.[57] The original company, Minimed Technologies, was founded in the early 1980s by Alfred E. Mann and spun off from Pacesetter Systems to design a practical insulin pump for lifelong wear.[58] Most devices then were either too large or impossible to program and were extremely unreliable. The release of the lightweight, menu-driven MiniMed 500 series changed the landscape, and it was a major factor in bringing insulin pump usage to the mainstream.
In 1996, the MiniMed was redesigned by the innovation consulting RKS Design to look both more flashy and more elegant and to resemble a beeper. The friendliness of the device boosted adoption rate, and sales increased by 357%.[59] In the early 2000s, Medtronic purchased Minimed, to form Medtronic Minimed.[60]
On 11 May 2009, Medtronic announced it had chosen San Antonio, Texas, for the location of its new Diabetes Therapy Management and Education Center. The company announced that it expected 1400 new jobs would be created to staff the 150,000-square-foot (14,000 m2) facility.[61]
In September 2016, the FDA approved a device, MiniMed 670G, which automatically pumps insulin to a diabetic patient's body on sensing its absence or reduction.[62]
Surgical technologies[edit]

The surgical technologies business group designed and manufactured products for the diagnosis and treatment of ear, nose and throat (ENT) diseases and cranial, spinal and neurologic conditions. It also encompassed a surgical navigation division to design "StealthStation" systems, software and instruments for Computer Assisted Surgery (CAS) and a special intraoperative X-ray imaging system, known as the O-arm Imaging System. Many of the products are used for minimally-invasive surgical procedures. In 2016, the business unit was dissolved, and each site folded into new business groups.
Technology safety[edit]
In 2011, Jay Radcliffe, an independent black hat security researcher, revealed a security vulnerability in a Medtronic insulin pump, allowing an attacker to take control of the pump. Medtronic responded by assuring users of the full safety of its devices.[63]
In 2008, a team of computer security researchers was able to take remote control of a Medtronic cardiac implant. The team, using an unused implant in a lab, was able to control the electrical shocks delivered by the defibrillator component and even glean patient data from the device.[64]

Medtronic raises dividend by 7%, sets new $5 billion stock repurchase program
Medtronic PLC  said Friday it will raise its quarterly dividend by 7% to 46 cents a share from 43 cents a share. The new dividend will be payable July 26 to shareholders of record on July 7. The medical technology company also said it was authorizing the buyback of up to $5 billion worth of common stock, with no specific time period. The new authorization replaces the previous one set in 2015. Based on Thursday's stock closing price of $89.09, the new annual dividend rate of $1.84 implies a dividend yield of 2.07%, compared with the implied aggregate S&P 500  yield of 1.99%, according to FactSet. And $5 billion could buy back 56.1 million shares, or about 4.1% of the shares outstanding. The stock, which was still inactive in premarket trade, has rallied 25.1% year to date, while the S&P 500 has gained 8.7%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Announcement




Medtronic plc (NYSE: MDT) announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has classified the company's recently initiated voluntary field action related to its HVAD(TM) System Controllers (serial numbers lower than CON300000) and DC Adapters (all serial numbers for product code 1435) as a Class I recall.Medtronic began notifying clinicians outside of the United States in March 2017 about updated HVAD System Controllers and DC Adapters that were developed following two previously communicated Field Safety Notices that occurred in April 2015 and April 2016. The FDA approved the updated controller on April 7, 2017, and Medtronic began notifying U.S. clinicians about the updated HVAD Controllers and DC Adapters on April 14, 2017.The updated controller includes enhancements designed to address the potential safety issues identified in the previously communicated notices, including:strengthened power and serial port alignment guides intended to reduce the incidence of wear that could lead to damaged connector pins;functionality designed to monitor internal battery performance and sound an alert when the internal battery is nearing depletion; andredesigned connectors and housing intended to prevent the risk of connectors loosening or becoming more vulnerable to damage from exposure to water and other fluids.In addition, the updated controller introduces upgraded internal circuitry designed to improve overall device reliability.In April 2015 and April 2016, Medtronic notified clinicians about potential safety issues with the current HVAD System Controller that could lead to possible injury and death due to worn alignment guides, internal "double disconnect (no power) alarm" battery failure, and loose power and data connectors.With the introduction of the updated controller, Medtronic has begun to remove current HVAD Controllers (product codes 1400,1401US and 1407US) in select geographies, including the U.S. Medtronic also has begun to remove the related adapters (product code 1435), Instructions for Use, Patient Manuals and Emergency Responder Guides.As part of these activities, Medtronic has provided the following recommendations to physicians:Before the updated controller will be distributed to hospitals, clinicians must complete required training on the updated controller and updated product labeling, including the Instructions for Use and Patient Manual.Following training and the receipt of the updated controllers in hospital inventory, clinicians are requested to quarantine and replace patients' primary and backup HVAD Controllers and DC adapters under clinical supervision and at a hospital where patient support equipment is available.While Medtronic recommends that HVAD Controllers be exchanged, clinicians should weigh the benefits of the updated controller against the risks of a controller exchange procedure.When clinicians determine a controller exchange is appropriate, they will notify patients who should promptly schedule a controller exchange as soon as the updated controllers are available.Trained hospital staff must educate patients on using the updated controller.Patients with questions about this announcement should contact their physicians or ventricular assist device (VAD) coordinator at their hospital center.Adverse reactions or quality problems experienced with the use of this device may be reported to the FDA's MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting program either online, by regular mail or by fax:Complete and submit the report online: www.fda.gov/medwatch/report.htmRegular mail or fax: Download form www.fda.gov/MedWatch/getforms.htm or call +1-800-332-1088 to request a reporting form, then complete and return to the address on the pre-addressed form, or submit by fax to +1-800-FDA-0178For information or to report a problem, please contact the 24-hour Clinical Support line at +1-888-494-6365 or email FSCA@medtronic.com.About MedtronicMedtronic plc (www.medtronic.com), headquartered in Dublin, Ireland, is among the world's largest medical technology, services and solutions companies - alleviating pain, restoring health and extending life for millions of people around the world.

                                So simple
                            

                                Touchscreen technology makes the t:slim X2 Pump simple to learn and simple to use. The bright, color touch screen lets you conveniently deliver insulin and view your settings.
                            
























                                So durable
                            

                                The t:slim X2 Pump is ultrastrong. Its aluminum body is very durable and light, and the touchscreen is made of high-grade, shatter-resistant glass. Plus, the t:slim X2 Pump is watertight2, so you don’t have to worry if it accidentally gets wet.
                            
























                                So preferred
                            

                                The t:slim X2 Pump is based on the original t:slim Insulin Pump consistently ranked #1 by pump users for product features and consumer software.1  This reflects
the focus that Tandem Diabetes Care places on all aspects of using and owning an insulin pump, from cutting edge design, ease of use, expert training, unique and powerful features, professional 24-hour customer support, and interactive data management software.
                            
























                                So advanced
                            

The t:slim X2 Pump is compatible with the Tandem
Device Updater, a revolutionary new tool that allows users to update a pump’s software from a personal computer. Its first FDA-cleared use was to provide t:slim Pumps purchased before April 2015 an update to the latest software, but it has the potential to enable users to add new features in the future, independent of their insurance pump replacement cycle4. The t:slim X2 Pump also incorporates familiar technology such as an integrated micro-USB
port for convenient charging and fast data transfer speeds.

                                Even if you do everything right, there’s a big part of the picture you’re not seeing if you rely on finger sticks alone. Many people test less than 6 times per day. The t:slim G4™ System provides up to 288 readings per day, giving you insights that finger sticks can't.1,2

You can also quickly upload your insulin delivery and CGM data from your pump using the t:connect® Diabetes Management Application on either a Mac® or a PC, and generate reports for more in-depth analysis with your healthcare provider.

Indications for Use:

The t:slim G4™ Insulin Pump with Dexcom G4® Platinum CGM (“t:slim G4 System”) consists of the t:slim G4 Insulin Pump paired with the Dexcom G4 Platinum Sensor and Transmitter. The t:slim G4 Insulin Pump is intended for the subcutaneous delivery of insulin, at set and variable rates, for the management of diabetes mellitus in persons requiring insulin. The t:slim G4 Insulin Pump can be used solely for continuous insulin delivery and as part of the t:slim G4 System to receive and display continuous glucose measurements from the Dexcom G4 Platinum Sensor and Transmitter. The t:slim G4 System also includes continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) indicated for detecting trends and tracking patterns in persons with diabetes for use as an adjunctive device to complement, not replace, information obtained from standard home glucose monitoring devices. The t:slim G4 System aids in the detection of episodes of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, facilitating both acute and long-term therapy adjustments, which may minimize these excursions. Interpretation of the t:slim G4 System results should be based on the trends and patterns seen with several sequential readings over time. The t:slim G4 System is indicated for use in individuals 12 years of age and greater. The t:slim G4 System is intended for single patient use and requires a prescription.

                                So simple
                            

                                Touchscreen technology makes the t:slim X2 Pump simple to learn and simple to use. The bright, color touch screen lets you conveniently deliver insulin and view your settings.
                            
























                                So durable
                            

                                The t:slim X2 Pump is ultrastrong. Its aluminum body is very durable and light, and the touchscreen is made of high-grade, shatter-resistant glass. Plus, the t:slim X2 Pump is watertight2, so you don’t have to worry if it accidentally gets wet.
                            
























                                So preferred
                            

                                The t:slim X2 Pump is based on the original t:slim Insulin Pump consistently ranked #1 by pump users for product features and consumer software.1  This reflects
the focus that Tandem Diabetes Care places on all aspects of using and owning an insulin pump, from cutting edge design, ease of use, expert training, unique and powerful features, professional 24-hour customer support, and interactive data management software.
                            
























                                So advanced
                            

The t:slim X2 Pump is compatible with the Tandem
Device Updater, a revolutionary new tool that allows users to update a pump’s software from a personal computer. Its first FDA-cleared use was to provide t:slim Pumps purchased before April 2015 an update to the latest software, but it has the potential to enable users to add new features in the future, independent of their insurance pump replacement cycle4. The t:slim X2 Pump also incorporates familiar technology such as an integrated micro-USB
port for convenient charging and fast data transfer speeds.

					Programmed with

					Software you'll enjoy using :)




					Graphically program in Flow Charts and/or Ladder Logic to rapidly create custom applications. 

					We simplified the instruction set.  Our function set is comprehensive, easy to use and powerful.

					No hunting for features.  vBuilder’s layout keeps the tools and information you need in plain view.

					Warnings and Errors are presented in real time so there are no surprises at build.

					Tag based PLCs are easier to use than address based ones, but typically cost hundreds of dollars.

					Our entire line, starting at $49, is Tag based.

					Innovative Features

					We’ve developed some great features to help you get things done quicker and more reliably.

					Subroutines:

					Break projects up into manageable chunks, and allow program reuse.

					Objects:

					Isolate data and create logic components to greatly improve development efficiency,

					maintainability and reliability.

					Linked Subroutines:

					Specify that multiple subroutines should use the same Objects.  Maybe you’ve

					got an initialization routine you’d like in one subroutine, and a process you want in another.  

					They can share an object, so you don’t have to pass data between the two.




					View your data and create operator controls with

					Awesome, Free HMI




					We’re serious about delivering the easiest to use, most productive PLC software.

					We could go on about our features, but seeing is believing, so Check out our vBuilder page,

vFactory page or Download vBuilder and vFactory. They're

					FREE




					Meet Branch








					Expansion has a vLink input port instead of USB. 

					Expansions are otherwise physically identical to Branch Main. 

					Your Sensors and Actuators are Branched Out, 

					Your PLC Should Branch With Them! 







					Branch's unique structure beats backplane and brick systems 

					at getting IO where it’s need, helping you run shorter wires and keep an organized system 




					Smarter IO

					Expansion units have full PLC processing power and memory.




					vBuilder’s power shines with Branch 

					Put subroutines inside of IO units to focus processing where it’s most needed. 

					Debug your entire Branch system as a unit.  No need to debug one processor at a time. 

					Lets you view real-time data for your entire system. 













					PLC programming should be fun! 

					We’ve got engaging tutorials to get you up to speed on our PLCs, and more are on the way. 

					Whether you’re new to PLCs, or just new to us, we want your learning experience to be enjoyable. 

					The tutorials aren’t boring or difficult to follow, we promise. 

					FREE Connector Tool 

					For a limited time only, we’re giving away a FREE connector tool with every Order!




					Every order over $48 ships FREE 

					100% of our PLCs qualify for Free US standard shipping.
					We also ship to Canada and Mexico for $19.95.

					100% Satisfaction Guarantee 

					Shop with confidence, knowing that you are free to return any product for a full 30 days after 

					purchase and receive a full refund. 



					Choose your adventure...

History[edit]
Early history[edit]




Medtronic Operational Headquarters in Fridley, Minnesota, a suburb of Minneapolis.


Medtronic was founded in 1949 in northeastern Minneapolis by Earl Bakken and his brother-in-law, Palmer Hermundslie, as a medical equipment repair shop.[10]
Through his repair business, Bakken came to know C. Walton Lillehei, a doctor of heart surgery at the University of Minnesota Medical School. The deficiencies of the pacemakers of the day were made painfully obvious following a power outage over Halloween in 1957, which affected large sections of Minnesota and western Wisconsin.[11] A pacemaker-dependent paediatric patient of Lillehei died because of the blackout. The next day, Lillehei spoke with Bakken about developing some form of battery-powered pacemaker. Bakken modified a design for a transistorised metronome and created the first battery-powered external artificial pacemaker.




Medtronic's old headquarters in St. Anthony, Minnesota


The company expanded through the 1950s, mostly selling equipment built by other companies but also developing some custom-made devices. Bakken built a small pacemaker that could be strapped to the body and powered by batteries. Work in the new field later produced an implantable pacemaker in 1960. The company built headquarters in the Minneapolis suburb of St. Anthony, Minnesota, in 1960[12] and the company moved to Fridley in the 1970s. Medtronic's main competitors in the cardiac rhythm field include Boston Scientific and St. Jude Medical. In 1998, Medtronic acquired Physio-Control for $538 million.[13]
Animal rights[edit]
In 2005, 2008, and 2010 PETA threatened to submit a shareholder resolution to improve animal welfare standards in the company. In 2005, PETA attempted to stop five specific animal experiments that it deemed "crude and cruel". In 2008, PETA protested the outsourcing of animal testing to countries with lax animal welfare laws, such as China. In 2010, PETA attempted to stop Medtronic's reported use of live animals in testing and training. In response, Medtronic conducted a feasibility study that found that banning the use of live animals was impractical. Medtronic continues to use live animals for testing and training but has said that it will look for alternatives in the future. In each case, PETA withdrew its shareholder resolution after talks with Medtronic's leadership.[14][15]
Recent history[edit]
After 2008 and the global financial crisis, its stock value dropped dramatically. Despite sales and gross margins well above the average of most industries, with steady revenue growth since 2008 and a gross margin above 60%, Medtronic initiated a series of restructurings in 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011, including Physio-Control's spin-off for $487 million.[16] Its stock price now approaches pre-recession values.
In May 2014, Medtronic agreed to pay over $1 billion to settle patent litigation with Edwards Lifesciences, after years of protracted legal battles.[clarification needed][17]
In June 2014, Medtronic announced its acquisition, the largest in its history, of Covidien, plc of Ireland, for $42.9 billion in cash and stock.[18] Following the acquisition, Medtronic ceased to be a Minnesota-based company. It moved its headquarters to low-tax Ireland, allowing it to avoid taxation on more than $14 billion held overseas.[5][19]
In February 2016, the company announced that it would acquire Bellco from private equity firm Charme Capital Partners.[20]
In June 2016, the company announced its acquisition of HeartWare International Inc. for $1.1 billion.[21]

Business units[edit]
Medtronic has six main business units, which develop and manufacture devices and therapies to treat more than 30 chronic diseases, including heart failure, Parkinson's disease, urinary incontinence, Down's syndrome, obesity, chronic pain, spinal disorders and diabetes.
Cardiac rhythm disease management[edit]
Cardiac rhythm disease management is the oldest and largest of Medtronic's business units. Its work in heart rhythm therapies dates back to 1957, when Bakken developed the first wearable heart pacemaker to treat abnormally-slow heart rates. Since then, it has expanded its expertise in electrical stimulation to treat other cardiac rhythm diseases. It has also made an effort to address overall disease management by adding diagnostic and monitoring capabilities to many of its devices. An independently-operating Dutch pacemaker manufacturer, Vitatron, acquired by Medtronic in 1986, is now a European subsidiary of the unit.[50] Medtronic and Vitatron pacemakers are interrogated and programmed by Medtronic Carelink Model 2090 Programmer for Medtronic and Vitatron Devices; they use separate interfaces.[51]
In 2007, Medtronic recalled its Sprint Fidelis product, the flexible wires, or leads, which connect a defibrillator to the interior of the heart. The leads were found to be failing at an unacceptable rate, resulting in unnecessary shocks or no shocks when needed; either can be lethal. The scope of the problem continues to be a matter of research. Studies since the recall, disputed by Medtronic, suggest that the failure rate of already-implanted Sprint Fidelis leads is increasing exponentially. Medtronic's liability is limited by various court decisions.[52]
Spinal and biologics[edit]
Spinal and biologics is Medtronic's second-largest business. Medtronic is the world leader in spinal and musculoskeletal therapies. In 2007, Medtronic purchased Kyphon, a manufacturer and seller of spinal implants thst are necessary for procedures like kyphoplasty.[53]
In May 2008, Medtronic Spine agreed to pay the US government $75 million to settle a qui tam lawsuit after a whistleblower alleged that Medtronic committed Medicare fraud. The company was charged with illegally convincing healthcare providers to offer kyphoplasty, a spinal fracture repair surgery, as an inpatient, not an outpatient, procedure to make thousands of dollars more in profits per surgery.[54]
A "special report" by writer Steven Brill in Time showed that according to Medtronic's quarterly SEC filing of October 2012, the company had, on average, a 75.1% profit margin on its spine products and therapies.[55]
Cardiovascular[edit]
Medtronic's cardiovascular therapies span the major specialities of interventional cardiology, cardiac surgery and vascular surgery. The products are used to reduce the potentially debilitating effects of coronary, aortic and structural heart disease.
Neuromodulation[edit]
Neuromodulation is the second-oldest and third-largest department of Medtronic. Its products include neurostimulation systems and implantable drug delivery systems for chronic pain, common movement disorders and urologic and gastrointestinal disorders. It relies on innovative development methodologies to build cutting-edge medical technology devices, with embedded software. The department's revenues in 2014 amounted to $1.9 billion, or 11% of Medtronic’s total revenues.[56]
Diabetes[edit]
The diabetes management manufacturing and sales division of Medtronic is based in Northridge, California.[57] The original company, Minimed Technologies, was founded in the early 1980s by Alfred E. Mann and spun off from Pacesetter Systems to design a practical insulin pump for lifelong wear.[58] Most devices then were either too large or impossible to program and were extremely unreliable. The release of the lightweight, menu-driven MiniMed 500 series changed the landscape, and it was a major factor in bringing insulin pump usage to the mainstream.
In 1996, the MiniMed was redesigned by the innovation consulting RKS Design to look both more flashy and more elegant and to resemble a beeper. The friendliness of the device boosted adoption rate, and sales increased by 357%.[59] In the early 2000s, Medtronic purchased Minimed, to form Medtronic Minimed.[60]
On 11 May 2009, Medtronic announced it had chosen San Antonio, Texas, for the location of its new Diabetes Therapy Management and Education Center. The company announced that it expected 1400 new jobs would be created to staff the 150,000-square-foot (14,000 m2) facility.[61]
In September 2016, the FDA approved a device, MiniMed 670G, which automatically pumps insulin to a diabetic patient's body on sensing its absence or reduction.[62]
Surgical technologies[edit]




O-arm Surgical Imaging System. Federal Center of Neurosurgery in Tyumen, 2013


The surgical technologies business group designed and manufactured products for the diagnosis and treatment of ear, nose and throat (ENT) diseases and cranial, spinal and neurologic conditions. It also encompassed a surgical navigation division to design "StealthStation" systems, software and instruments for Computer Assisted Surgery (CAS) and a special intraoperative X-ray imaging system, known as the O-arm Imaging System. Many of the products are used for minimally-invasive surgical procedures. In 2016, the business unit was dissolved, and each site folded into new business groups.
Technology safety[edit]
In 2011, Jay Radcliffe, an independent black hat security researcher, revealed a security vulnerability in a Medtronic insulin pump, allowing an attacker to take control of the pump. Medtronic responded by assuring users of the full safety of its devices.[63]
In 2008, a team of computer security researchers was able to take remote control of a Medtronic cardiac implant. The team, using an unused implant in a lab, was able to control the electrical shocks delivered by the defibrillator component and even glean patient data from the device.[64]

History[edit]
Early history[edit]




Medtronic Operational Headquarters in Fridley, Minnesota, a suburb of Minneapolis.


Medtronic was founded in 1949 in northeastern Minneapolis by Earl Bakken and his brother-in-law, Palmer Hermundslie, as a medical equipment repair shop.[10]
Through his repair business, Bakken came to know C. Walton Lillehei, a doctor of heart surgery at the University of Minnesota Medical School. The deficiencies of the pacemakers of the day were made painfully obvious following a power outage over Halloween in 1957, which affected large sections of Minnesota and western Wisconsin.[11] A pacemaker-dependent paediatric patient of Lillehei died because of the blackout. The next day, Lillehei spoke with Bakken about developing some form of battery-powered pacemaker. Bakken modified a design for a transistorised metronome and created the first battery-powered external artificial pacemaker.




Medtronic's old headquarters in St. Anthony, Minnesota


The company expanded through the 1950s, mostly selling equipment built by other companies but also developing some custom-made devices. Bakken built a small pacemaker that could be strapped to the body and powered by batteries. Work in the new field later produced an implantable pacemaker in 1960. The company built headquarters in the Minneapolis suburb of St. Anthony, Minnesota, in 1960[12] and the company moved to Fridley in the 1970s. Medtronic's main competitors in the cardiac rhythm field include Boston Scientific and St. Jude Medical. In 1998, Medtronic acquired Physio-Control for $538 million.[13]
Animal rights[edit]
In 2005, 2008, and 2010 PETA threatened to submit a shareholder resolution to improve animal welfare standards in the company. In 2005, PETA attempted to stop five specific animal experiments that it deemed "crude and cruel". In 2008, PETA protested the outsourcing of animal testing to countries with lax animal welfare laws, such as China. In 2010, PETA attempted to stop Medtronic's reported use of live animals in testing and training. In response, Medtronic conducted a feasibility study that found that banning the use of live animals was impractical. Medtronic continues to use live animals for testing and training but has said that it will look for alternatives in the future. In each case, PETA withdrew its shareholder resolution after talks with Medtronic's leadership.[14][15]
Recent history[edit]
After 2008 and the global financial crisis, its stock value dropped dramatically. Despite sales and gross margins well above the average of most industries, with steady revenue growth since 2008 and a gross margin above 60%, Medtronic initiated a series of restructurings in 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011, including Physio-Control's spin-off for $487 million.[16] Its stock price now approaches pre-recession values.
In May 2014, Medtronic agreed to pay over $1 billion to settle patent litigation with Edwards Lifesciences, after years of protracted legal battles.[clarification needed][17]
In June 2014, Medtronic announced its acquisition, the largest in its history, of Covidien, plc of Ireland, for $42.9 billion in cash and stock.[18] Following the acquisition, Medtronic ceased to be a Minnesota-based company. It moved its headquarters to low-tax Ireland, allowing it to avoid taxation on more than $14 billion held overseas.[5][19]
In February 2016, the company announced that it would acquire Bellco from private equity firm Charme Capital Partners.[20]
In June 2016, the company announced its acquisition of HeartWare International Inc. for $1.1 billion.[21]

Business units[edit]
Medtronic has six main business units, which develop and manufacture devices and therapies to treat more than 30 chronic diseases, including heart failure, Parkinson's disease, urinary incontinence, Down's syndrome, obesity, chronic pain, spinal disorders and diabetes.
Cardiac rhythm disease management[edit]
Cardiac rhythm disease management is the oldest and largest of Medtronic's business units. Its work in heart rhythm therapies dates back to 1957, when Bakken developed the first wearable heart pacemaker to treat abnormally-slow heart rates. Since then, it has expanded its expertise in electrical stimulation to treat other cardiac rhythm diseases. It has also made an effort to address overall disease management by adding diagnostic and monitoring capabilities to many of its devices. An independently-operating Dutch pacemaker manufacturer, Vitatron, acquired by Medtronic in 1986, is now a European subsidiary of the unit.[50] Medtronic and Vitatron pacemakers are interrogated and programmed by Medtronic Carelink Model 2090 Programmer for Medtronic and Vitatron Devices; they use separate interfaces.[51]
In 2007, Medtronic recalled its Sprint Fidelis product, the flexible wires, or leads, which connect a defibrillator to the interior of the heart. The leads were found to be failing at an unacceptable rate, resulting in unnecessary shocks or no shocks when needed; either can be lethal. The scope of the problem continues to be a matter of research. Studies since the recall, disputed by Medtronic, suggest that the failure rate of already-implanted Sprint Fidelis leads is increasing exponentially. Medtronic's liability is limited by various court decisions.[52]
Spinal and biologics[edit]
Spinal and biologics is Medtronic's second-largest business. Medtronic is the world leader in spinal and musculoskeletal therapies. In 2007, Medtronic purchased Kyphon, a manufacturer and seller of spinal implants thst are necessary for procedures like kyphoplasty.[53]
In May 2008, Medtronic Spine agreed to pay the US government $75 million to settle a qui tam lawsuit after a whistleblower alleged that Medtronic committed Medicare fraud. The company was charged with illegally convincing healthcare providers to offer kyphoplasty, a spinal fracture repair surgery, as an inpatient, not an outpatient, procedure to make thousands of dollars more in profits per surgery.[54]
A "special report" by writer Steven Brill in Time showed that according to Medtronic's quarterly SEC filing of October 2012, the company had, on average, a 75.1% profit margin on its spine products and therapies.[55]
Cardiovascular[edit]
Medtronic's cardiovascular therapies span the major specialities of interventional cardiology, cardiac surgery and vascular surgery. The products are used to reduce the potentially debilitating effects of coronary, aortic and structural heart disease.
Neuromodulation[edit]
Neuromodulation is the second-oldest and third-largest department of Medtronic. Its products include neurostimulation systems and implantable drug delivery systems for chronic pain, common movement disorders and urologic and gastrointestinal disorders. It relies on innovative development methodologies to build cutting-edge medical technology devices, with embedded software. The department's revenues in 2014 amounted to $1.9 billion, or 11% of Medtronic’s total revenues.[56]
Diabetes[edit]
The diabetes management manufacturing and sales division of Medtronic is based in Northridge, California.[57] The original company, Minimed Technologies, was founded in the early 1980s by Alfred E. Mann and spun off from Pacesetter Systems to design a practical insulin pump for lifelong wear.[58] Most devices then were either too large or impossible to program and were extremely unreliable. The release of the lightweight, menu-driven MiniMed 500 series changed the landscape, and it was a major factor in bringing insulin pump usage to the mainstream.
In 1996, the MiniMed was redesigned by the innovation consulting RKS Design to look both more flashy and more elegant and to resemble a beeper. The friendliness of the device boosted adoption rate, and sales increased by 357%.[59] In the early 2000s, Medtronic purchased Minimed, to form Medtronic Minimed.[60]
On 11 May 2009, Medtronic announced it had chosen San Antonio, Texas, for the location of its new Diabetes Therapy Management and Education Center. The company announced that it expected 1400 new jobs would be created to staff the 150,000-square-foot (14,000 m2) facility.[61]
In September 2016, the FDA approved a device, MiniMed 670G, which automatically pumps insulin to a diabetic patient's body on sensing its absence or reduction.[62]
Surgical technologies[edit]




O-arm Surgical Imaging System. Federal Center of Neurosurgery in Tyumen, 2013


The surgical technologies business group designed and manufactured products for the diagnosis and treatment of ear, nose and throat (ENT) diseases and cranial, spinal and neurologic conditions. It also encompassed a surgical navigation division to design "StealthStation" systems, software and instruments for Computer Assisted Surgery (CAS) and a special intraoperative X-ray imaging system, known as the O-arm Imaging System. Many of the products are used for minimally-invasive surgical procedures. In 2016, the business unit was dissolved, and each site folded into new business groups.
Technology safety[edit]
In 2011, Jay Radcliffe, an independent black hat security researcher, revealed a security vulnerability in a Medtronic insulin pump, allowing an attacker to take control of the pump. Medtronic responded by assuring users of the full safety of its devices.[63]
In 2008, a team of computer security researchers was able to take remote control of a Medtronic cardiac implant. The team, using an unused implant in a lab, was able to control the electrical shocks delivered by the defibrillator component and even glean patient data from the device.[64]

History[edit]
Early history[edit]




Medtronic Operational Headquarters in Fridley, Minnesota, a suburb of Minneapolis.


Medtronic was founded in 1949 in northeastern Minneapolis by Earl Bakken and his brother-in-law, Palmer Hermundslie, as a medical equipment repair shop.[10]
Through his repair business, Bakken came to know C. Walton Lillehei, a doctor of heart surgery at the University of Minnesota Medical School. The deficiencies of the pacemakers of the day were made painfully obvious following a power outage over Halloween in 1957, which affected large sections of Minnesota and western Wisconsin.[11] A pacemaker-dependent paediatric patient of Lillehei died because of the blackout. The next day, Lillehei spoke with Bakken about developing some form of battery-powered pacemaker. Bakken modified a design for a transistorised metronome and created the first battery-powered external artificial pacemaker.




Medtronic's old headquarters in St. Anthony, Minnesota


The company expanded through the 1950s, mostly selling equipment built by other companies but also developing some custom-made devices. Bakken built a small pacemaker that could be strapped to the body and powered by batteries. Work in the new field later produced an implantable pacemaker in 1960. The company built headquarters in the Minneapolis suburb of St. Anthony, Minnesota, in 1960[12] and the company moved to Fridley in the 1970s. Medtronic's main competitors in the cardiac rhythm field include Boston Scientific and St. Jude Medical. In 1998, Medtronic acquired Physio-Control for $538 million.[13]
Animal rights[edit]
In 2005, 2008, and 2010 PETA threatened to submit a shareholder resolution to improve animal welfare standards in the company. In 2005, PETA attempted to stop five specific animal experiments that it deemed "crude and cruel". In 2008, PETA protested the outsourcing of animal testing to countries with lax animal welfare laws, such as China. In 2010, PETA attempted to stop Medtronic's reported use of live animals in testing and training. In response, Medtronic conducted a feasibility study that found that banning the use of live animals was impractical. Medtronic continues to use live animals for testing and training but has said that it will look for alternatives in the future. In each case, PETA withdrew its shareholder resolution after talks with Medtronic's leadership.[14][15]
Recent history[edit]
After 2008 and the global financial crisis, its stock value dropped dramatically. Despite sales and gross margins well above the average of most industries, with steady revenue growth since 2008 and a gross margin above 60%, Medtronic initiated a series of restructurings in 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011, including Physio-Control's spin-off for $487 million.[16] Its stock price now approaches pre-recession values.
In May 2014, Medtronic agreed to pay over $1 billion to settle patent litigation with Edwards Lifesciences, after years of protracted legal battles.[clarification needed][17]
In June 2014, Medtronic announced its acquisition, the largest in its history, of Covidien, plc of Ireland, for $42.9 billion in cash and stock.[18] Following the acquisition, Medtronic ceased to be a Minnesota-based company. It moved its headquarters to low-tax Ireland, allowing it to avoid taxation on more than $14 billion held overseas.[5][19]
In February 2016, the company announced that it would acquire Bellco from private equity firm Charme Capital Partners.[20]
In June 2016, the company announced its acquisition of HeartWare International Inc. for $1.1 billion.[21]

Business units[edit]
Medtronic has six main business units, which develop and manufacture devices and therapies to treat more than 30 chronic diseases, including heart failure, Parkinson's disease, urinary incontinence, Down's syndrome, obesity, chronic pain, spinal disorders and diabetes.
Cardiac rhythm disease management[edit]
Cardiac rhythm disease management is the oldest and largest of Medtronic's business units. Its work in heart rhythm therapies dates back to 1957, when Bakken developed the first wearable heart pacemaker to treat abnormally-slow heart rates. Since then, it has expanded its expertise in electrical stimulation to treat other cardiac rhythm diseases. It has also made an effort to address overall disease management by adding diagnostic and monitoring capabilities to many of its devices. An independently-operating Dutch pacemaker manufacturer, Vitatron, acquired by Medtronic in 1986, is now a European subsidiary of the unit.[50] Medtronic and Vitatron pacemakers are interrogated and programmed by Medtronic Carelink Model 2090 Programmer for Medtronic and Vitatron Devices; they use separate interfaces.[51]
In 2007, Medtronic recalled its Sprint Fidelis product, the flexible wires, or leads, which connect a defibrillator to the interior of the heart. The leads were found to be failing at an unacceptable rate, resulting in unnecessary shocks or no shocks when needed; either can be lethal. The scope of the problem continues to be a matter of research. Studies since the recall, disputed by Medtronic, suggest that the failure rate of already-implanted Sprint Fidelis leads is increasing exponentially. Medtronic's liability is limited by various court decisions.[52]
Spinal and biologics[edit]
Spinal and biologics is Medtronic's second-largest business. Medtronic is the world leader in spinal and musculoskeletal therapies. In 2007, Medtronic purchased Kyphon, a manufacturer and seller of spinal implants thst are necessary for procedures like kyphoplasty.[53]
In May 2008, Medtronic Spine agreed to pay the US government $75 million to settle a qui tam lawsuit after a whistleblower alleged that Medtronic committed Medicare fraud. The company was charged with illegally convincing healthcare providers to offer kyphoplasty, a spinal fracture repair surgery, as an inpatient, not an outpatient, procedure to make thousands of dollars more in profits per surgery.[54]
A "special report" by writer Steven Brill in Time showed that according to Medtronic's quarterly SEC filing of October 2012, the company had, on average, a 75.1% profit margin on its spine products and therapies.[55]
Cardiovascular[edit]
Medtronic's cardiovascular therapies span the major specialities of interventional cardiology, cardiac surgery and vascular surgery. The products are used to reduce the potentially debilitating effects of coronary, aortic and structural heart disease.
Neuromodulation[edit]
Neuromodulation is the second-oldest and third-largest department of Medtronic. Its products include neurostimulation systems and implantable drug delivery systems for chronic pain, common movement disorders and urologic and gastrointestinal disorders. It relies on innovative development methodologies to build cutting-edge medical technology devices, with embedded software. The department's revenues in 2014 amounted to $1.9 billion, or 11% of Medtronic’s total revenues.[56]
Diabetes[edit]
The diabetes management manufacturing and sales division of Medtronic is based in Northridge, California.[57] The original company, Minimed Technologies, was founded in the early 1980s by Alfred E. Mann and spun off from Pacesetter Systems to design a practical insulin pump for lifelong wear.[58] Most devices then were either too large or impossible to program and were extremely unreliable. The release of the lightweight, menu-driven MiniMed 500 series changed the landscape, and it was a major factor in bringing insulin pump usage to the mainstream.
In 1996, the MiniMed was redesigned by the innovation consulting RKS Design to look both more flashy and more elegant and to resemble a beeper. The friendliness of the device boosted adoption rate, and sales increased by 357%.[59] In the early 2000s, Medtronic purchased Minimed, to form Medtronic Minimed.[60]
On 11 May 2009, Medtronic announced it had chosen San Antonio, Texas, for the location of its new Diabetes Therapy Management and Education Center. The company announced that it expected 1400 new jobs would be created to staff the 150,000-square-foot (14,000 m2) facility.[61]
In September 2016, the FDA approved a device, MiniMed 670G, which automatically pumps insulin to a diabetic patient's body on sensing its absence or reduction.[62]
Surgical technologies[edit]




O-arm Surgical Imaging System. Federal Center of Neurosurgery in Tyumen, 2013


The surgical technologies business group designed and manufactured products for the diagnosis and treatment of ear, nose and throat (ENT) diseases and cranial, spinal and neurologic conditions. It also encompassed a surgical navigation division to design "StealthStation" systems, software and instruments for Computer Assisted Surgery (CAS) and a special intraoperative X-ray imaging system, known as the O-arm Imaging System. Many of the products are used for minimally-invasive surgical procedures. In 2016, the business unit was dissolved, and each site folded into new business groups.
Technology safety[edit]
In 2011, Jay Radcliffe, an independent black hat security researcher, revealed a security vulnerability in a Medtronic insulin pump, allowing an attacker to take control of the pump. Medtronic responded by assuring users of the full safety of its devices.[63]
In 2008, a team of computer security researchers was able to take remote control of a Medtronic cardiac implant. The team, using an unused implant in a lab, was able to control the electrical shocks delivered by the defibrillator component and even glean patient data from the device.[64]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Industrial Automation: Answers for Manufacturing Productivity




The most forward-thinking companies turn to Siemens every day for answers that enable smart, fast and lean manufacturing. Driven by a nearly universal client requirement to drive process efficiency, our industrial automation solutions are rigorously engineered to:



Assess client technology and efficiency needs
Build a tailored plan that drives quick time to value
Deploy sensors to monitor manufacturing process performance
Automate processes using software, data and logic controllers





  Schlafly Hops Over Growth Limits  
With growing demand for craft brewed beer and limited expansion potential, Schlafly needed to increase output within their brewery, while maintaining the quality of their craft beer brews.
Schlafly automated brewing tasks, introduced process controls and systematically applied data intelligence using industrial automation technology from Siemens.
The brewery was able to increase process efficiency by 30%, while improving product consistency.













 The BRAUMAT process control system is based on a SIMATIC PCS 7 platform. It took over routine functions like turning on pumps and the opening and closing of valves. Those functions now happen consistently and on time – taking minutes off the average brew cycle.

The kind of transformation going on at Schlafly Bottleworks is just one example of how Siemens industrial automation solutions are helping our customers stay ahead of the competition.
















  Dependable Technology from a Trusted Partner  

Siemens industrial automation technology and deep domain expertise drives process efficiency, enables quality control and lowers operating costs. Working with clients to understand their manufacturing challenges, Siemens solutions include:


 Advanced process control technology such as SIMATIC PCS 7, which provide a solid foundation to optimize manufacturing with sensors, software and logic control mechanisms.
 Industry-specific process engineering expertise across diverse industries such as chemicals, food & beverage, glass, solar, water treatment technologies and pharmaceuticals.
 Consulting and lifecycle management services through a global delivery network of in-house experts, solution providers and OEM suppliers.
 Legacy system integration or migration projects with a focus on reducing total cost of ownership and delivering quick time to value.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
