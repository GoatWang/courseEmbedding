The Treatment That's Helping Transform the Lives of Patients With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia









We are actively developing treatments for our patients in six important therapeutic areas: Cardiovascular & Metabolism, Immunology, Infectious Diseases & Vaccines, Neuroscience, Oncology and Pulmonary Hypertension.




Immunology
Our vision is a world free from immune diseases. To achieve this, we will translate internal and external science to deliver products that address immune-mediated diseases. 






We have a strong history of delivering novel medicines for immunological diseases. We continue to build a pipeline of innovative biologic and oral therapies in core disease areas: rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel diseases and psoriasis. Through our ongoing efforts in discovery, biomarkers, clinical research and external innovation, we are poised for continued leadership and growth, bringing transformational medicines to patients and healthcare professionals around the world.

Our vision is a world free from immune diseases. To achieve this, we will translate internal and external science to deliver products that treat, cure, intercept, and prevent immune-mediated diseases.

— Sue Dillon,
Global Therapeutic Head, Immunology, Janssen



















Cardiovascular & Metabolic Disease 
Our vision is to improve the lives of the millions of people with cardiovascular disease and diabetes, and to work tirelessly to eliminate these diseases.






Every year, more than 19 million people around the world die from cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. This tremendous global burden compels us to develop new therapies that will change the face of these diseases with the goal to eliminate them. We focus on finding and developing truly transformational therapies that target underlying disease pathways, important pathways, and novel mechanisms of action. We continue to seek and develop the next generation of transformational cardiovascular & metabolic therapies. 
Visit the Janssen Website












Our deep scientific expertise and demonstrated clinical development capabilities support our commitment to aggressively develop and launch transformational therapies for patients with cardiovascular and metabolic diseases.

— James List, M.D., Ph.D.,
Global Therapeutic Area Head, Cardiovascular & Metabolism



















Pulmonary Hypertension
For almost two decades, Actelion, a Janssen Pharmaceutical Company of Johnson & Johnson, has been working to fundamentally change the way pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is treated. 






Pulmonary hypertension refers to high blood vessel pressure in the lungs, and PAH is a rare, progressive form of this often-debilitating condition. While the disease affects more women than men, it can also develop in children of any age and across all ethnicities. About 15 people out of every million are affected by PAH. Our understanding of the complex pathways and molecular mechanisms of PAH has enabled us to develop tailored medicines to improve patient outcomes and make a difference for people around the world living with this disorder.

We are actively developing treatments for our patients in six important therapeutic areas, including Infectious Diseases & Vaccines, Neuroscience, and Oncology.




Infectious Diseases & Vaccines
We strive to discover and develop novel therapeutics and vaccines to treat and cure infectious diseases worldwide, improving treatment outcomes and patients’ lives. 






Our vision is to advance human health by helping to achieve a world free of life-threatening infectious diseases. We will do this by discovering and developing transformational therapies and vaccines that prevent, treat and cure some of the world’s most life-threatening infectious diseases such as HIV, viral hepatitis, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza and Ebola.

11 of our prescription medicines are on the World Health Organization’s list of Essential Medications.












Neuroscience
Our mission is to reduce the burden, disability and devastation caused by serious neuro psychiatric diseases and pain conditions. 






The research priorities of our Neuroscience Therapeutic Area include Alzheimer’s Disease, Mood Disorders and Schizophrenia. Across neuroscience, our researchers are exploring the emerging science of synaptic plasticity and cellular resilience, with an emphasis on developing novel therapeutics for the treatment of severe mood disorders and neurodegenerative dementias. We are deeply committed to patients with these conditions and to the health care professionals and loved ones who care for them.

Janssen is leading efforts to discover and develop innovative therapeutic solutions for people with brain disorders and to eliminate the social stigma about these diseases.

— Husseini Manji, M.D., F.R.C.P.C.,
Global Therapeutic Area Head, Neuroscience

We are committed to delivering targeted therapies to fight the devastation of cancer.

Personal & Companion Care for Seniors | Starlight Caregivers










 
 
 
 
 

















Personal & Companion Care
Descriptions of StarLight CareGivers Companion Care and Personal Care Services.
What is Personal Care?
Oftentimes, seniors and the disabled are uncomfortable having family members support them with highly personal tasks like bathing and toileting. Having a caregiver outside the family network to help with these duties allows these individuals to maintain his or her sense of dignity. Some personal care examples include:

Bathing and Hygiene 


It's no surprise that good personal hygiene is very important to the physical and mental well-being of all of us. Our caregivers are specially trained in personal hygiene and other personal care services, and always focus on preserving the dignity, comfort, and health of each client.


Walking Assistance, Mobility, and Posture Positioning

Our clients benefit from regular movement which results in improvements physically and mentally. This movement helps with digestion and circulation, and stimulates the mind with new sights and sounds of different rooms or the fresh air of outdoors Our caregivers carefully consider the physical limitations and comfort of each individual's ability to walk, climb stairs, get in and out of vehicles, chairs, beds, bathrooms and other routine movements. We also make sure each client maintains proper posture for eating or while sitting and reading or watching television.


Toileting Care

Our specialized caregivers are trained and experienced in assisting with urinary and bowel care, with the utmost attention given to a client's comfort and self-esteem.


Oral Hygiene

Our caregivers can help our clients with mouth, gum, and denture care to encourage better overall oral hygiene. Caregivers will carefully brush and floss teeth, gums, and the tongue, as well as the removal and replacement of dentures.




What is Companion Care?
We offer wide range of companion care services which can be carried out in the home, in the hospital, or in various healthcare facilities.


Regular Visits, Conversation, and Company

Having a regular visitor with common interests or other special qualities can be something to look forward to on a daily basis, and this can make all the difference in the world to someone living alone or home alone during the day or night. This can be as simple as walking and talking, watching movies together, or even a trip to the bowling alley for the adventurous. We match the caregiver to the clients' interests.


Medication Reminders


Our caregivers cannot administer medications, but they can provide regular reminders for oral medications or injections and the monitoring of side effects or other medical issues. We also offer a video-based monitoring solution where loved-ones can participate through an internet connection.


Special Diets, Meal Preparation, Eating Assistance

Cooking and cleaning up is our job. Our caregivers can prepare regular meals focused on maintaining a healthy diet and sufficient nutrition. We are happy to do the shopping and prepare meals per the client's specific direction or meal plan, or we can get creative with other healthy options. In fact, we encourage and provide incentive to our caregivers to take cooking classes. Due to some of our client's physical and emotional challenges in the ability to perform basic functions, like the act of eating, our caregivers provide exceptional sensitivity, care, and safety for these challenges.


Light Housekeeping


Leave the cleaning to us! Safety and cleanliness in the home are very important, and our caregivers provide services including vacuuming, dusting, trash removal, organizing and tidying, and the thorough cleaning of kitchens and bathrooms. We cannot do such tasks as lifting or moving furniture, or washing windows, but we are happy to provide quality referrals when asked.


Laundry Services

We clean and organize clothes and linens. Our caregivers can do the wash, dry, fold, iron and organize clothing, bed linens, and towels into closets and drawers. Laundry can pile up fast, and can be difficult to manage for people due to physical restrictions. Let us help keep the home clean and safe.


Shopping, Errands, and Transportation

Stocking the refrigerator with fresh goods from the grocer, getting medications at the pharmacy, and a trip to the doctor are typical services in this category. But some customers also need a ride to a friend's home, a movie theatre, or various other social and recreational activities. Our caregivers provide a safe journey using their own vehicle, or if required, the client's vehicle. Proper insurance and clean driving records are checked and mandatory.


Mail and Paperwork Organization


We can help when the mail is piling up and bills are not being paid. At the specific direction of our clients, our caregivers can assist with opening and reading mail, keep track of bills and other important documents, and help to organize household mail and other paperwork.


Live-In Services

Clients and their families may need to have regular care administered by a caregiver who resides in the home. We provide these special 24-hour care arrangements whether it be temporary or more permanent. Call for details.


Technology Services

We also offer unique technology to supplement our caregiving service which can bring loved ones piece of mind. Client's families can see exactly when caregivers have checked into and out of the home, and review any notes the caregiver may have taken. The caregiver can also receive specific notes from loved ones on what to watch for or relay special needs for the day.
We also offer a unique web-based video service that is user friendly for seniors, and a variety of emergency response devices in case of a fall or other special conditions.


Respite Care

Families need a break to maintain their own health. This is critical as caregiving can be immensely stressful. We can help relieve this stress of caring for a loved one by providing a much-needed break to primary caregivers.

Experienced Professional Insured Caregivers | Starlight Caregivers










 
 
 
 
 

















About Our Caregivers
Join our Team

StarLight CareGivers are our direct employees, not contractors. They are fully insured, including workers compensation and liability insurance, and they are bonded by us. This totally protects clients and places full responsibility on the agency. Do not be misled by a registry service that may send an unqualified, un-insured stranger into your loved ones home. StarLight is also responsible for all caregiver benefits, tax withholding, and employer contributions for federal and state unemployment insurance.


We differentiate from other home care services by selecting only the best and experienced caregivers, and that means roughly 5% of applicants are hired, most of which are certified nurse assistants (CNA) or certified home health aides (HHA). A rigorous 12 step interview process focuses on both personality and qualifications combined. This process includes hiring only experienced caregivers, training and re-training to our standards, checking references, doing national criminal background checks, reviewing driving records and proof of auto insurance, drug testing, screening for tuberculosis (TB), fingerprinting, and using E-Verify. We also provide our caregivers with continuous education on the latest developments in elder care.
Our caregivers are our employees and greatest asset, we manage all aspects of taxes, benefits, and workers compensation – all of these elements are critical in protecting and shielding our customers and allows StarLight CareGivers to provide these premium services.
We carefully select a perfect match caregiver for our clients and guarantee the right person for the job is on the job. These unique profiles are set up during our detailed assessment process with clients to understand their care needs and special interests, and also during the hiring process with our caregivers to characterize their skills and interests. These matching models are represented in our custom care plan.
