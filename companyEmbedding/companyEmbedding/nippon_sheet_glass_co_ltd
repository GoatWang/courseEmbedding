About NSG GroupMaking a Difference to our World throughGlass TechnologyCompany OverviewThe Mission of the NSG Group is to be the global leader in innovative high performance glass and glazing solutions, contributing to energy conservation and generation, working safely and ethically.
The Group is one of the world's leading manufacturers of glass and glazing systems in three business areas: Architectural; Automotive; and Technical Glass.
Founded in 1918, NSG acquired the leading UK-based glass manufacturer Pilkington plc in June 2006. Today, the Company has combined sales of JPY 580.8 billion, with manufacturing operations around the world and sales in over 100 countries, employing some 27,000 people worldwide.
We operate in three main sectors. Architectural supplies glass for architectural and Solar Energy applications. Automotive serves the original equipment, aftermarket replacement and specialized transport glazing markets. Technical Glass products include very thin glass for displays, lenses and light guides for printers, and glass fiber, used in battery separators and engine timing belts.
We have major market shares in most building and automotive product markets of the world, with a broad geographic reach, enabling us to respond to customers whose operations, particularly in the case of Automotive OE, are increasingly global.
Geographically, 38 per cent of the Group's sales are in Europe, 25 per cent in Japan and 20 per cent in North America, with the remaining 17 per cent being generated mainly in South America, China and South East Asia.

The non-exclusive license grants UMU Products, a subsidiary of world-leading glass manufacturer Nippon Sheet Glass, the right to manufacture and sell SPD-SmartGlass products including windows, doors, solar shading screens, curtainwalls, skylights and other intelligent smart glass architectural products. The license provides for a 15% royalty to Research Frontiers on sales of licensed SPD-SmartGlass products. The minimum annual royalties and other fees and license terms were not disclosed.Research Frontiers is the developer and licensor of patented SPD-Smart light-control film technology. SPD-Smart light-control film transforms widely used products -- windows, skylights and more -- into products that instantly and precisely control the light, glare and heat entering a home, office, or vehicle. SPD-SmartGlass is instantly tunable to an infinite number of light transmission states regardless of window size, and easily adapts to individual preferences using control devices ranging from dimmer switches and photosensors, to those that are integrated into smart homes or intelligent office control and building management systems. The unequalled performance characteristics of SPD-SmartGlass help optimize energy-saving daylight harvesting benefits and many other desired outcomes such as increased security, noise reduction and protection from harmful ultraviolet light.Yuichi Yano, President of UMU Products, noted: "Because of our prior experience with SPD-SmartGlass in the automotive industry for Mercedes, and our expertise with liquid crystal windows, we have gained tremendous experience with the efficient production and reliability of SPD-SmartGlass products. We bring this expertise, combined with the benefits of SPD-SmartGlass, to our customers for various applications, including some in the works right now which will be industry firsts."Joseph M. Harary, President and CEO of Research Frontiers, noted: "We have worked closely with NSG and UMU for years though their involvement with Nippon Sheet Glass, which owns Pilkington. Pilkington currently supplies Mercedes with the SPD-SmartGlass MAGIC SKY CONTROL roofs for the Mercedes SLC and SL Roadsters. They have also brought many high-performing and elegant architectural glass products to the market, and we look forward to the new uses for SPD-SmartGlass that they are working on with their customers. Some of these products add complimentary technologies and materials to bring to the consumer the benefits of SPD-SmartGlass in new, unique and highly visible ways. As a film-based dimmable glass technology, SPD-SmartGlass is an enabling technology that can serve as the foundation for products that deliver unprecedented additional benefits using complementary innovative technologies. We are excited for consumers to see what NSG, UMU and their customers are working on using SPD-SmartGlass technology."About Nippon Sheet Glass and NSG UMU Products Co., Ltd.NSG UMU products is a subsidiary of Nippon Sheet Glass.

How Venezuela chaos could spark oil rally OPEC has failed to achieve 
              
              Political and economic turmoil in Venezuela could fuel a rise in oil prices—something the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, despite it’s efforts to cut back production, hasn’t been able to do.

Nippon Sheet Glass’ UMU Products Subsidiary to Produce SPD-SmartGlass Architectural Window Products Licensed by Research Frontiers


									January 17, 2017

Nippon Sheet Glass’ UMU Products Subsidiary to Produce SPD-SmartGlass Architectural Window Products Licensed by Research Frontiers.doc – Word File
Chiba, Japan and Woodbury, New York. January 17, 2017 – Research Frontiers (Nasdaq: REFR) and NSG UMU Products Co., Ltd. announced today that UMU Products has acquired a license from Research Frontiers Inc. to produce and sell SPD-SmartGlass architectural intelligent products throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico, Japan, the People’s Republic of China and Taiwan. The non-exclusive license grants UMU Products, a subsidiary of world-leading glass manufacturer Nippon Sheet Glass, the right to manufacture and sell SPD-SmartGlass products including windows, doors, solar shading screens, curtainwalls, skylights and other intelligent smart glass architectural products. The license provides for a 15% royalty to Research Frontiers on sales of licensed SPD-SmartGlass products. The minimum annual royalties and other fees and license terms were not disclosed.
Research Frontiers is the developer and licensor of patented SPD-Smart light-control film technology. SPD-Smart light-control film transforms widely used products – windows, skylights and more – into products that instantly and precisely control the light, glare and heat entering a home, office, or vehicle. SPD-SmartGlass is instantly tunable to an infinite number of light transmission states regardless of window size, and easily adapts to individual preferences using control devices ranging from dimmer switches and photosensors, to those that are integrated into smart homes or intelligent office control and building management systems. The unequalled performance characteristics of SPD-SmartGlass help optimize energy-saving daylight harvesting benefits and many other desired outcomes such as increased security, noise reduction and protection from harmful ultraviolet light.
Yuichi Yano, President of UMU Products, noted: “Because of our prior experience with SPD-SmartGlass in the automotive industry for Mercedes, and our expertise with liquid crystal windows, we have gained tremendous experience with the efficient production and reliability of SPD-SmartGlass products. We bring this expertise, combined with the benefits of SPD-SmartGlass, to our customers for various applications, including some in the works right now which will be industry firsts.”
Joseph M. Harary, President and CEO of Research Frontiers, noted: “We have worked closely with NSG and UMU for years though their involvement with Nippon Sheet Glass, which owns Pilkington. Pilkington currently supplies Mercedes with the SPD-SmartGlass MAGIC SKY CONTROL roofs for the Mercedes SLC and SL Roadsters. They have also brought many high-performing and elegant architectural glass products to the market, and we look forward to the new uses for SPD-SmartGlass that they are working on with their customers. Some of these products add complimentary technologies and materials to bring to the consumer the benefits of SPD-SmartGlass in new, unique and highly visible ways. As a film-based dimmable glass technology, SPD-SmartGlass is an enabling technology that can serve as the foundation for products that deliver unprecedented additional benefits using complementary innovative technologies. We are excited for consumers to see what NSG, UMU and their customers are working on using SPD-SmartGlass technology.”
About Nippon Sheet Glass and NSG UMU Products Co., Ltd.
NSG UMU products is a subsidiary of Nippon Sheet Glass. NSG UMU currently develops, manufactures and sell products applying liquid crystal technology, serving a wide range of fields from construction to various other industries. It is a company that provides its customers with solutions related to light and comfort. Founded in 1918, NSG acquired the leading UK-based glass manufacturer Pilkington in June 2006. Today, the Nippon Sheet Glass Group has combined sales of just over JPY 629 billion ($5.35 billion), with manufacturing operations in 28 countries and sales in 130 countries, employing approximately 27,000 people worldwide. The Nippon Sheet Glass Group is one of the world’s leading manufacturers of glass and glazing systems.
About Research Frontiers Inc. 
Research Frontiers is the developer of SPD-Smart light-control technology, the world’s best-selling smart window technology, which allows users to instantly, precisely and uniformly control the shading of glass or plastic, either manually or automatically. Research Frontiers has built an infrastructure of over 40 licensed companies that collectively are capable of serving the growing global demand for smart glass products in automobiles, homes, buildings, museums, aircraft and boats.

BBB Rating System Overview














Customer Review Rating:









                        The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business.
                        The Customer Review Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive,
                        neutral, and negative reviews posted.

Composite Score:





                        Fab Glass and Mirror LLC has received 5 out of 5 stars based on 4 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

Nippon Sheet Glass Co., Ltd. (日本板硝子株式会社, Nihon Ita-Garasu Kabushiki-gaisha) is a Japanese glass manufacturing company. In 2006 it purchased Pilkington of the United Kingdom. This makes NSG/Pilkington one of the four largest glass companies in the world alongside another Japanese company Asahi Glass, Saint-Gobain, and Guardian Industries.
The company is listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the Nikkei 225 stock index.[3]

History[edit]
The company was established in November 1918 as America Japan Sheet Glass Co., Ltd. with its head office in Osaka, after it obtained technology from Libbey Owens Ford Glass Co. of the United States to produce flat glass using the Colburn process. The company changed its name to the Nippon Sheet Glass Co., Ltd. in January 1931. It expanded operations across Japan post World War II, and in October 1970 acquired Nippon Safety Glass Co., Ltd. In April 1999 the company merged with Nippon Glass Fiber Co., Ltd. and Micro Optics Co., Ltd. In Apr 2001 the company acquired Nippon Muki Co., Ltd. and in July 2004 moved the registered head office from Osaka to Minato Ward in Tokyo.[4]
Pilkington[edit]
In 1986, Pilkington bought Libbey Owens Ford. Following an agreed acquisition of 20% of Pilkington of the United Kingdom in 2001, in 2006 NSG purchased the residual 80% of shares, a company then double its size.
Present[edit]
Founded in 1918, NSG acquired the leading UK-based glass manufacturer Pilkington plc in June 2006. Today, the enlarged company has combined sales of approximately JPY 600 billion, with manufacturing operations in 29 countries and sales in 130 countries, employing some 28,500 people worldwide.
The Group's Flat Glass businesses, encompassing Building Products and Automotive Products, account for 90 per cent of annual sales, with the balance being in Specialty Glass. The Specialty Glass business covers a number of niche markets, the most important of which are in displays and optical products for printers and copiers.
The Group has major market shares in most building and automotive product markets of the world, with a broad geographic reach, enabling it to respond to customers whose Operations, particularly in the case of Automotive OE, are increasingly global.
Geographically, 42 per cent of the Group's sales are in Europe, 28 per cent in Japan and 13 per cent in North America, with the rest primarily in South America, South East Asia and China. [5]

History[edit]
The company was established in November 1918 as America Japan Sheet Glass Co., Ltd. with its head office in Osaka, after it obtained technology from Libbey Owens Ford Glass Co. of the United States to produce flat glass using the Colburn process. The company changed its name to the Nippon Sheet Glass Co., Ltd. in January 1931. It expanded operations across Japan post World War II, and in October 1970 acquired Nippon Safety Glass Co., Ltd. In April 1999 the company merged with Nippon Glass Fiber Co., Ltd. and Micro Optics Co., Ltd. In Apr 2001 the company acquired Nippon Muki Co., Ltd. and in July 2004 moved the registered head office from Osaka to Minato Ward in Tokyo.[4]
Pilkington[edit]
In 1986, Pilkington bought Libbey Owens Ford. Following an agreed acquisition of 20% of Pilkington of the United Kingdom in 2001, in 2006 NSG purchased the residual 80% of shares, a company then double its size.
Present[edit]
Founded in 1918, NSG acquired the leading UK-based glass manufacturer Pilkington plc in June 2006. Today, the enlarged company has combined sales of approximately JPY 600 billion, with manufacturing operations in 29 countries and sales in 130 countries, employing some 28,500 people worldwide.
The Group's Flat Glass businesses, encompassing Building Products and Automotive Products, account for 90 per cent of annual sales, with the balance being in Specialty Glass. The Specialty Glass business covers a number of niche markets, the most important of which are in displays and optical products for printers and copiers.
The Group has major market shares in most building and automotive product markets of the world, with a broad geographic reach, enabling it to respond to customers whose Operations, particularly in the case of Automotive OE, are increasingly global.
Geographically, 42 per cent of the Group's sales are in Europe, 28 per cent in Japan and 13 per cent in North America, with the rest primarily in South America, South East Asia and China. [5]

History[edit]
The company was established in November 1918 as America Japan Sheet Glass Co., Ltd. with its head office in Osaka, after it obtained technology from Libbey Owens Ford Glass Co. of the United States to produce flat glass using the Colburn process. The company changed its name to the Nippon Sheet Glass Co., Ltd. in January 1931. It expanded operations across Japan post World War II, and in October 1970 acquired Nippon Safety Glass Co., Ltd. In April 1999 the company merged with Nippon Glass Fiber Co., Ltd. and Micro Optics Co., Ltd. In Apr 2001 the company acquired Nippon Muki Co., Ltd. and in July 2004 moved the registered head office from Osaka to Minato Ward in Tokyo.[4]
Pilkington[edit]
In 1986, Pilkington bought Libbey Owens Ford. Following an agreed acquisition of 20% of Pilkington of the United Kingdom in 2001, in 2006 NSG purchased the residual 80% of shares, a company then double its size.
Present[edit]
Founded in 1918, NSG acquired the leading UK-based glass manufacturer Pilkington plc in June 2006. Today, the enlarged company has combined sales of approximately JPY 600 billion, with manufacturing operations in 29 countries and sales in 130 countries, employing some 28,500 people worldwide.
The Group's Flat Glass businesses, encompassing Building Products and Automotive Products, account for 90 per cent of annual sales, with the balance being in Specialty Glass. The Specialty Glass business covers a number of niche markets, the most important of which are in displays and optical products for printers and copiers.
The Group has major market shares in most building and automotive product markets of the world, with a broad geographic reach, enabling it to respond to customers whose Operations, particularly in the case of Automotive OE, are increasingly global.
Geographically, 42 per cent of the Group's sales are in Europe, 28 per cent in Japan and 13 per cent in North America, with the rest primarily in South America, South East Asia and China. [5]
