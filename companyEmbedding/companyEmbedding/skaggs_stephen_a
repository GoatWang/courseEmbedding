Home > Shop by Artist > Steven Skaggs



























Steven Skaggs is Professor of Graphic Design at the University of Louisville. After receiving his Master’s degree from Pratt Institute, he practiced branding and environmental design in Atlanta before entering academia. He designs fonts, glyphs, logos, and is a calligrapher. His work is in the permanent collections of the Akademie der Künste (Berlin), the Klingspor Museum, and the Sackner Archive of Visual and Concrete Poetry. His interest in symbols led him to semiotics, a subject that studies “symbology” and stitches together many of his interests. Much of this work of the last couple decades has involved developing design theory. He is author of FireSigns, which is to appear later in 2016 from MIT Press.
