(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Overview  The Company designs, manufactures and markets systems and equipment to move, measure, control, dispense and spray fluid and coating materials. Management classifies the Company's business into three reportable segments: Industrial, Contractor and Lubrication. Key strategies include developing and marketing new products, expanding distribution globally, opening new markets with technology and channel expansion and completing strategic acquisitions.  The following Management's Discussion and Analysis reviews significant factors affecting the Company's results of operations and financial condition. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the accompanying notes to the financial statements.  Acquisition in 2012  On April 2, 2012, the Company completed the purchase of the finishing businesses of ITW. The acquisition included Powder Finishing and Liquid Finishing equipment operations, technologies and brands. Results of the Powder Finishing business have been included in the Industrial segment since the date of acquisition.  Pursuant to a March 2012 order, the Liquid Finishing businesses were to be held separate from the rest of Graco's businesses while the United States Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") considered a settlement with Graco and determined which portions of the Liquid Finishing businesses Graco must divest.  In May 2012, the FTC issued a proposed decision and order which requires Graco to sell the Liquid Finishing business assets, including certain business activities related to the development, manufacture, and sale of products under the Binks(R), DeVilbiss(R), Ransburg(R) and BGK(R) brand names, no later than 180 days from the date the order becomes final. The FTC continues to work on resolving issues related to a proposed final decision and order.  The Company has retained the services of an investment bank to help it market the Liquid Finishing businesses and identify potential buyers. While it seeks a buyer, Graco must continue to hold the Liquid Finishing business assets separate from its other businesses and maintain them as viable and competitive.  The Company does not control the Liquid Finishing businesses, nor is it able to exert influence over those businesses. Consequently, the Company's investment in the shares of the Liquid Finishing businesses has been reflected as a cost-method investment, and its financial results have not been consolidated with those of the Company.  As a cost-method investment, income is recognized based on dividends received from after-tax earnings of Liquid Finishing and included in other expense (income) on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Dividends received in 2014 totaled $11 million in the second quarter and $15 million year-to-date, consistent with the amounts received in comparable periods of  Table of Contents  2013. Once the FTC issues its final decision and order, and the Company completes the sale of its investment, there will be no further dividends from Liquid Finishing.  The Company evaluates its cost-method investment for other-than-temporary impairment at each reporting period. As of June 27, 2014, the Company evaluated its investment in Liquid Finishing and determined that there was no impairment.  Consolidated Results Net sales, net earnings and earnings per share were as follows (in millions except per share amounts and percentages): Thirteen Weeks Ended Twenty-six Weeks Ended June 27, June 28, % June 27, June 28, % 2014 2013 Change 2014 2013 Change Net Sales $ 322.5 $ 286.0 13% $ 612.5 $ 555.1 10% Operating Earnings $ 85.8 $ 75.2 14% $ 160.6 $ 146.7 9% Net Earnings $ 66.2 $ 57.8 15% $ 117.0 $ 110.0 6% Diluted Net Earnings per Common Share $ 1.07 $ 0.92 16% $ 1.88 $ 1.76 7%  Sales for the second quarter increased in all reportable segments and regions, with double-digit percentage growth in Industrial and Contractor segments. Year-to-date sales increased in all segments and regions except for Asia Pacific, where sales were flat compared to last year.  Changes in product mix and lower margins from acquired operations contributed to a decrease in gross margin rate for both the quarter and the year-to-date.  Expense leverage offset the effects of lower gross margin rates on operating earnings. Year-to-date operating earnings increased 9 percent, but a higher effective income tax rate led to a smaller increase in net earnings.  Table of Contents  The following table presents components of changes in sales:   Quarter Segment Region Asia Industrial Contractor Lubrication Americas EMEA Pacific Total Volume and Price 6 % 12 % 7 % 10 % 7 % 4 % 8 % Acquisitions 6 % - % - % 6 % 1 % 2 % 4 % Currency 2 % 1 % - % (1)% 4 % 1 % 1 % Total 14 % 13 % 7 % 15 % 12 % 7 % 13 % Year-to-Date Segment Region Asia Industrial Contractor Lubrication Americas EMEA Pacific Total Volume and Price 5 % 11 % 7 % 11 % 5 % (2)% 7 % Acquisitions 5 % - % - % 5 % 1 % 1 % 3 % Currency 1 % - % (1)% (1)% 4 % - % - % Total 11 % 11 % 6 % 15 % 10 % (1)% 10 %  Sales by geographic area were as follows (in millions):   Thirteen Weeks Ended Twenty-six Weeks Ended June 27, June 28, June 27, June 28, 2014 2013 2014 2013 Americas1 $ 184.8 $ 160.7 $ 343.6 $ 298.9 EMEA2 79.7 70.9 153.1 139.8 Asia Pacific 58.0 54.4 115.8 116.4 Consolidated $ 322.5 $ 286.0 $ 612.5 $ 555.1  1 North and South America, including the U.S.  2 Europe, Middle East and Africa  Sales for the quarter increased 13 percent, including increases of 15 percent in the Americas, 12 percent in EMEA (8 percent at consistent translation rates) and 7 percent in Asia Pacific. Year-to-date sales increased 10 percent, including increases of 15 percent in the Americas and 10 percent in EMEA (6 percent at consistent translation rates). Sales were flat in Asia Pacific. Sales from operations acquired in the fourth quarter of 2013 and the first quarter of 2014 totaled $10 million for the quarter (contributing 4 percentage points of growth) and $17 million year-to-date (3 percentage points of growth).  Gross profit margin, expressed as a percentage of sales, was 55 percent for both the quarter and year-to-date, down less than one percentage point from the comparable periods last year. Changes in product mix and lower margins in acquired operations contributed to the decrease in both the quarter and year-to-date. Non-recurring inventory-related purchase accounting effects of $1 million and lower margins in acquired operations accounted for nearly half of the year-to-date decrease.  Table of Contents  Total operating expenses for the quarter were $7 1/2 million (9 percent) higher than second quarter last year. Year-to-date operating expenses were $13 million (8 percent) higher than last year. Expenses of acquired operations and spending on regional and product growth initiatives accounted for more than half of the increase for both the quarter and year-to-date. As a percentage of sales, total operating expenses for the quarter were 28 percent, down 1 percentage point from the second quarter last year and year-to-date operating expenses were down by one-half percentage point.  Other expense (income) included dividends received from the Liquid Finishing businesses that are held separate from the Company's other businesses. Such dividends totaled $11 million for the quarter and $15 million year-to-date, consistent with the comparable periods of last year.  The effective income tax rate of 28 percent for the quarter was 1 percentage point lower than the comparable period last year. The decrease resulted from higher foreign earnings that are taxed at lower rates than in the U.S., partially offset by the impact of the federal R&D credit not being renewed for 2014. The effective year-to-date income tax rate of 29 percent was 1 percentage point higher than last year. Last year's rate included the favorable impact of the R&D credit that was renewed in 2013 retroactive to the beginning of 2012. The increase in the effective rate as a result of the expiration of the R&D credit for 2014 was partially offset by the impacts of higher foreign earnings taxed at lower rates than in the U.S. and additional benefit from U.S. business deductions.  Segment Results  Certain measurements of segment operations compared to last year are summarized below:  Industrial Thirteen Weeks Ended Twenty-six Weeks Ended June 27, June 28, June 27, June 28, 2014 2013 2014 2013 Net sales (in millions) Americas $ 83.0 $ 70.2 $ 161.5 $ 136.4 EMEA 55.9 49.8 110.3 100.1 Asia Pacific 42.9 39.7 86.4 87.3 Total $ 181.8 $ 159.7 $ 358.2 $ 323.8 Operating earnings as a percentage of net sales 32 % 32 % 31 % 33 %  Industrial segment sales for the quarter increased 14 percent, with increases of 18 percent in the Americas, 12 percent in EMEA (7 percent at consistent translation rates) and 8 percent in Asia Pacific. Year-to-date sales increased 11 percent with increases in the Americas and EMEA and a small decrease in Asia Pacific. First half results included the operations of QED Environmental Systems, acquired at the beginning of fiscal 2014, and EcoQuip, acquired at the end of fiscal 2013. Acquired operations contributed $10 million to sales in this segment for the quarter and $17 million year-to-date (6 percentage points of growth for the quarter and 5 percentage points for the year-to-date). Year-to-date operating margin rate for the Industrial segment decreased compared to last year due to lower margins on acquired operations, including the impact of non-recurring acquisition-related inventory valuation adjustments, and other investments in regional and product expansion.  Table of Contents  Contractor Thirteen Weeks Ended Twenty-six Weeks Ended June 27, June 28, June 27, June 28, 2014 2013 2014 2013 Net sales (in millions) Americas $ 79.2 $ 69.9 $ 137.7 $ 121.4 EMEA 21.3 18.0 37.7 34.1 Asia Pacific 10.6 10.6 20.6 20.6 Total $ 111.1 $ 98.5 $ 196.0 $ 176.1 Operating earnings as a percentage of net sales 25 % 25 % 24 % 23 %  Contractor segment sales for the quarter increased 13 percent, including increases of 13 percent in the Americas, 18 percent in EMEA (14 percent at consistent translation rates) and 1 percent in Asia Pacific. Year-to-date sales increased 11 percent with strong increases in the Americas and EMEA. Operating margin rates in the Contractor segment were slightly higher than the rates for the comparable periods last year. The favorable effects of higher sales volume and expense leverage were partially offset by unfavorable effects of product mix.  Lubrication Thirteen Weeks Ended Twenty-six Weeks Ended June 27, June 28, June 27, June 28, 2014 2013 2014 2013 Net sales (in millions) Americas $ 22.7 $ 20.6 $ 44.4 $ 41.1 EMEA 2.6 3.0 5.1 5.5 Asia Pacific 4.4 4.3 8.8 8.5 Total $ 29.7 $ 27.9 $ 58.3 $ 55.1 Operating earnings as a percentage of net sales 23 % 24 % 23 % 21 %  Lubrication segment sales increased 7 percent for the quarter and 6 percent year-to-date, mostly from increases in the Americas. Higher sales volume, improved gross margin rate and expense leverage led to a higher year-to-date operating margin rate in the Lubrication segment.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Net cash provided by operating activities was $84 million in 2014 and $100 million in 2013. The first half increase in accounts receivable was $15 million higher in 2014 than the increase in 2013. Accounts receivable and inventory balances have increased since the end of 2013 due to increases in business activity. Significant uses of cash in the first half of 2014 included $65 million for a business acquisition, $94 million for purchases of Company common stock and $33 million of dividends paid to shareholders.  In May 2012, the FTC issued a proposed decision and order which requires Graco to sell the Liquid Finishing business assets, including certain business activities related to the  Table of Contents  development, manufacture, and sale of products under the Binks, DeVilbiss, Ransburg and BGK brand names, no later than 180 days from the date the order becomes final. The FTC continues to work on resolving issues related to a proposed final decision and order.  The Company has retained the services of an investment bank to help it market the Liquid Finishing businesses and identify potential buyers. The Company believes its investment in the Liquid Finishing businesses, carried at a cost of $422 million, is not impaired.  Under terms of the FTC's hold separate order, the Company is required to provide sufficient resources to maintain the viability, competitiveness and marketability of the Liquid Finishing businesses, including general funds, capital, working capital and reimbursement of losses. To the extent that the Liquid Finishing businesses generate funds in excess of financial resources needed, the Company has access to such funds consistent with practices in place prior to the acquisition. Since the date of acquisition, the Company received $55 million of dividends from current earnings of the Liquid Finishing businesses, including $15 million in the first half of 2014.  On June 26, 2014, the Company executed an amendment to its revolving credit agreement, extending the expiration date to June 26, 2019, and increasing the amount of credit available to $500 million, a $50 million increase.  Under the amended agreement, the base rate applied to borrowings is an annual rate equal to a margin ranging from zero percent to 0.875 percent (down from zero to 1 percent under the prior agreement), depending on the Company's cash flow leverage ratio, plus the highest of (i) the bank's prime rate, (ii) the federal funds rate plus 0.5 percent or (iii) one-month LIBOR plus 1.5 percent. In general, LIBOR-based loans bear interest at LIBOR plus 1 percent to 1.875 percent (down from 1 to 2 percent), depending on the Company's cash flow leverage ratio.  Fees on the undrawn amount of the loan commitment decreased to a range of 0.15 percent to 0.30 percent (down from 0.15 percent to 0.40 percent), depending on the Company's cash flow leverage ratio.  At June 27, 2014, the Company had various lines of credit totaling $552 million, of which $317 million was unused. Internally generated funds and unused financing sources are expected to provide the Company with the flexibility to meet its liquidity needs in 2014, including the needs of the Liquid Finishing businesses acquired in April 2012.  Outlook  After a solid first half of 2014, we are well positioned to achieve full-year growth in all segments and geographies. Our Contractor segment is poised to continue low double-digit growth in the Americas, benefitting from the recovery in the U.S. construction market. Stable macroeconomic conditions in developed economies and firming demand levels in the emerging markets of EMEA and China may provide upside to our outlook for mid-single-digit organic growth for the second half of the year.

Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

History[edit]




Graco headquarters complex, Minneapolis, MN.


Russell Gray, a Minneapolis parking lot attendant, founded Gray Company, Inc. in 1926 with his brother Leil Gray to produce and sell Russell's air-powered grease gun, invented in response to cold weather making hand-powered grease guns inoperable. Sales their first year of operation were $35,000. By 1941, annual sales had reached $1 million. They capitalized on opportunities in defense-based lubricating needs during World War II.
After the war, they began expanding outside of lubricant handling, developing a paint pump and direct-from-drum industrial fluids pumps. By the mid-1950s they had expanded to $5 million in sales and 400 employees, and were servicing fluid handling needs in a wide variety of industries.
Leil Gray died in 1958, and was succeeded as president by Harry A. Murphy. He was succeeded in turn by David A Koch in 1962. The company continued to expand, helped by the 1957 introduction of the airless spray gun. By 1969, when Gray Company went public and changed its name to Graco, it had annual sales of $33 million.
After acquiring H. G. Fischer & Co, a manufacturer of electrostatic finishing products, sales continued to climb, reflecting an industry-wide shift in automobile painting from air-based to electrostatic technologies. By 1980, sales had climbed to $100 million.[4]
Contractor Equipment Division[edit]
Graco currently has airless sprayers, line striping units, fine finish equipment, texture sprayers, roof coating rigs, and pressure washers on the Contractor Equipment Division (CED).[5]
Lubrication Equipment Division[edit]

History[edit]




Graco headquarters complex, Minneapolis, MN.


Russell Gray, a Minneapolis parking lot attendant, founded Gray Company, Inc. in 1926 with his brother Leil Gray to produce and sell Russell's air-powered grease gun, invented in response to cold weather making hand-powered grease guns inoperable. Sales their first year of operation were $35,000. By 1941, annual sales had reached $1 million. They capitalized on opportunities in defense-based lubricating needs during World War II.
After the war, they began expanding outside of lubricant handling, developing a paint pump and direct-from-drum industrial fluids pumps. By the mid-1950s they had expanded to $5 million in sales and 400 employees, and were servicing fluid handling needs in a wide variety of industries.
Leil Gray died in 1958, and was succeeded as president by Harry A. Murphy. He was succeeded in turn by David A Koch in 1962. The company continued to expand, helped by the 1957 introduction of the airless spray gun. By 1969, when Gray Company went public and changed its name to Graco, it had annual sales of $33 million.
After acquiring H. G. Fischer & Co, a manufacturer of electrostatic finishing products, sales continued to climb, reflecting an industry-wide shift in automobile painting from air-based to electrostatic technologies. By 1980, sales had climbed to $100 million.[4]
Contractor Equipment Division[edit]
Graco currently has airless sprayers, line striping units, fine finish equipment, texture sprayers, roof coating rigs, and pressure washers on the Contractor Equipment Division (CED).[5]
Lubrication Equipment Division[edit]
In the Lubrication Equipment Division (LED), Graco produces automatic lubrication equipment, vehicle lubrication maintenance and repair equipment, and a variety of activators and switches for the lubrication process.[6]
Industrial Products Division[edit]
In Graco's Industrial Products Division (IPD), there are a wide range of pneumatic, hydraulic, and electric pumps created to withstand the toughest finishing applications. IPD also has different fine finish pump packages which can spray with air, assisted by air, or airless. [7]
Markets served[edit]
Graco serves a wide variety of markets. Providing products for painting, anti-corrosion, fluid transfer, gluing and sanitary applications for markets like Automotive, Aeronautic, Body refinish, wood, building and construction,[8] marine... They distribute through a global network of equipment dealers and retail stores.[9]

History[edit]




Graco headquarters complex, Minneapolis, MN.


Russell Gray, a Minneapolis parking lot attendant, founded Gray Company, Inc. in 1926 with his brother Leil Gray to produce and sell Russell's air-powered grease gun, invented in response to cold weather making hand-powered grease guns inoperable. Sales their first year of operation were $35,000. By 1941, annual sales had reached $1 million. They capitalized on opportunities in defense-based lubricating needs during World War II.
After the war, they began expanding outside of lubricant handling, developing a paint pump and direct-from-drum industrial fluids pumps. By the mid-1950s they had expanded to $5 million in sales and 400 employees, and were servicing fluid handling needs in a wide variety of industries.
Leil Gray died in 1958, and was succeeded as president by Harry A. Murphy. He was succeeded in turn by David A Koch in 1962. The company continued to expand, helped by the 1957 introduction of the airless spray gun. By 1969, when Gray Company went public and changed its name to Graco, it had annual sales of $33 million.
After acquiring H. G. Fischer & Co, a manufacturer of electrostatic finishing products, sales continued to climb, reflecting an industry-wide shift in automobile painting from air-based to electrostatic technologies. By 1980, sales had climbed to $100 million.[4]
Contractor Equipment Division[edit]
Graco currently has airless sprayers, line striping units, fine finish equipment, texture sprayers, roof coating rigs, and pressure washers on the Contractor Equipment Division (CED).[5]
Lubrication Equipment Division[edit]
In the Lubrication Equipment Division (LED), Graco produces automatic lubrication equipment, vehicle lubrication maintenance and repair equipment, and a variety of activators and switches for the lubrication process.[6]
Industrial Products Division[edit]
In Graco's Industrial Products Division (IPD), there are a wide range of pneumatic, hydraulic, and electric pumps created to withstand the toughest finishing applications. IPD also has different fine finish pump packages which can spray with air, assisted by air, or airless. [7]
Markets served[edit]
Graco serves a wide variety of markets. Providing products for painting, anti-corrosion, fluid transfer, gluing and sanitary applications for markets like Automotive, Aeronautic, Body refinish, wood, building and construction,[8] marine... They distribute through a global network of equipment dealers and retail stores.[9]

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

 Liquid Clinic: Justifying Liquid Automation
            
                Q. I am trying to justify liquid automation for my plant, but am not sure how to develop a return on investment. What are some guidelines that would help?

                Graco’s ProMix PD2K positive displacement proportioner mixes the material close to the gun so the flush zone is smaller, reducing solvent use and mixed material waste when compared with traditional proportioners.







 
 Graco Electric Circulating Pumps
            
                Graco will display its E-Flo DC electric circulating pumps, which are designed to operate by maintaining either constant pressure or a constant flow rate.

                The Federal Trade Commission will require Graco to sell the worldwide liquid finishing business of Illinois Tool Works and ITW Finishing under a proposed order as part of a settlement.
