Our Investment Strategy Third Rock Ventures






















Philosophy
We build great companies in order to make a dramatic difference for patients








Our Investment Strategy
Discover. Launch. Build.
Our Mission & Core Values



Our Investment Strategy
We discover, launch and build great companies based on bold ideas that meet at the intersection of science, strategy, business and medicine - where transformational science meets operational reality - providing the best opportunity to make a dramatic difference in patients' lives. 







The Third Rock Team
   Our team has a proven record of translating disruptive technologies into valuable business enterprises. We adhere to a “Third Rock Forever” philosophy, realizing that we have been phenomenally successful because of the contributions of the whole Third Rock team. People are our greatest asset, and we invest significant effort and resources to ensure we hire the best people at Third Rock and across the portfolio. Working closely with leading scientific and business visionaries, as well as industry partners, our team is focused on identifying opportunities to change the future of medicine and rigorously vets those ideas through our discovery process to develop the vision, strategy and plan needed to succeed. Learn About Our People | Download Third Rock Team Fact Sheet











A Formula for Innovation
We only invest in the best of those ideas. We are actively involved in the early stages of our companies' development, typically serving as members of the founding management teams, to build a strong foundation, put in place the right people and culture, and set the companies on a path to scientific and operational excellence. View Our Portfolio | Download Third Rock Company Fact Sheet
Then, we build on that foundation, transitioning out of our interim leadership roles as we put in place rock star management teams. We bring to bear the vast experience, expertise and network of our team and across our portfolio to help our companies succeed. Management teams can tap into our network of experts across disciplines, including science, medicine, business, healthcare economics and regulatory strategy. Our partner development team leverages our relationships with decision-makers in pharma to support business development efforts across our portfolio. Our strategy team serves as an advisory resource around critical business development, financial and operational decisions. Our Beyond Great leadership program provides our portfolio leaders with a peer-to-peer network, as well as tools and resources focused on shared elements of building transformational companies. We build great companies together, with our portfolio leaders, scientific founders, advisors and industry partners.









"We try never to forget that medicine is for the people. It is not for the profits. The profits follow, and if we have remembered that, they have never failed to appear. The better we have remembered it, the larger they have been."

PRESS RELEASE
Third Rock Ventures, L.L.C, a venture capital firm focused on building life sciences companies, today announced the final closing of Fund II, raising $426 million in an oversubscribed fund. With Fund II, Third Rock will continue to execute on its strategy and build on its successful track record of launching and supporting transformative life sciences companies.
“We are grateful for the strong support for our model and the significant interest from our existing and new investors,” said Kevin Starr, partner of Third Rock Ventures. “In 2007, we founded Third Rock with a $378 million Fund I, which enabled us to successfully seed, support or launch more than 15life sciences companies. These companies were formed around disruptive areas of science and medicine and many were developed as part of Third Rock’s unique company discovery process. We look forward to continuing to partner with entrepreneurs, researchers and company founders to pursue bold ideas and groundbreaking science that promise to dramatically improve the lives of patients.”
New Additions to the Third Rock Team
Third Rock is announcing several changes and additions to the team. These include the promotion of Alexis Borisy from entrepreneur-in-residence (EIR) to partner at Third Rock; the addition of Charles Homcy, M.D. (formerly chief executive officer of Portola Pharmaceuticals) as venture partner leading the newly established West Coast office; and the addition of David Armistead, Ph.D., (formerly chief scientific officer of CGI Pharmaceuticals – now Gilead), and Chris Varma (formerly with Flagship Ventures) as EIRs. As recently announced, Nick Leschly, formerly a partner with Third Rock Ventures, has assumed the role of president and CEO of portfolio company bluebird bio. 





Robert Tepper, M.D., Third Rock Ventures partner stated, “We are delighted to bring added breadth and depth to our team with senior capabilities in commercial, R&D, drug discovery and product development. These new hires add critical mass to our team and extend the guidance and support we can provide to our portfolio companies.”
Third Rock Opens San Francisco Office
Third Rock is establishing an office in San Francisco to better enable the firm to work directly with its growing portfolio of West Coast-based companies. Third Rock partner Craig Muir and principal Jake Bauer are relocating to San Francisco where they will work closely with Dr. Homcy as well as the Boston-based team.
“Our approach has always been to closely engage and collaborate with experts, academic centers and entrepreneurs, and the West Coast office enables us to extend our reach and maintain this model,” stated Mark Levin, partner of Third Rock Ventures. “I am personally very excited to work with Charles again in leading R&D efforts and launching new companies. With Craig and Jake from our Boston office joining Charles in San Francisco, this team will seamlessly integrate across Third Rock to collaborate with entrepreneurs to build, launch and operate our portfolio companies.”
