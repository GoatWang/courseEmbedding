Company Overview





Amarantus BioScience Holdings, Inc. is a publicly traded biotechnology company focused on developing therapeutic products with the potential for orphan drug designation in the areas of neurology, psychiatry, ophthalmology and regenerative medicine, and diagnostics in neurology.
The Company’s lead therapeutic program, eltoprazine is a small molecule indicated for the treatment of Levodopa-induced dyskinesia, one of the most difficult problems facing patients with Parkinson’s disease. Eltoprazine commenced a Phase 2b clinical trial in the second quarter of 2015 with results from the study expected in 2016. Eltoprazine is also being evaluated for the treatment of adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and Alzheimer’s aggression.
Amarantus recently completed the acquisition of Cutanogen Corporation (Cutanogen) from Lonza Walkersville, Inc., a subsidiary of Lonza Group Ltd. Cutanogen has an exclusive worldwide license to intellectual property rights associated with Engineered Skin Substitute (ESS). ESS is a full thickness skin replacement product prepared from autologous (patient's own) tissue-engineered skin cells in development for the treatment of severe burns. ESS received orphan drug designation from the FDA for the treatment of hospitalized patients with deep partial and full thickness burns requiring grafting. Amarantus expects to commence a Phase 2 study of ESS in the U.S. in the third quarter of 2015. Amarantus is also developing MANF (mesencephalic-astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor), which was discovered by the company’s own discovery platform, PhenoGuard. MANF is being developed for the treatment of brain and ophthalmic disorders and has received Orphan Drug Designation from the FDA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the treatment of Retinitis Pigmentosa.
The company’s diagnostics division, Amarantus Diagnostics is dedicated to the development and commercialization of neurology diagnostic products. The company’s lead diagnostic product, LymPro Test® is a blood based assay to diagnose Alzheimer’s disease and is approved for investigational use only to be used in biotech and pharmaceutical clinical trials. Amarantus Diagnostics is also developing MSPrecise®, a proprietary, next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) assay for the identification of patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) at first clinical presentation.

Isenberg Professor of Integrative Science at University of MassachusettsScientist at Pioneer Valley Life Sciences InstituteProfessor of Biology at University of Massachusetts, AmherstAdjunct Faculty in Pathology, BayState Medical Center
Dr. Lawrence M. Schwartz was appointed in 2010 as the first Isenberg Professor of Integrative Science at the University of Massachusetts. Dr. Schwartz is a Professor in the Biology Department at the University of Massachusetts, as well as the Founding Director of the Pioneer Valley Life Sciences Institute in Springfield MA where he served as Scientific Director from 2004 until 2010. He also served as the Director of the Center of Excellence in Apoptosis. His laboratory examines the molecular mechanisms that mediate cell death during normal development and in pathology. One avenue of research focuses in Acheron, a novel gene cloned in the Schwartz laboratory that regulates the differentiation and death of skeletal muscle, and may play a role in the metastatic behaviors of some soft tissue tumors. A second line of investigation examines the role of ubiquiton E3 ligases Parkin and Human Homolog of Ariadne-1 in dopaminergic neuron survival. 






John W. Commissiong, PhD
Chief Scientific Officer
Dr. Commissiong has served as the Chief Scientific Officer and a Director of Amarantus since co-founding the company in 2008. Prior to Amarantus, Dr. Commissiong served as the CSO of Neurotrophics, Inc. and Prescient Neuropharma, Inc. Throughout his distinguished career, Dr. Commissiong has been focused on the discovery of novel neurotrophic factors for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases as well as understanding the fundamental underlying biology of protoplasmic type-1 astrocytes that secrete neurotrophic factors. He was Chief of the Neural Transplantation Unit, NINDS-NIH, from 1989-94 where his research focused on identifying therapeutic approaches to spinal cord injury. Dr. Commissiong was Head of the Neurotrophic Factors Group, NINDS-NIH, from 1994-97 where he focused on developing technologies to systematically identify novel neurotrophic factors with applications for specific Central Nervous System disorders. He co-founded Prescient Neuropharma in 1999, and discovered MANF in 2003. The work pioneered by Dr. Commissiong has led to significant advancements in the field of astrocyte-neuron biology. Dr. Commissiong did his Postdoctoral work in the Lab Preclin Pharmac, NIMH-NIH, concentrating on the application of quadrupole mass spectrometry in the analysis of neurotransmitters. He holds a Ph.D. in Neurophysiology from the University of Southampton, a M.Sc. in Biochemical Pharmacology from the University of Southampton, and a B.S. in Biology and Chemistry from the University of the West Indies.

About Amarantus BioScience Holdings
Amarantus BioScience Holdings, Inc. is a publicly traded biotechnology company focused on developing therapeutic products with the potential for orphan drug designation in the areas of neurology, psychiatry, ophthalmology and regenerative medicine, and diagnostics in neurology.
The Company’s lead therapeutic program, eltoprazine is a small molecule indicated for the treatment of Levodopa-induced dyskinesia, one of the most difficult problems facing patients with Parkinson’s disease. Eltoprazine is currently in a Phase 2b clinical trial with results from the study expected in 2016. Eltoprazine is also being evaluated for the treatment of adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and Alzheimer’s aggression.
Amarantus recently completed the acquisition of Cutanogen Corporation (Cutanogen) from Lonza Walkersville, Inc., a subsidiary of Lonza Group Ltd. Cutanogen has an exclusive worldwide license to intellectual property rights associated with Engineered Skin Substitute (ESS). ESS is a full thickness skin replacement product prepared from autologous (patient's own) tissue-engineered skin cells in development for the treatment of severe burns. ESS received orphan drug designation from the FDA for the treatment of hospitalized patients with deep partial and full thickness burns requiring grafting. Amarantus expects to commence a Phase 2 study of ESS in the U.S. in the third quarter of 2015. Amarantus is also developing MANF (mesencephalic-astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor), which was discovered by the company’s own discovery platform, PhenoGuard. MANF is being developed for the treatment of brain and ophthalmic disorders and has received Orphan Drug Designation from the FDA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the treatment of Retinitis Pigmentosa.
The company’s diagnostics division, Amarantus Diagnostics is dedicated to the development and commercialization of neurology diagnostic products. The company’s lead diagnostic product, LymPro Test® is a blood based assay to diagnose Alzheimer’s disease and is approved for investigational use only to be used in biotech and pharmaceutical clinical trials.
Amarantus Diagnostics is also developing MSPrecise®, a proprietary, next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) assay for the identification of patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) at first clinical presentation.
The company is active exploring a number of strategic options for Amarantus Diagnostics, including a potential spin-off, to derive the full value of its premier neuro-diagnostics business.
