	Total Return Fund  Class 1 Shares






	Supplement dated June 15, 2010






	To the Prospectus Dated May 1, 2010





	At a meeting held on June 9, 2010, the Board of Directors of GE Investments Funds, Inc. considered and unanimously approved the hiring of Palisade
	Capital Management, L.L.C. (Palisade) as an investment sub-adviser for the Total Return Fund (the Fund), and a new sub-advisory agreement (the Sub-Advisory Agreement) between Palisade and GE Asset Management
	Incorporated (the Adviser), on behalf of the Fund. Palisade will manage those assets of the Fund allocated by the Adviser to be invested in small-cap equity investments. Shareholders of the Fund will receive an information statement
	which will provide more information about Palisade and the new Sub-Advisory Agreement.




	As a result of this new arrangement, certain
	disclosures in the Funds prospectus have been modified or supplemented, as described below.

	Risk

	:







	Small-Cap Company Risk

	is the risk that investing in the securities of small-cap companies may
	pose greater market and liquidity risks than larger, more established companies, because of limited product lines and/or operating history, limited financial resources, limited trading markets, and the potential lack of management depth. In
	addition, the securities of such companies are typically more volatile than securities of larger capitalization companies.

1 GE Investments Funds, Inc. Prospectus May 1, 2015 Class 3 Total Return Fund GETTX Like all mutual funds, shares of the GE Investments Funds, Inc. have not been approved or disapproved by the Securities and Exchange Commission, nor has the Securities and Exchange Commission passed upon the accuracy or adequacy of this Prospectus. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.2 3 GE Investments Funds, Inc. Prospectus May 1, 2015 Table of Contents Summary Section Total Return Fund 2 More on Strategies, Risks and Disclosure of Portfolio Holdings 6 Important Definitions 6 More on Investment Strategies 10 More on Risks 12 Disclosure of Portfolio Holdings 15 Shares of the Fund 19 Investor Service Plan 19 Distribution and Service (12b-1) Plan 19 Other Compensation Arrangements 19 Distribution of Shares 20 Purchase and Redemption of Shares 20 Redemptions in Kind 20 Disruptive Trading Policy 20 Contract Owner Voting Rights 21 Plan Participant Voting Rights 22 About the Investment Adviser 17 Investment Adviser, Administrator and Sub-Administrator 17 Board of Directors Approval of Investment Advisory Agreements 17 Manager of Managers Structure 17 About the Portfolio Managers 17 About the Sub-Adviser 18 Dividends, Capital Gains and Other Tax Information 23 Dividend and Capital Gains Distribution 23 Taxes 23 Inactive Accounts 23 Calculating Share Value 24 Financial Highlights 254 Total Return Fund Class 3 GETTX Investment Objective The highest total return, composed of current income and capital appreciation, as is consistent with prudent investment risk. Fees and Expenses of the Fund The following table describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy and hold shares of the Fund, but does not reflect the fees or charges imposed by the separate accounts ( Accounts ) of the life insurance companies through which shares of the Fund may be purchased. If these fees and charges were included, the costs shown below would be higher. Shareholder Fees (fees paid directly from your investment): N/A Annual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment). Class 3 Management Fees 0.35% Distribution and/or Service (12b-1) Fees 0.25% Other Expenses (includes an Investor Service Plan fee of 0.20% of the average daily net assets) 0.27% Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses 0.02% Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses % 1 Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses shown in the table above may not correspond to the ratio of net expenses to the average net assets in the Financial Highlights section of this Prospectus to the extent that Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses are included in the table above. Expense Example The example below is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of investing in other mutual funds. The example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods indicated and then redeem all of your shares at the end of those periods or continue to hold them. The example also assumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund s operating expenses remain the same. The example does not reflect the fees or charges imposed by the Accounts of the various life insurance companies through which shares of the Fund are offered. If these fees and charges were included, the expenses shown below would be higher. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be: 1 Year 3 Years 5 Years 10 Years Class 3 $91 $284 $493 $1,096 Portfolio Turnover The Fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or turns over its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs. These costs, which are not reflected in the Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the Expense Example, affect the Fund s performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund s portfolio turnover rate was 78% of the average value of its portfolio. Principal Investment Strategies The Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing primarily in a combination of U.S. and foreign (non- U.S.) equity and debt securities and cash. GE Asset Management utilizes information from its Asset Allocation Committee to allocate the Fund s assets across various asset classes in order to diversify the Fund s holdings and to adjust the asset class weightings based on market and economic conditions. The Fund also seeks to provide attractive risk adjusted returns relative to the Fund s three broad-based benchmarks by tactically adjusting its asset allocation among the underlying indexed strategies. Based on GE Asset Management s asset allocation decisions, the Fund s assets are managed by a sub-adviser that employs an indexing investment approach designed to track the performance of the desired broad-based indexes. With respect to approximately 50-70% of its assets, the Fund seeks to track the investment performance of the Standard & Poor s 500 Composite Stock Index ( S&P 500 Index ) and/or the Morgan Stanley Capital International All Country World Index Ex-U.S. ( MSCI ACWI ex-u.s. Index ). The investment adviser determines the allocation between the two indexes, which can vary over time and which can involve a full allocation to one index. The S&P 500 Index represents the market capitalization-weighted index of stocks of over 500 large U.S. companies, which is widely used as a measure of the large-capitalization U.S. stock market performance. The MSCI ACWI ex-u.s. Index represents the market capitalizationweighted index of stocks designed to provide a broad measure of stock performance throughout the world, with the exception of U.S. based companies. The MSCI ACWI ex-u.s. Index includes both developed and emerging markets. The subadviser uses a replication indexing strategy to track the investment performance of the S&P 500 Index and the MSCI ACWI ex-u.s. Index. Replication is an indexing strategy in which a fund invests in substantially all of the securities in a benchmark index in approximately the same proportions as the benchmark index. With respect to approximately 30-50% of its assets, the Fund seeks to track the investment performance of the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index, which represents a market valueweighted index of taxable investment-grade debt issues, including government, corporate, asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities, with maturities of one year or more. The Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index is designed to represent the performance of the U.S. investment-grade fixedrate bond market. The sub-adviser uses a representative sampling indexing strategy to manage the bond portion of the Fund s assets. Representative sampling is an indexing strategy that involves investing in a representative sample of securities that collectively has an investment profile similar to a benchmark index. The securities selected are expected to have, in the aggregate, investment characteristics (based on factors such as market capitalization and industry weightings), fundamental characteristics (such as return variability and yield) and liquidity measures similar to those of the benchmark index. The Fund might or might not hold all of the securities that comprise the benchmark index. To a lesser extent, the investment adviser may also allocate a portion of the Fund s 25 GE Investments Funds, Inc. Prospectus May 1, 2015 assets to track the investment performance of the Standard & Poor s MidCap 400 Index ( S&P MidCap 400 Index ) and/or the Russell 2000 Index, when the investment adviser believes that these indexes can provide attractive relative returns. The Fund may hold cash or invest in money market instruments, principally for the preservation of capital, income potential or maintenance of liquidity. The Fund may also use exchange traded funds ( ETFs ) and derivatives (such as options, futures, options on futures, interest rate swaps and credit default swaps) to gain or hedge exposure to a certain type of broad-based index (such as equity futures of a broadbased index) as an alternative to investing directly in or selling the securities representing such index. Principal Risks The principal risks of investing in the Fund are: Securities Market Risk is the risk that the value of securities owned by the Fund may go up or down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably, due to factors affecting particular companies or the securities markets generally. A general downturn in the securities markets may cause multiple asset classes to decline in value simultaneously, although equity securities generally have greater price volatility than fixed income securities. Negative conditions and price declines may occur unexpectedly and dramatically. In addition, the Fund could be forced to sell portfolio securities at an inopportune time in order to meet unusually large or frequent redemption requests in times of overall market turmoil or declining prices for the securities. Passive Strategy Risk: The Fund allocates its assets among various asset classes, each of which is managed using a passive investment approach attempting to track the performance of a particular unmanaged index of securities. The ability of the Fund to achieve significant correlation between the performance of each asset class of the Fund and its corresponding index may be affected by changes in the securities markets, changes in the composition of the index, the timing of purchases and redemptions of Fund shares and fees and expenses of the Fund. Any performance better than the index would be unusual and temporary. Foreign Investment Risk is the risk that investing in securities of foreign (non-u.s.) issuers may result in the Fund experiencing more rapid and extreme changes in value than a fund that invests exclusively in securities of U.S. companies, due to smaller markets, differing reporting, accounting and auditing standards, nationalization, expropriation or confiscatory taxation, currency blockages and political changes or diplomatic developments. The costs of investing in many foreign markets are higher than the U.S. and investments may be less liquid. The risk of loss and volatility have increased over the past few years and may continue because of high levels of debt and other economic distress in various countries, including some in Europe. Attempted solutions such as austerity or stimulus measures and governmental regulation also may increase the risk of loss and volatility in securities markets. Currency Risk is the risk that the dollar value of foreign investments will change in response to changes in currency exchange rates. If a foreign currency weakens against the U.S. dollar, the U.S. dollar value of an investment denominated in that currency would also decline. Interest Rate Risk is the risk that fixed income securities will decline in value because of changes in interest rates. Bond prices generally rise when interest rates decline and generally decline when interest rates rise. In recent periods, governmental financial regulators, including the U.S. Federal Reserve, have taken steps to maintain historically low interest rates. It is possible there will be less governmental action in the future to maintain low interest rates or that governmental action will be less effective in maintaining low interest rates. Changes in market conditions and government action may have adverse effects on investments, volatility, and liquidity in debt markets and any negative impact on fixed income securities could be swift and significant, potentially increasing Fund redemptions and negatively impacting the Fund s performance. Mid-Cap Company Risk is that the risk of investing in securities of mid-cap companies could entail greater risks than investments in larger, more established companies. Mid-cap companies tend to have more narrow product lines, more limited financial resources and a more limited trading market for their stocks, as compared with larger companies. As a result, their stock prices may decline more significantly or more rapidly than stocks of larger companies as market conditions change. Small-Cap Company Risk is the risk that investing in the securities of small-cap companies may pose greater market and liquidity risks than larger, more established companies, because of limited product lines and/or operating history, limited financial resources, limited trading markets, and the potential lack of management depth. In addition, the securities of such companies are typically more volatile than securities of larger capitalization companies. Credit Risk is the risk that the issuer or guarantor of a fixed income security, or the counterparty of a derivatives contract or repurchase agreement, is unable or unwilling (or is perceived to be unable or unwilling) to make timely payment of principal and/or interest, or to otherwise honor its obligations. Prepayment Risk is the risk that during periods of falling interest rates, issuers of debt securities may repay higher rate securities before their maturity dates. This may cause the Fund to lose potential price appreciation and to be forced to reinvest the unanticipated proceeds at lower interest rates. Allocation Risk is the risk that GE Asset Management may not allocate assets of the Fund among asset classes in an optimal manner, if, among other reasons, it does not correctly assess the attractiveness of an asset class. Valuation Risk is the risk that the portfolio securities that have been valued using techniques other than market quotations may have valuations that are different from those produced using other methodologies, and that such securities may be sold at discounts to the values established by the Fund. 36 Liquidity Risk is the risk that the Fund cannot readily sell securities within seven days, at approximately the price at which the Fund has valued them or at a favorable time or price during periods of infrequent trading. Illiquid investments may trade at a substantial discount and may be subject to wide fluctuations in market value. Emerging Markets Risk is the risk of investing in securities of governments or companies located in emerging market countries, which primarily includes increased foreign investment risk. Emerging market countries may have unstable governments and/or economies that are subject to sudden change, and may also lack the legal, business and social framework to support securities markets, which tends to make investments less liquid and more volatile. Derivative Instruments Risk is a combination of several risks, including the risks that: (1) an investment in a derivative instrument will not correlate well with the performance of the securities or asset class to which the Fund seeks exposure or which the Fund seeks to hedge, (2) a derivative instrument entailing leverage may result in a loss greater than the principal amount invested, and (3) derivatives not traded on an exchange may be subject to counterparty risk, as well as liquidity risk and the related risk that the instrument is difficult or impossible to value accurately. The methodology the Fund uses to establish the fair value of a derivative may result in a value materially different from the value obtained using an alternative methodology. In addition, changes in laws or regulations may make the use of derivatives more costly, may limit the availability of derivatives, or may otherwise adversely affect the use, value or performance of derivatives. It is possible to lose money on an investment in the Fund, and this risk of loss may be heightened if you hold shares of the Fund for a shorter period. An investment in the Fund is not a deposit of any bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) or any other government agency. Performance The bar chart and the Average Annual Total Returns table below provide some indication of the risks of investing in the Fund by showing changes in the Fund s performance from year to year and by showing how the Fund s average annual returns compare with the returns of three broad-based securities market indices. Past performance assumes the reinvestment of all dividend income and capital gains distributions. The Fund s past performance is not necessarily an indication of how the Fund will perform in the future. Prior to January 23, 2013, the Fund s underlying strategies were actively managed.

When received by a broker-dealer or other intermediary, such payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and salespersons to recommend the Fund over other mutual funds available as investment options in a variable contract. Ask the salesperson or visit the financial intermediary s website for more information. Purchase and Sale of Fund Shares The Fund does not offer its shares to the general public. Shares of the Fund are currently offered only to Accounts of various life insurance companies as funding vehicles for certain variable contracts issued by such life insurance companies. The Company has entered into an agreement with the life insurance company sponsor of each Account (participation agreement) setting forth the terms and conditions pursuant to which the insurer will purchase and redeem shares of the Fund. For information regarding the purchase and sale of Fund shares, see the contract prospectus or other disclosure document for such contract which describes the particular Account and variable contract. Tax Information Since the Accounts of the various life insurance companies are the only shareholders of the Fund, no discussion is included herein as to the federal income tax consequences for such Accounts. For information concerning the federal income tax consequences to the purchasers of variable contracts, see the contract prospectus or other disclosure document for such contract which describes the particular Account and variable contract. Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial Intermediaries Shares of the Fund are available only through the purchase of variable contracts issued by certain life insurance companies. The Company and its affiliates may pay such insurance companies (or their related companies) for the sale of shares of the Fund and/or administrative or other related services. When received by an insurance company, such payments may be a factor that the insurance company considers in including the Fund as an investment option in its variable contracts. The prospectus or other disclosure document for the variable contracts may contain additional information about these payments. Such insurance companies (or their related 58 More on Strategies, Risks and Disclosure of Portfolio Holdings Important Definitions This section defines important terms that may be unfamiliar to an investor reading about the Fund: Asset-backed securities represent a participation in, or are secured by and payable from, a stream of payments generated by particular assets, such as commercial paper, credit card receivables, auto loans or home equity loans. Bank deposits are cash, checks or drafts deposited in a financial institution for credit to a customer s account. Banks differentiate between demand deposits (checking accounts on which the customer may draw) and time deposits, which pay interest and have a specified maturity or require 30 days notice before withdrawal. Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index is a market valueweighted index of taxable investment-grade debt issues, including government, corporate, asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities, with maturities of one year or more. This index is designed to represent the performance of the U.S. investment-grade fixed-rate bond market. Cash includes bank deposits and highly rated, liquid shortterm instruments such as money market instruments. Certain of these instruments may be referred to as cash equivalents. Commercial paper includes short-term debt securities issued by banks, corporations and other borrowers. Common stock is a class of security representing equity ownership in a corporation. Holders of common stock have the right to elect directors and collect dividends. Common stock claims are subordinate to bondholder claims, preferred stockholders, and general creditors. Convertible securities may be debt or equity securities that pay interest or dividends or are sold at a discount and that may be converted on specified terms into the stock of the issuer. Corporate bonds are debt securities issued by companies. Debt obligations of supranational agencies are obligations of multi-jurisdictional agencies that operate across national borders (e.g., the World Bank). Debt securities are bonds and other securities that are used by issuers to borrow money from investors. Holders of debt securities have a higher priority claim to assets than do equity holders. Typically, the debt issuer pays the investor a fixed, variable or floating rate of interest and must repay the borrowed amount at maturity. Some debt securities, such as zero coupon obligations, are sold at a discount from their face values instead of paying interest. Depositary receipts represent interests in an account at a bank or trust company which holds equity securities. These interests may include American Depositary Receipts (held at U.S. banks and traded in the United States), European Depositary Receipts, Global Depositary Receipts or other similar instruments. Derivative instruments are instruments or contracts whose values are based on the performance of an underlying financial asset, currency or index and include futures contracts (on single stocks, on indices, currencies or bonds), options (on stocks, indices, currencies, futures contracts or bonds), forward contracts, swaps (including interest rate and credit default swaps), interest-only and principal-only debt securities, certain mortgage-backed securities like collateralized mortgage obligations ( CMOs ), and structured and indexed securities. Duration is the expected change in the value of a portfolio of fixed income securities that will result from a 1% change in interest rates. Duration is stated in years. For example, a 5 year average portfolio duration means the portfolio would be expected to decrease in value by 5% if interest rates rise 1%. Unlike maturity, duration takes into account interest payments that occur throughout the course of holding a fixed income security. Emerging market securities include interests in or obligations of governments or entities located in an emerging market country. An emerging market country is any country having an economy and market that are (or would be) considered by the World Bank to be emerging or developing. Emerging market countries are located in regions such as Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, Southern Europe, Eastern Europe (including the former republics of the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc) and Africa. Equitized cash is a technique that uses futures or other instruments (such as exchange traded funds ( ETFs )) to gain equity market exposure for holdings of cash. The use of futures or other instruments would be subject to other applicable restrictions on the Fund s investments. Equity securities may include common stocks, preferred securities, depositary receipts, convertible securities and rights and warrants of U.S. and foreign companies. Stocks represent an ownership interest in a corporation. Floating and variable rate instruments are securities with floating or variable rates of interest or dividend payments. Foreign debt securities are issued by foreign corporations or governments. They may include the following: Eurodollar Bonds, which are dollar-denominated securities issued outside the U.S. by foreign corporations and financial institutions and by foreign branches of U.S. corporations and financial institutions Yankee Bonds, which are dollar-denominated securities issued by foreign issuers in the U.S. Debt securities denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars Foreign securities include interests in or obligations of governments or entities located outside the United States. The determination of where an issuer of a security is located will be made by reference to the country in which the issuer (i) is organized, (ii) derives at least 50% of its revenues or profits from goods produced or sold, investments made or services 69 GE Investments Funds, Inc. Prospectus May 1, 2015 performed, (iii) has at least 50% of its assets situated, (iv) has the principal trading market for its securities, or (v) is assessed a non-u.s. risk rating by a recognized third-party rating agency. Foreign securities may be denominated in non-u.s. currencies and traded outside the United States or may be in the form of depositary receipts. Forward contracts involve agreements to exchange one currency for another at a future date. Forward contracts, unlike futures contracts, are not traded on exchanges and are not standardized; rather, banks and dealers act as principals in these markets, negotiating each transaction on an individual basis. Futures contracts are agreements to buy or sell a specific amount of a commodity, financial instrument, currency or index at a particular price and future date. Options on futures contracts give the purchaser the right, in return for the premium paid, to assume a position in a futures contract at a specified exercise price at any time prior to the expiration date of the option. Government stripped mortgage-related securities are mortgage-backed securities that have been separated into their interest and principal components. They represent interests in distributions of interest on or principal underlying mortgage-backed securities. Growth investing involves buying stocks with above-average growth rates. Typically, growth stocks are the stocks of faster growing companies in more rapidly growing sectors of the economy. Generally, growth stock valuation levels will be higher than those of value stocks and the market averages. Illiquid investments are securities or other instruments that cannot be sold within seven days for a price approximately equal to the value they currently have on the Fund s books. Illiquid investments may include repurchase agreements maturing in more than seven days, swaps, time deposits with a notice or demand period of more than seven days, certain over-the-counter option contracts (and segregated assets used to cover such options), participation interests in loans, and certain restricted securities. Industrial development bonds are considered municipal bonds if the interest paid is exempt from federal income tax. They are issued by or on behalf of public authorities to raise money to finance various privately operated facilities for business and manufacturing, housing, sports, and pollution control. These bonds may also be used to finance public facilities such as airports, mass transit systems, ports and parking. The payment of the principal and interest on such bonds is dependent solely on the ability of the facility s user to meet its financial obligations and the pledge, if any, of real and personal property financed by the bond as security for those payments. Investment-grade debt securities are rated Baa or better by Moody s Investors Service, Inc. and BBB or better by Standard and Poor s Ratings Services, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. ( S&P ) (or are comparably rated by another nationally recognized statistical rating organization), or, if not rated, are considered by portfolio management to be of similar quality to such securities. Securities rated in the fourth highest grade have some speculative elements. Morgan Stanley Capital International All Country World Index Ex-U.S. ( MSCI ACWI Ex-U.S. Index ) is a marketcapitalization-weighted index designed to provide a broad measure of stock performance throughout the world, with the exception of U.S.-based companies. The MSCI ACWI Ex-U.S. Index includes both developed and emerging markets. Maturity represents the date on which a debt security matures or when the issuer must pay back the principal amount of the security. Money market instruments are short-term debt securities of the U.S. Government, banks, corporations and other entities. The Fund may invest directly in money market instruments, and may also invest indirectly in money market instruments through investments in the State Street Institutional U.S. Government Money Market Fund (the State Street Money Market Fund ). Mortgage-backed securities include securities issued by the Government National Mortgage Association ( Ginnie Mae ), the Federal National Mortgage Association ( Fannie Mae ), the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ( Freddie Mac ), other government agencies and private issuers. They may also include CMOs, which are derivative instruments that are fully collateralized by a portfolio of mortgages or mortgage-related securities. Mortgage dollar rolls are transactions involving the sale of a mortgage-backed security with a simultaneous contract (with the purchaser) to buy similar, but not identical, securities at a future date. Municipal obligations are debt securities issued by or on behalf of states, territories and possessions of the United States and the District of Columbia and their political subdivisions, agencies and instrumentalities, or multi-state agencies or authorities that pay interest exempt from regular federal income taxes and, in some cases, from federal alternative minimum taxes. They include: (i) municipal leases; (ii) participation interests in municipal obligations, whichare proportionate, undivided interests in municipal obligations; (iii) municipal obligation components, which are municipal obligations that have been divided into two components (one component pays interest at a rate adjusted periodically through an auction process, the second pays the residual rate after the auction rate is deducted from total interest payable); (iv) custodial receipts on municipal obligations, which evidence ownership of future interest payments, principal payments, or both, on certain municipal obligations;(v)tender option bonds;and(vi)industrial development bonds. Preferred securities are classes of stock that pay dividends at a specified rate. Dividends are paid on preferred stocks before they are paid on common stocks. In addition, preferred stockholders have priority over common stockholders as to the proceeds from the liquidation of a company s assets. 710 More on Strategies, Risks and Disclosure of Portfolio Holdings Important Definitions Purchasing and writing options are permitted investment strategies for the Fund. An option is the right to buy (i.e., a call) or sell (i.e., a put) securities or other interests for a predetermined price on or before a fixed date. A securities index option represents the option holder s right to obtain from the seller, in cash, a fixed multiple of the amount by which the exercise price exceeds (in the case of a put) or is less than (in the case of a call) the closing value of the securities index on the exercise date. An option on a foreign currency represents the right to buy or sell a particular amount of that currency for a predetermined price on or before a fixed date. Repurchase agreements (repos) are used to invest cash on a short-term basis. A seller (bank or broker-dealer) sells securities, usually government securities, to a fund, agreeing to buy them back at a designated price and time usually the next day. Restricted securities (which include Rule 144A securities) may have contractual restrictions on resale, or cannot be resold publicly until registered. Certain restricted securities may be illiquid. Illiquid investments may be difficult or impossible to sell when the Fund wants to sell them at a price at which the Fund values them. Reverse repurchase agreements involve selling securities held and concurrently agreeing to repurchase the same securities at a specified price and future date. Rights represent a preemptive right of stockholders to purchase additional shares of a stock at the time of a new issuance, before the stock is offered to the general public, allowing the stockholder to retain the same ownership percentage after the new stock offering. Rule 144A securities are restricted securities that may be sold to certain institutional purchasers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Russell 2000 Index is a market-capitalization-weighted index consisting of 2,000 of the smallest U.S.-domiciled publicly traded common stocks that are included in the Russell 3000 Index. The Russell 3000 Index is comprised of the 3,000 largest U.S. domiciled companies. S&P 500 Index is an unmanaged, market-capitalizationweighted index of stocks of over 500 large U.S. companies, which is widely used as a measure of large-cap U.S. stock market performance. S&P MidCap 400 Index is an unmanaged, marketcapitalization-weighted index of stocks of 400 mid-sized U.S. companies representing all major industries in the mid-range of the U.S. stock market. Short sales against the box involve selling short securities actually owned or otherwise covered at all times during the period the short position is open. Structured and indexed securities are securities whose principal and/or interest rate is determined by reference to changes in the value of one or more specific currencies, interest rates, commodities, indices or other financial indicators, but do not include securities issued by other investment companies. Swaps are two-party contracts entered into primarily by institutional investors for periods ranging from a few weeks to more than a year. In a standard swap transaction, two parties agree to exchange the returns earned on specified assets, such as the return on, or increase in value of, a particular dollar amount invested at a particular interest rate. Interest rate swaps involve the exchange by the Fund with another party of their respective commitments to pay or receive interest, such as an exchange of fixed rate payments for floating rate payments. Credit default swaps are transactions in which the buyer is obligated to pay the seller a periodic stream of payments over the term of the contract provided no event of default has occurred. In the event of default, the seller must pay the buyer the par value (full notional value) of the reference obligation in exchange for the reference obligation. Tender option bonds are long-term municipal obligations sold by a bank or other financial institution subject to a demand feature that gives the purchaser the right to sell them to the bank or other financial institution at par plus accrued interest at designated times (tender option). The interest rate on the bonds is typically reset at the end of the applicable interval in an attempt to cause the bonds to have a market value that approximates their par value, plus accrued interest. The tender option may not be exercisable in the event of a default on, or significant downgrading of, the underlying municipal obligation, and may be subject to other conditions. Therefore, the Fund s ability to exercise the tender option will be affected by the credit standing of both the bank or other financial institution involved and the issuer of the underlying securities. U.S. Government securities are securities that are issued or guaranteed as to principal and interest by the U.S. Government or one of its agencies or instrumentalities. Some U.S. Government securities are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government, such as U.S. Treasury bills and notes and obligations of Ginnie Mae. Other U.S. Government securities are neither issued by nor guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government, including those issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. All U.S. Government securities are considered highly credit worthy. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been operating under a conservatorship since 2008, with the Federal Housing Finance Agency ( FHFA ) acting as their conservator, and receive certain financing support from and have access to certain borrowing arrangements with the U.S. Treasury. The status of these entities and the value of their securities and the securities which they guarantee could be affected to the extent the entities no longer receive such support. Value investing involves buying stocks that are out of favor and/or undervalued in comparison to their peers and/or their prospects for growth. Generally, value stocks have lower valuation levels than growth stocks. 811 GE Investments Funds, Inc. Prospectus May 1, 2015 Variable rate securities, which include floating and variable rate instruments, are securities that carry interest rates that fluctuate or may be adjusted periodically to market rates. Interest rate adjustments could increase or decrease the income generated by the securities. Various investment techniques are utilized by the Fund to increase or decrease its exposure to changing security prices, interest rates, currency exchange rates, commodity prices or other factors that affect security values. These techniques may involve derivative instruments and transactions such as buying and selling options and futures contracts, entering into forward contracts or swaps and purchasing indexed securities. These techniques are designed to adjust the risk and return characteristics of the Fund s portfolio of investments and are not used for leverage. The Fund is not under any obligation to use any of these techniques at any given time or under any particular economic condition and there can be no assurance that the utilization of such investment techniques will benefit the Fund. To the extent that the Fund employs these techniques, the Fund would be subject to derivative instruments risk. Warrants are securities that are usually issued together with a bond or preferred securities, that permit the holder to buy a proportionate amount of common stock at a specified price that is usually higher than the stock price at the time of issue. Weighted average effective maturity represents the length of time in days or years until the average security in a money market or income fund will mature or be redeemed by its issuer, taking into account all expected prepayments, puts and adjustable coupons. The average effective maturity is weighted according to the dollar amounts invested in the various securities in the Fund. This measure indicates a money market fund or an income fund s sensitivity to changes in interest rates. In general, the longer the Fund s weighted average effective maturity, the more its share price will fluctuate in response to changing interest rates. When-issued and delayed delivery securities are securities that are purchased or sold for delivery and payment at a future date, i.e., beyond normal settlement date. Zero coupon obligations are securities that pay no interest to their holders prior to maturity. Instead, interest is paid in a lump sum at maturity. They are purchased at a discount from par value, and generally are more volatile than other fixed income securities. 912 More on Strategies, Risks and Disclosure of Portfolio Holdings More on Investment Strategies In addition to the Fund s principal investment strategies described earlier in this Prospectus, the Fund is permitted to invest in other securities or use other investment strategies or techniques in pursuit of its investment objective. The Fund is not under any obligation to invest in or use any other securities, strategies or techniques at any given time or under any particular economic condition. Certain securities, strategies and techniques may expose the Fund to other risks and considerations, which are discussed later in this Prospectus or in the GE Investments Funds Statement of Additional Information ( SAI ). Cash and Temporary Defensive Positions: Under normal circumstances, the Fund may hold cash: (i) pending investment, (ii) for investment purposes, (iii) for cash management purposes, such as to meet redemptions or pay operating expenses, and (iv) during restructuring. The Fund invests in equity securities and may equitize cash in order to gain general equity market exposure with respect to such holdings of cash. The Fund may from time to time take temporary defensive positions when its portfolio manager believes that adverse market, economic, political or other conditions exist. In these circumstances, the portfolio manager may hold cash without limit, or restrict the securities markets in which the Fund s assets are invested by investing those assets in securities markets deemed to be conservative in light of the Fund s investment objective and strategies. In addition, the Fund may hold cash under circumstances where the liquidation of the Fund has been approved by the Company s Board of Directors and therefore investments in accordance with the Fund s investment objective and policies would no longer be appropriate. The Fund may invest directly in money market instruments and may also invest indirectly in money market instruments through investment in the State Street Money Market Fund. To the extent that the Fund holds cash for temporary defensive positions, it may not achieve its investment objective. 1013 GE Investments Funds, Inc.

The Fund s risk exposure is determined primarily by its principal investment strategies, which are described earlier in the Summary Section of this Prospectus. Investments in the Fund are not insured against loss of principal. As with any mutual fund, there can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. Investing in shares of the Fund should not be considered a complete investment program. The share value of the Fund will rise and fall. One of your most important investment considerations should be balancing risk and return. Different types of investments tend to respond differently to shifts in the economic and financial environment. So, diversifying your investments among different asset classes such as stocks, bonds and cash and within an asset class such as small-cap and large-cap stocks may help to manage risk and achieve the results you need to reach your financial goals. The stock and bond markets in the United States and internationally have experienced unprecedented volatility in recent years. This financial crisis caused a significant decline in the value and liquidity of many securities. Despite gains in some markets after steep declines, such as those experienced during certain periods of , negative conditions and price declines may return unexpectedly and dramatically. In these types of situations, it may not be possible to identify all significant risks and opportunities using past investment strategies or models. The primary risks of particular investments are summarized below. For more information about the risks associated with the Fund, please see the SAI, which is incorporated by reference into this Prospectus. Allocation Risk: GE Asset Management may not allocate assets of the Fund among asset classes in an optimal manner, if, among other reasons, it does not correctly assess the attractiveness of an asset class. Asset-Backed Securities Risk: Because asset-backed securities often are secured by the loans underlying the securities, the Fund may lose money if there are defaults on the loans underlying the securities. Such defaults have increased the risk for asset-backed securities that are secured by home-equity loans related to sub-prime mortgage loans, especially in a declining residential real estate market. Asset-backed securities also may be subject to more rapid repayment than their stated maturity dates indicate, due to changing economic conditions. To maintain its position in such securities, the Fund may reinvest the reductions in principal amounts resulting from the prepayments. Yields on those reinvested amounts are subject to prevailing market rates. Because prepayments of principal generally increase when rates are falling, the Fund generally has to reinvest proceeds from prepayments at lower rates. Investments in assetbacked securities may also be subject to valuation risk. Credit Risk: The price of a bond is affected by the issuer s or counterparty s credit quality. Changes in an entity s financial condition and general economic conditions can affect its ability to honor financial obligations and therefore its credit quality. Lower quality bonds are generally more sensitive to these changes than higher quality bonds. Even within securities considered investment grade, differences exist in credit quality and some investment-grade debt securities may have speculative characteristics. A security s price may be adversely affected by the market s perception of the security s credit quality level even if the issuer or counterparty has suffered no degradation in its ability to honor the obligation. Derivative Instruments Risk: The Fund s use of various investment techniques may involve derivative instruments, such as forward contracts, futures and options on futures, options and swaps. There is no guarantee that these techniques will work. The Fund may, but is not required to, use derivatives as a substitute for taking a long or short position in an underlying asset, to increase returns, or as part of a hedging strategy. Some derivatives have the effect of leverage on the Fund, meaning that a small investment in derivatives could have a potentially large impact on the Fund s performance and its rate of income distributions for a particular period of time. The use of derivatives involves risks different from, and/or possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in the underlying assets. Potential losses from certain derivatives are unlimited. Derivatives can be highly volatile, illiquid and difficult to value. Derivatives not traded on an exchange may be subject to counterparty risk (i.e., the risk that a counterparty to a derivative transaction may be unable to fulfill its obligations). There is also the risk that changes in the value of a derivative held by the Fund may not correlate with the Fund s other investments which could impact Fund performance. The Fund may choose not to invest in derivative instruments because of their cost, limited availability or any number of other reasons deemed relevant by GE Asset Management and the portfolio manager(s) responsible for managing the Fund. Forward Contracts Risk: The principals who deal in the forward markets are not required to continue to make markets in the currencies or commodities they trade and these markets can experience periods of illiquidity, sometimes of significant duration. While the Fund may enter into forward contracts to reduce currency exchange rate risks, transactions in such contracts involve certain other risks. Therefore, while the Fund may benefit from such transactions, unanticipated changes in currency prices may result in a poorer overall performance for the Funds than if they had not engaged in any such transactions. Moreover, there may be imperfect correlation between the Fund s portfolio holdings of securities quoted or denominated in a particular currency and forward contracts entered into by the Fund. Such imperfect correlation may cause the Fund to sustain losses which will prevent the Fund from achieving a complete hedge or expose the Fund to risk of foreign exchange loss. Futures Contracts Risk: When the Fund uses futures contracts as a hedging technique, because perfect correlation between a futures position and the Fund position 1215 GE Investments Funds, Inc. Prospectus May 1, 2015 that is intended to be hedged is impossible to achieve, the desired protection may not be obtained and the Fund may be exposed to additional risk of loss. The loss that may be incurred by entering into futures contracts could exceed the amount of the premium paid and may be potentially unlimited. Futures markets are highly volatile and the use of futures may increase the volatility of the Fund s net asset value. Additionally, because of the low collateral deposits normally involved in futures trading, a high degree of leverage is typical of a futures trading account. As a result, a relatively small movement in the price or value of a futures contract increases the risk of losing more than the amount initially invested by the Fund. Furthermore, exchanges may limit fluctuations in futures contract prices during a trading session by imposing a maximum permissible price movement on each futures contract. The Fund may be disadvantaged if it is prohibited from executing a trade outside the daily permissible price movement. Futures contracts executed on foreign exchanges may not be provided the same protections as provided by U.S. exchanges. Options Risk: Writing and purchasing call and put options are highly specialized activities and entail greater than ordinary investment risks. Although options are intended to enable the Fund to manage market and interest rate risks, these investments can be highly volatile and the Fund s use of them could result in poorer investment performance. If the Fund purchases options, it is subject to the risk of a complete loss of the amounts paid as premiums to purchase the options. Unusual market conditions or the lack of a ready market for any particular option at a specific time may reduce the effectiveness of the Fund s option strategies, and for these and other reasons the Fund s option strategies may not reduce the Fund s volatility to the extent desired. Interest Rate Swaps and Credit Default Swaps Risk: The use of swaps is a highly specialized activity that involves investment techniques and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. If a portfolio manager is incorrect in forecasting interest rates and uses interest rate swaps, the investment performance of the Fund may be adversely impacted due to the use of such swaps. If the Fund is a buyer of a credit default swap and no event of default occurs, the Fund will not earn any return on its investment. If the Fund is a seller of a credit default swap, the Fund s risk of loss may be the entire notional amount of the swap. Swaps may also subject the Fund to the risk that the counterparty to the transaction may not fulfill its obligations. Emerging Markets Risk: Emerging market securities bear various foreign investment risks discussed below. In addition, there are greater risks involved in investing in emerging markets compared to developed foreign markets. Specifically, the economic structures in emerging market countries are less diverse and mature than those in developed countries, and their political systems are less stable. Investments in emerging market countries may be affected by national policies that restrict foreign investment. Emerging market countries may have less developed legal structures, and the small size of their securities markets and low trading volumes can make investments illiquid and more volatile than investments in developed countries. Investing in emerging market countries may require the Fund to establish special custody or other arrangements before investing, which may result in additional risks and costs to the Fund. Foreign Investment Risk: Investing in foreign securities, including depositary receipts, or securities of U.S. entities with significant foreign operations, involves additional risks that can affect the Fund s performance. Foreign markets, particularly emerging markets, may be less liquid, more volatile and subject to less regulation than U.S. markets. There may be difficulties in enforcing contractual obligations, and it may take more time for transactions to clear and settle in foreign countries than in the U.S. Less information may be available about foreign issuers. The costs of buying and selling foreign securities, including tax, brokerage and custody costs, generally are higher than those involving domestic transactions. The specific risks of investing in foreign securities include valuation risk and: Currency Risk: The values of foreign investments may be affected by changes in currency rates or exchange control regulations. If the local currency gains strength against the U.S. dollar, the value of the foreign security increases in U.S. dollar terms. Conversely, if the local currency weakens against the U.S. dollar, the value of the foreign security declines in U.S. dollar terms. U.S. dollar-denominated securities of foreign issuers, including depositary receipts, also are subject to currency risk based on their related investments. The Fund is permitted to hedge against foreign currency risk, but normally will not do so. Political/Economic Risk: Changes in economic, tax or foreign investment policies, government stability, war or other political or economic actions may have an adverse effect on the Fund s foreign investments. Regulatory Risk: Foreign companies often are not subject to uniform accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards or to other regulatory practices and requirements common to U.S. companies. Additional Risks Related to Debt and Economic Conditions: The risk of loss and volatility have increased over the past few years and may continue because of high levels of debt and other economic distress in various countries, including some in Europe. Attempted solutions such as austerity or stimulus measures and government intervention also may increase the risk of loss and volatility in securities markets. Government Stripped Mortgage-Related Securities Risk: In addition to prepayment risk, the yields on government stripped mortgage-related securities are extremely sensitive to prepayment on the underlying mortgage loans. A rapid rate of principal payments will reduce the yield to maturity on 1316 More on Strategies, Risks and Disclosure of Portfolio Holdings More on Risks interest only mortgage-related securities and increase the yield to maturity on principal only mortgage-related securities. If the underlying mortgage loans experience greater-than anticipated principal payments, the Fund may not fully recoup its initial investment in interest only mortgage-related securities. The market for such securities may be volatile and they are considered illiquid unless certain conditions are met. Investments in government stripped mortgage-related securities may also be subject to valuation risk. Interest Rate Risk: Bond prices generally rise when interest rates decline and generally decline when interest rates rise. The longer the duration of a bond, the more a change in interest rates affects the bond s price. Short-term and longterm interest rates may not move the same amount and may not move in the same direction. In recent periods, governmental financial regulators, including the U.S. Federal Reserve, have taken steps to maintain historically low interest rates. It is possible there will be less governmental action in the future to maintain low interest rates, or that governmental action will be less effective in maintaining low interest rates. Changes in market conditions and government action may have adverse effects on investments, volatility, and liquidity in debt markets and any negative impact on fixed income securities could be swift and significant, potentially increasing Fund redemptions and negatively impacting the Fund s performance. Substantial redemptions from bond and other income funds may worsen that impact. Dividend and paying and other types of equity securities also may be adversely affected from an increase in interest rates. Liquidity Risk: Illiquid investments may be difficult to resell at approximately the price they are valued in the ordinary course of business within seven days. When investments cannot be sold readily at the desired time or price, the Fund may have to accept a much lower price, may not be able to sell the investment at all, or may be forced to forego other investment opportunities, all of which may adversely impact the Fund s returns. Illiquid investments also may be subject to valuation risk. Mortgage-Backed Securities Risk: Mortgage-backed securities that are collateralized by a portfolio of mortgages or mortgage-related securities depend on the payments of principal and interest made by or through the underlying assets, which may not be sufficient to meet the payment obligations of the mortgage-backed securities. Prepayments of principal, which occur more frequently in falling interest rate conditions, may shorten the term and reduce the value of these securities. The quality and value of the underlying collateral may decline, or default, which has become a significant risk for collateral related to sub-prime mortgage loans, especially in a declining residential real estate market. Further, these securities generally are privately sold and may not be readily marketable, particularly after a rapid decrease in value. Investments in mortgage-backed securities may also be subject to valuation risk. Municipal Obligations Risk: Municipal obligations are backed by the entities that issue them and/or other revenue streams. Like other debt securities, prices of municipal debt securities are affected inversely by changes in interest rates and by changes in the credit rating or financial condition of the issuer. Income derived from investments in municipal obligations typically is exempt from regular federal income tax but may be subject to state and local taxes. Capital gains from the disposition of municipal obligations are subject to tax. In addition, interest income on certain municipal obligations may be subject to federal corporate and individual alternative minimum taxes. The municipal obligations market is volatile and may be significantly affected by tax, legislative or political changes. Some municipal obligations are insured, which is intended to guarantee the timely payment of interest and repayment of principal. Passive Strategy Risk: The Fund utilizes a passive investment strategy, attempting to track the performance of an unmanaged index(es) of securities. The ability of the Fund to achieve significant correlation between the performance of the Fund (or asset class of the Fund) and an index may be affected by changes in the securities markets, changes in the composition of an index, the timing of purchases and redemptions of Fund shares, and fees and expenses of the Fund. A Fund employing a passive strategy will hold constituent securities of an index(es) regardless of the current or projected performance of a specific security or a particular industry or market sector. Maintaining investments in securities regardless of market conditions or the performance of individual securities could cause the Fund s return to be lower than if the Fund employed an active strategy. Prepayment Risk: Prices and yields of certain securities such as mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities assume the securities will be redeemed at a given time. When interest rates decline, such securities experience higher prepayments because the underlying mortgages or loans are repaid earlier than expected. The Fund s portfolio manager may be forced to invest the proceeds from prepaid mortgagebacked securities or asset-backed securities at lower rates, which results in a lower return for the Fund. When interest rates increase, such securities experience lower prepayments because borrowers are less likely to repay their loans. This typically reduces the value of the underlying securities. Redemption Risk: The Fund may need to sell its holdings in order to meet shareholder redemption requests. The Fund could experience a loss when selling securities to meet redemption requests if the redemption requests are unusually large or frequent, occur in times of overall market turmoil or declining prices for the securities sold, or when the securities the Fund wishes to or is required to sell are illiquid. The Fund may be unable to sell illiquid securities at its desired time or price. Illiquidity can be caused by a drop in overall market trading volume, an inability to find a ready buyer, or legal restrictions on the securities resale. Certain securities that were liquid when purchased may later become illiquid, particularly in times of overall economic distress. 1417 GE Investments Funds, Inc. Prospectus May 1, 2015 Repurchase Agreements Risk: The Fund may suffer a loss if the other party to the repurchase agreement transaction defaults on its obligations and could be delayed or prevented from exercising its rights to dispose of the underlying securities. The value of the underlying securities may decline while the Fund seeks to assert its rights. The Fund could incur additional expenses in asserting its rights or may lose all or part of the income from the agreement. Restricted Securities Risk: Restricted securities (including Rule 144A securities) may be subject to legal restraints on resale and, therefore, are typically less liquid than other securities. The prices received from reselling restricted securities in privately negotiated transactions may be less than those originally paid by the Fund. Investors in restricted securities may not benefit from the same investor protection requirements as publicly traded securities. Reverse Repurchase Agreements Risk: A reverse repurchase agreement involves the risk that the market value of the securities retained by the Fund may decline below the price of the securities that the Fund has previously sold but is later obligated to repurchase at a higher price under the agreement. Securities Market Risk is the risk that the value of securities owned by the Fund may go up or down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably, due to factors affecting particular companies or the securities markets generally. A general downturn in the securities markets may cause multiple asset classes to decline in value simultaneously, although equity securities generally have greater price volatility than fixed income securities. Negative conditions and price declines may occur unexpectedly and dramatically. In addition, the Fund could be forced to sell portfolio securities at an inopportune time in order to meet unusually large or frequent redemption requests in times of overall market turmoil or declining prices for the securities. Stock market risk is the risk that the value of equity securities may decline. Stock prices change daily, sometimes rapidly, in response to company activity and general economic and market conditions. Certain stocks may decline in value even during periods when the prices of equity securities in general are rising, or may not perform as well as the market in general. Stock prices may also experience greater volatility during periods of challenging market conditions such as the one that the market recently experienced. Additional stock market risk may be introduced when a particular equity security is traded on a foreign market. For more detail on the related risks involved in foreign markets, see Foreign Investment Risk above. Bond market risk includes the risk that the value and liquidity of debt securities may be reduced under certain circumstances. Bond prices can change daily, sometimes rapidly, in response to issuer activity and general economic and credit market conditions. Bond prices can be volatile and there can be severe limitations in the ability to value or sell certain bonds, including those that are of higher credit quality, during periods of reduced credit market liquidity such as the one that the market recently experienced. Style Risk: Securities with different characteristics tend to shift in and out of favor depending upon market and economic conditions as well as investor sentiment. The Fund may underperform other funds that employ a different style. The Fund also may employ a combination of styles that impact its risk characteristics. Examples of different styles include growth and value investing, as well as those focusing on large, medium, or small company securities. Mid-Cap Company Risk: Investments in securities of midcap companies may entail greater risks than investments in larger, more established companies. Mid-cap companies tend to have more narrow product lines, more limited financial resources and a more limited trading market for their stocks, as compared with larger companies. As a result, their stock prices may decline more significantly or more rapidly than stocks of larger companies as market conditions change. Small-Cap Company Risk: Investing in securities of smallcap companies may involve greater risks than investing in larger, more established companies. Smaller companies may have limited product lines, markets or financial resources. Their securities may trade less frequently and in more limited volume than securities of larger, more established companies. In addition, smaller companies are typically subject to greater changes in earnings and business prospects than are larger companies. Consequently, the prices of small company stocks tend to rise and fall in value more than other stocks. Although investing in small-cap companies may offer potential for above-average returns, the companies may not succeed and their stock prices could decline significantly. Investments in small-cap companies may also be subject to valuation risk. Valuation Risk: Portfolio securities may be valued using techniques other than market quotations, under the circumstances described under Calculating Share Value. The value established for a portfolio security may be different than what would be produced through the use of another methodology or if it had been priced using market quotations. Portfolio securities that are valued using techniques other than market quotations, including fair valued securities, may be subject to greater fluctuation in their value from one day to the next than would be the case if market quotations were used. In addition, there is no assurance that the Fund could sell a portfolio security for the value established for it at any time and it is possible that the Fund would incur a loss because a portfolio security is sold at a discount to its established value. Disclosure of Portfolio Holdings GE Asset Management has adopted policies and procedures to protect the Fund s portfolio information and to prevent the misuse of that information by a third party. GE Asset Management limits disclosure of portfolio information to situations it believes will not result in material harm to or 1518 More on Strategies, Risks and Disclosure of Portfolio Holdings Disclosure of Portfolio Holdings disadvantage investors in the Fund. The Fund will generally disclose on its website (www.geam.com) the complete list of month-end portfolio holdings for the Fund, 30 days after the end of each month. Top 10 portfolio holdings and portfolio characteristics (such as sector and regional weightings) are generally posted monthly for the Fund, 15 days after the end of each month. A description of the Fund s policies and procedures relating to the disclosure of portfolio holdings is available in the Fund s SAI. 1619 GE Investments Funds, Inc. Prospectus May 1, 2015 About the Investment Adviser Investment Adviser, Administrator and Sub-Administrator GE Asset Management, located at 1600 Summer Street, Stamford, Connecticut 06905, is the investment adviser and administrator of each Fund. GE Asset Management is a whollyowned subsidiary of General Electric Company ( GE ) and a registered investment adviser. As of December 31, 2014, GE Asset Management had approximately $116 billion of assets under management, of which approximately $21 billion was invested in mutual funds. For many years, GE s tradition of ingenuity and customer focus has included financial services. In the late 1920s, through a desire to promote the financial well-being of its employees, GE began managing assets for its employee pension plan. By the mid-1930s, GE pioneered some of the nation s earliest mutual funds, the Elfun Funds to be followed years later by the GE Retirement Savings Plan Funds. The success of these funds spurred growth; eventually GE expanded its mutual fund offerings to include a wide variety of investment products called the GE Family of Funds. GE Asset Management bases its investment philosophy on two enduring principles. First, GE Asset Management believes that a disciplined, consistent approach to investing can add value to an investment portfolio over the long term. Its commitment to in-depth research, sound judgment and hard work provides investors with an opportunity to take advantage of attractive investments around the world. Second, GE Asset Management follows the same principles of integrity and quality that have guided GE over the past century and have made it the worldclass company that it is today. Management Fee: The Fund pays GE Asset Management a combined fee for advisory and administrative services that is accrued daily and paid monthly ( Management Fee ). GE Asset Management has retained BlackRock Investment Management, LLC ( BlackRock ) to manage the Fund s assets. GE Asset Management pays BlackRock an investment subadvisory fee out of the Management Fee that it receives from the Fund. The investment sub-advisory fee is paid monthly and is based upon the average daily net assets of the Fund s assets that are allocated to and managed by BlackRock. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014, the Fund paid GE Asset Management the following Management Fee as a percentage of average net assets: Total Return Fund 0.35% From time to time, GE Asset Management may waive or reimburse the management fee paid by the Fund. Under a separate sub-administration agreement, GE Asset Management has delegated certain administrative functions to State Street Bank and Trust Company, One Lincoln Street, Boston, Massachusetts ( State Street Bank ). Under the sub-administration agreement, State Street Bank performs certain back office services to support GE Asset Management including, among other things, furnishing financial and performance information about the Fund for inclusion in regulatory filings and Board and shareholder reports; preparing regulatory filings, Board materials and tax returns; performing expense and budgeting functions; performing tax compliance testing; and maintaining books and records. Board of Directors Approval of Investment Advisory Agreements The Fund s annual report to shareholders for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2014 contains a discussion regarding the basis for the Company s Board of Directors approval of the investment advisory contract with GE Asset Management and the sub-advisory contract with BlackRock. Manager of Managers Structure GE Asset Management and the Fund have received an exemptive order from the SEC to operate under a manager of managers structure that permits GE Asset Management, with the approval of the Board of Directors, to appoint and replace sub-advisers, enter into sub-advisory agreements, and materially amend and terminate sub-advisory agreements on behalf of the Fund without shareholder approval (the Manager of Managers Structure ). Under the Manager of Managers Structure, GE Asset Management has responsibility, subject to oversight of the Fund s Board of Directors, for overseeing the Fund s sub-advisers and recommending to the Board their hiring, termination, or replacement. The SEC order does not apply to any sub-adviser that is affiliated with the Fund or GE Asset Management. Notwithstanding the SEC exemptive order, adoption of the Manager of Managers Structure by the Fund also requires prior shareholder approval which has been obtained for the Fund. The Manager of Managers Structure enables the Fund to operate with greater efficiency and without incurring the expense and delays associated with obtaining shareholder approvals for matters relating to sub-advisers or sub-advisory agreements. Operation of the Fund under the Manager of Managers Structure will not: (1) permit management fees paid by the Fund to GE Asset Management to be increased without shareholder approval; or (2) diminish GE Asset Management s responsibilities to the Fund, including GE Asset Management s overall responsibility for overseeing the portfolio management services furnished by its sub-advisers. Shareholders will be notified of any changes made to sub-advisers or sub-advisory agreements within 90 days of the change.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
