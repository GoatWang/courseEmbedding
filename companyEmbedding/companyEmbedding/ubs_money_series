Strategy & Benefits

Principal Investment Strategy
The investment strategy of the Direxion Indexed Commodity Strategy Fund includes:

A quantitative, strategic index-based approach to commodity investing
Exposure to 12 commodities that can individually be long or flat (if a short signal is triggered the position is moved to cash)
The ability to make position changes intra-month based on trends
Monthly rebalance based on risk reduction where the allocation of individual components is reduced if volatility exceeds certain predetermined risk levels
A “smart” contract roll approach1

1 Smart Contract Roll Approach – A futures contract roll approach designed to select cost effective futures contracts to roll into upon expiration of current contract.
Why Invest in the Fund?

The long/flat approach provides exposure to commodities that can individually be positioned long or flat (in cash) based upon price trends
Seeks to mitigate the downside risk and maximum declines relative to notable long-only commodity indices
Has the flexibility to make individual commodity position changes intra-month
Risk management controls designed to adjust exposure levels if volatility gets too high
Low- or non-correlation to stocks and bonds
Disciplined, quantitative, rules-based approach to commodity investing




Why Commodities?

Not just commodities – Long/Flat commodities.
Most traditional commodity funds provide long only exposure to commodities. This limits their potential to contribute to a portfolio’s long-term performance because they only benefit if commodity prices rise.
The Direxion Indexed Commodity Strategy Fund seeks to match the performance of the Auspice Broad Commodity ER Index (ABCERI), which provides exposure to 12 commodities that can individually be positioned long or flat (in cash) based upon price trends.
This long/flat index is potentially more adaptive to volatile commodity markets because it seeks to take advantage of individual commodities by going long when prices rise, and mitigate risk by going flat (to cash) when prices fall.
Why consider long/flat commodities?
Most traditional commodity funds can only benefit if commodity prices rise. However, these long-only commodity strategies have shown to be inconsistent over time because:

Commodity returns are typically cyclical and sporadic
Individual commodity sub-sectors tend to perform dissimilarly in different market environments
Significant draw-downs can be damaging to the long-term performance of a portfolio

Within the inherently volatile commodity markets, a long/flat approach is potentially more adaptive to whip-sawing market conditions.

Target Index

The Auspice Broad Commodity ER Index aims to capture upward trends in the commodity markets while minimizing risk during downward trends. The index uses a quantitative methodology to track either long or flat positions in a diversified portfolio of 12 commodity futures covering energy, metals, and agriculture. The index incorporates dynamic risk management and contract rolling methods.

Source: Bloomberg. Data from 10/1/2010 – 6/30/2017. October 1, 2010 is the inception of the Auspice Broad Commodity ER Index. Index returns and correlations are historical and are not representative of any fund performance. Total returns of the index include reinvested dividends. Past performance does not guarantee future results.  One cannot invest directly in an index. The indexes are composite indexes of commodity sector returns representing unmanaged, unleveraged, long-only investment in commodity futures that are broadly diversified across the spectrum of commodities. 

S&P Goldman Sachs Commodity Index (S&P GSCI), a composite index of commodity sector returns representing an unleveraged, long-only investment in commodity futures that is broadly diversified across the spectrum of commodities;
Bloomberg Commodity Total Return Index (BCOM TR), a broadly diversified index that allows investors to track 19 commodity futures through a single, simple measure
Deutsche Banc Liquid Commodity Optimum Yield Index (DBC CI), an index composed of futures contracts on 14 of the most heavily-traded and important physical commodities in the world.

Standard Deviation is a measure of the dispersion of a set of data from its mean.
Correlation is a statistical measure of how two securities move in relation to each other.
Maximum Drawdown is the greatest percent decline from a previous high.

Under this Operating Service Agreement, Rafferty has contractually agreed to pay all expenses of each Fund through September 1, 2018 other than the following: management fees, Rule 12b-1distribution and/or service fees, any front-end or contingent deferred sales loads, acquired fund fees and expenses, taxes, swap financing and related costs, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses such as litigation or other expenses outside the typical day-to-day operations of the Fund. If these expenses were included, the net expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

  Addressing The Top Misconceptions About Alternative Investments    


Alternative strategies have the potential to be a viable way for investors, whether institutional or retail, to reduce risk in their investment portfolios.


  Alternatives? Too Many, or Not Enough?    


The key to risk-adjusted returns and diversification is not the number of securities – it’s their correlation – or, really, non-correlation – to each other, that’s paramount.


  A Correlation Misconception    


Some clients confuse negative correlation with low (or non-) correlation. They mistakenly believe that returns for investments with low correlation move in opposite directions from each other.

UBS Asset Management Announces Changes to Its Money Market Fund Platform | Business Wire
























































      UBS Asset Management Announces Changes to Its Money Market Fund Platform
    





January 28, 2016 06:46 PM Eastern Standard Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--UBS Asset Management (Americas) Inc. ("UBS AM") and its 
      affiliates/predecessors have managed money market funds for more than 35 
      years and offer client-focused solutions throughout the world. In an 
      effort to best address its clients' needs in an era of evolving 
      regulatory reform and industry changes, UBS AM today announced changes 
      to its money market fund platform, including the launch of new products.
    


      Highlights of the changes to UBS AM's money market fund platform include:
    


The UBS Select Prime Funds, with a largely institutional 
        ('non-natural persons') shareholder base, will adopt floating net 
        asset value (FNAV) pricing by an October 2016 regulatory compliance 
        deadline.
      

The UBS Prime Funds, a recently launched retail money market 
        family of funds, will accept investments from retail investors 
        ('natural persons') and seek to maintain a constant net asset value 
        (CNAV) per share of $1.00.
      

The UBS Select Tax-Free Funds intend to qualify as 'retail 
        money market funds' and will also undergo a name change later in 2016.
      

The UBS Select Treasury Funds affirmed their intention, 
        announced in June 2015, to qualify as 'government money market funds' 
        so that they can continue to seek to maintain a CNAV per share of 
        $1.00 once the regulatory changes become fully effective in October 
        2016.
      

The UBS Select Government Funds*, a new suite of government 
        money market funds will be launched in 2016 to complement the existing 
        UBS Select Treasury Funds. These new funds will accept investments 
        from all investors ('natural' and 'non-natural persons') and seek to 
        maintain a CNAV per share of $1.00.
      

The UBS Investor Series will reduce the initial minimum 
        investment requirement from $100,000 to $10,000.
      

UBS AM's sweep money market funds, available via UBS Financial 
        Services' automatic cash 'sweep platform,' will undergo changes later 
        in 2016. Some funds may no longer be offered on cash sweep platforms, 
        and shareholders may be transitioned to alternate money market fund 
        products.
      


      * The UBS Select Government Funds are currently in the process of being 
      registered with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The 
      information regarding the UBS Select Government Funds in their 
      prospectuses and herein is not complete and may be changed. We may not 
      sell those securities until the registration statement filed with the US 
      Securities and Exchange Commission is effective. This document is not an 
      offer to sell those securities and is not soliciting an offer to buy 
      shares of the UBS Select Government Funds in any jurisdictions where the 
      offer or sale is not permitted.
    

      "The changes we announced today and the expansion of our money market 
      fund platform are designed to ensure that all our clients continue to 
      have access to UBS Asset Management's deep capabilities in liquidity 
      management," said Joe Abed, Head of Global Liquidity for UBS Asset 
      Management.
    

      "Evolving our global liquidity product offering in the US is a critical 
      component of UBS Asset Management's growth strategy in the Americas," 
      said Blake Moore, Head of the Americas for UBS Asset Management. "With 
      over $40 billion in US money market assets and almost $99 billion in 
      liquidity products globally as of September 30, 2015, we continue to 
      offer our clients a broad range of investment products to meet their 
      liquidity needs."
    

      As of September 30, 2015, UBS AM had approximately $154 billion in asset 
      under management. UBS AM is a member of the UBS Asset Management 
      division of UBS Group AG, which had approximately $652 billion in assets 
      under management, of which $212 billion were in Fixed Income mandates, 
      including nearly $99 billion in Liquidity Management assets world wide 
      as of September 30, 2015.
    

      UBS AM intends to implement these changes over the course of the next 
      several months and conclude them within the SEC's compliance period, 
      which extends until October 14, 2016. Today's announcement includes 
      details about UBS AM's money market products for both retail and 
      institutional investors, including CNAV and
    

      FNAV pricing, as well as whether the funds will be potentially subject 
      to liquidity fees and/or gates on redemptions (under certain 
      circumstances) as required by the SEC's rule amendments ("fees and/or 
      gates").

      The UBS Select Prime Funds below have a primarily institutional (e.g., 
      non-natural persons) shareholder base and will adopt FNAV pricing and

      become effective on or before October 14, 2016.

UBS Prime Funds


      UBS AM recently launched UBS Prime Funds, a new family of funds that are 
      offered to natural persons. These funds intend to qualify as 'retail 
      money market funds' under the SEC's amended rules and seek to maintain a 
      CNAV per share of $1.00. The funds have expense structures and minimum 
      investment requirements similar to the UBS Select Prime Funds and will 
      be subject to the possibility of fees and/or gates effective on or 
      before October 14, 2016.

      anticipated to begin limiting subscriptions to natural persons by August 
      31, 2016. In connection with the designation as 'retail money market 
      funds', the funds will undergo name changes, dropping 'Select' from 
      their names. These funds will be subject to the possibility of fees 
      and/or gates effective on or before October 14, 2016.

UBS Select Treasury Funds


      UBS AM previously announced changes to its UBS Select Treasury Funds in 
      June 2015, affirming that the funds intend to qualify as 'government 
      money market funds' under the SEC's amended rules. The funds will 
      continue to invest in US Treasury securities and related repurchase 
      agreements.
    

      Under the SEC's amended rules, these Treasury funds may maintain a CNAV 
      per share of $1.00 and will not be subject to fees and/or gates 
      unless their board determines to provide advance notice to shareholders 
      of a change in this policy. The funds will continue to be available as 
      investment options to both natural persons and non-natural persons.

UBS Select Government Funds – New Family of Funds in Development*


      UBS AM is planning to launch new UBS Select Government Funds in 2016 to 
      expand its liquidity management platform and to complement the existing 
      UBS Select Treasury Funds. The funds will be available to both natural 
      persons and non-natural persons. Under the SEC's amended rules, these 
      government money funds may maintain a CNAV per share of $1.00 and will 
      not be subject to fees and/or gates unless their board determines to 
      provide advance notice to shareholders of a change in this policy. The 
      funds will seek to invest 99.5% or more of their net assets in cash, 
      government securities (e.g., US Treasury and agency securities) and/or 
      repurchase agreements collateralized solely by cash or government 
      securities.

UBS Investor Series – Reduction of Minimum Initial Investment


      To make its funds more accessible to investors, UBS AM is reducing the 
      initial minimum investment requirement from $100,000 to $10,000. These 
      changes are effective February 1, 2016.

UBS Cash Sweep Platform Changes


      To comply with the SEC's amended rules as well as to streamline 
      investment options for fund shareholders, UBS AM expects to makes 
      changes to its current menu of money market funds available via UBS 
      Financial Services' automatic "cash sweep platform." Some funds may no 
      longer be offered on cash sweep platforms, and investors may be 
      transitioned to alternate money market sweep products. Shareholders will 
      receive separate communications with specific fund changes later in 2016.
    

      UBS AM is working to ensure that its products, systems and processes 
      will comply with the new SEC regulations before the relevant compliance 
      deadlines and meet the funds' goals of safety, liquidity and income.

UBS is launching its own 'robo-advisor' to bring wealth management down market

UBS' robo-advice product
  will give people access to investment products based on their
  goals, assets, and risk threshold.

  UBS getting into the "robo-advice" market, launching an online
  wealth manager.

  UBS SmartWealth will provide real-time financial advice, telling
  people where to put their money based on goals, means, and
  attitude to risk.

  Clients can open an account entirely online, with no need for
  paperwork, and are offered access to five investment strategies
  through a range of active and passive funds created and managed
  by UBS.

  The investment strategies are influenced by UBS' "House View" —
  the bank's outlook on the global economy, based on all its
  in-house research.

  The "robo-advisor" also regularly checks the performance of
  investments against goals, suggesting alternative strategies if
  things go off track.





  The launch of SmartWealth is a "strategically important move" for
  the bank, according to Wealth Management COO Dirk Klee, that will
  help it win over new customers. UBS is the world's biggest
  private wealth manager, with $2 trillion of client assets.

  SmartWealth is one of a number of so-called "robo-advisors" that
  are springing up across the globe. These online platforms replace
  traditional wealth advisors with algorithms and automated advice
  and investment management.

  "Robo-advisors" are one of the hottest areas of fintech at
  the moment and leading examples include 
  Wealthfront and Betterment
  in the US and MoneyFarm
  and Scalable
  Capital in Europe.

  By automating much of the process, these platforms bring the cost
  of investment management way down and make it accessible to a new
  market. SmartWealth is no different — investors need just £15,000
  to access the service, compared to the £2 million bar usually set
  for UBS wealth management services.

  Dirk Klee, COO of UBS Wealth Management, says in a statement
  announcing the launch: "UBS SmartWealth is a strategically
  important move for UBS. It enables us to bring our advice and
  expertise to a much wider audience, at first in the UK, but in
  time in other geographies too."

  SmartWealth has been built entirely in-house and UBS says it has
  been working for a year on the platform in London and Zurich.

  Klee says in the statement: "Technology is changing the way
  financial services are delivered. The launch of UBS SmartWealth
  shows that digital innovation is not the sole reserve of
  start-ups. Large market-leading institutions have the resources
  to research, test and build transformative new products and
  services.

  "This launch is an example of how we can blend the best of UBS
  with the best of start-up thinking and agility, meaning clients
  can access new innovations alongside the insight of worldwide
  investment and wealth planning experts."

  UBS is launching SmartWealth to a small number of clients in the
  UK in November, before a full roll-out next year.

  Jamie Broderick, Head of UBS Wealth Management UK, says in an
  emailed statement: "The UK is the perfect market in which to
  launch SmartWealth. The UK has developed a reputation for
  technology-led innovation in financial services. Regulation in
  the UK is progressive and has established support for new
  innovations.

  "And over recent years, a significant advice gap has developed in
  the UK, leaving clear space in the market for a product like
  SmartWealth."

  Clients will be charged 1.7% of assets for an actively managed
  investment strategy and 1% of a passive one, according to Bloomberg. The fees fall as the
  amount invested rises.

Strategy & Benefits

Principal Investment Strategy
The investment strategy of the Direxion Indexed Commodity Strategy Fund includes:

A quantitative, strategic index-based approach to commodity investing
Exposure to 12 commodities that can individually be long or flat (if a short signal is triggered the position is moved to cash)
The ability to make position changes intra-month based on trends
Monthly rebalance based on risk reduction where the allocation of individual components is reduced if volatility exceeds certain predetermined risk levels
A “smart” contract roll approach1

1 Smart Contract Roll Approach – A futures contract roll approach designed to select cost effective futures contracts to roll into upon expiration of current contract.
Why Invest in the Fund?

The long/flat approach provides exposure to commodities that can individually be positioned long or flat (in cash) based upon price trends
Seeks to mitigate the downside risk and maximum declines relative to notable long-only commodity indices
Has the flexibility to make individual commodity position changes intra-month
Risk management controls designed to adjust exposure levels if volatility gets too high
Low- or non-correlation to stocks and bonds
Disciplined, quantitative, rules-based approach to commodity investing




Why Commodities?

Not just commodities – Long/Flat commodities.
Most traditional commodity funds provide long only exposure to commodities. This limits their potential to contribute to a portfolio’s long-term performance because they only benefit if commodity prices rise.
The Direxion Indexed Commodity Strategy Fund seeks to match the performance of the Auspice Broad Commodity ER Index (ABCERI), which provides exposure to 12 commodities that can individually be positioned long or flat (in cash) based upon price trends.
This long/flat index is potentially more adaptive to volatile commodity markets because it seeks to take advantage of individual commodities by going long when prices rise, and mitigate risk by going flat (to cash) when prices fall.
Why consider long/flat commodities?
Most traditional commodity funds can only benefit if commodity prices rise. However, these long-only commodity strategies have shown to be inconsistent over time because:

Commodity returns are typically cyclical and sporadic
Individual commodity sub-sectors tend to perform dissimilarly in different market environments
Significant draw-downs can be damaging to the long-term performance of a portfolio

Within the inherently volatile commodity markets, a long/flat approach is potentially more adaptive to whip-sawing market conditions.

Target Index

The Auspice Broad Commodity ER Index aims to capture upward trends in the commodity markets while minimizing risk during downward trends. The index uses a quantitative methodology to track either long or flat positions in a diversified portfolio of 12 commodity futures covering energy, metals, and agriculture. The index incorporates dynamic risk management and contract rolling methods.

Source: Bloomberg. Data from 10/1/2010 – 6/30/2017. October 1, 2010 is the inception of the Auspice Broad Commodity ER Index. Index returns and correlations are historical and are not representative of any fund performance. Total returns of the index include reinvested dividends. Past performance does not guarantee future results.  One cannot invest directly in an index. The indexes are composite indexes of commodity sector returns representing unmanaged, unleveraged, long-only investment in commodity futures that are broadly diversified across the spectrum of commodities. 

S&P Goldman Sachs Commodity Index (S&P GSCI), a composite index of commodity sector returns representing an unleveraged, long-only investment in commodity futures that is broadly diversified across the spectrum of commodities;
Bloomberg Commodity Total Return Index (BCOM TR), a broadly diversified index that allows investors to track 19 commodity futures through a single, simple measure
Deutsche Banc Liquid Commodity Optimum Yield Index (DBC CI), an index composed of futures contracts on 14 of the most heavily-traded and important physical commodities in the world.

Standard Deviation is a measure of the dispersion of a set of data from its mean.
Correlation is a statistical measure of how two securities move in relation to each other.
Maximum Drawdown is the greatest percent decline from a previous high.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 1.26% for DXCTX, 2.01% for DXSCX, and 1.01% for DXCIX.  The Fund’s Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Services Agreement with each Fund. Under this Operating Service Agreement, Rafferty has contractually agreed to pay all expenses of each Fund through September 1, 2018 other than the following: management fees, Rule 12b-1distribution and/or service fees, any front-end or contingent deferred sales loads, acquired fund fees and expenses, taxes, swap financing and related costs, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses such as litigation or other expenses outside the typical day-to-day operations of the Fund. If these expenses were included, the net expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

  Addressing The Top Misconceptions About Alternative Investments    


Alternative strategies have the potential to be a viable way for investors, whether institutional or retail, to reduce risk in their investment portfolios.


  Alternatives? Too Many, or Not Enough?    


The key to risk-adjusted returns and diversification is not the number of securities – it’s their correlation – or, really, non-correlation – to each other, that’s paramount.


  A Correlation Misconception    


Some clients confuse negative correlation with low (or non-) correlation. They mistakenly believe that returns for investments with low correlation move in opposite directions from each other.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.source> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11x1gf2m6>  .

<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.rate> 4.5 .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage>  .


If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million
Updated: June 9, 2013
Data Format: CSV

2 GB gzip8 GB uncompressed

Download



The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

									Returns quoted are past performance and do not guarantee future results; current performance may be lower or higher. Investment returns and principal value will vary; there may be a gain or loss when shares are sold.
									Shares of ETFs are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Market returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 p.m. Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined for most ETFs), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Ordinary brokerage commissions apply and will reduce returns.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
