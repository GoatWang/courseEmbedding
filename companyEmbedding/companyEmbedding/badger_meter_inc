Badger Meter posts record profit, revenue in 2Q
D-Flow acquisition helps overcome customer order delays
by
							Arthur Thomas July 21, 2017, 12:38 PM
https://www.biztimes.com/2017/industries/manufacturing-logistics/badger-meter-posts-record-profit-revenue-in-2q/




It wasn’t by much, but Brown Deer-based Badger Meter Inc. reported an all-time record for revenue in the second quarter, topping the previous mark set during the same period last year.
Badger Meter Inc.’s headquarters in Brown Deer.
The maker of water meters reported almost $104.2 million in revenue, up $356,000 from the previous year.
“On a tough comparison, we had a very strong quarter,” said Rick Johnson, Badger Meter chief financial officer.
Executives said the acquisition of D-Flow Technology AB, a Swedish company focused on ultrasonic technology, contributed $650,000 to revenue during the quarter. That boost helped overcome a delay in customer orders ahead of the company’s June introduction of LTE cellular technology on its Orion meter endpoints.
“It’s a lot like the cellphones you buy,” said Rich Meeusen, Badger Meter chairman, president and chief executive officer, noting that as the company switched over from offering 3G technology to LTE customers opted to wait for the upgraded product.
Ordinarily, Meeusen said Badger Meter wouldn’t preannounce its launch of a technology upgrade, but competitors had been indicating they would be eventually launching their own LTE product as a way to lure Badger Meter customers away.
“That kind of forced us to tell our customers we had an LTE coming in June,” he said.
Badger Meter also set a company record for net income at $10.6 million, up 12.9 percent from the previous year, and earnings improved from 32 to 36 cents per diluted share.
The company’s gross profit margin improved from 37.9 percent to 39.4 percent, which Meeusen attributed to pricing discipline, manufacturing cost controls and the acquisition of much of the company’s distribution network.
Selling, general and administrative costs were essentially flat at $24.5 million, which the company attributed to staffing reductions in the flow instrumentation business in the second half of last year. That business, which is dependent on oil and gas markets, struggled over the last couple years, but began to pick up domestically during the quarter.
“We were pleased to see the long-awaited recovery of our oil and gas business,” Meeusen said.

Selling, general and administrative costs were essentially flat at $24.5 million, which the company attributed to staffing reductions in the flow instrumentation business in the second half of last year. That business, which is dependent on oil and gas markets, struggled over the last couple years, but began to pick up domestically during the quarter.
“We were pleased to see the long-awaited recovery of our oil and gas business,” Meeusen said.

Badger Meter posts record profit, revenue in 2Q
D-Flow acquisition helps overcome customer order delays

It wasn’t by much, but Brown Deer-based Badger Meter Inc. reported an all-time record for revenue in the second quarter, topping the previous mark set during the same period last year.
Badger Meter Inc.’s headquarters in Brown Deer.
The maker of water meters reported almost $104.2 million in revenue, up $356,000 from the previous year.
“On a tough comparison, we had a very strong quarter,” said Rick Johnson, Badger Meter chief financial officer.
Executives said the acquisition of D-Flow Technology AB, a Swedish company focused on ultrasonic technology, contributed $650,000 to revenue during the quarter. That boost helped overcome a delay in customer orders ahead of the company’s June introduction of LTE cellular technology on its Orion meter endpoints.
“It’s a lot like the cellphones you buy,” said Rich Meeusen, Badger Meter chairman, president and chief executive officer, noting that as the company switched over from offering 3G technology to LTE customers opted to wait for the upgraded product.
Ordinarily, Meeusen said Badger Meter wouldn’t preannounce its launch of a technology upgrade, but competitors had been indicating they would be eventually launching their own LTE product as a way to lure Badger Meter customers away.
“That kind of forced us to tell our customers we had an LTE coming in June,” he said.
Badger Meter also set a company record for net income at $10.6 million, up 12.9 percent from the previous year, and earnings improved from 32 to 36 cents per diluted share.
The company’s gross profit margin improved from 37.9 percent to 39.4 percent, which Meeusen attributed to pricing discipline, manufacturing cost controls and the acquisition of much of the company’s distribution network.
Selling, general and administrative costs were essentially flat at $24.5 million, which the company attributed to staffing reductions in the flow instrumentation business in the second half of last year. That business, which is dependent on oil and gas markets, struggled over the last couple years, but began to pick up domestically during the quarter.
“We were pleased to see the long-awaited recovery of our oil and gas business,” Meeusen said.

Top Company Interviews

          Net sales of $104,176,000 for the second quarter of 2017 were a record for any quarter and increased 0.3% from sales of $103,820,000 for the second quarter of 2016.

          Diluted earnings per share of $0.36 for the second quarter of 2017 were a record for any quarter and increased 12.5% from diluted earnings per share of $0.32 for the second quarter of 2016.
        

First Half 2017 Highlights


          Net sales were $205,782,000 for the first half of 2017, a 0.7% increase from sales of $204,390,000 for the first half of 2016.
        

          Net earnings were $19,363,000 for the first half of 2017, an 11.3% increase from net earnings of $17,390,000 for the first half of 2016.
        

          Diluted earnings per share were $0.67 for the first half of 2017, an 11.7% increase from diluted earnings per share of $0.60 for the first half of 2016.
        

Operations Review
      
      
        'We are pleased that we set new all-time records for net sales, net earnings and diluted earnings per share, especially coming after a record second quarter performance last year,' said Richard A. Meeusen, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Badger Meter.
      
      
        'Our second quarter domestic residential and commercial municipal water product sales were essentially flat year-over-year as some customers delayed orders to take advantage of the latest advancement in our ORION Cellular technology, the ORION Cellular Long-Term Evolution (LTE) endpoint, which we began shipping in June 2017. This first-to-market LTE cellular endpoint not only provides the latest cellular technology to new customers, but also enables the company's existing ORION Cellular customers to continue building out their system with the newer LTE networks,' explained Meeusen.
      
      
        'Our new ORION Cellular LTE endpoint is the latest example of how Badger Meter is always working to be at the forefront of advanced metering technology and analytics that will ensure our customers remain current with the latest advances in cellular communications,' said Meeusen.
      
      
        Meeusen also said domestic sales of flow instrumentation products increased in the second quarter, but were partially offset by fewer international projects. 'We were pleased to see the long-awaited recovery of our oil and gas business during this quarter,' commented Meeusen.
      
      
        The company further strengthened its presence in the ultrasonic flowmeter market with the acquisition of D-Flow Technology AB of Luleå, Sweden in the second quarter. D-Flow Technology specializes in the design and development of ultrasonic technology, primarily for use in flow measurement. The acquisition will allow Badger Meter to further enhance its successful E-SeriesUltrasonic product line, lower production costs and provide a platform for further advancement of its ultrasonic capabilities. D-Flow Technology's facilities in Sweden will become a Badger Meter Technology Center.
      
      
        'The integration of D-Flow Technology's operations is on schedule and we have begun an accelerated project to develop E-Series Ultrasonic meters for commercial applications, which will extend our family of ultrasonic meters into larger sizes. We are already seeing the benefits of this ultrasonic technology expertise,' said Meeusen.
      
      
        Meeusen said the gross profit margin was 39.4% in the second quarter of 2017 compared to 37.9% in the prior year quarter. Pricing discipline, manufacturing cost controls and the company's strategy to acquire or consolidate much of its distribution network helped to offset the headwinds of higher brass costs.
      
      
        Selling, engineering and administration expenses were essentially the same as the second quarter of 2016, primarily due to staffing reductions in the flow instrumentation business that occurred in the second half of 2016 and lower health care expenses.
      
      
        'With two consecutive record-setting quarters behind us, we continue to be optimistic about the remainder of the year,' added Meeusen.

Small changes can make a difference
There’s more to life with diabetes than most people think, and making small changes to your daily routine can help make managing it a little easier.
It's easy to talk yourself out of exercising, eating healthy food, or testing as much as you should. But every positive step you take, no matter how small, is a step forward.

FAQ 



Before using the OneTouch Verio Flex® meter to test your blood glucose, carefully read the Owner’s Booklet and inserts that come with the components of the system.

How do I turn on the OneTouch Verio Flex® meter?

Press and hold ‘OK’ until the start-up test screen appears. Once the device is on, release ‘OK’. You can also turn the meter on by inserting a OneTouch Verio® test strip into the test strip port.
If you see any missing segments within the start-up screen, there may be a problem with the meter. Contact Customer Service at 1-888-567-3003.



How many results will the OneTouch Verio Flex® meter store and where can I find my result after it is displayed on-screen?
Your meter stores your most recent 500 blood glucose and control solution test results and displays them in the order the tests were taken. They can be viewed in History Mode by pressing and holding the ‘OK’ button when the meter is off. You can then scroll through the results by pressing ∧ or ∨.


What batteries do the OneTouch Verio Flex® meter use?
Your OneTouch Verio Flex® meter uses one CR2032 lithium coin cell battery.


ColorSure™ technology - What are the low and high range limits and what do they mean?

Your meter uses low and high range limits to tell you when your result is below, above or within the limits that you set in the meter.* The meter comes with pre-set range limits that can be changed as recommended by your healthcare team. The pre-set low range limit is 70 mg/dL and the pre-set high range limit is 180 mg/dL.
*The low and high range limits you set apply to all glucose test results. This includes tests taken before or after mealtimes, medications and around any other activities that may affect your blood glucose.



ColorSure™ technology - How can I change the low and high range limits?

With the meter on, press and hold ∧ and ∨ at the same time. The SET screen will appear with the current low range limit displayed, and the number and Range Indicator arrow will flash. The low and high range limits can be adjusted but be sure to talk to your healthcare professional about the range limits that are right for you.
If you change your range limits, this will only affect whether future test results are displayed as below, above or within your range limits. Changing your range limits does not affect how past results are displayed.



How can I use Bluetooth® on my meter?

You can connect your meter with a compatible wireless device running the OneTouch Reveal® mobile app. To turn Bluetooth® on, start by turning your meter on using the 'OK' button, then press 'OK' and ∧ at the same time. After you open the OneTouch Reveal® mobile app on your mobile device, follow the on-screen instructions and enter the PIN shown on your meter screen when prompted. For further details, please refer to the Owner's Booklet.



Can I transfer my readings to a computer?

Your meter can work with the OneTouch Reveal® web app which provides simple visuals to help you see your blood sugar readings along with important things like food and insulin. You can track meals, medications and activity in a personalized logbook.
Hardware and software requirements needed to use the OneTouch Reveal® web app can be found at https://onetouchreveal.com/support/en_US/
