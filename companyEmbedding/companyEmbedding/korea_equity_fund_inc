Disclosures
Nomura Asset Management U.S.A. Inc. ("NAM-USA") is the investment manager of  the Korea Equity Fund, Inc. (“KEF”). KEF is a closed-end management investment company registered pursuant to the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. Nomura Asset Management Co., Ltd. ("NAM") acts as investment adviser to KEF. NAM-USA is a wholly owned subsidiary of NAM. Nomura Asset Management Singapore Limited and Nomura Asset Management Hong Kong Limited act as sub-advisers to KEF.
Closed-end fund shares are traded on the secondary market through one of the stock exchanges. Like any other stock, market price will fluctuate with the market. Shares of closed-end funds frequently trade at a discount, which is a market price that is below their net asset value ("NAV"). Upon sale, your shares may have a market price that is above or below NAV.
Past performance is not indicative of future results.  There is a risk of loss. The information contained on this website is not a prospectus. Additionally, the information contained herein is not an offer to buy or sell any security, is not legal or tax advice, and is for informational purposes only.
The Fund may participate in new issuances of securities ("New Issues"), and a portion of the Fund's returns consequently may be attributable to its investment in New Issues. The market value of New Issues may fluctuate considerably due to factors such as the absence of a prior public market, unseasoned trading, and the limited availability for trading and limited information about the issuer. When a composite's asset base is small, New Issues may have a magnified impact on the Fund's performance. As a fund's assets grow, it is probable that the effect of the composite's investment in New Issues on its total returns may not be as significant, which could reduce the Fund's performance. There is no guarantee that the availability or economic attractiveness of New issues will be consistent from year to year.
Foreign Investment Risk: Foreign investments involve special risks including economic, political and currency fluctuation risks, which may be greater in emerging markets. International markets may be less liquid and can be more volatile than U.S. markets or Canadian markets. Small and mid-cap stocks are subject to greater volatility and may be less liquid than stocks of larger, more established companies. Healthcare companies may be significantly affected by government regulations and government approvals of products and services, legislation or regulatory changes. Technology stocks may be more volatile than the overall stock market.
Forward Looking Statements
Certain information discussed herein may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the U.S. federal securities laws. Although Nomura Asset Management believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, it can give no assurance that its expectations will be achieved. Forward-looking information is subject to certain risks, trends and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected.
Nomura Asset Management Co., Ltd. and its investment advisory subsidiaries are referred to collectively as Nomura Asset Management or the NAM Companies. Nomura Asset Management provides asset management services in jurisdictions around the world. The services of a particular NAM Company may not be available to investors in certain jurisdictions.

	As of July 31, 2016, for federal income tax purposes, subject to change, the aggregate cost of securities was $70,043,262 and net unrealized appreciation was $13,940,395, comprised of gross unrealized appreciation of $16,844,380 and gross unrealized depreciation of $2,903,985. The aggregate cost of investments for tax purposes will depend upon Korea Equity Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") investment experience during the entirety of its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. Certain tax related calculations are completed and reviewed annually by the Fund. 





	 


	 


	 


	 





	Fair Value Measurements



	 


	 


	 





	In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), fair value is defined as the price that the Fund would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. GAAP also establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and a three-level hierarchy for fair value measurements based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability. Inputs may be observable or unobservable and refer broadly to the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Observable inputs reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Fund.  Unobservable inputs reflect the Fund's own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. Each investment is assigned a level based upon the observability of the inputs which are significant to the overall valuation. 





	 


	 


	 


	 





	The three-tier hierarchy of inputs is summarized below.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
