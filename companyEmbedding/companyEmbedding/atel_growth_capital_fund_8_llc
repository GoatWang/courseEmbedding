ATEL Capital Growth Income Fund 8 – Investment Loss Investigation




(Last Updated On: May 11, 2016)Have you suffered investment losses in ATEL Capital Growth Income Fund 8, LLC? If so, the securities attorneys of The White Law Group may be able to help you recover your losses by filing a FINRA Dispute Resolution claim against the brokerage firm that sold you the investment.
According to the prospectus, ATEL Capital Growth Income Fund 8 “will provide acquisition financing of equipment and other capital assets for emerging growth companies financed by venture capital and established privately held companies without publicly traded securities.” ATEL intends to use 87% of the capital it raised from the sale of “units” to purchase its portfolio.
Compared to traditional investments, such as stocks, bonds or mutual funds, the purchase of ‘units” in a private fund, like ATEL, are considerably more complex and involve a high degree of risk. Unfortunately many investors were not made adequately aware of the risks and liquidity problems associated with the investment.
The risk factors listed on ATEL ATEL Capital Growth Income Fund 8 prospectus include:

The Fund does not guarantee its distributions or the return of investors’ capital
Most of the Fund’s distributions will be, and most of the prior ATEL programs’ distributions have been, a return of capital and not a return on capital
No market exists for the Units or is expected to develop, the Fund’s Operating Agreement includes significant restrictions on the transferability of Units, and an investor may be unable to sell his Units or able to sell the Units only at a significant discount
The Fund will pay the Manager and its related companies substantial fees
The Manager will be subject to certain conflicts of interest

In addition, some brokers may have downplayed the risks associated with the purchase of the units and misled investors into thinking that they were “safe” investments. The 9% sales commission brokers earned for selling ATEL may have provided some brokers with enough incentive to push the product to unsuspecting investors.
Broker dealers are required to perform adequate due diligence on any investment they recommend and to ensure that all recommendations are suitable for the investor. Recommendations should be inline with the investor’s age, risk tolerance, net worth, and investment experience.
Broker dealers that fail to adequately disclose risks or make unsuitable investment recommendations can be held liable for investment losses.
If you have invested in ATEL Capital Growth Income Fund 8 and would like to speak to a securities attorney about the potential to recover your investment losses, please call The White Law Group at 1-888-637-5510 for a free consultation.
The White Law Group, LLC is a national securities fraud, securities arbitration, investor protection, and securities regulation/compliance law firm with offices in Chicago, Illinois and Vero Beach, Florida.

ATEL Capital Growth Income Fund 8 – Investment Loss Investigation




(Last Updated On: May 13, 2016)Have you suffered investment losses in ATEL Capital Growth Income Fund 8, LLC? If so, the securities attorneys of The White Law Group may be able to help you recover your losses by filing a FINRA Dispute Resolution claim against the brokerage firm that sold you the investment.

According to the prospectus, ATEL Capital Growth Income Fund 8 “will provide acquisition financing of equipment and other capital assets for emerging growth companies financed by venture capital and established privately held companies without publicly traded securities.” ATEL intends to use 87% of the capital it raised from the sale of “units” to purchase its portfolio.
Compared to traditional investments, such as stocks, bonds or mutual funds, the purchase of ‘units” in a private fund, like ATEL, are considerably more complex and involve a high degree of risk. Unfortunately many investors were not made adequately aware of the risks and liquidity problems associated with the investment.
The risk factors listed on ATEL ATEL Capital Growth Income Fund 8 prospectus include:

The Fund does not guarantee its distributions or the return of investors’ capital
Most of the Fund’s distributions will be, and most of the prior ATEL programs’ distributions have been, a return of capital and not a return on capital
No market exists for the Units or is expected to develop, the Fund’s Operating Agreement includes significant restrictions on the transferability of Units, and an investor may be unable to sell his Units or able to sell the Units only at a significant discount
The Fund will pay the Manager and its related companies substantial fees
The Manager will be subject to certain conflicts of interest

In addition, some brokers may have downplayed the risks associated with the purchase of the units and misled investors into thinking that they were “safe” investments. The 9% sales commission brokers earned for selling ATEL may have provided some brokers with enough incentive to push the product to unsuspecting investors.
Broker dealers are required to perform adequate due diligence on any investment they recommend and to ensure that all recommendations are suitable for the investor. Recommendations should be inline with the investor’s age, risk tolerance, net worth, and investment experience.
Broker dealers that fail to adequately disclose risks or make unsuitable investment recommendations can be held liable for investment losses.
If you have invested in ATEL Capital Growth Income Fund 8 and would like to speak to a securities attorney about the potential to recover your investment losses, please call The White Law Group at 1-888-637-5510 for a free consultation.
The White Law Group, LLC is a national securities fraud, securities arbitration, investor protection, and securities regulation/compliance law firm with offices in Chicago, Illinois and Vero Beach, Florida.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC

DISCLOSURE OF INTEREST
Affiliates of Bank of America may make a market or deal as principal in the securities mentioned in these Sites or in options based thereon.

HYPOTHETICAL OR PAST PERFORMANCE
Hypothetical or simulated performance results have inherent limitations. Unlike an actual performance record, simulated results do not represent actual trading. Also, since the trades have not actually been executed, the results may have under or over-compensated for the impact, if any, of certain market factors, such as lack of liquidity. Simulated trading programs in general are designed with the benefit of hindsight. Past performance is not indicative of future results; no representation is being made that any account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those shown.
