 



AgriEuro -Sustainable Resources


























"A place where the wild meets agriculture"

















				AgriEuro Corp treats its land with the utmost respect. Without nature's balance we wouldn't be able to benefit this much from our resources.
			
















AgriEuro Corp is proud to operate one of the few commercial Unesco World Heritage sites on the planet. Every precaution is taken to maintain this fragile wildlife habitat.


							Our mission at AgriEuro Corp is to develop and nurture a holistic, sustainable approach to everything we do. This allows us to produce the highest quality products possible.
						


						The property we own consists of 4,223 acres on the meeting point of the Danube Delta and the Black Sea, an area that is highly fertile and that will host a wide array of developments in the near future.


					

						We have a 25 kilometer dam that gives us access to huge bodies of water and yearly reed harvests that are of the best quality.
					

						Eastern Europe has a skilled work-force that allows us to get things done well, fast and cost-effectively. In fact we benefit from some of the most competitive wages in all of Europe: Romania has the second lowest wages in the EU.

AgriEuro -Sustainable Resources


























"A place where the wild meets agriculture"
























Aquaculture
Aquaculture, also known as aquafarming, is the farming of aquatic organisms such as fish, crustaceans, mollusks and aquatic plants. Aquaculture involves cultivating freshwater and saltwater populations under controlled conditions, and can be contrasted with commercial fishing, which is the harvesting of wild fish. Consumption from aquaculture farming has overtaken consumption of wild-caught fish and this trend is set to continue for decades to come according to government statistics. In fact, is is predicted that the majority of fish consumption in 20 years will be from farmed fish.







How we Raise our Fish

				AgriEuro Corp plans to build several fish farms across the ponds that we are currently constructing. Our crystal clear blue waters and consistently fresh water currents emanating from the Danube river provide our fish with a natural stress-free environment in which to mature until they reach the commercial size. With vertical integration of our production, we control and secure all the stages of production giving us  full autonomy on the end-result.
				

				The fish will be grown with the highest world standards and will satisfy demand from even the most peculiar buyers.
				

				Here are some of the aspects that will make our fisheries stand out:
				

We will not use genetically modified raw materials
We will constantly control the breeding process
Extra care for the juvenile, fish feed, end products
Continuous monitoring of the environment in which the fish live.
A complete traceability system













Fish and Mediterranean Diet

					The Mediterranean Diet reflects, as the name implies, the typical dietary habits of the people of the Mediterranean countries. In the pyramid of the Mediterranean diet the groups of food are “ranked” from the base to its top according to how often they should be included in our diet.
				

					It is recommended, according to the pyramid, that we consume fish 2 or 3 times a week, because they contain vitamin B complex and iron.
				

					Scientific research has confirmed that fish is a unique source of the ω3 polyunsaturated fatty acids.
				

					According to the health claim which was approved under the EU Regulation 1924/2006, the consumption of farmed Sea Bream and Sea Bass, as a rich source of ω3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (EPA & DHA) and as part of a healthy lifestyle, helps maintaining normal heart function, maintaining normal blood pressure and normal levels of triglycerides in the blood.
				












Product Quality

					AgriEuro Corp offers products of high quality, a fact that is proven by the procedures we follow.


				


AgriEuro Corp guarantees the freshness of the product because it is grown in some of the purest waters in the world with plenty of natural currents which keep the water in which our fish swim, as good as new.


AgriEuro Corp guarantees that our fish will offer a healthy diet, because as they say, you are what you eat and we only feed our fish the best food possible. You will find a strong concentration of high quality omega 3 fatty acids in our fish.


Finally, we guarantee that we will be able to supply fish year-round as we breed different kinds of fish

Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/25/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.  Royalty trusts may have special tax treatment, so you should consult a tax advisor on the potential tax consequences of investing in them.News, commentary and events are from third-party sources unaffiliated with Fidelity. Fidelity does not endorse or adopt their content.
