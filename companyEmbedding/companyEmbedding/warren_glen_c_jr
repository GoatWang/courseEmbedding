Contracts, Arrangements,   Understandings or Relationships with Respect to Securities of the Issuer     The   information provided or incorporated by reference in Item 3 and Item 4 is   hereby incorporated by reference herein.   Registration Rights Agreement   In   connection with the closing of the Offering, on May 9, 2017, the Issuer   entered into a registration rights agreement (the Registration Rights Agreement) with   certain members of Antero Resources Investment LLC (individually, each a Sponsor, collectively, the Sponsors) and certain of the Issuers   affiliates. Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, the Issuer has   agreed to register the sale of shares of its Common Shares under certain   circumstances.   At any   time after the six month anniversary of the completion of the Offering, each   Sponsor that, together with its affiliates, owns at least 3% of the Common   Shares has the right to require the Issuer by written notice to register the   sale of a number of their shares of Registrable Securities (as defined in the   Registration Rights Agreement) in an underwritten offering. The Issuer is   required to provide notice of the request within 10 days following the   receipt of any such demand request to all additional holders of Registrable   Securities, if any, who may, in certain circumstances, participate in the   registration. The Issuer is not obligated to effect any demand registration   in which the anticipated aggregate offering price included in such offering   is less than $50,000,000.  Any such demand registration may be for a   shelf registration statement.   If, at   any time, the Issuer proposes to register an offering of its securities   (subject to certain exceptions) for its own account, then it must allow each   holder of Registrable Securities to include a specified number of Registrable   Securities in that registration statement.   The   Issuer may be required to undertake a future public or private offering and   use the proceeds (net of underwriting or placement agency discounts, fees and   commissions, as applicable) to redeem an equal number of Common Shares from   holders of Registrable Securities.   These   registration rights are subject to certain conditions and limitations,   including the right of the underwriters to limit the number of Registrable   Securities to be included in a registration and the Issuers right to delay   or withdraw a registration statement under certain circumstances. The Issuer   will generally pay all registration    3       expenses   in connection with its obligations under the Registration Rights Agreement,   regardless of whether a registration statement is filed or becomes effective.   The   obligations to register Registrable Securities under the Registration Rights   Agreement will terminate when no Registrable Securities remain outstanding.   Registrable Securities will cease to be covered by the Registration Rights   Agreement when they have (i) been sold pursuant to an effective   registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act),   (ii) been sold in a transaction exempt from registration under the   Securities Act (including transactions pursuant to Rule 144 of the   Securities Act, (iii) ceased to be outstanding, (iv) been sold   in a private transaction in which the Issuers rights under the Registration   Rights Agreement are not assigned to the transferee or (v)  become   eligible for resale pursuant to Rule 144(b) of the Securities Act   (or any similar rule then in effect under the Securities Act).   Limited   Liability Company Agreement of the General Partner   On May 9, 2017, in connection with the closing of the Offering,   the Sponsors entered into the Limited Liability Company Agreement of the   General Partner (the LLC Agreement). The   LLC Agreement provides for the designation of members of the board of   directors of the General Partner by the Sponsors, including the Reporting   Person.   Pursuant to the terms of the LLC Agreement, during the ten-year   period commencing with the closing of the Offering, if the Reporting Person   serves as an executive officer or in an active role in the management of any   company (other than the Issuer, Antero Resources, Antero Midstream or their   respective subsidiaries and joint ventures) that is primarily engaged in an   operating oil and gas exploration, production, gathering, compression or   water handling and treatment business, then the Reporting Person (or his   designee) will be removed as a member of the board of directors of the   General Partner and such individual will no longer be entitled to designate a   member of the board of directors of the General Partner.   Lockup Agreements   The   Reporting Person has agreed that, for a period of 180 days from May 3,   2017, he will not, without the prior written consent of Morgan   Stanley & Co. LLC and subject to certain exceptions, dispose of any   Common Shares or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for the   Common Shares.   References   to, and descriptions of, the Registration Rights Agreement as set forth in   this Schedule 13D are qualified in their entirety by reference to the   Registration Rights Agreement, dated as of May 9, 2017, by and among the   Issuer Warburg Pincus Private Equity X O&G, L.P., Warburg Pincus X Partners,   L.P., Warburg Pincus Private Equity VIII, LP, Warburg Pincus Netherlands   Private Equity VIII C.V.I, WP-WPVIII Investors, L.P., Yorktown Energy   Partners V, L.P., Yorktown Energy Partners VI, L.P., Yorktown Energy Partners   VII, L.P., Yorktown Energy Partners VIII, L.P., Paul M.
