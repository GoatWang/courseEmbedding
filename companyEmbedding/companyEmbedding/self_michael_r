Wood and Zurcher suggest that the social self--its experience and organization--reflects the great transformation of society from industrial to postindustrial. . . . Wood and Zurcher have contributed to our social psychological understanding of self-development in several ways. They pack information about theories of modern self-hood into a well-researched and accessible book. Readers will find a resource on theories of the postmodern self here. The authors also introduce a creative use of computerized content analysis, which they successfully demonstrate by transforming personal documents into social scientific data.                                   Contemporary SociologyAccording to various observers, the postmodern self represents changes in contemporary culture--from rationality and unemotional performance to irrationality and mysticism; from institutional standards and duty-to-society to individual standards and duty-to-self; from structure and stability to transience and experimentation. Through an analysis of diaries from nineteenth- and twentieth-century Americans, this study deals with the nature of the postmodern self. It provides a framework for understanding the ideas that collectively comprise postmodern self theory and presents empirical data concerning its historical validity. The book reflects the use of a computer approach in which the statistical incidence of particular words is examined over time.

Acupressure for Emotional Healing
A Self-Care Guide for Trauma,
                                    Stress & Common Emotional Imbalances




                                 
                            








                                    Long known for its ability to alleviate physical pain, the ancient healing art of
                                    acupressure also relieves stress and emotional pain. From day-to-day pressures to
                                    life's most significant trials, traumatic events cause the body to shut down and
                                    keep negative feelings "stuck," resulting in physical ailments and emotional
                                    imbalances. Acupressure, which uses the fingers to stimulate the same points targeted
                                    in acupuncture, releases this muscular tension and restores the flow of vital energy,
                                    making resolution possible.






Touching Emotions DVD





Learn how to use acupressure therapy
                                        for others to facilitate and deal with highly charged emotional release. Michael
                                        Reed Gach demonstrates how to hold ten points in dealing with head pain, inner conflicts,
                                        emotional distress, and tears of grief and anguish.

                                        Psychotherapy is suggested to complement this healing process. Only trained, experienced
                                        and emotionally stable practitioners should use these methods in a safe and

trusting enviroment.

Rich Roll Podcast | Dr. Michael Gervais On The Psychology of Self-Mastery - Product Hunt































Product HuntThe best new products, every dayAsk●|Log InSign up Featured 9 months agoRich Roll Podcast | Dr. Michael Gervais On The Psychology of Self-MasteryWe learn who we are when we're the most uncomfortable.Productivityget it12 ShareFeatured commentrichroll@richroll · athlete / author / podcasterThe distance between the Olympic gold medalist standing proudly atop the podium and the athlete watching the games on television often boils down to one variable - the mind.
This week I sit down for a second conversation with the great Michael Gervais - the go to high performance psychologist everyone is talking about.
Working in the trenches of high-stakes environments with some of the world's most prolific Olympic and professional athletes, Michel's results are beyond impressive.
But this conversation isn’t just about high performance athletes. Whether you are an athlete or a weekend warrior, an executive or a stay-at-home parent, this is a conversation about transcending our self-imposed limitations to unlock dormant potential to unleash your unique, most authentic life.
Because we learn who we really are when we are the most uncomfortable.
Michael is truly one of my favorite people and this is a standout conversation. I hope you enjoy listening to it as much as I enjoyed having it.
