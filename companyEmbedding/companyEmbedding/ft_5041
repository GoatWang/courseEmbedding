        Worse product ever
We bought three of these hoses and two out of the three leaked so bad we couldn't use them. Contacted the company and have to pay to send hoses back and we are back to carrying buckets because of poor quality control. We will not buy from this company again or these hoses again.

        Can't Uncoil
This hose may as well be made of actual PVC piping because you certainly cannot easily unroll this hose or roll it back up for storage. We returned it ASAP.

Digging behaviors of radio-tagged black-footed ferrets near Meeteetse, Wyoming, 1981-1984Product Type: Journal ArticleYear: 2012Author(s): Biggins, D.E., L.R. Hanebury, and K.A. FagerstoneSuggested Citation: Biggins, D.E., L.R. Hanebury, and K.A. Fagerstone. 2012. Digging behaviors of radio-tagged black-footed ferrets near Meeteetse, Wyoming, 1981-1984. Western North American Naturalist . 72(2): 148-157. Intensive radio-tracking during August–December enabled us to collect detailed information on digging behaviors of a small sample of black-footed ferrets (Mustela nigripes) occupying colonies of white-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys leucurus). A sample of 33 prairie dogs, also radio-tagged, progressively ceased aboveground activity during late summer and fall, presumably as they descended into burrows to hibernate. Most of the time ferrets spent digging was in November–December when >95% of the radio-tagged prairie dogs were inactive, suggesting that digging was primarily to excavate hibernating prey. Although 43.9% of the burrow openings were estimated to be in large mounds, which are common on colonies of white-tailed prairie dogs, all of a sample of 17 deposits of soil (diggings) made by ferrets were excavated at small mounds or nonmounded openings. The average duration of 23 nocturnal sessions of digging by ferrets was 112.2 minutes. A digging session consisted of multiple bouts of soil movement typically lasting about 5 min, and sessions were separated by pauses above- or belowground lasting several minutes. Bouts of moving soil from a burrow involved round-trips of 12.5–30.3 s to remove an average of 35 cm3 of soil per trip. These digging bouts are energetically costly for ferrets. One female moved 16.8 kg of soil an estimated 3.3 m during bouts having a cumulative duration of 178 minutes, removing a soil plug estimated to be 178 cm long. Increasing evidence suggests that some behaviors of ferrets and prairie dogs are coevolutionary responses between this highly specialized predator and its prairie dog prey.

                        I have used K&N filters for years in Toyota, Lexus and now Honda Pilot and CRV vehicles. They are an excellent product, easy to clean and function very well. My recent order for a 2017 Honda Pilot air filter was done on-line because none of the local auto supply centers, nor Wal-mart carried a model that fit my Pilot. The online order system was easy and fast.

                        It's nice knowing that I've bought the last air filter for my 2016 Honda Pilot. I bought my first K&N air filter in 1982, so I know the quality of product that it is. It's simply the best filter money can buy. If I buy another car, I'll buy another K&N air filter.

                        This air filter is an easy exchange for the stock filter. I do not know if it has increases the power in the truck but it does give it a sportier sound when you step on it. It is not as loud as an intake system on a sports car but it does have a growl to it. MPG...hard to say at this point since I have been on the gas harder than normal to just hear the in the intake noise. Overall, I am very pleased with the purchase like on my other vehicles.
