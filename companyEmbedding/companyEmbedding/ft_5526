                    Very importantly, Laredo is a friendly city.  With TAIMU and Laredo Community College we can preview many cultural events that are free to the public. With a little money the world is ours, Philharmonic Orchestra and the Laredo Energy Arena bring the musical world to town.  Traveling 150 miles north we can see more sophisticated entertainment like Broadway shows and 150 miles west we have a beautiful beach and great fishing. The Casa Blanca Lake is a great asset to the area and last but not least is the enormous retail bargains in downtown Laredo.

                    This property is a very spacious home located in one of the most prestigious neighborhoods in Laredo. One of the things that stood out to me was the master bedroom, which has a beautiful restroom, and a nice walk in closet. There is a dog room which the previous owners made for their pets in the back of the house. Additionally, the house has many closets throughout.
