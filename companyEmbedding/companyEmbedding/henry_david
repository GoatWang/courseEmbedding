High Quality Gift Baskets
If you want the highest quality gift baskets, luxury food gifts, and gourmet food delivered, you’ve come to the right place. Quality gourmet gift baskets are brimming with the finest quality sweet and savory delights available, with premium fresh fruit from our orchards, famous chocolate truffles, and the best quality gourmet foods from around the country. Adding little touches like expertly paired wine or a personalized note makes quality gift baskets like ours that much better. 
We grow, make, or bake many of our specialty gifts right here in our home in Southern Oregon to ensure the highest quality gift baskets. It all started in 1934 with an orchard, two brothers, and a dream from our founders, Harry and David Holmes.
Types of Gift Baskets 
There are gift baskets for all occasions! Some types of gift baskets include wine or fruits perfectly paired with gourmet cheeses and charcuterie. Other types of gift baskets have savory delights like soups and appetizer spreads, or gourmet chocolate gifts with exceptional chocolate truffles. Our gourmet gift basket types include: 
 Gift Baskets with Wine
 Fruit Baskets
 Holiday Gift Baskets
 Special Occasion Gift Baskets
Sympathy Gift Baskets

Sending a Gift Basket 
Sending a gift basket starts with choosing the type of gift basket that matches the occasion. From get well gifts and sympathy gifts to happy birthday and congratulations, sending an expertly crafted gourmet gift basket full of delights and comforts is the best way to show you care. Add a touch of elegance to the gift basket you send with a perfectly paired bottle of our premium wine, or add your own sentiments with a personalized note. 
Sending a personalized gourmet gift basket of your choice has never been this easy. You can choose from standard or expedited shipping, and we can even hold your order for a specific delivery date of your choice. Many gift baskets can be customized with wine, chocolates, and other delightful options.

Gourmet Pears & Fruits
Harry & David has been spreading smiles for 80 years 
with our famous sweet Royal
Riviera® Pear fruit gifts. Our orchard-fresh fruit gifts also include juicy
Oregold® Peaches, apples, oranges, ruby red Cherry-Oh!® Cherries, and more.
While we grow most of our fruit in our own orchards, we also work with a few
carefully chosen farms that maintain the same high standards for their orchards
as we do for ours. 
Not all of our fruit goes into fresh fruit deliveries
and gift baskets, however. Some ends up in our candy kitchen for a dip in
gourmet chocolate and caramel and a bit of hand decorating. These indulgent
fruit gift ideas are always ideal for a special treat. One of the great things
about sending a fresh fruit delivery is that you know your gift will be useful.
A gift of fruit is always appreciated. 
Our Clubs are a great way to buy fruit online and taste all of our different
fresh fruit gifts. The Fruit-of-the-Month
Club® Collections provide a fresh fruit delivery to you each month. Picture
a handpicked fresh fruit gift box delivered in perfect condition directly to
your door. Sign up a friend for fresh fruit gifts, and you’ll brighten their
day with every bite. Remember, when you send fruit, you are wishing friends
well; in fact, you are wishing them wellness.

Publisher's Description▼▲
On July 4, 1845, Henry David Thoreau began a two-year experiment living in a solitary, self-built hut on the edge of Walden Pond outside of Concord, Massachusetts. In Walden, Thoreau wrote, “I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.” Walden is a detailed account of how and why Thoreau lived in relative seclusion, and his conclusions about living deliberately, and human nature.HarperTorch brings great works of non-fiction and the dramatic arts to life in digital format, upholding the highest standards in ebook production and celebrating reading in all its forms. Look for more titles in the HarperTorch collection to build your digital library.


Author Bio▼▲
Henry David Thoreau was born in 1817 in Concord, Massachusetts. He spent time as a school teacher after attending Harvard College but was dismissed for his refusal to administer corporal punishment. In 1845, wanting to write his first book, he moved to Walden Pond and built his cabin on land owned by Ralph Waldo Emerson. It was during his time at Walden that Thoreau was imprisoned briefly for not paying taxes; this experience became the basis for his well-known essay "Civil Disobedience." He died of tuberculosis in 1862 at the age of 44.

By: Henry David Thoreau / Edited by: Steven Schnur / Illustrated by: Peter Fiore
 
"A slight sound at evening lifts me up by the ears, and makes life seem inexpressibly grand."
 
Henry David Thoreau's masterpiece, Walden, has touched generations with its quiet recollections. Now, younger readers are introduced to one of America's greatest writers through excerpts from Walden. Fusing the beauty, power, and subtlety of nature into eloquent prose, Henry David's House presents Thoreau's thoughts in a striking picture book to be appreciated by all readers.
Peter Fiore's exquisite oil and watercolor paintings blend the dreaminess of a solitary life and the force of nature. Rich, true colors transport readers to the tiny house in the woods on the shores of Walden Pond.
"Henry David's House is sure to make Thoreauvians out of a whole new generation of readers."      —Tom Harris, Executive Director of the Thoreau Society "Not only is Henry David's House a beautiful book, it succeeds admirably in presenting Thoreau's own words to young readers."      —Kathi Anderson, Executive Director of the Walden Woods Project

Editorial Reviews:

Booklist
"Near the end of March I borrowed an ax and went down tot he woods near Walden Pond. . . ." In brief, easy-reading passages chosen by Schnur, Thoreau describes the construction of his famous cottage, lists the possessions he filled it with, and tallies sights an d sounds of the changing seasons, concluding, "We can never have enough of nature." Fiore's dappled, impressionistic woodland scenes make the sentiment easy to comprehend, though because his view is more often turned away from the actual house than toward it, children will see less of the building than its setting. Libraries needing a follow-up to offer picture-book audiences intrigued by Johnson's Henry Hikes to Fitchburg or Henry Builds a Cabin will be well served by this pleasing, sun-dappled picture book for older children. Schnur's afterword provides context.


Kirkus Reviews
These excerpts from Thoreau's own journal piece together the events that formed the basis for Walden. Borrowing an axe from a friend, young Thoreau enters the woods and begins to cut down trees to build his house. Working alongside the sounds, sights, and smells of nature, he begins to form his philosophy for which he is famous: living life simply. As the seasons pass, Thoreau erects his house and begins to live in the woods full-time. He often sits quietly observing the birds as they flit from tree to tree with only the sounds of humanity to remind him of the passage of time. Whether it is picking ripe raspberries; sitting in a boat on the nearby pond; or entertaining other travelers in the woods, Thoreau is reminded, "W can never have enough of nature." Richly layered watercolor and oil painting depict the natural world in which Thoreau lived. From large landscape painting, to that of a single flower or chestnut, readers will enjoy the work's visual appeal as they read through the original text. Written for younger children, this might also assist older children or even adults as an introduction to one of the great philosophers in American history. An editor's note following the text gives more information about Thoreau's life and work.


Publishers Weekly
Schnur (The Shadow Children) deftly plucks Thoreau's own words from Walden, and Fiore's (The Boston Tea Party) luminous watercolor and oil paintings affectingly evoke the simplicity and serenity of this man's existence on his beloved pond. As Thoreau chronicles a key chapter in his life—he repeatedly marvels at the sights and sounds of the natural world, constantly changing with each season. Schnur's chosen passages reveal Thoreau as a participant in rather than merely an observer of nature: "Sometimes a rambler in the wood was attracted by the sound of my axe, and we chatted pleasantly over the chips which I had made." Spare yet eloquent, Thoreau's words offer intriguing insight into his lifestyle as well as his philosophy. Describing the minimal contents of his house, he notes, "My furniture, part of which I made myself, consisted of a bed, a table, a desk, three chairs (one for solitude, two for friendship, three for society)." Fiore's striking panoramas underscore the beauty and the appeal of the locale that became Thoreau's home and inspiration, while the interiors and spot art emphasize the simplicity of his lifestyle.

ForeWord
One hundred fifty-seven years ago, the author began his celebrated experiment in Concord, Massachusetts. "I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived." The editor has selected passages in which Thoreau chronicles his labor of love: he borrowed an axe in March of 1845, and built his own cabin in the woods along Walden Pond. Each double-page spread moves the reader ahead one month. Thoreau meticulously charts the progress of construction and lovingly details the glories of nature. The illustrator's full-page light-filled watercolor and oil paintings capture Thoreau's simple yet eloquent text. Int he lower right corner of each text page, Fiore marks the passage of the seasons with lush thumbnail images of nature (ducks upon an ice-laden pond, butterfly, water lily, apples, pumpkin, snow-covered berries). Readers may recognize Fiore's impressionistic style from his illustrations for The Boston Tea Party (Holiday House), and Dear Willie Rudd (Simon and Schuster). Editor Schnur has also written picture books emphasizing nature, like Autumn: An Alphabet Acrostic (Clarion) and Spring Thaw (Viking), as well as provocative middle-year novels emphasizing human nature and moral conflicts like The Koufax Dilemma (William Morrow) and The Shadow Children (William Morrow). Schnur thinks that younger children (ages five through eight) will be able to identify with the philosophy of Transcendentalist Thoreau. In the Editor's Note, he writes, "Thoreau forever changed the way we think about nature and our place in it." This beautiful book can easily prompt a discussion with children about the "trappings" of modern life. What would daily life be like without computers, cell phones, and televisions? What would it be like to build a cabin by yourself with only an axe and nails? What would it be like to live in the woods? What can humans learn from nature? The answers elicited will surprise adults and open rich avenues for exploration.


The Concord Bookshop
Hard on the heels of author and illustrator D.B. Johnson's wonderful Henry Builds a Cabin, which features the ursine alter ego of Concord's own Henry David Thoreau, comes Henry David's House,/i>, a picture book with abridged text from Thoreau's writings and information about his life and Walden Pond today. The exquisite water color illustrations by Peter Fiore make this one to add to your library. 


Riverbank Review
Henry David's House portrays another side of Thoreau: his deep, almost reverent love of the natural world. In this large, lush book Thoreau speaks for himself right from the start: "Near the end of March I borrowed an axe and went down to the woods by Walden Pond and began to cut down some tall white pines for timber." On the opposite page, we see a young man in a waist coat and longish hair, resolutely swinging an axe.  Each spread includes a brief, poetic paragraph or two from Walden, selected by Schnur. Thoreau lyrically describes not just the building process ("I dug my cellar down... to a fine sand where potatoes would not freeze in any winter") but also the small, telling details of his life in the woods ("I heard a stray goose... cackling... like the spirit of the fog"). Peter Fiore's impressionistic watercolor-and-oil illustrations effectively evoke the New England landscape while giving us a sense of Thoreau the man—drowsing in the summer sun, driving a team of horses, watching winter's first snowflakes. Especially eye-catching is a bird's-eye view of Thoreau boating in the autumn pond, surrounded by water lilies.  Still, in this book, it is the words that sing. Schnur has chosen carefully from Walden, leaving out the pedantic discourse and giving us instead Thoreau's keen, poetic descriptions of nature. When he speaks of "the moon traveling over the ribbed bottom" of the pond, the "whooping of the ice," or the red squirrel "coursing over the roof," we are there with him in this beloved solitude. The cabin itself is not the important thing, we realize by the end of the book. Thoreau is out here because, as he says in the final quote, "we can never have enough of Nature."

Henry David Thoreau
Forever 49¢ | 3 Stamp Formats
With this stamp, the U.S. Postal Service® celebrates writer, philosopher, and naturalist Henry David Thoreau (1817–1862) on the bicentennial of his birth. Renowned for his book Walden, a complex and eloquent exploration of nature and society, Thoreau encouraged readers to reconsider both their own lives and the world around them. With his personal example of simple living, his criticism of materialism, and the timeless questions he raises about the place of the individual in society and humanity's role in the natural world, Thoreau continues to inspire new generations to assert their independence, reinterpret his legacy, and ask challenging questions of their own.On the left side of the stamp is a close view of Thoreau’s face, an oil-on-panel painting based on a famous 1856 daguerreotype by Benjamin Maxham. On the right side of the stamp, roughly level with Thoreau’s eyes, is his own signature of his last name. Below the signature is a branch of sumac leaves. Sumac grew next to the door of Thoreau’s cabin at Walden Pond, and Thoreau mentions in his writings that he saw sumac sprouting among clear-cut stumps in the area.From July 1845 to September 1847, Thoreau lived outside his hometown of Concord, Massachusetts, in a one-room house on a lake, where he made time to write while farming, reading, thinking, taking long walks, and observing the doings of nature around him. The book Thoreau wrote about his experiences there would become one of the most widely read, translated, and debated books in the American literary canon. In Walden, published in 1854, Thoreau ponders the problems that result from materialism and preaches simplicity as a viable alternative, exhorting people from all walks of life—including himself—to reexamine their misplaced priorities and discover the things that are most important.Thoreau wrote prolifically about history, nature, and society, and every generation finds its own touchstones in his work. His writings about politics and civil disobedience influenced Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King, Jr., he has come to be seen as a founding figure in the environmental movement, and scientists have praised his observations about nature for anticipating ecology and other sciences.The artist for this stamp was Sam Weber. Art director Greg Breeding designed the stamp.The Henry David Thoreau stamp is being issued as a Forever® stamp.

Publisher's Description▼▲
 An updated edition of Thoreau's most widely read works.   Self-described as "a mystic, a transcendentalist, and a natural philosopher to boot," Henry David Thoreau dedicated his life to preserving his freedom as a man and as an artist. Nature was the fountainhead of his inspiration and his refuge from what he considered the follies of society. Heedless of his friends' advice to live in a more orthodox manner, he determinedly pursued his own inner bent-that of a poet-philosopher-in prose and verse. Edited by noted Thoreau scholar Jeffrey S. Cramer, this edition promises to be the new standard for those interested in discovering the great thinker's influential ideas about everything from environmentalism to limited government. 


Author Bio▼▲
Henry David Thoreau was born in Concord, Massachusetts in 1817. He graduated from Harvard in 1837, the same year he began his lifelong Journal. Inspired by Ralph Waldo Emerson, Thoreau became a key member of the Transcendentalist movement that included Margaret Fuller and Bronson Alcott. The Transcendentalists' faith in nature was tested by Thoreau between 1845 and 1847 when he lived for twenty-six months in a homemade hut at Walden Pond. While living at Walden, Thoreau worked on the two books published during his lifetime: Walden (1854) and A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers (1849). Several of his other works, including The Maine Woods, Cape Cod, and Excursions, were published posthumously. Thoreau died in Concord, at the age of forty-four, in 1862.
