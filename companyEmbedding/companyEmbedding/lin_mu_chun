Chung-ho Lin, Ph.D.

Assistant Research ProfessorForestry

Phone: 573-882-6283
E-mail: LinChu@missouri.edu
Address: 203 Anheuser-Busch Natural Resources Building

Education

Ph.D. 2002, University of Missouri

Research Summary

Lin's primary research involves the use of plants and genetic modified microbes for applications in the area of phytoremediation and bioremediation in agroforestry researches.  Several modern chromatographic and DNA-based techniques have developed to evaluate the bioremediation capacity of a wide range of forages and woody species for reducing transport and enhancing sequestration and degradation of agrochemicals, veterinary pharmaceuticals, munitions explosives, and their degradation products in the vegetative buffer systems.
Other active research projects include 1) screening phytochemicals from Eastern redcedar (Juniperus virginiana) for development of potential entrepreneurial opportunities, 2) identifying volatile organic attractants from chestnut that has potential application for biological/chemical control of chestnut weevil, 3) investigating the fate of modern herbicides, such as isoxaflutole, in municipal disinfection process, and 4) assessing the effectiveness of vegetative windbreak in reducing transport of malodorous compounds.

Background[edit]
Mu Chun is the younger brother of "Unrestrained" Mu Hong. The brothers are from a wealthy and influential family in Jieyang Town (揭陽鎮; believed to be in present-day Jiujiang, Jiangxi), near the Xunyang River. Mu Chun excels in martial arts and wields a saber in battle.
Meeting Song Jiang[edit]
When Song Jiang is exiled to Jiangzhou (江州; east of present-day Chongzuo, Guangxi), he passes by Jieyang Town along the way and meets the street performer Xue Yong. Xue Yong's failure to acknowledge the Mu brothers' presence angers them. Mu Chun forbids the townsfolk to pay Xue Yong for his performance. Song Jiang ignores Mu Chun and gives Xue Yong five silver taels. Mu Chun is furious with Song Jiang for disregarding him and wants to beat up Song, but Xue Yong comes to Song's aid and defeats Mu in a fight.
Mu Chun feels humiliated after his defeat and is determined to take revenge on Song Jiang and Xue Yong. He forbids the townsfolk from extending their hospitality to the two men, and then secretly discusses his plans for revenge with his brother. Song Jiang overhears their conversation by chance and flees from the town. The Mu brothers capture Xue Yong, beat him up, and then lead their followers to pursue Song Jiang. In desperation, Song Jiang boards Zhang Heng's boat, without knowing that Zhang is actually a pirate who robs unsuspecting travellers. When the boat reaches the middle of the river, Zhang Heng wants to kill Song Jiang and rob him, but is stopped by Li Jun. Zhang Heng and the Mu brothers are shocked when they learn of Song Jiang's true identity from Li Jun, because they have heard of his reputation as a generous and chivalrous hero who helps those in need, and have been wanting to meet him. They apologise to him and treat him like an honoured guest before seeing him off on his journey to Jiangzhou.
Joining Liangshan[edit]
Song Jiang runs into trouble in Jiangzhou later and is sentenced to death. However, the outlaws from Liangshan Marsh show up Jiangzhou, storm the execution ground, and save Song Jiang. After escaping from Jiangzhou, they head towards the riverbank, where Li Jun, the Mu brothers and others are waiting for them in boats. They ferry the outlaws back to Liangshan Marsh. The Mu brothers join the outlaw band at Liangshan.
After the Grand Assembly of the 108 Stars of Destiny, Mu Chun becomes one of the leaders of the Liangshan infantry. He follows the heroes on their campaigns against the Liao invaders and southern rebel forces after they have been granted amnesty by Emperor Huizong. During the campaign against the rebel leader Fang La, Mu Chun remains behind in Hangzhou to take care of six of his comrades who fell sick after the battle of Hangzhou. After the Liangshan forces defeat Fang La, Mu Chun is grieved to learn that his brother had died of illness in Runzhou (潤州; present-day Runzhou District, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu) during the campaign. When the surviving Liangshan heroes return to the capital to report their victory, the emperor offers Mu Chun the title of "Martial Gentleman of Grace" (武奕郎) to recognise him for his contributions during the campaigns. Mu Chun, however, declines the offer and returns home, where he leads the rest of his life as a commoner.

Mu Chun is furious with Song Jiang for disregarding him and wants to beat up Song, but Xue Yong comes to Song's aid and defeats Mu in a fight.
Mu Chun feels humiliated after his defeat and is determined to take revenge on Song Jiang and Xue Yong. He forbids the townsfolk from extending their hospitality to the two men, and then secretly discusses his plans for revenge with his brother. Song Jiang overhears their conversation by chance and flees from the town. The Mu brothers capture Xue Yong, beat him up, and then lead their followers to pursue Song Jiang. In desperation, Song Jiang boards Zhang Heng's boat, without knowing that Zhang is actually a pirate who robs unsuspecting travellers. When the boat reaches the middle of the river, Zhang Heng wants to kill Song Jiang and rob him, but is stopped by Li Jun. Zhang Heng and the Mu brothers are shocked when they learn of Song Jiang's true identity from Li Jun, because they have heard of his reputation as a generous and chivalrous hero who helps those in need, and have been wanting to meet him. They apologise to him and treat him like an honoured guest before seeing him off on his journey to Jiangzhou.
Joining Liangshan[edit]
Song Jiang runs into trouble in Jiangzhou later and is sentenced to death. However, the outlaws from Liangshan Marsh show up Jiangzhou, storm the execution ground, and save Song Jiang. After escaping from Jiangzhou, they head towards the riverbank, where Li Jun, the Mu brothers and others are waiting for them in boats. They ferry the outlaws back to Liangshan Marsh. The Mu brothers join the outlaw band at Liangshan.
After the Grand Assembly of the 108 Stars of Destiny, Mu Chun becomes one of the leaders of the Liangshan infantry. He follows the heroes on their campaigns against the Liao invaders and southern rebel forces after they have been granted amnesty by Emperor Huizong. During the campaign against the rebel leader Fang La, Mu Chun remains behind in Hangzhou to take care of six of his comrades who fell sick after the battle of Hangzhou. After the Liangshan forces defeat Fang La, Mu Chun is grieved to learn that his brother had died of illness in Runzhou (潤州; present-day Runzhou District, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu) during the campaign. When the surviving Liangshan heroes return to the capital to report their victory, the emperor offers Mu Chun the title of "Martial Gentleman of Grace" (武奕郎) to recognise him for his contributions during the campaigns. Mu Chun, however, declines the offer and returns home, where he leads the rest of his life as a commoner.

If you wish to learn about pu-erh tea in detail, please click here >>







Tea is produced in 2012. It is compressed into 200g of tea cake

This tea gives very distinctive fruity flavor. The tea was grown at the north of Lin Cang.


 
Du Mu Chun comes from the north part of Wu Liang Shan. The north part of Wu Liang Shan is the arid zone. A lot of cactus growing around the tea garden. The tea tree of Du Mu Chun aged more than a few hundred years and it is grown without fertilizer. Due to severe drought, tea grows very slow and its flavour is highly concentrated. This tea has a unique flavour that reminds us of citrus, spice, or sometimes even prunes. It also gives light floral flavour reminiscent lily flower or fresh honey. Because of its strong and up-lifting aroma, many people misunderstand that this is oolong tea. Many customers enjoy this tea when it is fresh. Nevertheless, keeping tea for a few years may produce interesting outcome too.
In Yunnan, sometimes we come across pu-erh tea that gives very strong flavour, like Du Mu Chun. To find this tea often need some luck.
     I have brewed this tea in different places, such as China, Malaysia and Japan. The flavour differs a lot depending on the water we use, it sometimes gives floral fragrance and sometimes its flavour is fruitier. Du Mu Chun will have considerable body with modest aftertaste. It's simply delicious with no astringency; it is a good choice as a daily drinking tea.
 

The northern part of Wu Liang Shan. The river down there is the Mekong River. This river starts in Tibet, passes Thailand and flows until Pacific Ocean. Once upon a time, Mekong River had been used for logistics purpose when tea was traded to neighbouring countries. As you can see in the photo, the soil in this area is not fertile at all, and very rich in red soil. This type of extreme environment is rather good for the tea's quality.
 



 
 

We mainly focus in tea from Lincang, and we seldom buy tea from Xishuang-banna
The three main production areas of pu-erh tea is Xishuang-banna, Lin Cang and Pu-erh. In these three places, Xishuang-banna is the most famous.
Xishuang-banna has historically famous place, such as Yiwu, Bu Lang Shan or Lao Ban Zhang. In the past few years, it took us more than a day to reach some of the villages. These places were quite isolated and not publicly. Nowadays, the access to these places becomes much easier, thanks to the road construction. In less than three hours, these places can be reached. Many local visitors or even tourists from other provinces often visit these places, since buying tea directly from tea garden is sort of a fun activity. Sometimes, at the minority village located in the mountain of Xishuang-banna, we can even see the BMW or Porsche. Since many people are rushing to obtain tea from these famous places, the tea price keeps rising and yet the quality drastically reduces. When the demand on tea tremendously increases, farmers will find a way to increase the output to fulfil the demand. Thus, they stop traditional farming and start applying a lot of fertilizer in order to increase the output. These situation is really spoiling the quality of tea in the historically the famous production area. For us, we seldom purchase tea in Xishuang-banna. The tea is too expensive for its quality.
HOJO focus in tea from Lin Cang. From my point of view, Ling Cang is a very ideal place for producing quality tea. One of the important reasons is that this place is not well-developed. Some of the villages are at remote location and cannot be reached by car. I prefer those minor places is mainly because of the tea tree is maintained at very natural condition. Since these villages are less popular, farmers pay less attention to the output. They leave the tea tree just like their ancestor's way. The tea plucking is only once a year. Besides, no pesticide and no fertilizer is applied. The only natural fertilizer is given by chicken; only if the tea tree is very lucky, chickens may drop a "gift" as they wander at tea garden. In addition, for the production of high-quality tea, Lin Cang's environmental condition is flawless. First of all, the total rainfall in Lin Cang is very low. It is a very dry area indeed. Most of the land here is very rich in red clay and the altitude of the Lin Cang is very high. Due to these factors, tea in Lin Cang grows very slowly and accumulates a lot of minerals. Once we tasted these teas, it is very uneasy to reverse back to the previous quality. The tea is so soft and smooth. We can tell the difference even if we drink it while pinching our nose.
 
Why people are so crazy about pu-erh tea?
Honestly speaking, no matter how well the pu-erh tea is made or matured, in terms of flavour, it never is able to compete with the well-made oolong tea.  For example, the flavour of Phoenix Dan Cong oolong is marvellous. I often say that oolong tea is appreciated because of its flavour, while pu-erh tea is valued for its taste. Nevertheless, there is oolong tea that gives good taste as well as nice flavour. However, please compare the price of oolong and pu-erh tea. Usually, if oolong tea has both good flavour and taste, the price is sky-high. As for pu-erh, its flavour may not be as great as oolong. But we can often find pu-erh tea that gives extraordinarily nice taste. In this context, nice taste is refers to after taste, soft, smooth, thick and long lasting sweetness. Generally, oolong is produced in Fujian or Guangdong province. These tea regions are more open and better-known. So there is no more "Indiana John’s story". Pu-erh tea comes from Yunnan province. The Yunnan province has less exposure to the outside world. Many small villages are scattered in the mountain. Some of them are not even indicated on the Yunnan map. Only if tea buyer knows the specific place, it is possible to find the extraordinarily quality tea at very low price. We still stand a lot of chances to enjoy the fantasy of treasure hunting. 
The flavour of pu-erh becomes very attractive, if it is well-kept. It may not be as perfect as some of the fine oolong, but its flavour becomes very fruity and sweet like honey. Usually, tea starts developing the honey flavour in 2-3 years’ time and fruitiness appears from 5 years’ time onwards. I believe the best timing to drink pu-erh tea is within 5-10 years’ time. However, some people like aged tea that has been kept for 20 to 30 years. I think it is personal preference.
 
The point of selection for tea we purchased in 2012
I would like to explain the point of selection for tea we purchased in 2012. Usually, I buy tea from minority races. They own the old tea trees inherited from their ancestors. Some of the tea trees have been there more than 1000 years. Till today, they practice very traditional farming. If we require good quality tea, it is very essential to purchase it from minority races. With natural farming method, the raw material quality is superb. However, the disadvantage of getting tea from them is their process control is less precise. Normally, the pan-frying of tea is carried out with wood firing. With this method, it is difficult to control the consistent or ideal temperature. Sometimes tea is over-fired. Usually I am taking note of the over-fired flavour and try not to purchase. However, if the tea base quality is extremely high and the price is very reasonable, I will consider to purchase. It is ideal to keep for further maturation. High quality tea is refers to tea is very rich in polyphenols and this is the key element for maturation. Once the tea is well-matured, the over-fired flavour disappears. After ideal maturation, the price of tea will be adjusted. For pu-erh tea, it is common that price is raised in proportion to the maturation period. Since these teas are less expensive, one of the ways is to buy extra quantity and keep for some time. In any case, tea produced from the quality material is nice to enjoy even it is fresh. Although it may give slight over-fired flavour, it is sweet with very smooth drinking feeling.
Here’s the list of our pu-erh teas:

 1. Tea that is well-made:
 
Bai Ying Shan Raw Pu-erh 2008
Bai Ying Shan Raw Pu-erh 2012
Da Xue Shan Wild Pu-erh 2010
Du Mu Chun Raw Pu-erh 2012
 
2. Tea that has slight over-fired flavour caused by wood-firing:
 
Xian Su Shan Raw Pu-erh 2010
Xiu Lin Wu Hao Raw Pu-erh 2011
Zhong Shan Raw Pu-erh 2012
 
Xian Su Shan Raw Pu-erh has very marginal extent of effect from the firing process. It is a well-made tea from the extraordinarily good material. It gives full body, long-lasting taste and very smooth texture, with a lingering sweetish taste. In fact, you can enjoy this tea for now, and do not have to wait until the tea is matured. 
Next to Da Xue Shan Wild Pu-erh, Xiu Lin Wu Hao Raw Pu-erh gives the strongest after taste among the teas. This tea is so smooth and soft, with flavour like sugar cane and honey. Although it has slightly smoky flavour like scotch, some customers like this tea very much as they love good scotch. 
Zhong Shan Raw Pu-erh is also made from very good material. This tea was slightly over-fried. It gives a little baked aroma like bean.

Raw puerh is the original Yunnan tea.
 
By far, many customers associate Pu-erh tea as tea with liquor that is dark brown in color and gives moldy or muddy smell. In fact, tea that has “brown liquor and moldy smell” is just referring to one type of Pu-erh teas, we call it Pu-erh ripe tea. Pu-erh ripe tea is invented back in 1973. It was produced with the microbiological fermentation. Most of Pu-erh teas available in oversea market are this sort of ripe tea. However Pu-erh ripe tea is not the original Pu-erh tea. In Yunnan province, Pu-erh tea means "raw Pu-erh". The ripe Pu-erh is considered as "export tea". Most of tea connoisseurs, me included seek for Pu-erh raw tea. Although both teas shared the same name as "Pu-erh", the Pu-erh raw tea and ripe tea is completely different kind of tea. In fact it is as different as comparing black tea and green tea.
This tea is produced by minorities in Yunnan. They were historically originated from South East Asia. Most of their tea trees existed ever since long ago. Today, these tea trees adapted into the surrounding natural environment and grew just like wild plants. Usually, they go to the mountain to pluck tea leaves whenever they need to make some money for living. The environment of the mountain where these tea trees grow is just like any ordinary mountain area. Needless to say, no fertilizer or pesticide is applied. Thanks to the fact that tea trees were left to grow like wild trees and no chemicals were applied, their natural habitat has a very efficient ecological system. The pests co-exist with their natural enemies. Thanks to no pesticide, these natural enemies of pest can survive in adequate numbers to keep the pest population under control.
Pu-erh raw tea has more than 1000 years of long history and China is the only country that produces Pu-erh tea. It was originated from Yunnan province in southwest China. In Yunnan, the locals drink this tea on a daily basis. In making Pu-erh raw tea, the quality of raw material has a critical impact on the quality of finished tea.  
  What are the quality criteria of good Pu-erh raw tea? We noticed that many people thought that Pu-erh tea is very special and different from other teas. However, Pu-erh tea is also one type of tea. There is no difference in its character from other types of tea. No exceptional taken just because it is Pu-erh tea. 
  The quality of Pu-erh consists of 2 elements.
 
1. Intensity of after taste

  Good tea gives very deep after taste which allows you to enjoy the taste deep down in your throat. The flavor of good tea stays longer in the throat and lasts for a long time. This quality aspect has nothing to do with the method of processing. The intensity of after taste is due to the minerals content of tea leaves. Usually, tea produced from old tea trees or trees grown at high altitude will give much better quality and after taste.
 
2. Quality of flavour

    Tea must maintain its fresh flavour. As a matter of fact, most of Pu-erh teas were stored under inappropriate environment where the humidity tends to be very high. As a result, tea loses its fresh flavour, and instead it gives oxidized and sour flavour. Many people misunderstand that this sort of oxidized flavour as the flavour of “aging”. In fact, Pu-erh tea that has undergone proper aging naturally gives a fresh fruity flavour. 


3. Astringency

  Tea that gives bitter or astringent taste indicates that it is not early spring tea. They are plucked either during end of spring or summer. Usually those teas are classified as lower quality. Spring tea is high in quality, but the yield of early spring tea is very limited in a year. Thus, majority of Pu-erh raw tea available in tea market is summer tea which tastes bitter and/or astringent. Many customers told us that they could not drink freshly made raw Pu-erh because it was too strong (bitter or astringent) and therefore raw tea has to be kept for more than 5 years before it can be consumed. In a way, this is true but also not so true. If the tea is made of tea leaves plucked in early spring, it will never taste bitter or astringent. In fact, most people in Yunnan like to drink fresh Pu-erh tea produced less than a year. Only occasionally, the locals in Yunnan drink vintage Pu-erh tea.

Brewing Method

(1) Water
 

   If you are using tap water, it is necessary to filter the water using an activated carbon filter. If not, you wouldn't be able to enjoy the authentic taste of tea. Chlorine is added to tap water in order to sanitize bacteria. This chlorinated water will also harm our body cells. Concerning about our health condition, it is very important to remove chlorine from drinking water. The most effective method in removing chlorine is to install an activated carbon filter. This type of filter is designed for removing organic substance. It will remove not only chlorine, but also other harmful substance such as contaminated pesticide. The activated carbon filter can be easily obtained from the common hardware shop in most countries. If activated carbon filter is not available, please place a charcoal inside the water and leave it for overnight. The material composed of activated carbon filter is made of ground charcoal. The difference is that activated carbon filter contains much finer particles and hence it has extremely large surface area for a better efficiency in filtration. The intensity of after taste becomes stronger if water is kept overnight. Keeping water with stones or inside clay jar will increase the content of minerals. However, you need to confirm whether or not the water kept inside particular jar or with stone is suitable with your tea or tea equipment (such as teapot). If water jar carries certain minerals like copper or zinc, it will rather spoil the taste and flavor of tea. For this, you need to confirm with experiment on try and error basis. For boiling water, please do not use aluminum or copper kettle. It spoils the taste of water. We suggest using kettle made of iron, stainless steel, tin or glass. 
   In the long run, you may observe a thick layer of scale accumulated inside your kettle. Our mother usually taught us to wash and remove it with citric acid. But please do not even try to remove the scale. Scale consists of minerals that exist in the water. The mineral composition is reflected from the water you used. If you remove the scale, the mineral ion balance between scale and water is destroyed. This balance is called buffer effect in science. The flavor and taste will seriously run out and you won't be able to get previous taste and flavor for a long time. It is also important to stick to the same type of water whenever brewing tea. If source of water is changed, it carries different type of minerals. It will affect the mineral ion balance too.

 (2) Quantity of tea leaves

    Use 1g of tea leaves for 40ml of water. It means that you need 5g of tea leaves for 200ml of water.

(3) Temperature
     
    It is important to use boiling water. Please do not stop as soon as water is boiled. It is advisable to keep water boiling for about 30 seconds to 1 minute.

(4) Warm up teapot
It is important to pour boiling water into the teapot and leave it for about 10 seconds. Without this rinsing process, the temperature of boiling water decrease about 20 degree C when it is pour into the teapot.

 (5) Warm up tea leaves
Place tea leaves in teapot and pour boiling water again. Leave it for less than a second and discard the water, and immediately pour boiling water one more time and repeat the same procedure. Without this step, the temperature of tea will reduce nearly 30 degree C.
    If (4) and (5) is not carried out, your brewing temperature will be 50-60 degree C. This is too low to extract sufficient flavor and taste. Please repeat rinsing process one more time. Please do not soak tea for more than a second.

(6)Brewing Time
    1st Brewing: A few seconds
    2nd Brewing Onwards: Less than a few seconds.
  You can brew up to even 8-10 brewing using the same tea leaves. From 2nd brewing onwards, it is very important to keep brewing time as short as you can. As tea leaf is wet and hot, definitely it is not necessary to brew more than a few seconds.
    Note: Please remove the lid while you are waiting for subsequent brewing. If the lid is not removes, tea leaves will be over steamed and get oxidized.
 
In our opinion, this tea taste nicer if it is brewed thicker. We suggest to use more quantity of leaves than normal pu-erh tea brewing.


Simple Brewing Method using Gaiwan
 
    Firstly, warm up the Gaiwan with boiling water, and then place tea leaves up to 60-70% of the capacity of Gaiwan. We use 1g of tea leaves for 10ml of water. So if the capacity of Gaiwan is 100ml, we need about 5g of tea leaves. Please remember to place tea leaves gently and not to compress it into the Gaiwan. Pour boiling water up to the level of tea leaves, and then place the lid and immediately pour out the water from Gaiwan. Repeat this action once more. It means you need to rinse the tea leaves twice with boiling water. This action is to warm up tea leaves and also to open up the leaves. These actions must be carried out swiftly so as not to lose the precious flavor and taste of tea.
  For the actual brewing, it does not require long infusion like making other teas. Instead, you have to brew it the "touch and go" style. As soon as you pour the boiling water up to the level of tea leaves, place the lid to Gaiwan and then immediately pour out the tea without letting it soak. It is recommended to accumulate the 1st and 2nd brewing into a pitcher in order to even out the flavor and taste. For each subsequent brewing, you just need to brew less than a second. By brewing this "touch and go" style, you can continue brew up to nearly 20 times.

Note: Please remove the lid while you are waiting for subsequent brewing. Tea leaf will be over steamed and get oxidized if the lid is not removed. 
 



Storage of Tea

Pu-erh tea can lasts more than 10 - 20 years as long as tea is kept in dry environment. Before tea is kept, it must be tightly sealed. Tea should be kept in ambient temperature and dry conditions such as in the living room and it must not be kept in humid environment like in the kitchen. Avoid enclosed area such as inside the cupboard or drawer as these places are damp. Also avoid opening the bag of tea in humid atmosphere. It is recommended to open the bag during a sunny day or under air-conditioned atmosphere. Once tea leaves absorb moisture, deterioration of tea will be triggered within a few days. Tea will give an astringent taste, and sometime it tastes sour. Its aroma also becomes weaker.

      Traditionally, Pu-erh tea is compressed to remove oxygen from the leaves and kept it intact. It was the wisdom of ancient people to keep tea without oxygen and let it matured very well. 
From scientific point of view, oxidation does not only refer to receiving oxygen. The oxidation also takes place when it releases hydrogen and receives electron. Even if tea is kept without oxygen, it will still undergo oxidation.
In 1960's, generally Pu-erh tea was compressed tightly and shaped like a bing (flat and thin round cake). It was called “iron bing”. The tea leaf was compressed extremely tight until it became like a piece of stone; we can hardly pry it even if we use the proper tool that designed for prying the Pu-erh cake. This style of compression succeeded the elimination of oxygen from the tea leaves. If you have ever tried this kind of Pu-erh iron bing, you would know that it was very well-matured. It gives flavour like honey with fruity note and gives no earthy flavour at all. The only problem is that it is so difficult to loosen the leaves from the iron bing and the leaves are often damaged during the process. 
      On the other hand, nowadays most of Pu-erh cakes are loosely compressed. Some of the Pu-erh cakes can be easily break apart by fingers. Obviously there is oxygen remained in between the leaves.  If we keep loosely-compressed Pu-erh in ambient environment, tea will expose to not only oxygen but also moisture and develop unwanted oxidation that usually generates earthy flavour. To achieve the same maturation effect like the iron bing, we encourage customer to keep Pu-erh tea without oxygen. With modern technology, we are able to apply the same theory.  Some people in Taiwan intentionally keep high mountain oolong in the vacuum bag for a few years. In the beginning, high mountain oolong is green in colour and it gives a delightful fresh flowery flavour. After a few years of maturation, the leaves turn into yellow colour and it gives the flavour like ripen peach or apricot. This is exactly the same effect as what we are looking for in Pu-erh tea. Based on our experience, well-matured Pu-erh tea gives a very fruity flavour and no earthy or mouldy flavour at all.
Please make sure not to keep inside fridge.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
