TGN1412 clinical trial[edit]
Main article: TGN1412





The neutrality of this section is disputed. Relevant discussion may be found on the talk page. Please do not remove this message until conditions to do so are met. (August 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


In March 2006, a PAREXEL-run trial on behalf of TeGenero, the now bankrupt German biotechnology firm, on its anti-inflammatory drug TGN1412 to treat rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis or leukaemia, caused severe inflammation and multiple organ failure in six healthy volunteers at a facility based at Northwick Park Hospital in London.[42] The drug had been tested on animals but this was the first test on humans.
PAREXEL became the target of legal proceedings from lawyers representing the injured volunteers after the insurance policy of TeGenero was unable to provide sufficient compensation. When the liable company[43] subsequently declared bankruptcy,[44] lawyers for the volunteers initiated legal proceeding against PAREXEL and the two parties later entered into talks;[45] the results of this meeting have not been made public.[46]
A documentary shown in the UK on 28 September 2006 featuring journalist Brian Deer as part of Channel 4's Dispatches series exposed uncertainty about the existence of data that should mandatorily have been submitted by TeGenero to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) prior to the trial indicating whether TGN1412 had been adequately tested on human blood in vitro. Concerns were also raised about whether a safe human dosage was properly obtained by TeGenero. The MHRA however concluded that none of the companies involved could be held responsible for the outcome of the test and that the adverse events that occurred were most likely caused by an unpredicted biological action of the drug in humans.[47]

PAREXEL International is a multinational life sciences consulting firm. It conducts clinical trials on behalf of its pharmaceutical clients to expedite the drug approval process. It is the second largest clinical research organization in the world and has helped develop approximately 95% of the 200 top-selling biopharmaceuticals on the market today.[3] The company publishes the annual PAREXEL R&D Statistical Sourcebook,[4] operates the PAREXEL-Academy,[5] and councils all of the top 50 biopharmaceutical and top 30 biotechnology companies.[6]
PAREXEL was founded in 1982 by Josef von Rickenbach[7] and organic chemist Anne B. Sayigh[8] initially to advise Japanese and German firms on how to navigate the FDA approval process.[9] The firm has grown organically over the years and through 40 acquisitions. Josef von Rickenbach is credited with establishing PAREXEL’s culture and practices based on the principles he experienced as a researcher at Schering-Plough in Lucerne, Switzerland.[9]
In 1990, the firm expanded internationally and established new practice areas. By 1999 it had a staff of 4,500 and 45 offices.[9] In the 2000s, it grew to over 18,000 employees. PAREXEL’s consulting and clinical trial work has helped establish many household drug brands and contributed to numerous successes in modern pharmacology.
In 2016, the company allied with EMC Corporation to provide a suite of regulated information and content management services.[10] The company has announced that it will be acquired by private equity firm Pamplona Capital Management for approximately $5.0 billion. [11] The deal is expected to close by the end of 2017.

TGN1412 clinical trial[edit]
Main article: TGN1412





The neutrality of this section is disputed. Relevant discussion may be found on the talk page. Please do not remove this message until conditions to do so are met. (August 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


In March 2006, a PAREXEL-run trial on behalf of TeGenero, the now bankrupt German biotechnology firm, on its anti-inflammatory drug TGN1412 to treat rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis or leukaemia, caused severe inflammation and multiple organ failure in six healthy volunteers at a facility based at Northwick Park Hospital in London.[42] The drug had been tested on animals but this was the first test on humans.
PAREXEL became the target of legal proceedings from lawyers representing the injured volunteers after the insurance policy of TeGenero was unable to provide sufficient compensation. When the liable company[43] subsequently declared bankruptcy,[44] lawyers for the volunteers initiated legal proceeding against PAREXEL and the two parties later entered into talks;[45] the results of this meeting have not been made public.[46]
A documentary shown in the UK on 28 September 2006 featuring journalist Brian Deer as part of Channel 4's Dispatches series exposed uncertainty about the existence of data that should mandatorily have been submitted by TeGenero to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) prior to the trial indicating whether TGN1412 had been adequately tested on human blood in vitro. Concerns were also raised about whether a safe human dosage was properly obtained by TeGenero. The MHRA however concluded that none of the companies involved could be held responsible for the outcome of the test and that the adverse events that occurred were most likely caused by an unpredicted biological action of the drug in humans.[47]

Parexel to be bought in a $5 billion deal by Pamplona Capital
Parexel International Corp.  announced Tuesday an agreement to be acquired by private-equity firm Pamplona Capital Management in a deal valued at $5.0 billion. Under terms of the deal, Pamplona said it will pay $88.10 in cash for each of the biopharmaceutical company's shares outstanding, a 5.0% premium to Monday's closing price of $83.92, but 27.9% above "unaffected" May 5 closing price of $68.86, which was just before reports of a potential buyout. The deal is expected to close early in the fourth quarter. Parexel's stock was up 8.1% in premarket trade prior to a trading halt. It has soared 35% over the past three months to close Monday at a record high, while the S&P 500  has gained 9.6%.

Parexel to be bought in a $5 billion deal by Pamplona Capital
Parexel International Corp.  announced Tuesday an agreement to be acquired by private-equity firm Pamplona Capital Management in a deal valued at $5.0 billion. Under terms of the deal, Pamplona said it will pay $88.10 in cash for each of the biopharmaceutical company's shares outstanding, a 5.0% premium to Monday's closing price of $83.92, but 27.9% above "unaffected" May 5 closing price of $68.86, which was just before reports of a potential buyout. The deal is expected to close early in the fourth quarter. Parexel's stock was up 8.1% in premarket trade prior to a trading halt. It has soared 35% over the past three months to close Monday at a record high, while the S&P 500  has gained 9.6%.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

PAREXEL International is a multinational life sciences consulting firm. It conducts clinical trials on behalf of its pharmaceutical clients to expedite the drug approval process. It is the second largest clinical research organization in the world and has helped develop approximately 95% of the 200 top-selling biopharmaceuticals on the market today.[3] The company publishes the annual PAREXEL R&D Statistical Sourcebook,[4] operates the PAREXEL-Academy,[5] and councils all of the top 50 biopharmaceutical and top 30 biotechnology companies.[6]
PAREXEL was founded in 1982 by Josef von Rickenbach[7] and organic chemist Anne B. Sayigh[8] initially to advise Japanese and German firms on how to navigate the FDA approval process.[9] The firm has grown organically over the years and through 40 acquisitions. Josef von Rickenbach is credited with establishing PAREXEL’s culture and practices based on the principles he experienced as a researcher at Schering-Plough in Lucerne, Switzerland.[9]
In 1990, the firm expanded internationally and established new practice areas. By 1999 it had a staff of 4,500 and 45 offices.[9] In the 2000s, it grew to over 18,000 employees. PAREXEL’s consulting and clinical trial work has helped establish many household drug brands and contributed to numerous successes in modern pharmacology.
In 2016, the company allied with EMC Corporation to provide a suite of regulated information and content management services.[10] The company has announced that it will be acquired by private equity firm Pamplona Capital Management for approximately $5.0 billion. [11] The deal is expected to close by the end of 2017.

TGN1412 clinical trial[edit]
Main article: TGN1412





The neutrality of this section is disputed. Relevant discussion may be found on the talk page. Please do not remove this message until conditions to do so are met. (August 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


In March 2006, a PAREXEL-run trial on behalf of TeGenero, the now bankrupt German biotechnology firm, on its anti-inflammatory drug TGN1412 to treat rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis or leukaemia, caused severe inflammation and multiple organ failure in six healthy volunteers at a facility based at Northwick Park Hospital in London.[42] The drug had been tested on animals but this was the first test on humans.
PAREXEL became the target of legal proceedings from lawyers representing the injured volunteers after the insurance policy of TeGenero was unable to provide sufficient compensation. When the liable company[43] subsequently declared bankruptcy,[44] lawyers for the volunteers initiated legal proceeding against PAREXEL and the two parties later entered into talks;[45] the results of this meeting have not been made public.[46]
A documentary shown in the UK on 28 September 2006 featuring journalist Brian Deer as part of Channel 4's Dispatches series exposed uncertainty about the existence of data that should mandatorily have been submitted by TeGenero to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) prior to the trial indicating whether TGN1412 had been adequately tested on human blood in vitro. Concerns were also raised about whether a safe human dosage was properly obtained by TeGenero. The MHRA however concluded that none of the companies involved could be held responsible for the outcome of the test and that the adverse events that occurred were most likely caused by an unpredicted biological action of the drug in humans.[47]

PAREXEL International is a multinational life sciences consulting firm. It conducts clinical trials on behalf of its pharmaceutical clients to expedite the drug approval process. It is the second largest clinical research organization in the world and has helped develop approximately 95% of the 200 top-selling biopharmaceuticals on the market today.[3] The company publishes the annual PAREXEL R&D Statistical Sourcebook,[4] operates the PAREXEL-Academy,[5] and councils all of the top 50 biopharmaceutical and top 30 biotechnology companies.[6]
PAREXEL was founded in 1982 by Josef von Rickenbach[7] and organic chemist Anne B. Sayigh[8] initially to advise Japanese and German firms on how to navigate the FDA approval process.[9] The firm has grown organically over the years and through 40 acquisitions. Josef von Rickenbach is credited with establishing PAREXEL’s culture and practices based on the principles he experienced as a researcher at Schering-Plough in Lucerne, Switzerland.[9]
In 1990, the firm expanded internationally and established new practice areas. By 1999 it had a staff of 4,500 and 45 offices.[9] In the 2000s, it grew to over 18,000 employees. PAREXEL’s consulting and clinical trial work has helped establish many household drug brands and contributed to numerous successes in modern pharmacology.
In 2016, the company allied with EMC Corporation to provide a suite of regulated information and content management services.[10] The company has announced that it will be acquired by private equity firm Pamplona Capital Management for approximately $5.0 billion. [11] The deal is expected to close by the end of 2017.

TGN1412 clinical trial[edit]
Main article: TGN1412





The neutrality of this section is disputed. Relevant discussion may be found on the talk page. Please do not remove this message until conditions to do so are met. (August 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


In March 2006, a PAREXEL-run trial on behalf of TeGenero, the now bankrupt German biotechnology firm, on its anti-inflammatory drug TGN1412 to treat rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis or leukaemia, caused severe inflammation and multiple organ failure in six healthy volunteers at a facility based at Northwick Park Hospital in London.[42] The drug had been tested on animals but this was the first test on humans.
PAREXEL became the target of legal proceedings from lawyers representing the injured volunteers after the insurance policy of TeGenero was unable to provide sufficient compensation. When the liable company[43] subsequently declared bankruptcy,[44] lawyers for the volunteers initiated legal proceeding against PAREXEL and the two parties later entered into talks;[45] the results of this meeting have not been made public.[46]
A documentary shown in the UK on 28 September 2006 featuring journalist Brian Deer as part of Channel 4's Dispatches series exposed uncertainty about the existence of data that should mandatorily have been submitted by TeGenero to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) prior to the trial indicating whether TGN1412 had been adequately tested on human blood in vitro. Concerns were also raised about whether a safe human dosage was properly obtained by TeGenero. The MHRA however concluded that none of the companies involved could be held responsible for the outcome of the test and that the adverse events that occurred were most likely caused by an unpredicted biological action of the drug in humans.[47]

PAREXEL International is a multinational life sciences consulting firm. It conducts clinical trials on behalf of its pharmaceutical clients to expedite the drug approval process. It is the second largest clinical research organization in the world and has helped develop approximately 95% of the 200 top-selling biopharmaceuticals on the market today.[3] The company publishes the annual PAREXEL R&D Statistical Sourcebook,[4] operates the PAREXEL-Academy,[5] and councils all of the top 50 biopharmaceutical and top 30 biotechnology companies.[6]
PAREXEL was founded in 1982 by Josef von Rickenbach[7] and organic chemist Anne B. Sayigh[8] initially to advise Japanese and German firms on how to navigate the FDA approval process.[9] The firm has grown organically over the years and through 40 acquisitions. Josef von Rickenbach is credited with establishing PAREXEL’s culture and practices based on the principles he experienced as a researcher at Schering-Plough in Lucerne, Switzerland.[9]
In 1990, the firm expanded internationally and established new practice areas. By 1999 it had a staff of 4,500 and 45 offices.[9] In the 2000s, it grew to over 18,000 employees. PAREXEL’s consulting and clinical trial work has helped establish many household drug brands and contributed to numerous successes in modern pharmacology.
In 2016, the company allied with EMC Corporation to provide a suite of regulated information and content management services.[10] The company has announced that it will be acquired by private equity firm Pamplona Capital Management for approximately $5.0 billion. [11] The deal is expected to close by the end of 2017.

TGN1412 clinical trial[edit]
Main article: TGN1412





The neutrality of this section is disputed. Relevant discussion may be found on the talk page. Please do not remove this message until conditions to do so are met. (August 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


In March 2006, a PAREXEL-run trial on behalf of TeGenero, the now bankrupt German biotechnology firm, on its anti-inflammatory drug TGN1412 to treat rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis or leukaemia, caused severe inflammation and multiple organ failure in six healthy volunteers at a facility based at Northwick Park Hospital in London.[42] The drug had been tested on animals but this was the first test on humans.
PAREXEL became the target of legal proceedings from lawyers representing the injured volunteers after the insurance policy of TeGenero was unable to provide sufficient compensation. When the liable company[43] subsequently declared bankruptcy,[44] lawyers for the volunteers initiated legal proceeding against PAREXEL and the two parties later entered into talks;[45] the results of this meeting have not been made public.[46]
A documentary shown in the UK on 28 September 2006 featuring journalist Brian Deer as part of Channel 4's Dispatches series exposed uncertainty about the existence of data that should mandatorily have been submitted by TeGenero to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) prior to the trial indicating whether TGN1412 had been adequately tested on human blood in vitro. Concerns were also raised about whether a safe human dosage was properly obtained by TeGenero. The MHRA however concluded that none of the companies involved could be held responsible for the outcome of the test and that the adverse events that occurred were most likely caused by an unpredicted biological action of the drug in humans.[47]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
