WILTON, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The Sun Products Corporation, a leading North American manufacturer and 
      marketer of fabric care and household care products, today announced 
      that Jeffrey Ansell, currently President and CEO, has been named 
      Chairman of the Board, effective immediately.
    


      Mr. Ansell succeeds Neil P. Defeo who is stepping down as Chairman but 
      will remain on the Board as a non-executive Director.
    

      Mr. Ansell joined Sun Products in spring, 2011 as President and Chief 
      Executive Officer and will continue in these roles. He has redefined the 
      company’s strategy, created a more robust foundation upon which Sun 
      Products can flourish, and strengthened the brand portfolio through 
      innovation.
    

      Dan O’Connell, Chief Executive Officer of majority shareholder Vestar 
      Capital Partners said, “Jeff has demonstrated strong leadership and 
      moved Sun Products forward since joining as President and Chief 
      Executive Officer last year. His knowledge of and passion for the 
      category will bode well in his extended role as Chairman of the Board.
    

      “Neil Defeo played a critical role partnering with us on the formation 
      of Sun Products in 2008 and launched the company as a leading player in 
      the fabric care and household care market,” Mr. O’Connell added. “I am 
      pleased that we will continue to benefit from Neil’s tenure and 
      experience as a member of the Board of Directors.”
    

      Commenting on his appointment, Jeff Ansell said, “I am honored to have 
      been named Chairman. I thank the Board for this great opportunity and 
      look forward to leading Sun Products on its exciting growth journey.”
    

      “We were fortunate in selecting Jeff last year as President and CEO,” 
      said former chairman of Sun Products Neil DeFeo. “Jeff brings extensive 
      CPG experience in growing brands, and his strategic focus, together with 
      his substantial business knowledge, will drive the company forward. I 
      leave my position with great confidence in Jeff’s leadership to take the 
      Company to the next level.”
    

      Mr. Ansell most recently served for three years as Chief Executive 
      Officer and member of the Board of Directors of Pinnacle Foods Group, a 
      $2 billion company of iconic packaged foods brands. Prior to this, he 
      was a Corporate Officer at Procter & Gamble, where he worked for 25 
      years, with his last seven years at P&G as President of the Iams Pet 
      Care subsidiary.
    

      Mr. Ansell serves on the Board of Directors of SymphonyIRI Group, as 
      well as the Grocery Manufacturers Association (GMA). He is a graduate of 
      the Indiana University Kelley School of Business, where in 2010 he was 
      appointed to the Dean’s Council Advisory Board.

Someday, these gloves will be considered mediocre.
 Today, however, they lead the industry in hand protection and make the average work glove look like an old sock. Thanks to the innovators at Ansell®, Intercept™ Cut Resistance Technology delivers an unmatched balance of comfort, dexterity and cut protection—providing a clear benefit over cheap imports and knock-offs . It’s the kind of advancement that makes yesterday’s safety gear look outdated.

Ansell Limited is the new name of the Company formerly known as Pacific Dunlop Limited. The Companys name was changed in April 2002 as a result of a strategic repositioning of the Company to concentrate on its core business, protective products and services in a broad healthcare context, and following the disposition of a series of other business units that did not fit within the strategy. The new direction now being taken by the Company leverages the solid foundation provided by the Ansell Healthcare business that has been a major part of the parent companys portfolio of businesses since it was acquired in 1969

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
