Media & Technology, Micro Cap Insider




Neutra Corp (OTCMKTS:NTRR) continues to trade just over all-time lows of $0.0131 on moderate volume and continued interest from Investors.
NTRR has a history of highly explosive moves making several significant runs over the past 2 years in tandem with the industry. NTRR was initially incorporated to market and sell nutraceutical supplement products but switched to the pot sector when it heated up in 2014.
Neutra Corp (OTCMKTS:NTRR) bills itself as a healthy lifestyle company that specializes in the development and marketing of natural wellness solutions, including cannabis-related products. By providing a variety of new technologies designed to ensure safer, more reliable access to cannabis in approved markets, Neutra Corp. plans to compete alongside GW Pharmaceuticals Growlife Inc. and Medbox Inc. delivering technological advancements in the cultivation and processing of cannabis in approved markets.
Last year NTRR acquired vapor innovators Diamond Anvil Designs earlier this year in order to develop a lightweight, portable, smoke-free delivery system that will stand out from competing products in the marketplace. The new Diamond Anvil vapor pen features customizable power levels, multi-substance vaporization capacity and best-in-class durability, making it a unique and groundbreaking product in the fast-growing vaporization industry. Neutra Corp. ordered the first production run from the manufacturer in July.
“The demand for cannabis and cannabis-related products is growing every day. The Diamond Anvil Vapor Pen is only one of several game-changing products we have in the pipeline to capitalize on what is proving to be an unprecedented market opportunity.”
The Denver-based laboratory company signed a letter of intent this month with S2O2 to act as a third-party lab collecting weekly surface samples at the cultivation operations where the joint venture’s products are being tested. These surface samples will be tested for microbes, which the joint venture’s suite of products are designed to eliminate. The case study will also include biological and cannabinoid testing of cannabis flowers in order to validate the biological controls.

Back in April NTRR announced it and its joint venture partner, Surface to Air Solutions (S2O2), the companies are already receiving a great deal of interest from cannabis growers in the state. In response, each Friday in April, S2O2 will conduct educational information sessions on its suite of antimicrobial alternatives to pesticides, hosted by respected cultivation organization Denver Consulting Group.
Last month, S2O2 signed letter of intent with Denver Consulting Group to test and demonstrate the efficacy of its horticultural product suite at the company’s indoor growing operations in the state. “These open information sessions are the perfect way to spread the word on these products before the official testing cycle is complete,” said NTRR CEO Chris Brown. “We have been blown away by the response to these products’ potential for the cannabis industry. Growers are ready for real, effective alternatives to pesticides for indoor cultivation.”
On September 15 NTRR said it continues to accrue new cannabis clients for its cutting-edge suite of horticultural technologies, state revenues from the plant are rising fast due to swelling demand. The first two states to legalize cannabis for adult use have collectively brought in more than $200 million in taxes so far.
The strong market demand evident for cannabis is good news for NTRR as the company continues to offer new growing solutions to farmers in Colorado, Washington and elsewhere. Alongside joint venture partner Surface to Air Solutions (S2O2), NTRR is marketing indoor growing options designed to help eliminate the use of harsh chemicals in cannabis cultivation altogether, including a plant stimulant, an air-scrubber and a self-cleaning hard surface treatment.
This treatment has been carefully engineered to keep plants and surfaces clean and preventing the buildup of mold, powdery mildew, botrytis, and mites without the use of pesticides and fungicides. The products are already in use in growing facilities in the U.S. and Canada.

Currently trading at a $1.5 million market valuation NTRR has no assets, no revenues and rising short term debt. While the Company has some exciting projects in the Cannabis industry word is there is a 50 for 1 reverse stock split coming which could have a significant effect on trading. We will be updating on the stock as more details emerge so make sure you are subscribed to Microcapdaily so you know what’s going on with NTRR
