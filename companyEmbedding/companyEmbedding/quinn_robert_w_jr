Capital One® Secured Mastercard®


                                            I never had played in credit before, and someone suggested this card to me to build credit for the first time. I've been really satisfied for the most part. They report quickly and accurately, remind me when my bill is due, and the customer service has been kind and thorough....show more

Bluebird Prepaid Card


                                            Bluebird is okay, but the issue I have is not many establishments accept American Express. I went to a gas station and swiped at the pump and received an error. So I went inside and they told me that they do not accept the card and I was on "E". It's a good thing...show more

Academy Bank


                                            They cancelled my secured credit card without informing me.  Did not refund the money from secured card without me calling,. Guess they thought I might forget.  Will be closing all accounts with them today.  Worst customer service of any bank I've dealt with

                                            I have (had) been with Alfa for 23 years. Over the course of the last few years, my premiums kept going up. $20 here, $30 there - well, this last time it went up over $200 with the new renewal.

PenFed Credit Union


                                            HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! They do not work with you at all to satisfy the customer. Other credit unions help you ESPECIALLY if you have great credit. This CU doesn't tell you everything so verify everything with two other reps. Total Nightmare!

                                            Do you have to link your personal bank account to pay the fees for the card. How do you pay your bill monthly. I see other people comment about they took money out of there bank account. How did they get their bank information from.

I live on a fixed income. Its very difficult. My father and I are fairly comfortable, but due to the 40+ derogatory items on my credit report, which are all medically related. Lexington law, if you can afford their services, have done soo much for me. In only two months time, they removed 25+ items off my report. Unfortunately I'm unable to continue working with them, due to the roughly $100/mo fee, which is a bit too high for me.… read more

Who is taking it?  If you are just paying taxes and insurance no one can take it from you if you send a letter of intentions and pay what you can every month.  You might put the home up for a fast sale and with the money move into something affordable while paying the six thousand.
