(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Overview  The Company was formed on January 5, 2011 for the purpose of acquiring, through a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization, exchangeable share transaction or other similar business transaction, one or more operating businesses or assets. The Company consummated the acquisition of RMG on April 8, 2013 and on April 19, 2013 acquired Symon Holdings Corporation ("Symon"). Symon is considered to be the Company's predecessor corporation for accounting purposes.  As a result of its two acquisitions, the Company is a global provider of media applications and enterprise-class digital signage solutions. Through an extensive suite of products, including media services, proprietary software, software-embedded hardware, maintenance and creative content service, installation services, and third-party displays, the Company delivers complete end-to-end intelligent visual communication solutions to its clients. The Company is one of the largest integrated digital signage solution providers globally and conducts operations through its RMG Media Networks and its RMG Enterprise Solutions business units.  The RMG Media Networks business unit engages elusive audience segments with relevant content and advertising delivered through digital place-based networks. These networks include the RMG Airline Media Network. The RMG Airline Media Network is a U.S.-based network focused on selling advertising across airline digital media assets in executive clubs, on in-flight entertainment, or IFE, systems, on in-flight Wi-Fi portals and in private airport terminals. The network, which spans almost all major commercial passenger airlines in the United States, delivers advertising to an audience of affluent travelers and business decision makers in a captive and distraction-free video environment.  The RMG Enterprise Solutions business unit provides end-to-end digital signage applications to power intelligent visual communication implementations for critical contact center, supply chain, employee communications, hospitality, retail and other applications with a large concentration of customers in the financial services, telecommunications, manufacturing, healthcare, pharmaceutical, utility and transportation industries, and in federal, state and local governments. These solutions are relied upon by approximately 70% of the North American Fortune 100 companies and thousands of overall customers in locations worldwide. The installations of Enterprise Solutions deliver real-time intelligent visual content that enhance the ways in which organizations communicate with employees and customers. The solutions are designed to integrate seamlessly with a customer's IT infrastructure and data and security environments.  Revenue  The Company derives its revenue as follows:  ? Advertising  ? Product sales:  ? Licenses to use its proprietary software products; ? Proprietary software-embedded media players; ? Proprietary LED displays; and  ? Customer support services:  ? Product maintenance services; and  ? Professional installation and training services  Revenue is recognized as outlined in "Critical Accounting Policies - Revenue Recognition" below.  RMG Media Networks Revenues  The Company sells advertising through agencies and directly to a variety of customers under contracts ranging from one month to one year. Contracts usually specify the network placement, the expected number of impressions (determined by passenger or visitor counts), and the cost per thousand impressions ("CPM") over the contract period to arrive at a contract amount. The Company bills for these advertising services as required by the customer, but most frequently on a monthly basis following the delivery of the contracted ad insertions. Revenue is recognized at the end of the month in which fulfillment of the advertising orders occurred.  RMG Enterprise Solutions Revenues  The Company sells its Enterprise products and services through its global sales force and through a select group of resellers and business partners. In the United States, approximately 90% or more of its enterprise sales are generated solely by the Company's sales team, with 10% or less through resellers in 2013. In the United Kingdom, Western Europe, the Middle East and India, the situation is reversed, with around 85% of sales coming from the reseller channel. Overall, approximately 67% of the Company's global enterprise revenues are derived from direct sales, with the remaining 33% generated through indirect partner channels.  The Company has formal contracts with its resellers that set the terms and conditions under which the parties conduct business. The resellers purchase products and services from the Company, generally with agreed-upon discounts, and resell the products and services to their customers, who are the end-users of the products and services. The Company does not offer contractual rights of return other than under standard product warranties, and product returns from resellers have been insignificant to date. The Company sells directly to its resellers and recognizes revenue on sales to resellers upon delivery, consistent with its recognition policies. The Company bills resellers directly for the products and services they purchase. Software licenses and product warranties pass directly from the Company to the end-users.  Cost of Revenue  RMG Media Networks Revenues  The cost of revenue associated with RMG Media Networks revenues consists primarily of revenue sharing with the Company's airline and other business partners. Revenue sharing payments to airlines and other business partners are made on a monthly basis under either under minimum annual guarantees, or as a percentage of advertising revenues following collection from customers. The portion of revenue shared with partners ranges from 25% to 80% depending on the partner and the media asset. The Company makes minimum annual payments to three partners and revenue sharing payments to all other partners. The Company's partnership agreements have terms generally ranging from one to five years. Four of the Company's partnership agreements renew automatically unless terminated prior to renewal, and the remaining agreements have no obligation to renew.  RMG Enterprise Solutions Revenues  The cost of revenue associated with RMG Enterprise Solutions product sales consist primarily of the costs of media players, the costs of third-party flat screen displays and the operating costs of the Company's assembly and distribution center. The cost of revenue of professional services is the salary and related benefit costs of the Company's employees and the travel costs of personnel providing installation and training services. The cost of revenue of maintenance and content services consists of the salary and related benefit costs of personnel engaged in providing maintenance and content services and the annual costs associated with acquiring data from third-party content providers.  Operating Expenses  The Company's operating expenses are comprised of the following components:  ? Sales and marketing expenses include salaries and related benefit costs of sales personnel, sales commissions, travel by sales and sales support personnel, and marketing and advertising costs.  ? Professional fees paid to attorneys, accountants, consultants and other professionals in connection with the acquisitions of RMG and Symon.  ? Depreciation and amortization costs include depreciation of the Company's office furniture, fixtures and equipment and amortization of intangible assets.  Given the nature of the formation of the Company, its financial results are required to be reported on a basis that includes various groupings of the three companies (RMG Networks Holding Corporation, RMG and Symon), and for different time periods, both before and after the two acquisitions.  Results of Operations  Comparison of the period from April 20, 2013 to December 31, 2013 and the year ended January 31, 2013  As discussed above, the Company acquired RMG on April 8, 2013 and Symon on April 19, 2013. Prior to its acquisition, Symon had a January 31 fiscal year end. The financial statements for the period April 20, 2013 through December 31, 2013 include the results of operations of RMG Networks, RMG, and Symon (the "Successor Company") for 256 days. The financial statements for the year ended January 31, 2013 include only the results of operations of Symon (the "Predecessor Company") for the entire year. As a result, the financial results shown are not generally comparable on a meaningful basis.   Successor Predecessor Company Company April 20, 2013 through Year Ended December 31, January 31, Change 2013 2013 Dollars % Revenue $ 50,277,647 $ 42,528,391 $ 7,749,256 18.2 % Cost Of Revenue 29,685,596 18,441,521 11,244,075 61.0 % Gross Profit 20,592,051 24,086,870 (3,494,819 ) -14.5 % Operating Expenses - Sales and marketing 12,681,559 7,760,739 4,920,820 63.4 % General and administrative 12,871,283 7,313,398 5,557,885 76.0 % Research and development 2,623,791 2,103,078 520,713 24.8 % Acquisition expenses 2,095,250 380,000 1,715,250 451.4 % Depreciation and amortization 4,956,622 1,111,948 3,844,674 345.8 % Total Operating Expenses 35,228,505 18,669,163 16,559,342 88.7 % Operating Income (Loss) (14,636,454 ) 5,417,707 (20,054,161 ) -370.16 % Warrant liability income charge 1,960,211 - 1,960,211 - Interest expense and other - net (3,327,148 ) (66,467 ) (3,260,681 ) - Income (Loss) Before Income Taxes (16,003,391 ) 5,351,240 (21,354,631 ) -399.1 % Income Tax Expense (Benefit) (3,003,088 ) 1,860,190 (4,863,278 ) -261.4 % Net Income (Loss) $ (13,000,303 ) $ 3,491,050 $ (16,491,353 ) -472.4 %  Revenue  Revenue was $50,277,647 and $42,528,391 for the period April 20, 2013 through December 31, 2013 and the year ended January 31, 2013, respectively. This represents a $7,749,256 or 18.2%, increase. This difference in revenue is due to the fact that revenues for the period April 20 through December 31, 2013 include advertising revenues for the Successor Company, while revenues for the year ended January 31, 2013 include only the revenues of the Predecessor Company. Revenues for the period April 20 through December 31, 2013 have also been reduced by $4,399,479 to reflect the adjustment to market value of the Company's deferred revenue accounts at the acquisition date in accordance with US GAAP.  During the period April 20 through December 31, 2013 and the year ended January 31, 2013, the Company's revenues were derived as follows.   Successor Company Predecessor Company April 20, 2013 Year through ended December 31, January 31, 2013 2013 Revenue : Advertising $ 15,963,107 $ - Products 18,488,304 19,185,359 Maintenance and content services 7,537,024 17,065,483 Professional services 8,289,212 6,277,549 Total $ 50,277,647 $ 42,528,391  The fluctuations in the components of revenues between the two periods are due to the same reasons stated above with respect to total revenues. Specifically, the RMG Media Networks business unit was not included in operations for the year ended January 31, 2013, and, as a result, there was no advertising revenue. In addition, revenues for the period April 20 through December 31, 2013 are for the Successor Company for a 256 day period while revenues for the year ended January 31, 2013 are for the Predecessor Company for a 365 day period.  The following table reflects the Company's sales on a geographic basis.   Successor Company Predecessor Company April 20, 2013 through Year ended December 31, January 31, 2013 2013 North America $ 40,235,491 80.0 % $ 29,750,058 70.0 % EMEA 10,042,156 20.0 % 12,778,333 30.0 % Total $ 50,277,647 100.0 % $ 42,528,391 100.0 %  The increase in North America business for the period April 20 through December 31, 2013 was due to the inclusion of the RMG Media Networks advertising revenues which were almost exclusively generated in North America. The RMG Media Networks business unit was not included in operations for the year ended January 31, 2013.  We believe that a better basis for comparing the Company's financial results can be found in Note #14 to the Company's audited consolidated financial statements located elsewhere in this filing that provides unaudited "Pro-Forma" financial results for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012. These Pro-Forma financial results present the Company's results of operations assuming the acquisitions of Reach Media and Symon had occurred on January 1, 2012 and the Company had operated as a combined entity since that date. The financial results include the following entries required under GAAP purchase accounting guidelines:  ? Amortization expense includes amortization of the fair value of Intangible Assets that were acquired.  ? Revenues have been reduced based on the adjustment to market value of the Company's customer order backlog that existed at the acquisition date.  Operating expenses do not include:  ? Any acquisition related expenses.  ? The charge for impairment of goodwill and intangible assets in 2012.  The Pro-Forma financial results reflect revenues of $72,294,886 and $64,632,528 for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. These revenue totals include reductions in revenues of $577,749 and $4,684,396 in the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, resulting from the adjustment to market value of the Company's customers' order backlog in accordance with GAAP purchase accounting guidelines. Excluding the reductions, the Company's revenues were $3,555,711, or 5.1%, higher in 2013 than in 2012.  Differences in the composition of the Company's revenues for the two Pro-Forma periods are as follows:  ? Advertising revenues for the Company's Media Networks business unit totaled $23,217,226 and $21,635,113 for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. This is a $1,582,113, or 7.3%, increase.  ? Excluding the revenue reductions previously discussed, revenues generated by the Company's Enterprise Solutions business unit totaled $48,094,564 and $43,646,851 in 2013 and 2012, respectively. This represents a $4,447,713, or 10.2%, increase in revenues in 2013.  Cost of Revenue  Cost of revenue totaled $29,685,596 and $18,441,521 for the period April 20, 2013 through December 31, 2013 and for the year ended January 31, 2013, respectively. This $11,244,075, or 61%, increase in cost of revenue is directly attributable to the previous explanations given for the fluctuations in revenues, i.e., the cost of revenues are comprised of cost of revenue totals for different time periods and different groupings of companies.  The following table summarizes the composition of the Company's revenue and cost of revenue for the period April 20, 2013 through December 31, 2013 and the year ended January 31, 2013.   Successor Company Predecessor April 20 Company through Year ended Change December 31, January 31, 2013 % 2013 % Dollars % Revenue - Advertising $ 15,963,107 31.7 % $ - - $ 15,963,107 - Products 18,488,304 36.8 % 19,185,359 45.1 % (697,055 ) -3.6 % Maintenance and content services 7,537,024 15.0 % 17,065,483 40.1 % (9,528,459 ) -55.8 % Professional services 8,289,212 16.5 % 6,277,549 14.8 % 2,011,663 32.0 % Total 50,277,647 100.0 % 42,528,391 100.0 % 7,749,256 18.2 % Cost of Revenue - Advertising 10,718,458 36.1 % - - 10,718,458 - Products 11,974,491 40.4 % 11,581,070 62.8 % 393,421 3.4 % Maintenance and content services 1,759,866 5.9 % 2,507,840 13.6 % (747,974 ) -29.8 % Professional services 5,232,781 17.6 % 4,352,611 23.6 % 880,170 20.2 % Total $ 29,685,596 100.0 % $ 18,441,521 100.0 % 11,244,075 61.0 %  The fluctuations in the components of cost of revenues between the two periods are due to the same reasons stated above with respect to total revenues. Specifically, since the Media Networks business unit is not included in operations for the year ended January 31, 2013, there is no advertising revenue for that period and, as a result, no associated cost of advertising revenue.  The following table reflects the Company's gross margins for the period April 20 through December 31, 2013 and the year ended January 31, 2013:   Successor Company Predecessor Company April 20 through Year ended December 31, 2013 January 31, 2013 $ % $ % Advertising $ 5,244,649 32.9 % - - Products 6,513,813 35.2 % 7,604,289 39.6 % Maintenance and content services 5,777,158 76.7 % 14,557,643 85.3 % Professional services 3,056,431 36.9 % 1,924,938 30.7 % Total 20,592,051 41.0 % 24,086,870 56.6 %  The Company's overall gross margin for the period April 20 through December 31, 2013 decreased to 41.0% from 56.6% for the year ended January 31, 2013. The lower gross margin was primarily attributable to the following:  ? Revenues for the period April 20 through December 31, 2013 have been reduced by $4,399,479 to reflect the amortization of the Company's customer order backlog from the date of acquisition in accordance with US GAAP.  ? Advertising revenue, which comprised 31.7% of total revenues for the period April 20 through December 31, 2013, generates a lower gross margin than the average gross margin for the Company's other products and services. As previously noted, there was no advertising revenue in the year ended January 31, 2013.  ? The Company also had a lower gross margin on product sales in the period ended December 31, 2013 because of sales mix.  Operating Expenses  Operating expenses totaled $35,228,505 and $18,669,163 for the period April 20 through December 31, 2013 and the year ended January 31, 2013, respectively. This $16,559,342, or 88.7%, increase in operating expenses is also directly attributable to the previous explanations given for the fluctuations in revenues and cost of revenues, i.e., the operating expenses are comprised of operating expense totals for different time periods and different groupings of companies.  In addition, during the period April 20 through December 31, 2013 the Company incurred acquisition expenses of $2,095,250 and amortization expense of $4,368,000 related to the intangible assets recorded as a result of the acquisitions of RMG and Symon in accordance with GAAP purchase accounting guidelines.  A comparison of operating expenses shown in the Pro-Forma financial results reflects that pro-forma operating expenses totaled $44,678,417 and $34,148,728 for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. As previously discussed, operating expenses do not include any acquisition related expense or the charge for impairment of intangible assets and goodwill in 2012. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to implementing the Company's multiple new sales growth initiatives. These initiatives include additional sales and sales support personnel and new marketing programs, materials and personnel. In addition, the Company incurred additional general and administrative expenses related to expanding its infrastructure, both personnel and systems, and various public company expenses.  Warrant Liability Expense  The Company calculates its warrant liability based on the quoted market value of its outstanding warrants. The warrant liability income credit for the period April 20 through December 31, 2013 of $1,960,211 represents the decrease in the Company's warrant liability during that period. The financial results for 2012 include only the results of Symon, which had no outstanding warrants.  Interest and other - Net  Interest expense and other - net for the period April 20 through December 31, 2013 increased by $3,260,681 compared to the year ended January 31, 2013, primarily due to the following items:  ? Interest expense of $2,063,997 related to the Company's borrowings that were used finance the acquisition of Symon.  ? Loan origination fees of $876,774.  ? Costs of $263,398 incurred in connection with the refinancing of the Company's debt.  The financial results shown for the year ended January 31, 2013 include only the Predecessor Company which had no outstanding debt.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  The Company's primary source of liquidity prior to acquiring RMG and Symon had been the cash generated from its initial public offering. Historically, Symon has generated cash from the sales of its products and services to its global customers. In addition, both RMG and Symon had realized cash through debt agreements with lenders.  In April 2013, the Company entered into two debt agreements whereby it received $34,000,000 of cash. These funds were used to finance the acquisition of Symon.  In August 2013, the Company completed a public offering of 5,365,000 shares of its common stock at a public offering price of $8.00 per share, minus the underwriters' discount of $0.56 per share. The Company received net proceeds of approximately $39.1 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by the Company. The Company used substantially all of the net proceeds of the offering to prepay a portion of its outstanding senior indebtedness.  The Company has entered into revenue sharing agreements with certain customers that require the Company to make minimum revenue sharing payments of $7,842,448 in 2014, $8,619,842 in 2015, and $6,000,000 in 2016.  At December 31, 2013, the Company's cash and cash equivalents balance was $8,235,566. This includes cash and cash equivalents of $1,696,475 held in bank accounts of its subsidiaries located outside the United States. The Company currently plans to use this cash to fund its ongoing foreign operations. If the Company were to repatriate the cash held by its subsidiary located outside the United States, it may incur tax liabilities.  Management feels that the Company has an adequate amount of cash to operate the Company for at least twelve months from December 31, 2013. Despite our present liquidity position, however, if we fail to achieve the level of revenues that we forecast, including as a result of an extended downturn or lower than expected demand for our products and services, we could generate less cash flow than we have budgeted. Under those circumstances, our cash on hand and funds from operations may not be sufficient to fund our operations or pursue strategic transactions, and we may be required to seek alternative sources of financing. There is no assurance, however, that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms, or at all.  At December 31, 2013 the Company had outstanding debt of $8,000,000. This debt represents the remaining balance of the borrowings the Company made in connection with the acquisition of Symon as discussed above and the additional funds borrowed when the Company refinanced its debt on November 14, 2013.  The Company has generated and used cash as follows:   Successor Predecessor Company Company April 20, 2013 through December 31, Year Ended January 31, 2013 2013 . . .

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes that appear elsewhere in this report and in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 (the "2016 Form 10-K"). In addition to historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. These forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology, including the words "believes," "estimates," "anticipates," "expects," "intends," "plans," "may," "will," "potential," "projects," "predicts," "continue," or "should," or, in each case, their negative or other variations or comparable terminology. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this report, particularly in "Risk Factors" in Item 1A of Part II.  Overview  The Company was formed on January 5, 2011, for the purpose of acquiring, through a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization, exchangeable share transaction or other similar business transaction, one or more operating businesses or assets. The Company consummated the acquisition of RMG Networks Holding, Inc., f/k/a Reach Media Group Holdings, Inc. on April 8, 2013, and on April 19, 2013, acquired RMG Enterprise Solutions Holdings Corporation, f/k/a Symon Holdings Corporation ("Symon"). Symon is considered to be the Company's predecessor corporation for accounting purposes.  The Company is one of the largest integrated digital signage solution providers, offering enterprise-class digital signage solutions that are relied upon by a majority of Fortune 100 companies and thousands of overall customers in locations worldwide. Through an extensive suite of products that include proprietary software, software-embedded hardware, maintenance and creative content service, installation services, and third-party displays, the Company delivers complete end-to-end intelligent visual communication solutions to its clients for critical contact center, supply chain, internal communications, hospitality, retail and other applications with a large concentration of customers in the financial services, telecommunications, manufacturing, healthcare, pharmaceutical, utility and transportation industries, and in federal, state and local governments. Our installations deliver real-time intelligent visual content that enhances the ways in which organizations communicate with employees and customers to drive productivity and engagement. The solutions are designed to integrate seamlessly with a customer's IT infrastructure, data and security environments. The Company conducts operations through its RMG Enterprise Solutions business unit.  Revenue  The Company derives its revenue as follows from three primary sources:  1. Product sales:  � Licenses to use its proprietary software products;  � Proprietary software-embedded media players; and  � Third-party flat screen displays and other third-party hardware.  2. Customer support services:  � Product maintenance services; and  � Subscription-based content services.  3. Professional services:  � Professional installation services;  � Custom, "innovative" creative services; and  � Training services.  Revenue is recognized as outlined in "Critical Accounting Policies - Revenue Recognition" below. The Company sells its solutions through its global sales force and through a select group of resellers and business partners. In North America,  Table of Contents  the Company's sales team generated approximately 91% and 94% of its annual sales in the first quarters of 2017 and 2016, respectively, while 9% and 6% of its sales were generated through resellers in the first quarters of 2017 and 2016, respectively. Outside the United States, approximately 70% and 73% of first quarter sales come from the reseller channel in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Overall, approximately 70% and 67% of the Company's global enterprise sales are derived from direct sales in the first quarters of 2017 and 2016, respectively, with the remaining 30% and 33% generated through indirect partner channels in the first quarters of 2017 and 2016, respectively.  The Company has formal contracts with its resellers that set the terms and conditions under which the parties conduct business. The resellers purchase products and services from the Company, generally with agreed-upon discounts, and resell the products and services to their customers, who are the end-users of the products and services. The Company does not offer contractual rights of return other than under standard product warranties, and product returns from resellers have been insignificant to date. The Company sells directly to its resellers and recognizes revenue on sales to resellers upon delivery, consistent with its recognition policies. The Company bills resellers directly for the products and services they purchase. Software licenses and product warranties pass directly from the Company to the end-users.  Cost of Revenue  The cost of revenue associated with product sales consist primarily of the costs of media players, the costs of third-party flat screen displays and the operating costs of the Company's assembly and distribution operations. The cost of revenue associated with professional services consists of the salary and related benefit costs and the travel costs of the Company's employees providing installation and training services as well as on-site installation costs from third-party providers. The cost of revenue associated with maintenance and content services consists of the salary and related benefit costs of the Company's employees engaged in providing customer support and content services and the annual costs associated with acquiring data from third-party content providers.  Operating Expenses  The Company's operating expenses are comprised of the following components:  � Sales and marketing expenses include salary and related benefit costs of sales personnel, sales commissions, travel by sales and sales support personnel, and marketing and advertising costs.  � Research and development ("R&D") costs consist of salary and related benefit costs of R&D personnel and expenditures to outside third-party contractors. To date, all R&D expenses are expensed as incurred.  � General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salary and related benefit costs of executives, accounting, finance, administrative, and IT personnel. Also included in this category are other corporate expenses such as rent, utilities, insurance, professional service fees, office expenses, travel by general and administrative personnel and meeting expenses.  � Depreciation and amortization expenses include depreciation of the Company's office furniture, fixtures and equipment and amortization of intangible assets.  Trends in Operating Results  The Company is a leading global provider of enterprise-class digital signage solutions and as such, its operations are subject to factors that generally affect corporate budgets, including but not limited to general economic conditions, employment levels, business conditions, and global uncertainty.  Since the arrival of a new chief executive officer in July 2014, the Company has been executing a multi-year strategic turnaround plan that emphasized delivering new, innovative products and solutions, diversifying into select industry verticals, improving the effectiveness and productivity of its sales and marketing efforts, and implementing a cost rationalization effort. During late 2014, the Company introduced a number of new products and enhancements, increased its focus on solution areas that aligned with its data-intensive core competencies, and lowered operating costs by reducing headcount, closing underperforming geographies, and refocusing its marketing initiatives. During 2015, the Company continued to make progress on its multi-year strategic turnaround plan by strengthening the executive leadership team,  Table of Contents  including hiring a new chief financial officer and North American sales leader, enhancing the breadth and depth of its suite of product offerings, continuing its targeted solution area focus such as supply chain and internal communications, improving the effectiveness and productivity of its sales organization, significantly reducing its cost structure, and divesting its non-core Media business. The Company continued executing its strategic plan in 2016 and 2017, as it further enhanced its product offerings and solution portfolio with a product development roadmap that worked toward addressing growing mobile demand and important data and analytics capabilities. The Company also further strengthened its management team with the addition of a new chief technical officer and global chief marketing and creative officer. In addition, the Company continued its solution area strategy to seek to further penetrate the contact center space, as well as expand into the supply chain and internal communications spaces. The Company also continued its sales efficiency initiative by focusing on selling larger deals and expanding its third-party sales channels in North America to create incremental revenues opportunities without commensurate selling cost increases. Finally, the Company maintained a reduced level of operating costs to support its effort to achieve long-term sustainable profitability.  Revenues  As a result of various renewal initiatives, maintenance revenues began to stabilize starting in late 2015, and increased on a year-over-year basis in 2016, after the Company had seen declines in 2014, primarily from the decision to proactively "end-of-life" maintenance services on certain products in 2014. In the first quarter of 2017, the Company was impacted by lower renewals. Since the first quarter of 2015, professional services revenue has varied greatly based on the open project backlog at designated points in time. Going forward, we expect that professional services revenues will be largely dependent on the Company's success in signing larger deals with significant professional services components. Also in 2016, the Company replaced the managing director leading its Europe and South East Asia markets and added new sales headcount to seek to improve sales in those regions and in 2017 has begun to see the positive results of these changes. Given the uncertainty in the United Kingdom and Europe as a result of Brexit, revenue trends in that region still remain uncertain. In addition, the macro-economic impact of continuing low oil prices in the Middle East will likely continue to have an impact on certain customers electing to delay committed projects until oil prices begin to rise again.  Expenses  Since 2014, the Company has significantly reduced its overall cost structure as a result of headcount reductions across the organization, closing underperforming geographies, divesting its non-core Media business, reducing ineffective marketing initiatives, and developing more efficient product distribution operations. Beginning in 2017, the Company has begun investing in areas that it believes have a strong return potential such as research and development and sales and marketing.  Results of Operations  Comparison of the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016  The following table summarizes the results of operations of the Company for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016.

Revenues derived from product sales for the three months ended March 31, 2017 remained relatively flat from the same period of 2016.  Revenues derived from maintenance and content service contracts for the three months ended March 31, 2017 decreased by $0.2 million, or 5.9%, as compared to the same period in 2016, primarily due to lower renewals.  Revenues derived from professional service is impacted by the sales mix and professional services employee utilization in any given quarter. In the three months ended March 31, 2017, professional services revenues increased by $0.5 million, or 33.9%, as compared to the same period in 2016, primarily driven by improved utilization rates and a favorable sales mix.  The following table sets forth the Company's revenue on a geographic basis for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016.   (in thousands) Three Months Ended March 31, Region 2017 2016 North America $ 5,869 65.4 % $ 5,352 61.8 % International: United Kingdom 1,516 17.0 % 1,258 14.5 % Middle East 1,221 13.6 % 1,163 13.4 % Europe 300 3.3 % 541 6.2 % Other 63 0.7 % 353 4.1 % Total International 3,100 34.6 % 3,315 38.2 % Total $ 8,969 100.0 % $ 8,667 100.0 %  Revenue growth in the North American region in the first quarter of 2017 resulted primarily from an increase in professional services revenue, due to improved utilization rates and a favorable sales mix. United Kingdom revenues also increased in the first quarter of 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016 due to both higher product sales and professional services revenues, slightly offset by lower maintenance revenues. Revenues in the Europe region decreased in the first quarter of 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016, due to the lower foreign currency exchange rate in 2017 as compared to the first quarter of 2016. Excluding the foreign currency impact, revenues in the first quarter of 2017 in Europe were slightly lower as compared to the same period in 2016. Revenues in the Middle East region increased slightly in the first quarter of 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016, driven primarily by increased product sales. Revenues in the Other region decreased during the first quarter of 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016, due primarily to decreased product sales resulting from a large sale made during the first quarter of 2016.  Cost of Revenue  Cost of revenue totaled $4.0 million and $3.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. This $0.4 million, or 10.5%, increase in cost of revenue was primarily attributable to an unfavorable sales mix with lower software revenues and higher hardware and third-party services revenues that have lower margins. As a result, for the three  Table of Contents  months ended March 31, 2017, the gross margin of 55.1% was in-line with expectations. For the same period in 2016, gross margin was 58.0%, due to a favorable sales mix resulting from a larger amount of software sales.  Operating Expenses  Operating expenses totaled $6.4 million and $6.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. This $0.2 million, or 2.6% decrease in operating expenses is due to the Company's continued efforts to manage expenses in line with revenues, while strategically investing in certain areas of the business, such as sales and marketing and R&D. Specifically, we note the following items:  � Sales and marketing expenses increased $0.3 million in the three months ended March 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016, due to planned investments in sales and marketing, such as incremental headcount, additional partnership expenses and increased sales-related travel expenses.  � General and administrative expenses decreased by $0.4 million in the three months ended March 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016, primarily due to lower professional accounting and legal fees, and lower compensation costs resulting from reduced headcount.  Warrant Liability  The Company calculates its warrant liability based on the quoted market value of its outstanding warrants. The gain on change in warrant liability for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was $0.2 million. There was no change in the warrant liability for the three months ended March 31, 2016. A gain on change in warrant liability represents a decrease in the amount of the Company's warrant liability during that quarter.  Interest and other - Net  Interest (expense) and other income - net for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 was $(25) thousand and $254 thousand, respectively, a $279 thousand increase in expense. During the three months ended March 31, 2017, the stabilization of the British pound sterling against the U.S. dollar led to a slight foreign currency loss in other expense. During the three months ended March 31, 2016, other income was driven by a foreign currency gain resulting from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the British pound sterling, offset by interest expense.  Income Tax Expense  There was no income tax expense for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016. The Company had book net losses in the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 with a U.S. full valuation allowance against the resulting deferred tax asset at March 31, 2017 and 2016.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  The Company has a history of operating losses and negative cash flow, including the Media business which continued to generate losses until its divestiture on July 1, 2015. As such, the Company took several steps in 2015 and 2016 to reduce its operating costs and in 2017, continues to closely monitor its cash projections and evaluate its operating structure for opportunities to reduce operating costs. In order to ensure the Company had adequate working capital, effective November 2, 2015, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries (collectively, the "Borrowers") entered into a loan and security agreement (the "Loan Agreement") with Silicon Valley Bank (the "Bank"), pursuant to which the Bank agreed to make a revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Facility") available to the Borrowers in the principal amount of up to $7.5 million. The Revolving Facility has an effective date (the "Effective Date") of October 13, 2015, and matures on October 13, 2017. Availability under the Revolving Facility is tied to a borrowing base formula. Interest on advances under the Revolving Facility (the "Advances") will accrue on the unpaid principal balance of such Advances at a floating per annum rate equal to either 1.75% above the prime rate or 2.75% above the prime rate, depending on whether certain conditions are satisfied. During an event of default, the rate of interest would increase to 5% above the otherwise applicable rate, until such event of default is cured or waived. All accrued and unpaid interest is payable monthly on the last calendar day of each month.  On December 29, 2016, the Company completed a rights offering to existing stockholders of record at November 29, 2016 as well as the related sale of shares to existing stockholders pursuant to a standby purchase agreement. Pursuant to the  Table of Contents  rights offering and the related private placement, the Company issued an aggregate of 7,741,908 shares of common stock at a price of $0.62 per share for gross proceeds of approximately $4.8 million. Offset by $0.4 million in transaction expenses, the rights offering resulted in $4.4 million of net cash proceeds to be used for general working capital purposes.  At March 31, 2017, the Company had no borrowings and $4.3 million in unused availability under the Revolving Facility. At March 31, 2017, the Company's cash and cash equivalents balance was $2.0 million. This includes cash and cash equivalents of $0.8 million held in bank accounts of its subsidiaries located outside the United States. The Company currently plans to use this cash to fund its ongoing foreign operations. If the Company were to repatriate the cash held by its subsidiary located outside the United States, it may incur tax liabilities.  The Company believes that the combination of cash and availability under its Revolving Facility provide adequate cash to operate the Company through at least the next twelve months.  The Company has generated and used cash as follows:   (in thousands) Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 2016 Operating cash flow $ (1,817) $ (580) Investing cash flow (52) (19) Financing cash flow (1,274) 700 Total $ (3,143) $ 101  Operating Activities  The decrease in cash from operating activities of $1.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 is primarily due to the Company's net loss of $1.3 million. The net loss is offset by the following non-cash items:  � Non-cash expense for depreciation and amortization of $0.8 million  � Non-cash stock-based compensation of $0.1 million  � Gain on change in warrant liability of $0.2 million  � Non-cash amortization of loan origination fees of $20 thousand  � Non-cash directors' fees of $31 thousand  � Inventory reserve adjustment for obsolescence of $15 thousand  � Allowance for doubtful accounts adjustment of $6 thousand  In addition, the following are the principal changes in assets and liabilities that affected cash from operating activities during the three months ended March 31, 2017:  � Accounts receivable decreased by $0.1 million due to improved collections as compared to the same period last year  � Inventory decreased by $0.2 million, due to improved demand forecasting and inventory management  � Other current assets increased by $51 thousand as prepaid expenses were added at a higher rate than expensed  � Accounts payable decreased by $1.3 million, primarily due to increased payments of obligations and lower operating expenses  � Accrued liabilities decreased by $1.0 million, primarily due to increased payments of obligations and lower operating expenses  � Deferred revenue increased by $0.8 million, primarily due to maintenance revenues exceeding the value of new and renewal maintenance contracts values  Investing Activities  The decrease in cash from investing activities of $52 thousand during the three months ended March 31, 2017 was due to expenditures for property and equipment.  Table of Contents  Financing Activities  The increase in cash used in financing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2017 was due to $1.3 million of payments on the Revolving Facility.  Critical Accounting Policies  The Company's significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 of the Company's unaudited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this filing. The Company's consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Certain accounting policies involve significant judgments, assumptions, and estimates by management that could have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  May 04, 2017  (c) 1995-2017 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved

Benefits of a Visual External Communications Solution
RMG delivers high-impact visuals that communicate your brand and sets your clientele at ease while navigating through the buyer’s journey or through your facility. With a variety of attention-grabbing enterprise solutions fit for use in lobbies, store fronts, or in any customer-facing environment, trust RMG for intelligent visual communications.
 
 
 





Capture Attention
Draw greater attention with dynamic and compelling visual messages designed to smartly promote and increase incremental sales.

 
 
 




Boost Your Brand
Make a lasting impression on prospective clients with professionally designed interactive visuals that communicate your brand in a compelling and memorable way.

 
 
 




Make Messages More Engaging
Encourage customers to spend more time in your store with engaging and immersive visual experiences that help guide customers through their buyer’s journey.

 
 
 
 





Influence Decisions
Influence purchasing decisions with real-time, POS system reports and inventory databases to send the right message to customers at the right time.

 
 
 




Improve Experience
Help visitors navigate your facility with virtual concierge services and wayfinding kiosks that also broadcast consistent communications andbrand messaging.

 
 
 




Increase Revenue
Intelligently monitor and automatically change promotions based on inventory, weather, or time of day to increase revenue.

 
 
 
 
 





Capture Attention


High-resolution imagery and video displayed on large screens (lobbies, walkways, large meeting rooms) and small screens (waiting rooms, meeting rooms) are almost irresistible in today’s visually oriented culture. Digital signs in hotels encourages guest to leave their room and visit revenue-generating parts of the facility such as the hotel restaurant and spa, building excitement about the amenities and keeping guests on the property.
–







 



Digital Signage Displays Come Alive
Smart signs display brilliant visuals, helping shoppers imagine themselves in those new clothes that have just gone sale or giving guests the sense of actually stepping into the hotel spa. In a corporate setting, vivid video presentations of a company’s products or community activities create a favorable and memorable impression of your business to visitors and guests.
 
 
 
 






As a customer or visitor to a new facility, it can be frustrating to not know where to go or who to ask for help. Digital signage, such as wayfinding displays or a virtual concierge, has the advantage of capturing attention more effectively than static maps or displays and can even be made into an interactive experience with the use of touchscreens and other interactive technologies. Any large or complex facility can give its guests a more positive experience by making it easier for them to get where they need to go without stress.

“At Principal Hayley, it became apparent that there was growing requirement for digital signage across our hotels and conference venues. After evaluating a number of digital signage vendors, RMG really stood out to us as‘best of breed”

Strengthen Your Brand
All of the benefits of digital signage — capturing attention, building engagement, improving the onsite experience — combine to strengthen your brand and make your message more powerful. Using a digital medium gives a perception to visitors that a facility is sophisticated, up-to-date with technology, and concerned about its customers’ needs. These positive brand impressions help to retain customers. It also inspires guests to refer others and to write positive reviews on social media and other online platforms. Also, it’s important to keep in mind that the absence of digital signage may well produce the opposite effect — relying on old-fashioned posters, billboards, and other static print media may convey a brand is out of date and not keeping up
with technology.
 
 
 
 





Intelligent digital signage provides an immediate and powerful impact on incremental sales by being positioned at strategic points within a facility and by communicating special offers in a powerful way at those locations. Retailers can further customize specials by using interactive displays to fashion offers around the shopper’s buying history or product preferences. Businesses, hotels, clinics and restaurants can similarly use digital displays to deliver hard-hitting advertising or marketing information to generate immediate sales, future sales or highly qualified sales leads.

History[edit]
Reach Media Group was founded in 2006 as Danoo and got financial backing from Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, DAG Ventures, National CineMedia and Tennenbaum Capital Partners. In July 2009, Danoo acquired IdeaCast.[2] In August 2009, the company renamed itself RMG Networks[3] and appointed Garry McGuire to take over as CEO from Aileen Lee.[4]
In May 2012, RMG sold its digital signage network targeting cafes, small restaurants and juice bars for an undisclosed sum to San Francisco-based Brite Media.
In April 2013, the company acquired Symon Communications, a digital signage company founded in 1980, for $45.5 million and moved its headquarters from San Francisco to the Dallas metropolitan area where Symon Communications was located.[5] The company went public via a reverse merger with SCG Financial Acquisition Corp. in April 2013.[6][7]
