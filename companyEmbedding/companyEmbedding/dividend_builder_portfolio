How to Build a Dividend Portfolio



Simply Safe Dividends 


			2017-05-17T02:52:01+00:00		
June 28th, 2016|Dividend Investing|  Print Article

I previously wrote an article about measuring and managing dividend stocks, but have you ever wondered how to build a dividend portfolio in the first place?
 
Like most things with investing, everyone has their own opinion about how to construct a portfolio. Most of the debate usually centers on how many holdings an investor should own and how their holdings should be diversified.
 
While there is no right or wrong answer, I believe there are general guidelines that investors should remain aware of to avoid taking unnecessary risk with their dividend portfolios – especially for those living off dividends in retirement.
 
In this article, I will review the key factors that influence a portfolio’s risk profile. Let’s start with a basic understanding of why a portfolio is important in the first place.
 
A Portfolio Diversifies Risk
Why should investors build a dividend portfolio instead of investing completely in one or two companies that they really like?
 
For one thing, investing involves a tremendous amount of randomness and luck. Even the “best” professionals are wrong at least 40% of the time.
 
If we invested all of our cash into a single company, even one with seemingly “low” risk, we will likely generate returns that are significantly different than the market’s performance – for better or worse.
 
Many investors do not have the stomach for this level of volatility, especially since there are a number of unexpected events that could occur to put your capital at risk of being permanently lost.
 
Remember Enron? What about Lehman Brothers? Going “all-in” on any one company can have disastrous consequences.
 
On the other end of the spectrum, suppose you bought shares of every stock in the market. For every company in your portfolio that experienced bad news, you would likely own just as many businesses experiencing unexpectedly good news.
 
In other words, you would no longer be dependent on any single stock to drive your investment returns and dividend income. Your portfolio could weather a few unanticipated storms because it was diversified across a number of different companies.
 
So long as our country continues to survive and advance, there would be virtually no chance of your portfolio experiencing a permanent loss of capital – the market has historically appreciated over long periods of time and will likely continue to do so.
 
It’s obviously impractical for an individual investor to buy shares of every company in the market without the use of exchange traded funds (ETFs), but you can understand the advantages of owning more than just a couple of companies.
 
Properly constructed portfolios can help us diversify away risk and get closer to our objectives. Building a dividend portfolio starts with an understanding of the main risk factors that influence a portfolio’s returns and volatility.
 
Key Risk Factors to Consider
In my opinion, the four most important factors that will influence the volatility of your portfolio’s return relative to the market’s return are: (1) the number of holdings; (2) the correlation between holdings; (3) the amount of financial leverage each holding has; and (4) the market cap size of each holding.
 
Each of these risk factors can significantly impact a portfolio’s performance, especially during turbulent markets.
 
Investors are often unaware that they are making a factor bet with their portfolios until it works against them.
 
For example, suppose half of your portfolio was invested in small cap energy stocks with high financial leverage.
 
Until late 2014, your portfolio probably enjoyed excellent returns and low volatility as oil prices and production increased.
 
It’s only human nature to attribute good results to our own skill rather than luck. However, this portfolio was nothing more than a factor bet on energy and favorable credit markets.
 
Now that the price of oil has collapsed and credit is less available to small energy firms, this portfolio would have been walloped.
 
The point of building a portfolio is to diversify away these factor bets, which we cannot control or forecast, and focus our returns on the performance of individual companies.
 
Risk Factor 1: How Many Stocks Should I Own?
Many of the best investment professionals run concentrated portfolios (e.g. top 10 stocks = 65%+ of the portfolio’s value). They invest with conviction behind their best ideas.
 
For example, Warren Buffett’s dividend portfolio has several holdings that exceed 10% of his portfolio’s overall value.
 
As an individual investor, I certainly do not have Warren Buffett’s resources, connections, and insights needed to responsibly run a concentrated portfolio.
 
For that reason, I prefer to spread my bets over a reasonable range of different stocks to avoid shooting myself in the foot with a concentrated bet that turns sour.
 
The fewer stocks you own, the greater your portfolio can deviate from the market’s return. So how many dividend-paying stocks should you own to maximize the benefits of diversification? Plenty of academic studies have tried answering this question over the last 50 years.
 
The American Association of Individual Investors (“AAII”) wrote an article citing that “holding a single stock rather than a perfectly diversified portfolio increases annual volatility by roughly 30%…Thus, the single-stock investor will experience annual returns that average a whopping 35% above or below the market – with some years closer to the market and some years further from the market.”
 
The AAII study went on to state that, as a rule of thumb, diversifiable risk will be reduced by the following amounts:

Holding 25 stocks reduces diversifiable risk by about 80%
Holding 100 stocks reduces diversifiable risk by about 90%
Holding 400 stocks reduces diversifiable risk by about 95%

A more recent study was released in late 2014 in a paper titled, “Equity Portfolio Diversification: How Many Stocks are Enough? Evidence from Five Developed Markets.”
 
Notable findings were that a greater number of stocks are needed to diversify risk during periods when markets are in financial distress – correlations between stocks are often the highest in this type of environment.
 
Within the U.S., the researchers concluded that, to be confident of reducing 90% of the diversifiable risk 90% of the time, the number of stocks needed on average is about 55. In times of distress, however, it can increase to more than 110 stocks.
 
From these two studies alone, it would seem responsible to own between 25 and 100 stocks. However, in addition to the math behind diversification, investors should also consider factors unique to their personal financial situation – the size of their portfolio, willingness to devote time to research, trading costs, and more.
 
The smaller your portfolio, the greater the impact trading costs will have on total returns. Investors with small accounts should consider buying dividend ETFs instead of individual stocks to save trading costs and achieve diversification.
 
The more positions you own, the less research time you will have to devote to knowing your companies really well.
 
While it is highly subjective, I believe the relationships between portfolio value and the number of holdings in the table below provide a reasonable balance between the need for diversification, a desire to keep trading costs low, and a limited amount of research time to devote to maintaining a portfolio.

At the end of the day, each investor has a unique opinion on how much diversification is “enough” and how much risk they are willing to take.
 
Once I have settled on an ideal number of holdings to own, I prefer to equally weight my positions. It is very difficult to know which stocks will go on to be the best long-term performers.
 
Risk Factor 2: Industry Diversification
While owning a greater number of stocks can provide diversification benefits, many investors still end up with poorly diversified portfolios because they are drawn to particular types of stocks (e.g. consumer products with familiar brands) or investing “rules” (e.g. only buy stocks with price-to-earnings ratios less than 12x).
 
Unfortunately, owning a number of stocks that have similar characteristics does not provide adequate diversification.
 
This is because stocks from similar industries are often sensitive to the same factors and move together in the market (i.e. they are highly correlated).
 
If a shared factor such as interest rates or the price of oil becomes unfavorable, your portfolio could significantly underperform the market.
 
Picking stocks from different sectors and industries helps diversify away this risk because when some sectors are struggling, others are likely doing well.
 
The pie chart below shows the sector breakdown of the S&P 500. You can see that only one sector accounts for more than 20% of the overall market (Information Technology).
 
My personal preference is to invest no more than 25% of my portfolio into any single sector, and I try to own blue-chip dividend stocks with little overlap in their actual operations.
 
Source: S&P
 
Sector diversification is important because you never know which areas of the market could come in or out of favor.
 
As seen below, a portfolio invested completely in energy stocks would have returned -4% over the last five years, underperforming the S&P 500 by 72%.
 
On the other hand, a portfolio consisting completely of healthcare stocks would have gained 110%, beating the market by 42%.
 
No one knows which sectors will be the best and worst performers over the next five years, which is why maintaining a reasonable level of diversification is important.
 
Source: Simply Safe Dividends
 
Importantly, sector diversification should not come at the expense of violating valuation principles or extending outside of your circle of competence.
 
Just because consumer staples accounts for 10.1% of the S&P 500 doesn’t mean you must buy a stock in that sector if you cannot find one that is attractively priced.
 
Equally important, you should not diversify into a sector or industry that is outside of your comfort zone.
 
For example, many conservative dividend investors remain underweight the technology sector because its pace of change is too fast. Trying to predict which tech companies will still be relevant in five years can be challenging.
 
The takeaway is that you should be intentional with your diversification across sectors and business models, but you don’t need to play everywhere. Stick to areas of the market you are comfortable with and use common sense as you look to diversify.

Risk Factor 3: Financial Leverage
Financial leverage magnifies returns received by equity holders and is one of the key factors to be aware of when searching for safe stocks. The more debt a company has, the more the price of the stock can fluctuate depending on business conditions.
 
As such, companies with large debt loads and more cyclical business models usually have more volatile stocks.
 
If interest rates ever rise and credit conditions start to tighten, some of the lower quality, highly levered firms could run into trouble.
 
When constructing a portfolio, it’s important to be aware of the overall credit quality of your holdings.
 
For most types of businesses, I prefer to see a debt to capital ratio of no more than 50%, healthy free cash flow generation, and strong coverage ratios (e.g. net debt / EBIT of less than 5x). These are some of the most important financial ratios to understand.
 
Risk Factor 4: Size Matters
Historically speaking, companies with small market caps have exhibited greater stock price volatility than large cap stocks.
 
The bigger the company, the more buyers and sells there are to trade shares back and forth. The availability of buyers and sellers is known as liquidity.
 
When you enter an order to buy or sell shares of Coca-Cola, someone has to be on the other side of the trade and agree to your asking price for the trade to execute.
 
Small cap companies (i.e. stocks with market caps under $2 billion) can have much less liquidity compared to large cap companies.
 
With fewer buyers and sellers, it is not always as easy to move in and out of positions, and the spread between the price that a seller is asking for and the price a buyer is willing to pay can become very wide.
 
With less trading liquidity, small cap stocks can significantly outperform or underperform large cap stocks in different market environments.
 
Small cap stocks are also more volatile because their businesses are often less diversified and established than large caps.
 
As seen below, the Russell 2000, which contains mostly small cap stocks, exhibited significantly greater volatility (standard deviation) over the past decade than the Dow Jones and S&P 500.
 
Expect your portfolio to also demonstrate greater volatility if it is mostly composed of small cap stocks.

Price Volatility and Time Horizon
In addition to the four risk factors mentioned above, investors should understand beta (price volatility) and take advantage of their long-term holding periods to improve their dividend portfolios.
 
Beta measures a stock’s price volatility in relation to the market. By definition, the market has a beta of 1.0, and individual stocks are ranked according to how much they deviate from the market.
 
A stock that swings more than the market over time has a beta above 1.0. If a stock moves less than the market, the stock’s beta is less than 1.0.
 
A stock’s beta is largely determined by some the risk factors mentioned above. Smaller companies with high amounts of financial leverage and less predictable business models will usually have higher betas.
 
While beta is backwards-looking (i.e. a stock with low price volatility historically will not necessarily have low volatility going forward), it is still helpful for investors to understand since we each have different risk tolerances and emotional tendencies.
 
A portfolio filled with stocks that have beta values greater than 1.0 will likely whip up and down much more than a portfolio filled with low beta stocks.
 
Importantly, beta is based on relatively near-term price volatility ignores underlying business fundamentals.
 
In other words, for long-term focused dividend investors, a high or low beta does not indicate whether or not an investment will be successful over the next five years.
 
As individual investors, one of our biggest advantages is being able to hold stocks for much longer periods of time to let their strong underlying fundamentals eventually be reflected in the stock’s price.
 
As you build up your portfolio, remember you are running a marathon, not a sprint.
 
It is generally better to own shares of a quality, growing business trading at a reasonable price than remain on the sidelines trying to time the market or play the quarterly earnings game. Let your long time horizon work for you.
 
 
Closing Remarks
Building a dividend portfolio is part art, part science. Constructing an optimal portfolio largely depends on an individual’s goals, risk tolerance, and available capital.
 
When it comes to dividend investing, building and protecting a nest egg is goal number one, followed by generating a stream of safe, growing passive income.
 
Understanding the key risk factors influencing a portfolio’s returns and volatility can help us avoid taking unnecessary risk.
 
The following risk factors are worth remembering:

The greater number of uncorrelated stocks you own, the less diversifiable risk remains
Depending on portfolio size and research time constraints, owning 20 to 60 stocks seems reasonable for most investors
Stocks should be diversified across different sectors and industries
Small cap stocks are more volatile than large cap stocks
Stocks with high financial leverage are more volatile and create greater risk for shareholders
A stock’s beta tells you how volatile the stock has been relative to the market
Investing with a time horizon measured in months or quarters is speculating

Keeping the above factors in mind, you should review your personal goals. Are you nearing retirement and looking to create a safe and steady stream of income to live off of?
 
Are you investing for your grandkids, looking for more balance between income and long-term capital appreciation?
 
What is your risk tolerance? How much time are you willing to commit to stay current with your portfolio?
 
Answering all of these questions will influence how many dividend stocks you choose to buy and the characteristics of each stock (e.g. dividend yield, price volatility, Dividend Safety Scores).
 
For investors interested in reviewing the risk profile of their existing dividend portfolio, you can input your holdings in our Portfolio Analyzer tool to see your diversification by stock, sector, dividend income, and more.

Amazing write up SSD!  That stat from the study about diversification blew my mind.  The amount of stocks thatyou need to buy to decrease your diversification risk in half/15% is unreal.  Almost not worth it if you ask me.   I love diversification; however, I don’t know if I could handle buying and owning that many individual stocks.  That is way too much for me to monitor and track on my own.   Right now I own about 30 companies, so we will see how many I can tolerate haha   
This is a great article for any new dividend investor trying to learn about the game we signed up for.  Thanks for taking the time to put it together!

Thanks, Bert! Owning 30 companies is great – not too overwhelming but certainly enough for healthy diversification. A lot of mutual fund portfolio managers own 100+ stocks and struggle to keep up with them. Sometimes less is more!

As always, an excellent thoughtful article! Over the years I myself have gone the opposite way… from owning 100+ stocks (leaving very little time for research) to currently owning only 9 stocks, roughly equally weighted.
I am always looking for reasons to reject, rather than include, a stock in my portfolio, and the “goal” is to hold a stock forever.
To paraphrase Warren Buffet  “it is ok to have all your eggs in one basket, as long as you watch that basket very carefully” .. I think i can monitor and guard 9 baskets, especially if I am informed by constantly updated dividend safety scores from SimplySafeDividends. My current portfolio has an overall safety score of 95.

Thanks, Ven. One of the hardest things to do in investing is reject a stock, but the reality is that we should pass on most companies. Like you said, we need to carefully watch our basket and make sure it doesn’t get too busy. It sounds like you have a well-tuned dividend growth machine! Thanks for commenting.

Brian–This is a great article. Especially, as several have mentioned the reduction of risk with numbers of stock owned. I wonder if anyone has then couple this  with sector diversification to refine the number. 
I realize sectors go in and out of favor, sometimes as you mentioned, without much warning but sector diversification must have an effect on risk. Just wondering.

Hi Joe,
Thanks for your comment, and I’m happy to hear that you liked the article. Sector diversification definitely impacts risk, but in my view it’s not worth being overly scientific about either. Perfectly trying to match up one’s sector exposure with the broader market can actually lead to more trouble than good in some instances (e.g. the tech sector was 30% of the market in 1999 before it crashed; financials were more than 20% of the market in 2006). 
My preference is to build up a portfolio one stock at a time based on business quality and valuation. From there, I try to keep a reasonable balance between sectors (e.g. no sector greater than 20% of my portfolio) but am mostly focused on owning the best companies possible for the long term.

To speed up my returns, one single stock (ADM) makes up about 35% of my portfolio. This is to make sure that I get additional stocks every quarter. Compounding interest is the 8th world wonder according to someone who knew his stuff, so that’s why I choose to buy so much of a single stock.

Hi Hank,
You certainly have more of a stomach for risk than me! With great return prospects comes great risk (in most cases). As long as you are aware of the risks and are willing to accept them, I wish you the best of luck. Here is my research on ADM from November 2015: http://www.simplysafedividends.com/archer-daniels-midland-adm-a-dividend-aristocrat-yielding-3/

I learned my lesson going heavy in energy.  It was great for awhile.  Now I have a bunch of pipelines that were not supposed to follow the commodity price down but did.  I also bought up stream companies.  Never again!  I had about 25% in energy.  OUCH!   If I put 5% of my total portfolio in each company now [not energy] at what point should I consider taking some off the top.  Hank seems comfortable with 35% in one company.  I would not be.  What percentage would you say is too much in one company.  When I talk about total portfolio I”m including my bonds.  Am I wrong doing that?

Hi Shirley,
Everyone has a different opinion on proper diversification. It begins with overall asset allocation between bonds and stocks. Perhaps that is most important. Than, within each asset class, an investor needs to figure out what level of return and risk is appropriate for his or her goals. 
It’s important to be aware of your total portfolio’s diversification (bonds and stocks). Morningstar has an X-ray tool that helps you bring in everything. Most studies show owning 20-40 individual stocks diversified across different industries captures the bulk of benefits from diversification. My preference is to equal weight each position because it’s hard to know which investments will go on to be the best performers. My approach means that each position is between 2.5% and 5.0% of my stock portfolio’s total value, depending on how many total stocks I decide to own. The more stocks you hold, the more closely your portfolio will likely match the broader market (assuming reasonable diversification between companies).

a journey towards financial independence










Portfolio 

Behold! (drums please) … I proudly present my portfolio.

Deka DAXplus Maximum Dividend (TER:0.3%)
Global X SuperDividend (TER:0.45%)
Global X SuperIncome (TER:0.58%)
iShares MSCI Pacific ex-Japan (TER:0.6%)
iShares UK Dividend (TER:0.4%)
iShares US Preferred Stock (TER:0.47%)
Kempen Global High Dividend (TER:0.73%)
SPDR S&P Global Dividend Aristocrats (TER:0.45%)
Vanguard FTSE All-World High Dividend Yield (TER: 0.29%)

The list above shows the name of the fund and the total expense ratio (TER) that the ‘fund administrator’ charges me on an annual basis. The TER numbers are what I found on the fund company’s website when I checked them last. So, the numbers above can be incorrect and outdated.
Every month, I will provide an update on the dividends that have been paid to me during that month. I will typically have a EUR and a USD number. However, they are not one and the same thing ie not one simply converted into the other currency. Some funds simply pay me in USD and some in EUR. What I do for sake of simplicity, I simply add the two to arrive at my total for the month. Click here for my most recent monthly overview. The best thing about this is that all I have to do is sit back and wait for the dividends to come in. I love it!
You will also notice, that the portfolio consists entirely of funds. However not all of them are exchange traded funds (ETFs). Some of them are actively managed and try to beat a particular index like the Kempen Global High Dividend Fund.
Every now and then, I plan to say a little bit about each of those funds. For example why I have chosen this fund and what its characteristics (yield, top 10 holdings, costs, etc) are. Stay tuned for more.

Nice to find another Dutch FIRE blogger in cyberspace! I understand the appeal of ETF investing, I am a fan as well. You might want to check the tracking error and the efficiency of the index tracked for your funds as well. You might want to treat those as cost factors next to the TER. Good luck on your journey!

Hi Mr FOB,
thank you for welcoming me to the community. You raise a very valid point. I will see if I can look at the tracking errors and index efficiency early next year. Thank you for stopping by.

Both of you, TeamCF as well as Divnomics got me thinking. That is why I love this blog already even though I do not write on it for long yet. So, what I did was actually make a list of the management fees that I am charged in my portfolio. The result of which will be an individual blog entry in a short while. But what I can say already is that I thought I knew what the individual fee percentages were. However I was actually quite surprised and while I do not like doing a lot of transaction, I already sold one position due to the fees I was charged.

Looking good! Like Team CF, I think it’s a really interesting approach and to see how your journey will play out 🙂 
Just curious? You are not having any transactions costs on buying the funds? Or are they that much lower compared to buying individual stocks?

Thank you for your comment Divnomics. Unfortunately, my transaction costs are not that much lower. However if I wanted to be invested in say 100 companies I would have to pay at least EUR 500 in transaction costs. The minimum fee I pay at my broker is EUR 5. So it is more a diversification argument why I do this.

Interesting investment strategy, using only dividend ETF. You don’t see this very often, but I certainly understand the appeal!
Are you also considering branching out into individual stocks? Major benefit is the reduction/elimination of management fees, but it does take more time to build a balanced dividend portfolio.
Curious to know your thoughts!

Thank you very much for your comment. At the moment I have no intention to invest in the equity of individual companies. The management fees of most/funds ETFs you see above are below 1% or even 0.5%. On annual basis this comes down to about ca EUR 100 for my entire portfolio. If I would like to achieve the same level of diversification via individual transactions I would have to spend much more in trading costs. As the portfolio grows, I might revisit this however.

Agreed, upfront costs are a bit higher, but in the long term it really quickly changes. Just something to consider for the 30+ years calculations 😉

Building A Dividend Portfolio For Passive Income

by retirebyforty



{ 105 comments }

 Tweet34 Pin66 Share14 +14Shares 118Update – I updated this article for 2014. See my updated Dividend Portfolio there.
One of my financial goals for 2013 is to generate $18,000 from passive income. This isn’t going to be easy because last year we only made $7,742 last year from dividend, rentals, peer to peer lending, and interest. However, the total was pulled down quite a bit by the rentals in 2012. I’m pretty sure 2013 will be better, but it is still a tall order to hit $18,000.
Dividend Income
Let’s look at dividend income today. In 2012, we generated $6,791 in dividend from our taxable account. For 2013, I’m hoping to generate around $9,000 from dividend. That’s a big increase, but last year I was still converting my investments in the taxable to dividend stocks. I had some stocks that didn’t pay dividend such as Berkshire Hathaway and Amazon. Now, I’m much further along now and most the investments in our taxable accounts are paying some dividend.
This year I’d like to keep better track of the dividend portfolio and share how well it does. The long term goal is for the % gain + % dividend to at least equal the S&P500 gain for the year. We’ll use VFINX as a benchmark.

The projected dividend income is still a bit under $9,000. However, we can add new money and reinvest the dividend throughout the year to increase the total for the year. Many of these companies have a good track record of increasing their dividend payout every year so we should see some increase in the % yield as well. If we’re lucky, the dividend payout will increase to $9,000 by the end of 2013.
Some Red Flags

This dividend portfolio is becoming unwieldy. I will need to cut down on the number of stocks because there are too many companies to keep track of.
Intel – I sold a bunch of Intel stocks and options in 2012, but I still have quite a few shares. I’ll need to sell more shares off at some point.
Abott Lab – They split into Abott Lab and AbbVie. I’m not sure what to do with both at this time. I’ll keep an eye on them.
Activision – Probably need to sell this one too. It hasn’t been doing much over the past couple of years.
Mondelez – This is a spinoff from Kraft. I need to keep an eye on this one.
Shell – It’s not doing as well as Exxon or Chevron. I probably should sell some shares and buy another energy company.
AT&T – The price seems high so I might need to take some profit. The dividend is quite nice though.

Passive Income 2013
Here is the plan to meet the $18,000 goal.

Dividend: $9,000
Rentals: $7,500
Peer to Peer lending: $1,000
Interest: $500

The biggest question mark here is still the rentals. I’m not sure how we’ll do in 2013 on that front. We’ll just have to compartmentalize and take care of one thing at a time. The dividend income is getting close to the target so that’s one less thing to worry about. With a little luck we should hit that $9,000 by the end of the year.
How about you? Do you have a plan to generate passive income? If you see any problem with our dividend portfolio above, don’t hesitate to call me out. I still have a lot to learn about stock picking.
Disclaimer: This is not a recommendation. My stock picking track record isn’t great so you need to do your own research.

I stopped doing the whole buy and hold stocks for dividends thing in 2008 with the GFC. Since then I trade the market in the penny dreadful end looking for 5-10% returns. On the whole I do pretty well, but I have had some spectacular failures.

I always get ads to trade penny stocks and turn $100 into $10,000. haha
On a more serious note, I am glad that you are planning on selling off some INTC, T and RDS-B. These three stocks generate 52% of your total dividend income. For safety, I actually own more than 40+ individual stocks in my dividend portfolio. If one of them cuts or eliminated dividends, I won’t be too terribly affected, and can redeploy funds elsewhere.
The only people on the internet who advise “concentrated” portfolios with 10 stocks are those who are not dealing with real money. If you are serious about this income stream, you need at least 30 individual stocks representative of as many sectors that make sense. And if you are still learning about investing, it is ok to actually have the money sit in the bank.

Have you ever considered the higher yielding dividends such as SDRL or AGNC (and of course there are others)?
If not, why not? After all, you could literally make your dividend in the $9k range from what it seems you have in other stocks such as KO, etc.
For instance, SDRL would be paying out $2.64/shr over the past year (WARNING: they sped up the next quarter dividend into last year to avoid possible tax implications for investors).

I’m considering REIT purchases and will research that next. At this point, my number 1 goal is to preserve capital so I don’t want to be more conservative. I will probably put at most 5% into these higher dividend funds/stocks. I can’t react fast enough if there are bad news. AGNC has been doing pretty well.

I’d be careful with some of the high dividend REITs.    Looking at AGNC they invest in mortgage securities rather than physical real estate.   They may be making money via arbitrage due to currently low interest rates or simply gambling on high risk mortgages in default.   I’d take a careful look at their annual report to see what they’re really doing and make sure you know what you’re buying.

I agree with jim.  There are various types of REITs that specialize in different things and their books are not always easy to comb through.  For a beginning investor its probably not the best sector to start in.   
As for AGNC, I currently own it and expect a dividend cut in a quarter or two.  The Feds low interest rate policy is hurting their ability to make money.

I first learned about peer to peer lending from your site.  I have looked in to what is available for me to try  in Canada and I have decided the industry is too new and the risk is too high for my little bits of available investment money.  
I have enrolled in the DRIP program for my dividend paying stocks.  Canadians are lucky enough to have a tax free savings account, TFSA, that I keep  my tiny collection of stocks in.  The dividend income is automatically reinvested in more stocks because I want this income for my retirement.
I plan to add another Canadian bank and perhaps an energy company (Suncor?) to my portfolio this year.  
In 2012 I made less than $100.00 in passive income but it was my first year buying stocks.

Would you ever consider trading some stocks for dividend etf’s like SDY or VIG? It might simplify things. Although, you are extremely well organized and possibly not seeking simplicity. I think you’re in great shape.
All my dividend paying investments are currency in retirement vehicles, predominantly Roth IRA. Our rental income should surpass $25k this year – I’m really excited about that and hope to purchase another property next year.

From a recent post, it sounds like you have some reservations about P2P lending (Prosper and Lending Club), but I suggest you keep at it. I’ve been doing it now for over 2 years and have been able to maintain 10%+ income. Reading lendacademy.com is a must as you’ll find a ton of useful information there.
The main drawback to P2P lending is that gains are taxed as normal income.

Most of those stocks are standard dividend growth stocks.  I don’t think that you have too many companies.  If anything, you need a few more. In analyzing your portfolio, it would be helpful if you could list the weighting of the stocks.  You suggest that you’ve got a lot of Intel stock, but how much is a lot?
I wouldn’t sell AT&T.  It’s been paying out ever increasing dividends for over 10 years and I doubt that’s going to change.
I would run like hell from Leggett and Platt.  It’s only a matter of time before they cut their dividend and their stock price tanks too.

Well done! You and My Own Advisor are ahead of me. I am short of $6K for the year. I had higher yielding stocks early on when I started with dividends but since they don’t grow their dividends or appreciate as much, I started focusing on buying valued Dividend Aristocrats where I know I get a dividend raise every year. In some cases, I look for those that increase their dividend by 10% on average.

Are you ever tempted to sell when its near the higher prices and buy back the AT&T stock a month later?
Could you maybe explain why it would be a bad idea to do that? Other than worrying that the stock price doesn’t go down again, are there any significantly negative reasons to not sell the AT&T stock once the capital gain, net of short-term capital gain and commission costs is at least double the next quarterly dividend, net of qualified dividend tax rate?

If you’re going to hold stocks, you might want to consider selling covered calls against them for additional monthly income.  As long as you have at least 100 shares of a stock you can do it.  Some people think trading options is risky but this strategy is one of the least risky since all your downside risk is in holding stock in the first place.

Great post on generating passive income through dividends. I agree 20 dividend stocks seems to be too many unless this portfolio is $1MM+.
If you are interested in dividend through individual stocks, I will suggest you look into value oriented stock selection strategies such as Dogs of Dow, Dogs of S&P500 and in general Dogs of Index and trim the number of stocks in your portfolio.
I also wouldn’t discount buying growth/capital appreciation stocks for generating passive income. Buy one growth stock every month, after a year review the stock either sell whole position or capital appreciation portion. Do the same for every stock on 12 month anniversary. You will have nice monthly gains assuming you have large enough position in each stock for transaction cost to be just a blip and stocks of established stable companies that don’t swing big in short term.

Hi Joe,
I think that it’s great that you have a goal to increase your passive income for 2013 and you have a plan laid out for it.  It has definitely inspired me to do the same.  I’m new to your site, and have been looking around and I find your story very inspirational.
In terms of stock picking, my belief is to learn from those who are successful in doing whatever it is you want to accomplish.  So for me, I chose to follow Warren Buffett.  The book I read called “Warren Buffet and the Interpretation of Financial Statements” has helped me tremendously in picking good quality stocks.  This book teaches you how to interpret a company’s financial statements and determine if it’s a good company to invest in or not.  These are the principles that Warren follows.
If you’re looking for ways to increase your dividend portfolio from stocks, this book will definitely help you find those quality stocks to keep for the long term.
Wishing you all the best with your goals for 2013!

I’m an amateur at all this, but I did purchase AGNC and PBI in the last quarter of 2012 and though they’re both down 10% (again, amateur) they did make about 5% in that last dividend payout.

How about doing more rentals?  I pay my entire mortgage through them.  The problem with rentals, though, is that if you want to get enough to live off of, managing things yourself will not scale.
To combat that, this year, I want to try some turnkey companies that will rehab and manage your rentals for you.  This way, it’s more passive and you can take advantage of lower out-of-state prices.
Best example I saw recently: a duplex in Ohio that would give over a 60% cash-on-cash ROI, after taxes and insurance.
This year, I’ll probably get something in Ohio.  And next month I’m heading to Tennessee to check things out there.  Let me know if you’re interested, I’ll let you know how it goes.

Nice work Joe, my only suggestion to you would be to focus on stocks that can drive higher dividend growth over time. Try and look past the higher yield today. To that end, your right on looking to get rid of AT&T. They don’t generate the growth to lift their dividend more than low single digits today. CME is one I’d suggest you look into. I just recently reviewed it. Be a little watchful of Western Union as well, it’s had flat revenue and cash flow growth for quite some time.

If you want to build your dividend portfolio you should focus on several things. Always remember that you are investing for your future income need so you don’t need to take company risk. Your main focus should be receiving dividends not just growth.

Looks good. But your spread out to far. I created a custodial account for our son in 2008 and he is looking at 15% return for this year. You need to narrow it down. I would focus on the big stocks i have below.
AT&T
Intel
Coca-Cola
Altria – (Maybe)
Proctor & Gamble
You should add Real Estate as well I have Vanguard VNQ ETF I am up about 23% since Dec 2011 other stocks I have include MSFT, SBUX, NKE, DIS (63% return since 2011) I recently added Ford I already have Intel and GE and a few others. But not bad at all sir.

@K
It really depends on your philosophy and diversification goals. I have a $6,000 income with 32 stocks but I am more focused on increasing my positions now then adding new stocks. The number of stocks is not really what drives the income but rather the amount of money invested and therefore how much you have saved.

Retireby40,
Do you know anything about Scottrade to manage investments? I am new at it and want to try with help. I work full time and really wouldn’t have time to watch over my investments. After reading many of your posts and watching my I brother struggle as a landlord…I believe I am ready but with help. When you invest and buy do you just go directly to each company or do you need a broker to  buy? Thanks for sharing and helping!
God bless you and your loved ones!

I think Scottrade is a discount broker. They don’t usually help with investment management.
If you are just starting out, I would invest in a Vanguard index fund like VTSMX or VFINX.
These are big funds with many many companies in them. You just need to keep adding to your investment every month and you should do well in 10+ years.
You can also buy individual stocks (company like Apple) through Scottrade. You probably should put this off until you are more comfortable with stock investing.
Good luck!

Just a short note about dividend paying stocks. I think this is a great way to add passive income.  My attorney has invested his retirement funds around dividend paying stocks and is doing very well.  I note that some people suggest trading here and there for added funds.  After 20 years of stock trading with options, stocks, as well as covered calls, I don’t recommend trading at all.  Buffet said it well…”Rule #1. Don’t lose money.  Rule #2. Don’t forget rule #1.”  I recommend a solid portfolio of 1) Dividend Paying stocks, 2) I-Bonds, 3) Real Estate Rentals, 4) Social Security (at a later date).  I lost small fortunes by wanting too much too fast.  Follow the Turtle and not the Hare.  Congratulations.  You are on your way!  And…a great blog!

I have about zero free time to watch the stock market and manage investments, so I invest in funds, not individual stocks/bonds, that balance themselves periodically.
I am interested in I-Bonds. Would you keep them in an IRA or outside of it?
I know about as much as Real Estate investing as I do writing Kanji 🙂 Are there any good REI funds out there?

I’m mostly invested in Funds as well. I do have a dividend portfolio that have individual stocks.
I keep my I-Bonds at Treasury Direct (taxable account.) You don’t have to pay tax until you redeem though.
You probably need to read a good REIT book. I don’t know much about them either. 🙁 The book was pretty boring….

Hi,
Which brokerage are you using for your taxable dividend portfolio? Do you know of any free screener/platform where it’s possible to set email alerts based on price.
I currently keep all my 401K/IRA money in Vanguard index funds but plan on building an early-retirement taxable dividend portfolio of around 40 stocks. Thanks.

I see your gain on the securities was only 1.18% + dividends. So what was your overall return on these securities. Not to be mean, but my way of thinking says to look at the return of an investment not just the dividends. 
To me it seems like you might do better with a simple cover call strategy. It might not be dividends, but its more consistent and more frequent returns where you can choose your own shielding to downward movement. I would argue that cover calling is MORE conservative than your approach with better returns.

I’m attempting to retire in one year.   I am in the process of moving about $1M of my nest egg into high dividend ETFs.  For now I’m in LVL, DWX, SDIV.  I should get around 6% dividend annually if they repeat past performance and the exposure is global.  I’d like to add two or three more to the mix.   
My question is, will I get the same sort of yield appreciation over time that one can get from owning an individual stock?  
One example would be where a company raises its dividend annually as its share price increases, so as to keep the annual dividend yield constant.  After ten years, the yield on the original investment would no doubt reach double digits.

Am I missing out by not investing in individual dividend stocks? I am currently 29 years old, I am following the low cost passive indexing approach. My portfolio currently contains the Vanguard US total stock market fund, Vanguard small cap index value fund, and the Vanguard Total international fund. I am 70% US/30% international. I do get some nice sizable dividends quarterly. I like this simple approach….  Occasionally I have dabbled in some momentum stocks and turned a nice profit, but that’s about it. I sleep better a night not being in any one individual stock for the most part.

I had pretty much the same approach that you had except I also had a bit of this and a bit of that (dividend growth stocks, pure tech growth stocks, stock du-jurs, etc).  I’ve recently made a switch to a mostly Dividend Growth model and currently have 38 positions in 4 different accounts (401k, Rollover IRA, Roth IRA, and Brokerage) that has a total portfolio weighted yield of 4.42% with an overall weighted Beta of 0.76, which I feel is pretty strong considering the higher than average yield.  I still currently hold 41% of my total portfolio in various index tracking funds (and 35% of that is in my 401k)
I’m using the Index Funds as a balance with my Dividend Growth and High Yield Dividend portfolios.  I’m still in a few pure growth stocks (zero dividends) and I don’t know how much longer I’ll be in those, but for now they’re holding well and I like the companies so it’s ok as they’re only 3.5% of my total portfolio. 
Like you, I’ve been sleeping better at night knowing that my portfolio is working for me as well with the  dividend growth choices I’ve made.  It’s not an easy conversion and it’s not for everyone.  Good luck with your future choices.

So $9,000 in dividend income would be about $6,000 after state & federal income taxes, or about $500/month?  What is the total taxable portfolio size, about $100K+?
The only downside is that you are trading long term (compounded) growth for current earnings.  But I’m sure you’re already aware of that and it sounds like you know what you’re doing and why.  
I have a less ambitious goal of buying enough stock in a company to offset my expenses in that company’s product/service, such as buying enough NWN (Northwest Natural Gas) shares so that their annual dividend pays my entire gas bill 🙂

Dividend Investing – qualified plans
I actually would take issue with your dividend investing approach. Nothing wrong with the stocks but save for T and MO, none of them generate dividends in excess of  the RMD. And as you note, most did not have principal growth and most are slow dividend growers. True, most have DRIP plans so you will get a boost from compounding. So for creating wealth, I would question whether this is the best approach. My portfolio currently generates about 12% on invested capital. The universe of holdings is made up of BDC’s, closed end MLP’s, (to avoid UBTI), an mREIT ETN, (MORL), Natural Resource ETF (GGN), Natural Gas Storage NKA, Dry Bulk Shipper NMM, and a few others (OXLC, NYMT, NTI) . I have rounded out the portfolio with additional growth names (MO, VZ, SCCO, CLF, DOW) on which I can write monthly calls that generate about 3/4 – 1% per month in additional income. Like yours, most of these do not offer much growth so they are ‘coupon clippers.’  Most either have DRIPS or the equivalent through my broker Schwab. Anyway, that’s what I’m doing.   Jim

Hello,
I am new to this site. I really like the idea of dividend investing to generate passive income, just wondering how much capital you need to have invested to be able to generate 9 to 10K a year in dividend income? Can anyone shed some light?
Thank you

If you invest pretty conservatively, you’d need around $300k to generate 9 to 10k. If you’re willing to take on more risk, then probably less. Good luck!

The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds and exchange-traded funds) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considere d a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding  consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.The Overall Morningstar Rat ing for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns,  60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most  weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods. Star ratings do not reflect the effect of any applicable sales load.©2017 Morningstar. All  Rights Reserved.

Portfolio profile subject to change due to active management. Percentages may not total 100% due to rounding. Fund invests in an affiliated investment company (Portfolio) with the same objective(s) and policies as the Fund. References to investments are  to the Portfolio's holdings.


About Risk: 
Fund performance is sensitive to stock market volatility. Changes in the dividend policies of companies could make it difficult to provide a predictable level of income. Investments in foreign instruments or currencies can involve greater risk and volati lity than U.S. investments because of adverse market, economic, political, regulatory, geopolitical or other conditions. No fund is a complete investment program and you may lose money investing in a fund. The Fund may engage in other investment practice s that may involve additional risks and you should review the Fund prospectus for a complete description.



1. S&P 500 Index is an unmanaged index of large-cap stocks commonly used as a measure of U.S. stock market performance. Unless otherwise stated, index returns do not reflect the effect of any applicable sales charges, commissions, expenses, taxes or leverag e, as applicable. It is not possible to invest directly in an index. Historical performance of the index illustrates market trends and does not represent the past or future performance of the fund.
2. Source: Fund prospectus.
5. The Morningstar Large Blend Category includes funds that are fairly representative of the size, growth rates and price of the US stock market.  They invest primarily in U.S. large-cap companies where neither strong growth or value characteristics predomi nate.
6. SEC 30-day yield is a standardized measure based on the estimated yield to maturity of a fund's investments over a 30-day period and is based on the maximum offer price at the date specified. The SEC 30-day yield is not based on the distributions made by  the fund, which may differ. Distribution Rate at NAV is calculated by dividing the last distribution paid per share (annualized) by NAV. The Fund's monthly distribution may be comprised of ordinary income, net realized capital gains and returns of capit al.
7. Alpha measures risk-adjusted performance, showing excess return delivered at the same risk level as the benchmark. Beta measures the volatility of a fund relative to the overall market. R-Squared represents the percentage of the portfolio's movement that  can be explained by the general movement of the market. Standard deviation measures the historic volatility of a fund. Sharpe Ratio uses standard deviation and excess return to determine reward per unit of risk.
8. A portion of the Fund's returns may be comprised of return of capital or short term capital gains. The Fund will determine the tax characteristics of all Fund distributions after the end of the calendar year and will provide shareholders such information  at that time. Please consult your tax advisor for further information.

Important Morningstar Information


The Morningstar Rating™
		 for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The Morningstar Rating does not include any adjustment for sales loads. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. Ratings may vary by share class.	

		Ratings and/or rankings may be based, in part, on the performance of a predecessor fund or share class and are calculated by Morningstar using a methodology that differs from that used by Janus Henderson. Methodology differences may have a material effect on the return and therefore the rating/ranking.	

		When an expense waiver is in effect, it may have a material effect on the total return or yield, and therefore the ranking and/or rating for the period.	

The Morningstar Equity Style Box™
		 reveals a fund's investment strategy. For equity funds the vertical axis shows the market capitalization of the stocks owned and the horizontal axis shows investment style (value, blend or growth).	

The Morningstar Fixed-Income Style Box™
		 reveals a fund's investment style as of the date noted. For fixed-income funds, the vertical axis shows the credit quality of the bonds owned and the horizontal axis shows interest rate sensitivity as measured by a bond's effective duration.	

		Morningstar seeks credit rating information from fund companies on a periodic basis (e.g., quarterly). In compiling credit rating information Morningstar accepts credit ratings reported by fund companies that have been issued by all Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations (NRSROs). For a list of all NRSROs, please visit https://www.sec.gov/ocr/ratingagency.html. Additionally, Morningstar accepts foreign credit ratings from widely recognized or registered rating agencies. If two rating organizations/agencies have rated a security, fund companies are to report the lower rating; if three or more organizations/agencies have rated a security, fund companies are to report the median rating, and in cases where there are more than two organization/agency ratings and a median rating does not exist, fund companies are to use the lower of the two middle ratings. PLEASE NOTE: Morningstar, Inc. is not itself a NRSRO nor does it issue a credit rating on the fund. A NRSRO or rating agency ratings can change from time-to-time.	

		For credit quality, Morningstar combines the credit rating information provided by the fund companies with an average default rate calculation to come up with a weighted-average credit quality. The weighted-average credit quality is currently a letter that roughly corresponds to the scale used by a leading NRSRO. Bond funds are assigned a style box placement of "low", "medium", or "high" based on their average credit quality. Funds with a low credit quality are those whose weighted-average credit quality is determined to be less than "BBB-"; medium are those less than "AA-", but greater or equal to "BBB-"; and high are those with a weighted-average credit quality of "AA-" or higher. When classifying a bond portfolio, Morningstar first maps the NRSRO credit ratings of the underlying holdings to their respective default rates (as determined by Morningstar's analysis of actual historical default rates). Morningstar then averages these default rates to determine the average default rate for the entire bond fund. Finally, Morningstar maps this average default rate to its corresponding credit rating along a convex curve.	

		For interest-rate sensitivity, Morningstar obtains from fund companies the average effective duration. Generally, Morningstar classifies a fixed-income fund's interest-rate sensitivity based on the effective duration of the Morningstar Core Bond Index (MCBI), which is currently three years. The classification of Limited will be assigned to those funds whose average effective duration is between 25% to 75% of MCBI's average effective duration; funds whose average effective duration is between 75% to 125% of the MCBI will be classified as Moderate; and those that are at 125% or greater of the average effective duration of the MCBI will be classified as Extensive.	

The Morningstar Analyst Rating
		 is not a credit or risk rating.  It is a subjective evaluation performed by the mutual fund analysts of Morningstar, Inc.  Morningstar evaluates funds based on five key unequally weighted pillars, which are process, performance, people, parent and price.  Morningstar’s analysts use this five pillar evaluation to identify funds they believe are more likely to outperform over the long term on a risk-adjusted basis.  Analysts consider quantitative and qualitative factors in their research, but the assessment of each pillar and how they are combined is driven by the analyst’s overall assessment and overseen by Morningstar’s Analyst Rating Committee.  The approach serves not as a formula but as a framework to ensure consistency across Morningstar’s global coverage universe.	

		The Analyst Rating scale ranges from Gold to Negative, with Gold being the highest rating and Negative being the lowest rating.  A fund with a “Gold” rating distinguishes itself across the five pillars and has garnered the analysts’ highest level of conviction.  A fund with a ‘Silver’ rating has notable advantages across several, but perhaps not all, of the five pillars-strengths that give the analysts a high level of conviction.  A “Bronze” rated fund has advantages that outweigh the disadvantages across the five pillars, with sufficient level of analyst conviction to warrant a positive rating.  A fund with a “Neutral” rating isn't seriously flawed across the five pillars, nor does it distinguish itself very positively.  A “Negative” rated fund is flawed in at least one, if not more pillars and is considered an inferior offering to its peers.  Analyst Ratings are reevaluated every 14 months. For more detailed information about Morningstar’s Analyst Rating, including its methodology, please go to http://corporate.morningstar.com/us/documents/MethodologyDocuments/AnalystRatingforFundsMethodology.pdf.	

The Morningstar Analyst Rating should not be used as the sole basis in evaluating a mutual fund.  Morningstar Analyst Ratings are based on Morningstar’s current expectations about future events; therefore, in no way does Morningstar represent ratings as a guarantee nor should they be viewed by an investor as such.  Morningstar Analyst Ratings involve unknown risks and uncertainties which may cause Morningstar’s expectations not to occur or to differ significantly from what we expected.

Who Should Consider this Fund?
Investors looking for high income potential from a globally diverse mix of dividend-paying equities and fixed income securities. 
Risk Tolerance Spectrum


moderate
Janus Henderson funds are classified as moderate if their share prices are expected to have moderate fluctuation over time. This can include funds that have a primary allocation to stocks or high yield fixed income. May be appropriate for a moderate risk portion of a portfolio with capital appreciation as a primary emphasis and capital preservation or income as a secondary emphasis.



Funds are placed on the risk tolerance spectrum to demonstrate the wide spectrum of risk levels among asset classes in which they are expected to typically invest. The spectrum is for informational purposes only, is not intended to be forward looking and is subject to change.






							Overview						


Client Commitment
A globally diversified portfolio of income-producing securities. The Fund combines dividend-paying equities of U.S. and non-U.S. companies with an allocation to fixed income securities, including but not exclusively, high yield and investment grade corporate bonds. The Fund employs a bottom-up stock selection process with asset allocation decisions driven by an assessment of the relative attractiveness of income opportunities and views on the market environment.
Why Invest in the Fund

Seeks High & Rising Income
We seek to provide a level of income which exceeds the average yield of global stocks and aims to provide a growing stream of income over time.
Risk-Aware Asset Allocation
The fixed income allocation is used opportunistically to potentially preserve capital when the portfolio management team thinks the macro environment dictates: this allows the team to seek to reduce volatility further where appropriate.
Experienced Management Team
Respected equity and fixed income teams with extensive investment management experience.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
