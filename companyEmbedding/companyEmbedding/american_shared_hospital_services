Overview
 American Shared Hospital Services is a publicly traded healthcare company (New York Stock Exchange AMEX symbol AMS) with a 25-year track record of leasing state-of-the-art medical equipment to hospitals and medical centers in the United States.
Through GK Financing, LLC (GKF), our majority owned subsidiary, we are the leader in Gamma Knife unit ownership with approximately a 16% market share in the United States. Our Gamma Knife model has been expanded to incorporate the financing of other technology solutions including Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT), Image-Guided Radiation Therapy (IGRT) and Proton Beam Radiation Therapy (PBRT).
Milestones
1980: American Shared is founded by Ernest A. Bates, M.D., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, starting as a fee-per-use mobile diagnostic imaging company. We become the second company to provide mobile CT services to hospitals.

1991: Our first Gamma Knife unit opens at UCSF in San Francisco, CA.  
1995: We partner with Elekta to form GK Financing, LLC (GKF) to provide alternative financing for Gamma Knife units.  
1998: We sell our diagnostic imaging business to concentrate on radiosurgery, radiation therapy, and our OR21 concept.  
2000: Our tenth Gamma Knife unit opens at JFK Medical Center in Edison, NJ.

2006: We enter the proton beam radiation therapy (PBRT) market by acquiring an equity interest in Still River Systems, Inc., developer of the Monarch 250, a practical, cost-efficient, single room PBRT system. 
  In turn, we are able to contract with Tufts Medical Center in Boston, MA. for a complete radiation therapy department upgrade that includes an IMRT/IGRT as well as a single-room PBRT system.

Proton Beam Radiation Therapy
Let us help you acquire PBRT- potentially the most effective cancer treatment available.



Proton Beam Radiation Therapy
The American Cancer Society estimates that 1.4 million people in the United States are diagnosed with cancer each year. Although significant strides have been made in reducing the mortality rate and morbidity caused by cancer, cancer remains the second leading killer of Americans. Radiation therapy, a non-invasive treatment, has been a significant factor in improving the outcomes of patients afflicted with cancer. As many as 60% of cancer patients receive a form of radiation therapy during their course of treatment. Proton beam radiation therapy (PBRT) is emerging as the next treatment option that can make a significant impact in our fight against cancer.
PBRT is a precise form of radiation treatment that treats tumors with protons instead of photons used in conventional radiation therapy. Protons release almost all of their energy in a burst of radiation delivered directly to the tumor. Since less of a dose is delivered to surrounding healthy tissue, this technology is particularly useful for targeting tumors close to sensitive areas and in treating children. By minimizing damage to healthy tissue and surrounding organs, proton treatment is highly successful and results in fewer side-effects.



Currently PBRT treats prostate, eye, cranial-spinal, head and neck, lung, liver, breast tumors and is especially useful in pediatric cases. Additionally, the benefits of PBRT for colorectal and pancreatic cancers are being explored. 
The PBRT systems in use today were extremely expensive to build since the technology required multi-story facilities. Therefore there are only about 30 PBRT centers worldwide with six in the United States which limits patient access to this superior technology. Single-room PBRT rooms are currently in development and US FDA approval is expected in the near future.
If you are interested in this cutting-edge technology, we will work with you to finance single or multi-room facilities from a variety of manufacturers to suit your needs.  Learn more about our financing options.

Tufts Medical Center in Boston partnered with us to install its Gamma Knife. 
"At the time of our Gamma Knife installation, we were facing capital constraints and wanted a partner who could share the risk and help us upgrade the equipment when needed," says Denise Schepici, Senior Vice President of Clinical Services at Tufts Medical Center. "In light of the global financial crisis, we're glad we were able to spend less upfront and still offer the technology we needed to stay competitive." "



Case Study
Tufts Medical Center
American Shared Hospital Services originally partnered with Tufts Medical Center to open its Gamma Knife Center in 1999. Like many of our clinical partners, Tufts Medical Center had faced challenges in allocating the capital needed for this investment but wanted to be a leader in providing advanced technology to its patients. By partnering with American Shared, Tufts Medical Center became the first and remains the only Gamma Knife Center in Massachusetts and Northern New England offering Leksell Gamma Knife technology.
In addition to its Gamma Knife, Tufts Medical Center signed an agreement with American Shared to install an Image-Guided Radiation Therapy (IGRT) system and Computed Tomography (CT) simulator as part of a complete radiation therapy department upgrade.
Commented David E. Wazer, M.D., Radiation Oncologist-in-Chief at Tufts MC’s Department of Radiation Oncology, "American Shared has demonstrated its commitment to providing technologically advanced radiation oncology services based on a sound business model. This agreement assures that Tufts Medical Center will continue to provide state-of-the-art radiation oncology services to our patients with the most advanced technology available today and tomorrow."

					Full Description



American Shared Hospital Services, incorporated on September 30, 1983, provides Gamma Knife stereotactic radiosurgery equipment and radiation therapy and related equipment to approximately 20 medical centers in approximately 20 states in the United States. The Company provides Gamma Knife services through its over 81% indirect interest in GK Financing, LLC (GKF). The Company's business is the outsourcing of stereotactic radiosurgery services and radiation therapy services. The Company provides the equipment, as well as planning, installation, reimbursement and marketing support services.Gamma Knife stereotactic radiosurgery is a non-invasive procedure, which is an alternative to conventional brain surgery or can be an adjunct to conventional brain surgery, radiation therapy or chemotherapy. Typically, Gamma Knife patients resume their pre-surgical activities one or two days after treatment. The Gamma Knife treats patients with 201 single doses of gamma rays that are focused on small and medium sized, circumscribed and critically located structures in the brain. The Gamma Knife delivers a concentrated dose of gamma rays from Cobalt-60 sources housed in the Gamma Knife. The Cobalt-60 sources converge at the target area and deliver a dose that destroys the diseased tissue without damaging surrounding healthy tissue. The Gamma Knife treats selected malignant and benign brain tumors, arteriovenous malformations and functional disorders, including trigeminal neuralgia (facial pain). There are approximately 130 Gamma Knife sites in the United States and over 310 units in operation across the world.The Company's radiation therapy business consists of one Image Guided Radiation Therapy Operations (IGRT) system. IGRT technology integrates imaging and detection components into a linear accelerator, allowing clinicians to plan treatment, verify positioning and deliver treatment with a single device, providing radiation therapy with less damage to healthy tissue. IGRT captures cone beam imaging, fluoroscopic or x-ray images on a daily basis, creating three-dimensional images that pinpoint the size, location and coordinates of tumors. Once tumors are pinpointed, the system delivers ultra-precise doses of radiation, which leads to patient outcomes. There are approximately 4,000 linear accelerator-based radiation therapy units installed in the United States. The Company is also engaged in proton beam radiation therapy business (PBRT). PBRT treats prostate, eye, cranial-spinal, head and neck, lung, liver and breast tumors.The Company competes with Elekta, IBA Particle Therapy Inc., Hitachi Ltd., Varian Medical Systems, Inc. (Accel), Optivus Proton Therapy Inc., Sumitomo Heavy Industries, ProTom International, Inc. and Mitsubishi Electric.

 American Shared Hospital Services Shares News That Mevion Medical Systems Has Received FDA 510(k) Clearance for Its MEVION S250 Proton Therapy System

 Comments

SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jun 11, 2012-- AMERICAN SHARED  HOSPITAL SERVICES (AMEX:AMS), a leading provider of turnkey technology  solutions for advanced radiosurgical and radiation therapy services,  today shared a recent announcement from Mevion Medical Systems, Inc. regarding Mevion Medical Systems' receipt of FDA 510(k) clearance for  its MEVION S250 Proton Therapy System. "The Mevion team has created a truly revolutionary medical therapy  device. Revolutionary in the sense that this machine combines the  elements of a superconducting synchrocyclotron mounted on a gantry  that is less expensive than all other proton therapy devices, using  accelerator technology that has been proven to be reliable and simple  for the user," said AMS Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Ernest A. Bates, M.D. "This is an exciting day for Mevion, for AMS, and for cancer patients  and clinicians worldwide. The MEVION S250 significantly reduces the  cost, size and complexity of proton technology, and promises to bring  accessibility, affordability and practicality to this innovative  therapy. With FDA 510(k) clearance for the MEVION S250 now in hand, we  expect AMS' proton therapy business to accelerate, both the projects  we have already announced as well as additional projects that have  awaited the FDA's positive decision," said Craig K. Tagawa, Chief  Operating Officer of AMS. AMS owns approximately 1% of Mevion, and is developing proton therapy  centers in Orlando, Boston and Long Beach, California which are  expected to employ the MEVION S250 proton therapy device:  Mevion Medical Systems Announces FDA 510(k) Clearance for the MEVION  S250 Proton Therapy System  MEVION S250 patented technology significantly reduces the cost of  implementing and operating proton therapy centers. LITTLETON, MA., June 11, 2012 -- Mevion Medical Systems, Inc., a  radiation therapy company dedicated to advancing the treatment of  cancer, announced today that it has received FDA 510(k) clearance for  its MEVION S250 Proton Therapy System. The MEVION S250 is a  first-of-its-kind proton/therapy system that provides the same  precise, non-invasive treatment advantages and capabilities of  complex, large, and costly proton therapy systems but with higher  patient throughput, a significantly reduced footprint, improved  reliability, and lower implementation and operational costs. The  MEVION S250 delivers precise and intense proton beams that physicians  can use to treat tumors and lesions or any other condition where  radiotherapy is indicated. The broad adoption of proton therapy has been greatly limited by the  enormous cost, large footprint, and technical complexity of  traditional proton therapy systems. Powered by a patented TriNiobium  Core(TM), the MEVION S250 proton therapy system redefines the  economics, availability, and the future direction of proton therapy,  by bringing the management and operation of proton therapy to levels  similar to modern X-ray radiation therapy devices. "Completing this  very important milestone is a testament to the maturity of the Mevion  organization and its ability to manufacture, install and support a  safe and effective product," said Joseph Jachinowski, Chief Executive  Officer of Mevion Medical Systems. "We are pleased to receive this  clearance from the FDA and now look forward to providing our customers  and their patients access to this revolutionary device."  This clearance enables users of the MEVION S250 to immediately treat  patients upon completion of their system installation. The first  installation of the MEVION S250 will soon be completed at the Kling  Center for Proton Therapy at Barnes Jewish Hospital at Washington  University in St. Louis, Missouri. Mevion will be delivering and installing more than a dozen MEVION S250  proton therapy systems worldwide within the next two years, making it  one of the leading providers of proton therapy systems. MEVION S250  installations are also underway at Robert Wood Johnson University  Hospital in New Jersey and Oklahoma University in Oklahoma. Additional  sites in Florida and California will follow these installations. Earlier this year, the MEVION S250 received CE certification, which  gives Mevion the ability to market, sell, import, and install proton  therapy systems in the European Union and other regions where the CE  Marking is recognized. About Mevion Medical Systems  Mevion Medical Systems, Inc. is a radiation therapy company dedicated  to advancing the treatment of cancer. As the pioneering developer of  proton therapy systems, Mevion provides innovative, safe, and  effective solutions by transforming advances in medical technology and  science into practical clinical reality.
