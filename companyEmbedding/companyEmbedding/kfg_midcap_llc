TOM TAILOR GROUP and Kids Fashion Group Signs Licensing Agreement on the Tom Tailor Kids Line
Apr 7 17
TOM TAILOR GROUP and Kids Fashion Group (KFG) have signed a licensing agreement on the TOM TAILOR Kids line. Under the cooperation with the children's fashion specialist, which has more than 14 brands in its portfolio, TOM TAILOR will expand its sales network and support long-term revenue growth. The partnership covers the development, production and wholesale marketing of licensed products over the next 10 years. TOM TAILOR Kids will remain available through the TOM TAILOR e-shop, in the group's own retail stores, and through many of its trade partners. KFG is active in more than 30 countries, with 280 of its own stores and a further 3,500 points of sale, including 2,000 in Germany. The cooperation between the TOM TAILOR GROUP and KFG will begin on 1 June 2017. The two companies have been working closely together for several months to ensure a seamless transition; the employees of the apparel line will transfer to KFG under the terms of a transfer of undertakings. This will preserve the DNA of the fashion line and ensure that the expertise developed over many years is carried over into the license production. The first TOM TAILOR Kids collection developed by KFG will be released in the spring of 2018.
