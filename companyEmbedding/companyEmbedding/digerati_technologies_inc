(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and  The following is a discussion of the unaudited interim consolidated financial condition and results of operations of Digerati for the three and nine months ended April 30, 2017 and 2016. It should be read in conjunction with our audited Consolidated Financial Statements, the Notes thereto, and the other financial information included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2016 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 27, 2016. For purposes of the following discussion, fiscal 2017 or 2017 refers to the year ended July 31, 2017 and fiscal 2016 or 2016 refers to the year ended July 31, 2016.  History  Digerati Technologies, Inc., a Nevada corporation (including our subsidiaries, "we," "us," or "Digerati"), was formed in 2004 as the successor to a business originally commenced by Latcomm International, Inc., a Canadian company formed in 1994. We began providing communication services in 1995 along the U.S.-Mexico corridor to capitalize on the opportunities created by the deregulation of the telecommunication industries within Latin America. Through FY 2012 our principal business was providing transportation of voice traffic for other telecommunication service providers, wireless carriers and regional Internet telephony providers using Voice over Internet Protocol ("VoIP") technologies. Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Shift8 Technologies, Inc. ("Shift8"), offers a portfolio of Internet-based telephony products and services through our cloud application platform and session-based communication network, which is interconnected to numerous U.S. and foreign service providers.  During FY 2016 Flagship Energy Company ("Flagship"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Digerati, entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement ("PSA") with a Texas-based contract-for-hire oil and gas operator ("Operator"). Under the PSA, Flagship has utilized Operator for the drilling, completion and initial operations of a shallow oil and gas well in conjunction with the purchase of 100% of Operator's Working Interest and 80% of its Net Revenue Interest. Under the PSA, the Operator has agreed to transfer all field-level operations and assign 100% of a certain oil, gas and mineral lease to Flagship upon demand, which includes a tract of land located in South Texas. Additionally, Flagship entered into a Joint Operating Agreement ("JOA") with Operator, whereby the parties agree to develop the oil and gas well or wells for the production and retrieval of oil and gas commodities as provided for in the oil, gas and mineral lease. During the period ended April 30, 2017 the Company terminated its investment in the oil and gas properties and recognized an impairment loss of $248,000 for the total capitalized investment amount.  Until July 2014, Digerati owned a waste disposal business focused on disposing of solid and liquid wastes from drilling sites and an oilfield services business providing skid houses, telecommunication services, booster booths, portable restrooms, generators, potable water, and mess halls to drilling contractors and oil companies in the Bakken region of Montana and North Dakota.  Sources of Revenue and Direct Cost  Sources of revenue:  Global VoIP Services: We currently provide VoIP communication services on a limited basis to U.S. and foreign telecommunications companies that lack transmission facilities, require additional capacity or do not have the regulatory licenses to terminate traffic in Mexico, Asia, the Middle East and Latin America. Typically, these telecommunications companies offer their services to the public for domestic and international long distance services.  Cloud-based hosted Services: We provide enhanced VoIP services to resellers and enterprise customers. The service includes fully hosted IP/PBX services, IP trunking, call center applications, interactive voice response auto attendant, call recording, simultaneous calling, voicemail to email conversion, and multiple customized IP/PBX features in a hosted environment for specialized applications.  Direct Costs:  Global VoIP Services: We incur transmission and termination charges from our suppliers and the providers of the infrastructure and network. The cost is based on rate per minute, volume of minutes transported and terminated through the network. Additionally, we incur fixed Internet bandwidth charges and per minute billing charges. In some cases we incur installation charges from certain carriers. These installation costs are passed on to our customers for the connection to our VoIP network.  Cloud-based hosted Services: We incur bandwidth and co-location charges in connection with enhanced VoIP Services. The bandwidth charges are incurred as part of the connection between our customers to allow them access to our services.  Results of Operations  Three Months ended April 30, 2017 Compared to Three Months ended April 30, 2016  Global VoIP Services. Global VoIP services revenue decreased by $9,000, or 100%, from the quarter ended April 30, 2016 to the quarter ended April 30, 2017.

Cloud-based hosted services revenue increased by $3,000, or 6%, from the quarter ended April 30, 2016 to the quarter ended April 30, 2017.

Stock Compensation Expense. Stock compensation expense increased by $51,000, or 100%, from the quarter ended April 30, 2016 to the quarter ended April 30, 2017. The increase is attributed to the recognition of stock option expense associated to the stock options granted to various employees during FY2017. There were no outstanding options during FY2016, as a result the Company did not recognized any stock options expense during the three months ended April 30, 2016.  Legal and professional fees. Legal and professional fees decreased by $6,000, or 13%, from the quarter ended April 30, 2016 to the quarter ended April 30, 2017. The decrease is attributed to the implementation of controlling all legal and professional fees and only allowing for professional and legal expenses be incurred related to professionals conducting the due diligence on a potential acquisition.  Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization remained comparable between periods.  Operating loss. The Company reported an operating loss of $563,000 for the three months ended April 30, 2017 compared to an operating loss of $242,000 for the three months ended April 30, 2016. The increase in operating loss between periods is primarily attributed to the recognition of $248,000 related to the loss on disposal of unproven oil and gas properties, the $40,000 increase in cost of services and the $51,000 in stock compensation expense. The increase was slightly offset between periods by the $18,000 decrease in SG&A and the $6,000 decrease in legal and professional fees.  Other income (expense). Other income (expense) decreased by $29,000 from the quarter ended April 30, 2016 to the quarter ended April 30, 2017.

The increase was slightly offset between periods by the $18,000 decrease in SG&A, the $6,000 decrease in legal and professional fees and the $29,000 decrease in other expense.  Nine Months ended April 30, 2017 Compared to Nine Months ended April 30, 2016  Global VoIP Services.Global VoIP services revenue decreased by $25,000, or 100%, from the nine months ended April 30, 2016 to the nine months ended April 30, 2017. The decrease in revenue is attributed primarily to deemphasizing this product, as a result no Global VoIP revenue was generated during the nine months ended April 30, 2017.  Cloud-based hosted Services. Cloud-based hosted services revenue decreased by $11,000, or 7%, from the nine months ended April 30, 2016 to the nine months ended April 30, 2017. The decrease in revenue between periods is primarily attributed to the decrease in customers that generated monthly recurring services revenue unrelated to the Company's core sales strategy and product line. Hosted services include the following, fully hosted IP/PBX services, IP trunking, call center applications, interactive voice response auto attendant, call recording, simultaneous calling, voicemail to email conversion, SIP trunking and multiple other IP/PBX features in a hosted environment.

Legal and professional fees. Legal and professional fees decreased by $24,000, or 14%, from the nine months ended April 30, 2016 to the nine months ended April 30, 2017.

We are currently taking initiatives to reduce our overall cash deficiencies on a monthly basis. During fiscal 2017, we anticipate reducing fixed costs, professional fees and general expenses, in addition, certain members of our management team will take a significant portion of their compensation in common stock to reduce the depletion of our available cash. To strengthen our business, we intend to invest in a new marketing and sales strategy to grow our monthly recurring revenue; we anticipate utilizing our value-added resellers to tap into new sources of revenue streams, we have also secured various agent agreements to accelerate revenue growth. In addition, we will continue to focus on selling a greater number of comprehensive services to our existing customer base. Further, in an effort to increase our revenues, we will continue to evaluate the acquisition of various assets with emphasis in VoIP Services and Cloud Communication Services, as a result during the due diligence process we anticipate incurring significant legal and professional fees. On May 8, 2017 we entered into a definitive Agreement and Plan of Merger to acquire T3 Communications, Inc. ("T3"), a leading provider of cloud communication and broadband solutions in Southwest Florida. Subject to regulatory approval, we anticipate closing in approximately 90 days. The acquisition of T3 will allow the Company to accelerate its revenue growth and expand into new markets.  Management believes that current available resources will not be sufficient to fund the Company's operations over the next 12 months. The Company's ability to continue to meet its obligations and to achieve its business objectives is dependent upon, amongother things, raising additional capital, issuing stock-based compensation to certain members of the executive management team in lieu of cash, or generating sufficient revenue in excess of costs. At such time as the Company requires additional funding, the Company will seek to secure such best-efforts funding from various possible sources, including equity or debt financing, sales of assets, or collaborative arrangements. If the Company raises additional capital through the issuance of equity securities or securities convertible into equity, stockholders will experience dilution, and such securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of common stock or convertible senior notes. If the Company raises additional funds by issuing debt, the Company may be subject to limitations on its operations, through debt covenants or other restrictions. If the Company obtains additional funds through arrangements with collaborators or strategic partners, the Company may be required to relinquish its rights to certain technologies. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to raise additional funds, or raise them on acceptable terms. If the Company is unable to obtain financing on acceptable terms, it may be unable to execute its business plan, the Company could be required to curtail its operations, and the Company may not be able to pay off its obligations, if and when they come due.  Our current cash expenses are expected to be approximately $85,000 per month, including wages, rent, utilities and corporate professional fees. As described elsewhere herein, we are not generating sufficient cash from operations to pay for our ongoing operating expenses, or to pay our current liabilities. As of April 30, 2017, our total liabilities were approximately $3,931,000. We will continue to use our available cash on hand to cover our deficiencies in operating expenses.  We estimate that we need approximately $500,000 of additional working capital to fund our ongoing operations. Additionally, we have an accumulated deficit of approximately $79,632,000, which raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.

	DIGERATI TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES






	NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



	(Unaudited)


	 


	NOTE 1 – BASIS OF PRESENTATION


	 


	The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated
	financial statements of Digerati Technologies, Inc. (“Digerati” or the “Company”) have been prepared in
	accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and the rules of the United States Securities
	and Exchange Commission. In the opinion of management, these interim financial statements contain all adjustments, consisting of
	normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of financial position and the results of operations for the interim
	periods presented. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for
	the full year. Notes to the consolidated financial statements, which would substantially duplicate the disclosure contained in
	the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended July 31, 2016 contained in the Company’s Form 10-K filed
	on October 27, 2016 have been omitted.


	 




	Income Taxes





	 



	The effective tax rate was 0% for the nine
	months ended April 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

	The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities
	based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates and laws
	that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to be recovered. The Company provides a valuation allowance
	for deferred tax assets for which it does not consider realization of such assets to be more likely than not.



	 


	Since January 1, 2007, the Company accounts
	for uncertain tax positions in accordance with the authoritative guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board on
	income taxes which addresses how an entity should recognize, measure and present in the financial statements uncertain tax positions
	that have been taken or are expected to be taken in a tax return. Pursuant to this guidance, the Company recognizes a tax benefit
	only if it is “more likely than not” that a particular tax position will be sustained upon examination or audit. To
	the extent the “more likely than not” standard has been satisfied, the benefit associated with a tax position is measured
	as the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. We had $2,622,867 in accrued liabilities
	as of April 30, 2017 and July 31, 2016, respectively, for the purpose of settling a potential tax obligation.


	 




	Cash and cash equivalents




	 


	The Company considers all bank deposits
	and highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash and cash equivalents.


	 




	Oil and gas properties




	 


	The Company follows the successful efforts
	method of accounting for its oil and gas properties and, accordingly, exploration costs, other than the costs of drilling exploratory
	wells, are charged to expense as incurred. The costs of drilling exploratory wells are capitalized pending determination of whether
	the wells have discovered proved commercial reserves. If proved commercial reserves are not discovered, such drilling costs are
	expensed. Other exploration costs, including geological and geophysical costs and delay rentals on unproved leaseholds are charged
	to exploration expense as incurred. The costs of all development wells and related equipment used in the production of oil and
	gas are capitalized. Costs to operate and maintain field equipment are expensed as incurred. Direct costs of acquiring developed
	or undeveloped leasehold acreage, including lease bonuses, brokerage and other fees, are capitalized. A gain or loss is recognized
	when a property is sold or an entire field ceases to produce and is abandoned.


	 


	The Company annually reviews its oil and
	gas properties for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such properties may
	not be recoverable. When it is determined that an oil and gas property’s estimated future net cash flows will not be sufficient
	to recover its carrying amount, an impairment charge is recorded to reduce its carrying value to its estimated fair value. During
	the period ended April 30, 2017 the Company recognized an impairment loss of $248,000 on the Company’s oil and gas properties.


	 


	Unproved properties are assessed periodically
	on a property-by-property basis and any impairment in value recognized. If the unproved properties are determined to be productive,
	the appropriate related costs are transferred to proved oil and gas properties. Unproved properties are not subject to depletion,
	depreciation and amortization. The Company had no proved properties as of April 30, 2017.




	 






	Reclassifications




	For comparability, certain prior period amounts have
	been reclassified, where applicable, to conform to the financial statement presentation used in 2017. The reclassifications have
	no impact on net loss.

	NOTE 2 – GOING CONCERN



	 




	Financial Condition





	 



	Digerati’s consolidated financial
	statements for the period ending April 30, 2017 have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization
	of assets and the settlement of liabilities in the normal course of business. Digerati has incurred net losses and accumulated
	a deficit of approximately $79,632,000 since 1993 and a working capital deficit of approximately $3,426,000 which raises substantial
	doubt about Digerati’s ability to continue as a going concern. The current working capital deficit of $3,426,000 includes
	$2,622,867 in accrued liabilities accounted for as an uncertain tax position.


	 




	Management Plans to Continue as a
	Going Concern





	 



	Management believes that current available
	resources will not be sufficient to fund the Company’s operations over the next 12 months. The Company’s ability to
	continue to meet its obligations and to achieve its business objectives is dependent upon, among other things, raising additional
	capital, issuing stock-based compensation to certain members of the executive management team in lieu of cash, or generating sufficient
	revenue in excess of costs. At such time as the Company requires additional funding, the Company will seek to secure such additional
	funding from various possible sources, including equity or debt financing, sales of assets, or collaborative arrangements. If the
	Company raises additional capital through the issuance of equity securities or securities convertible into equity, stockholders
	will experience dilution, and such securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of common
	stock or convertible senior notes. If the Company raises additional funds by issuing debt, the Company may be subject to limitations
	on its operations, through debt covenants or other restrictions. If the Company obtains additional funds through arrangements with
	collaborators or strategic partners, the Company may be required to relinquish its rights to certain technologies. There can be
	no assurance that the Company will be able to raise additional funds, or raise them on acceptable terms. If the Company is unable
	to obtain financing on acceptable terms, it may be unable to execute its business plan, the Company could be required to curtail
	its operations, and the Company may not be able to pay off its obligations, if and when they come due.


	 


	The Company will continue to work with
	various best-efforts funding sources to secure additional debt and equity financings. However, Digerati cannot offer any assurance
	that it will be successful in executing the aforementioned plans to continue as a going concern.


	 


	Digerati’s consolidated financial
	statements as of April 30, 2017 do not include any adjustments that might result from the inability to implement or execute Digerati’s
	plans to improve our ability to continue as a going concern.


	 



	NOTE 3 – PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT
	AND JOINT OPERATING AGREEMENT   



	 


	On February 29, 2016 Flagship Energy Company
	(“Flagship”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Digerati, entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (“PSA”) with
	a Texas-based contract-for-hire oil and gas operator (“Operator”). Under the PSA, Flagship has utilized Operator for
	the drilling, completion and initial operations of a shallow oil and gas well in conjunction with the purchase of 100% of Operator’s
	working interest and 80% of its Net Revenue Interest. Under the PSA, the Operator has agreed to transfer all field-level operations
	and assign 100% of a certain oil, gas and mineral lease to Flagship upon demand, which includes a tract of land located in South
	Texas. Additionally, Flagship entered into a Joint Operating Agreement (“JOA”) with Operator, whereby the parties agree
	to develop the oil and gas well or wells for the production and retrieval of oil and gas commodities as provided for in the oil,
	gas and mineral lease.  


	 


	During the period ended April 30, 2017
	the Company recognized an impairment loss of $248,000 for the total capitalized investment amount in the oil and gas properties.

	NOTE 4 - REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT



	 


	On June 10, 2016,
	the Company extended a Revolving Line of Credit to one of its Strategic Partners. The Revolving Line of Credit is for $50,000 with
	an effective interest rate of 10% and maturity date of June 9, 2017. The Company has a secondary lien on accounts receivables,
	fixed assets and all other assets of the Strategic Partner. In addition, the Company also secured a personal guarantee from the
	largest shareholder and CEO.   As of April 30, 2017, the outstanding balance on the Revolving Line of Credit was $0.

	million stock options, restricted common shares, non-restricted common shares and other awards to employees, directors, and certain
	other persons. The Plan is intended to permit Digerati to retain and attract qualified individuals who will contribute to the overall
	success of Digerati. Digerati’s Board of Directors determines the terms of any grants under the Plan. Exercise prices of
	all stock options and other awards vary based on the market price of the shares of common stock as of the date of grant. The stock

	Item 2. Management’s
	Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.



	 



	This Quarterly Report
	on Form 10-Q contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933,
	as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. “Forward-looking statements” are those
	statements that describe management’s beliefs and expectations about the future. We have identified forward-looking statements
	by using words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “could,” “estimate,” “may,”
	“expect,” “plan,” and “intend.” Although we believe these expectations are reasonable, our
	operations involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Some of these risks include the availability and capacity of competitive
	data transmission networks and our ability to raise sufficient capital to continue operations. Additional risks are included in
	our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2016 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October
	27, 2016.




	 




	The following is a discussion
	of the unaudited interim consolidated financial condition and results of operations of Digerati for the three and nine months
	ended April 30, 2017 and 2016.

	It should be read in conjunction with our audited Consolidated
	Financial Statements, the Notes thereto, and the other financial information included in the Company’s Annual Report on
	Form 10-K

	for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2016 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 27,
	2016.

	For purposes of the following discussion, fiscal 2017 or 2017 refers to the year ended July
	31, 2017 and fiscal 2016 or 2016 refers to the year ended July 31, 2016.






	 





	History

	 


	 


	Digerati Technologies, Inc., a Nevada corporation
	(including our subsidiaries, “we,” “us,” or “Digerati”), was formed in 2004 as the successor
	to a business originally commenced by Latcomm International, Inc., a Canadian company formed in 1994. We began providing communication
	services in 1995 along the U.S.-Mexico corridor to capitalize on the opportunities created by the deregulation of the telecommunication
	industries within Latin America. Through FY 2012 our principal business was providing transportation of voice traffic for other
	telecommunication service providers, wireless carriers and regional Internet telephony providers using Voice over Internet Protocol
	(“VoIP”) technologies. Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Shift8 Technologies, Inc. (“Shift8”), offers a portfolio
	of Internet-based telephony products and services through our cloud application platform and session-based communication network,
	which is interconnected to numerous U.S. and foreign service providers.


	 


	During FY 2016 Flagship Energy Company
	(“Flagship”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Digerati, entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (“PSA”) with
	a Texas-based contract-for-hire oil and gas operator (“Operator”). Under the PSA, Flagship has utilized Operator for
	the drilling, completion and initial operations of a shallow oil and gas well in conjunction with the purchase of 100% of Operator’s
	Working Interest and 80% of its Net Revenue Interest. Under the PSA, the Operator has agreed to transfer all field-level operations
	and assign 100% of a certain oil, gas and mineral lease to Flagship upon demand, which includes a tract of land located in South
	Texas. Additionally, Flagship entered into a Joint Operating Agreement (“JOA”) with Operator, whereby the parties agree
	to develop the oil and gas well or wells for the production and retrieval of oil and gas commodities as provided for in the oil,
	gas and mineral lease. During the period ended April 30, 2017 the Company terminated its investment in the oil and gas properties
	and recognized an impairment loss of $248,000 for the total capitalized investment amount.


	 



	Until
	July 2014, Digerati owned a waste disposal business focused on disposing of solid and liquid wastes from drilling sites and an
	oilfield services business providing skid houses, telecommunication services, booster booths, portable restrooms, generators, potable
	water, and mess halls to drilling contractors and oil companies in the Bakken region of Montana and North Dakota.



	 



	Sources of Revenue and Direct Cost




	 




	Sources of revenue:



	 




	Global
	VoIP Services:


	We currently provide VoIP communication services on a limited basis to U.S. and foreign telecommunications
	companies that lack transmission facilities, require additional capacity or do not have the regulatory licenses to terminate traffic
	in Mexico, Asia, the Middle East and Latin America.

	Typically, these telecommunications companies offer
	their services to the public for domestic and international long distance services.



	 




	Cloud-based
	hosted Services

	: We provide

	enhanced VoIP services to resellers and enterprise customers. The service includes fully
	hosted IP/PBX services, IP trunking, call center applications, interactive voice response auto attendant, call recording, simultaneous
	calling, voicemail to email conversion, and multiple customized IP/PBX features in a hosted environment for specialized applications.


	 



	Direct Costs:



	 



	Global VoIP Services:

	We incur transmission and termination charges from our suppliers and the providers of the infrastructure and network. The cost
	is based on rate per minute, volume of minutes transported and terminated through the network. Additionally, we incur fixed Internet
	bandwidth charges and per minute billing charges. In some cases we incur installation charges from certain carriers. These installation
	costs are passed on to our customers for the connection to our VoIP network.


	 






	 



	8



	 







	 




	  



	Cloud-based hosted
	Services

	: We incur bandwidth and co-location charges in connection with enhanced VoIP Services. The bandwidth charges are incurred
	as part of the connection between our customers to allow them access to our services.


	 


	Results of Operations




	 






	Three Months ended April 30, 2017 Compared to Three Months
	ended April 30, 2016





	 




	Global VoIP Services

	.
	Global VoIP services revenue decreased by $9,000, or 100%, from the quarter ended April 30, 2016 to the quarter ended April 30,
	2017. The decrease in revenue is attributed primarily to deemphasizing this product, as a result no Global VoIP revenue was generated
	during the quarter ended April 30, 2017.


	 




	Cloud-based
	hosted Services

	. Cloud-based hosted services revenue increased by $3,000, or 6%, from the quarter ended April 30, 2016 to the
	quarter ended April 30, 2017. The increase in revenue between periods is primarily attributed to the increase in customers that
	generated monthly recurring services revenue. Hosted services include the following, fully hosted IP/PBX services, IP trunking,
	call center applications, interactive voice response auto attendant, call recording, simultaneous calling, voicemail to email conversion,
	SIP trunking and multiple other IP/PBX features in a hosted environment.



	 


	C

	ost of Services
	(exclusive of depreciation and amortization).

	The cost of services increased by $40,000, from the quarter ended
	April 30, 2016 to the quarter ended April 30, 2017. During the period ended April 30, 2016 the Company received various credits
	and discounts from key vendors, the Company did not receive similar credits during the period ended April 30, 2017, thus the increase
	in cost of services between periods.


	 



	Loss on disposal
	of unproven oil and gas properties.

	The Company reported a loss on disposal of unproven oil and gas properties of $248,000
	for the three months ended April 30, 2017 compared to a loss on disposal of assets $0 for the three months ended April 30, 2016.
	During the period ended April 30, 2017 the Company terminated its investment in the oil and gas properties and recognized an impairment
	loss of $248,000 for the total capitalized investment amount.



	 




	Selling, General
	and Administrative (SG&A) Expenses (exclusive of legal and professional fees).

	SG&A expenses decreased by $18,000,
	or 7%, from the quarter ended April 30, 2016 to the quarter ended April 30, 2017. The decrease is primarily attributed to the reduction
	in cash compensation to the Company’s management team, the reduction in cash compensation was recognized during the three months
	ended April 30, 3017, thus the reduction in SG&A between periods.


	 



	Stock Compensation
	Expense.

	Stock compensation expense increased by $51,000, or 100%, from the quarter ended April 30, 2016 to the quarter ended
	April 30, 2017. The increase is attributed to the recognition of stock option expense associated to the stock options granted to
	various employees during FY2017. There were no outstanding options during FY2016, as a result the Company did not recognized any
	stock options expense during the three months ended April 30, 2016.


	 



	Legal and professional
	fees

	. Legal and professional fees decreased by $6,000, or 13%, from the quarter ended April 30, 2016 to the quarter ended April
	30, 2017. The decrease is attributed to the implementation of controlling all legal and professional fees and only allowing for
	professional and legal expenses be incurred related to professionals conducting the due diligence on a potential acquisition.



	 




	Depreciation and
	amortization

	. Depreciation and amortization remained comparable between periods.


	 



	Operating
	loss.

	The Company reported an operating loss of $563,000 for the three months ended April 30, 2017 compared to an
	operating loss of $242,000 for the three months ended April 30, 2016. The increase in operating loss between periods is
	primarily attributed to the recognition of $248,000 related to the loss on disposal of unproven oil and gas properties, the
	$40,000 increase in cost of services and the $51,000 in stock compensation expense. The increase was slightly offset between
	periods by the $18,000 decrease in SG&A and the $6,000 decrease in legal and professional fees.

	Other income (expense)

	.
	Other income (expense) decreased by $29,000 from the quarter ended April 30, 2016 to the quarter ended April 30, 2017. The primary
	reason for the decrease in other income (expense) is attributed to the decrease between periods interest expense as a result of
	the Company currently not having any promissory notes that incur interest.



	 




	Net loss
	attributed to Digerati Technologies, Inc.

	Net loss attributed to Digerati Technologies, Inc. increased by $292,000 or
	108%, from the quarter ended April 30, 2016 to the quarter ended April 30, 2017. The increase in net loss
	attributed to Digerati Technologies; Inc. between periods is primarily attributed to the recognition of $248,000 related to
	the loss on disposal of unproven oil and gas properties, the $40,000 increase in cost of services and the $51,000 in stock
	compensation expense. The increase was slightly offset between periods by the $18,000 decrease in SG&A, the $6,000
	decrease in legal and professional fees and the $29,000 decrease in other expense.




	 






	Nine Months ended April 30, 2017 Compared to Nine Months
	ended April 30, 2016





	 




	Global VoIP Services.

	Global VoIP services revenue decreased by $25,000, or 100%, from the nine months ended April 30, 2016 to the nine months ended
	April 30, 2017. The decrease in revenue is attributed primarily to deemphasizing this product, as a result no Global VoIP revenue
	was generated during the nine months ended April 30, 2017.


	 




	Cloud-based
	hosted Services

	. Cloud-based hosted services revenue decreased by $11,000, or 7%, from the nine months ended April 30, 2016
	to the nine months ended April 30, 2017. The decrease in revenue between periods is primarily attributed to the decrease in customers
	that generated monthly recurring services revenue unrelated to the Company’s core sales strategy and product line. Hosted services
	include the following, fully hosted IP/PBX services, IP trunking, call center applications, interactive voice response auto attendant,
	call recording, simultaneous calling, voicemail to email conversion, SIP trunking and multiple other IP/PBX features in a hosted
	environment.



	 


	C

	ost of Services
	(exclusive of depreciation and amortization).

	The cost of services increased by $27,000, or 34%, from the nine
	months ended April 30, 2016 to the nine months ended April 30, 2017. During the period ended April 30, 2016 the Company received
	various credits and discounts from key vendors, the Company did not receive similar credits during the period ended April 30, 2017,
	thus the increase in cost of services between periods.



	 




	Loss on disposal
	of unproven oil and gas properties.

	The Company reported a loss on disposal of unproven oil and gas properties of $248,000
	for the period ended April 30, 2017 compared to a loss on disposal of unproven oil and gas properties of $0 for the period ended
	April 30, 2016. During the period ended April 30, 2017 the Company terminated its investment in the oil and gas properties and
	recognized an impairment loss of $248,000 for the total capitalized investment amount.



	 




	Selling, General
	and Administrative (SG&A) Expenses (exclusive of legal and professional fees).

	SG&A expenses decreased by $18,000,
	or 2%, from the nine months ended April 30, 2016 to the nine months ended April 30, 2017. The decrease is primarily attributed
	to the reduction in cash compensation to the Company’s management team, the reduction in cash compensation was recognized during
	the quarter ended April 30, 2017, thus the reduction in SG&A between periods.


	 



	Stock Compensation
	Expense.

	Stock compensation expense increased by $404,000, from the nine months ended April 30, 2016 to the nine months ended
	April 30, 2017. The primary reason for the increase between periods is attributed to the recognition of $241,000 in stock compensation
	expense associated with the Company’s contribution to the Profit Sharing Plan during FY2017. The increase in stock compensation
	expense is also attributed to the recognition of stock option expense of $86,000 associated with the stock options awarded to various
	employees and the recognition of stock option expense of $99,000 associated with the issuance of common stock in lieu of cash compensation
	to various employees.


	 



	Legal and professional
	fees

	. Legal and professional fees decreased by $24,000, or 14%, from the nine months ended April 30, 2016 to the nine months
	ended April 30, 2017. The decrease is attributed to the implementation of controlling all legal and professional fees and only
	allowing for professional and legal expenses be incurred related to professionals conducting the due diligence on a potential acquisition.



	 




	Depreciation and
	amortization

	. Depreciation and amortization remained comparable between periods.

	Operating loss.

	The Company reported an operating loss of $1,556,000 for the nine months ended April 30, 2017 compared to an operating loss of
	$883,000 for the nine months ended April 30, 2016. The increase in operating loss between periods is primarily attributed to the
	recognition of $248,000 related to the loss on disposal of unproven oil and gas properties and the $426,000 in stock compensation
	expense recognized during the period ended April 30, 2017.


	 



	Gain on disposal
	of assets.

	Gain on disposal of assets decreased by $2,000 between periods. During the period ending April 30, 2017, the Company
	did not recognized any loss on disposal of assets. During the period ending April 30, 2016, the Company recognized $2,000 in a loss
	on disposal of various small assets that reached their useful life.


	 



	Interest income
	(expense)

	. Interest income (expense) decreased by $25,000 from the nine months ended April 30, 2016 to the nine months ended
	April 30, 2017. The reason for the decrease in interest income (expense) is attributed to the decrease between periods in interest
	expense as a result of the Company currently not having any promissory notes that incur interest.



	 




	Net
	loss attributed to Digerati Technologies, Inc.

	Net loss attributed to Digerati Technologies

	,

	Inc. increased by
	$650,000 or 72%, from the nine months ended April 30, 2016 to the nine months ended April 30, 2017. The increase in net loss
	attributed to Digerati Technologies

	,

	Inc. is primarily attributed to $426,000 in stock compensation expense recognized
	during the period ended April 30, 2017 and the recognition of $248,000 related to a loss on disposal of unproven oil and gas
	properties.




	 






	Liquidity and Capital Resources





	 




	Cash Position:

	We had a consolidated cash balance of $344,000 as of April 30, 2017. Net cash consumed by operating activities during the period
	ended April 30, 2017 was approximately $786,000, primarily as a result of operating expenses. Cash used in investing activities
	was $39,000 for the purchases of oil and gas property. Overall, our net operating, investing and financing activities during the
	period ended April 30, 2017 consumed approximately $825,000 of cash.




	 




	We are currently taking
	initiatives to reduce our overall cash deficiencies on a monthly basis. During fiscal 2017, we anticipate reducing fixed costs,
	professional fees and general expenses, in addition, certain members of our management team will take a significant portion of
	their compensation in common stock to reduce the depletion of our available cash. To strengthen our business, we intend to invest
	in a new marketing and sales strategy to grow our monthly recurring revenue; we anticipate utilizing our value-added resellers
	to tap into new sources of revenue streams, we have also secured various agent agreements to accelerate revenue growth. In addition,
	we will continue to focus on selling a greater number of comprehensive services to our existing customer base. Further, in an effort
	to increase our revenues, we will continue to evaluate the acquisition of various assets with emphasis in VoIP Services and Cloud
	Communication Services, as a result during the due diligence process we anticipate incurring significant legal and professional
	fees. On May 8, 2017 we entered into a definitive Agreement and Plan of Merger to acquire T3 Communications, Inc. (“T3”),
	a leading provider of cloud communication and broadband solutions in Southwest Florida. Subject to regulatory approval, we anticipate
	closing in approximately 90 days. The acquisition of T3 will allow the Company to accelerate its revenue growth and expand into
	new markets.


	 


	Management believes
	that current available resources will not be sufficient to fund the Company’s operations over the next 12 months. The Company’s
	ability to continue to meet its obligations and to achieve its business objectives is dependent upon,

	among

	other things, raising additional capital, issuing stock-based compensation to certain members of the executive management team
	in lieu of cash, or generating sufficient revenue in excess of costs. At such time as the Company requires additional funding,
	the Company will seek to secure such best-efforts funding from various possible sources, including equity or debt financing, sales
	of assets, or collaborative arrangements. If the Company raises additional capital through the issuance of equity securities or
	securities convertible into equity, stockholders will experience dilution, and such securities may have rights, preferences or
	privileges senior to those of the holders of common stock or convertible senior notes. If the Company raises additional funds by
	issuing debt, the Company may be subject to limitations on its operations, through debt covenants or other restrictions. If the
	Company obtains additional funds through arrangements with collaborators or strategic partners, the Company may be required to
	relinquish its rights to certain technologies. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to raise additional funds,
	or raise them on acceptable terms. If the Company is unable to obtain financing on acceptable terms, it may be unable to execute
	its business plan, the Company could be required to curtail its operations, and the Company may not be able to pay off its obligations,
	if and when they come due.

	Our current cash expenses
	are expected to be approximately $85,000 per month, including wages, rent, utilities and corporate professional fees.

	As
	described elsewhere herein, we are not generating sufficient cash from operations to pay for our ongoing operating expenses, or
	to pay our current liabilities. As of April 30, 2017, our total liabilities were approximately $3,931,000. We will continue to use
	our available cash on hand to cover our deficiencies in operating expenses.



	 



	We
	estimate that we need approximately $500,000 of additional working capital to fund our ongoing operations. Additionally, we have
	an

	accumulated deficit of approximately $79,632,000, which raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going
	concern.

	Item 4. Controls and Procedures.




	 





	(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls
	and Procedures





	 



	In connection with
	the preparation of this Quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended April 30, 2017, our Principal Executive Officer (“PEO”)
	and Principal Financial Officer (“PFO”) evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the
	end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our PEO and PFO concluded that our disclosure controls and
	procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report were effective such that the information required to be disclosed
	by us in reports filed under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
	in the SEC’s rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer,
	as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. A controls system cannot provide absolute assurance, however, that
	the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues
	and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected.


	 




	(b) Changes in Internal Controls
	Over Financial Reporting





	 



	There
	were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) under the Securities
	Exchange Act of 1934, during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely
	to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Key Opinion Leader (KOL) Feedback Surveys


Gathering data through KOL feedback surveys is a direct way to assess your field-based teams’ tactics, skills and work ethics as they establish and cultivate relationships with key opinion leaders.  KOL feedback surveys allow your company to understand healthcare providers’ (HCPs) perceptions of your company, their awareness of your products or technology and their preferences for interactions.



 DOWNLOAD MORE INFO



Do you know how KOLs perceive your company and its field forces?
Improve your teams’ communications, interactions and  relationships with key opinion leaders.  Let Cutting Edge Information help you gather detailed feedback from HCPs in their own words.
Research shows, time and again, that life sciences companies drop the ball because they fail to gather direct feedback from their key opinion leaders. Field forces can only serve the medical community to the degree that they know what healthcare providers want from drug and device companies.
Cutting Edge Information has conducted thousands of direct surveys and interviews with thought leaders and healthcare providers around the world on behalf of its clients.  Take advantage of this expertise and get the insights you need to make better decisions.  Whether it’s your MSL teams or your HOLs and sales reps in the field, we know how to improve your tactics.


THE SOLUTION: KOL Feedback Surveys to Turn Your Qualitative Practices into Quantitative Measures

 CONTACT US



We recommend that companies approach KOL feedback surveys in a systematic, empirical fashion by creating standardized surveys that are consistent from year to year. Cutting Edge Information has developed standard questionnaires targeted at gathering valuable KOL feedback, but has worked with dozens of companies to develop customized surveys as well.
To receive unbiased HCP feedback targeted at your company’s needs, our expert team will create a customized, electronic deliverable of findings. Our KOL feedback surveys are designed to bridge the divide between quantitative and qualitative data. To capture both kinds of information, our surveys include a blend of questions that range from the strictly quantitative to the softer and more open-ended. The result is a set of metrics that enables leaders to assess, rank and coach their field-based teams (e.g. MSLs) – and that meets the needs of your internal stakeholders, whatever their preferences might be.












Commonly Collected Thought Leader Metrics:

Receive qualitative feedback from HCPs on their interactions with field based representatives and other Medical Affairs personnel
Grade the value of the information and services that KOLs receive in meeting their needs
Uncover HCP perceptions of the company’s reputation
Duration of MSL visits with KOLs
Identify HCP preferences for type and frequency of communication with MSLs
Determine optimal number of KOLs per MSL
Preferred methods and frequency of communication and interactions vs. actual frequency
Perceptions of new media platforms for communicating information
Information most commonly requested by HCPs
Value of interactions with field-based representatives
Satisfaction of relationships with company representatives
