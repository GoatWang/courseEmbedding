                Battery Comparison Chart
            










With so many battery choices, you’ll need to find the right battery type and size for your particular device. Energizer provides a battery comparison chart to help you choose.     There are two basic battery types: Single-use batteries have a finite life and need to be replaced.  These include alkaline batteries like Energizer® MAX® and Energizer® EcoAdvanced®, and lithium batteries like our Energizer® Ultimate Lithium™ are good examples.  Other single-use batteries include silver oxide and miniature lithium specialty batteries and zinc air hearing aid batteries. Rechargeable batteries, of course, can be recharged again and again – some of them up to 1,000 times!  Check out the Energizer® Recharge® for more information.

Click for a larger view      Energizer® EcoAdvanced® Responsibility Energizer® EcoAdvanced® is commited to bringing performance and responsibility to the world. Energizer® EcoAdvanced® is the world’s only household battery made with recycled batteries.  Energizer® EcoAdvanced® has achieved UL (Underwriters Laboratories) Environment Claim Validation for being made with 4% recycled batteries on AA (3.8% on AAA). By using Energizer® EcoAdvanced® our longest-lasting alkaline battery, the world can use fewer batteries and create less waste.         Energizer® Vision With science as our guide, Energizer® is leading the journey to a future where battery recycling has a positive impact on the environment and will be more broadly available. Innovations such as Energizer® EcoAdvanced® batteries have created a use – and a value – for recycled battery materials (which until today had little use or economic value). By 2025, our vision for Energizer® EcoAdvanced® is to increase the amount of recycled battery material ten-fold to 40%.         Energizer® Leading and Shaping
Battery Recycling We’ve been leading and shaping the collection and recycling of batteries for years.  As founding members of The Corporation for Battery Recycling, we’re leading and shaping an industry solution to collect and recycle primary batteries in an environmentally positive way. Recycling technologies have advanced to recover a higher quantity and quality of the battery materials through proper processing – this offsets the environmental impact of collecting, shipping, sorting and processing. We are working with partners like Redux Recycling in Europe and Retriev Technologies in North America to improve and expand processing capacity, which is the bottleneck today  – not battery collection –  to achieving our Energizer® EcoAdvanced® vision of increasing the amount of recycled battery material ten-fold to 40%. We are creating a use and value for recycled battery materials with the invention of Energizer® EcoAdvanced®.                   Energizer® is on a journey to bring positive performance and responsibility to the world. In fact, we innovate in all aspects of our business – battery disposal
is no exception.     A quest for less waste.   We started over 25 years ago by removing heavy metals such as mercury and  cadmium from our batteries – a good start, but we’ve always believed in creating less waste.   Innovations such as Energizer® EcoAdvanced® batteries have created a use – and a value – for recycled battery materials.   Today, you can join our journey by using longer-lasting batteries, which means using fewer batteries and creating less waste.     A concern for the environment.   With science as our guide, Energizer® is leading the journey to the future where recycling has a positive impact on the environment and will be more broadly available.

 Excellent Customer Service!
 "We ordered some items that were lost by USPS (we received an empty box and our order had clearly been stolen). We contacted BatterySharks to find out what we could do about our shipment and instead of making us jump through a lot of hoops they sent out a replacement order and we received it within the week. Customer Service was courteous and professional and made the experience a really easy one! Would happily do business with them again!"

 Inferior Batteries
 "I purchase two battery from this company for my Fathers wheelchair in Feb 2016 and they were useless by Oct. 2016. They had Voltage but no amps, they would fail under load. I followed all of their request to prove that batteries were defective and they did send two more to replace them, but they did not last as long as the first ones. These are very “inferior” batteries so save your money and buy from a company that will stand behind their products! I use a lot of batteries in my profession for golf carts, lifts, boats, wheelchair, stand-by generators, computer back up system, emergency lights and more, most batteries last two to three years not 6 to 7 months. These are not “High Quality Batteries” as stated on their web page.Their name says it all “Sharks”. "

 TERRIBLE FOREIGN RESELLER - AVOID AT ALL COSTS, WALMART.COM IS A REAL COMPANY
 "OFFERS FREE SHIPPING, FINAL PAY SCREEN WON'T CALCULATE.  2 PHONE CALLS, 2 EMAILS GIVING SCREEN SHOTS.  30 MINUTES OF EXCUSES THAT THEIR WEBSITE IS WRONG & I SHOULD KEEP RE-ENTERING MY SHIPPING INFO THAT IS ALREADY SHOWN WITH ZIP UNDER THE CALCULATION.THEY WON'T PROCESS ORDER WITHOUT ADDING 30% TO TOTAL COST BECAUSE THEIR WEBSITE IS STUCK IN "DEFAULT" MODE.  THEY REFUSE TO SELL WHAT THEIR WEBSITE OFFERS AT THE PRICE SHOWN ON THE SCREEN. "

 Rough start but they made things right
 "I ordered a battery for my 1999 Suzuki DR350SEX. The battery I needed was a STX7L-BS. My order arrived quickly but I did not have time to work on my bike immediately. A couple days later I opened my package and was surprised that the battery didn't look like it would fit my bike. I checked everything out and discovered the battery I received was not the same as the battery I ordered, The battery I received was a STX7A-BS. The battery nomenclature is very similar, only off by one letter, but the form factor is much different. I contacted Battery Shark Customer Service and they asked me to send a picture of the battery I received which I promptly did. They very quickly emailed me back, confirmed that they sent me the wrong battery, and notified me that the correct battery has already been sent and gave me the tracking number for the new battery. The new battery came quickly. I was happy to see I received the right battery. I installed it the next day and the bike started right up. Life is good.So my overall impression of Battery Sharks is they do right by the customer. Anyone can make a mistake it is what you do to fix it that counts."

 Quick responses and delivery
 "Had a UPS failure and our service provider gave us a two week lead time in order to have our batteries replaced.  They wanted us to rent a system while we waited for them to come in.  Went on Batterysharks.com spoke with customer service and was able to find a solution that shipped the same day.  Saved me time and money!!!"

Digital paper, or e-paper is making great technological improvements, but what exactly is it and exactly how does it work?
Electronic paper is also known as e-paper and is a technology designed to imitate the appearance and style of regular ink and paper. E-paper reflects light just as ordinary paper does, unlike the usual flat-panel screen that is lit with a backlight to light up -pixels.
Electronic paper was initially developed in the 1970s by Nick Sheridon at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Middle. The very first electronic paper, called Gyricon, consisted of polyethylene spheres between 20 and 100 micrometres across.
E-paper comprises two different components: the first is digital ink, sometimes referred to as the "frontplane"; and the second is the electronics required to produce the pattern of textual content and images on the e-ink page, the "backplane".Several different technologies take part in the production of e-paper, some use plastic base and electronics to make the display flexible, this will make it more comfortable to read that traditional displays and gives it a well balanced image, so you don't have to refresh it constantly. Though it's light and durable the color portrayal is still somewhat restricted.There are many uses of digital paper that can be seen or even purchased today. Here are some examples:Lucent's new Electronic Ink device shows how the future of ePaper is coming. The technology uses electronic ink and combines thin, plastic, versatile transistors with polymer LEDs to produce smart pixels. The particular process involved uses si rubber stamps to printing minute computer circuits on to the surface. For screen, E Ink uses digital ink: a liquid plastic material substance made up of countless tiny capsules packed with light and darkish dyes that change color when subjected to an electric charge. This device will be completely flexible like paper (without the easy tearing or crumpling) and can show changing text or image.The benefits to using electronic paper are quite impressive. Here are a few of the features of using the technology:

Shopping Tips
Who doesn't need to get the best package for their money -- especially of these tough monetary times? There is no shortage of deal advertisements from stores who would like your business: they're using preferred customer special deals, early parrot sales, midnight madness occurrences, coupon savings days and nights, and pre- AND post-holiday sales. How will you make a decision if their bargains are real just?
The Government Trade Commission, the country's consumer protection organization, has some tips to obtain the most for your cash.
Check around. A "sale" price isn't always the "best" price. Some merchants might give a sale price on an item for a limited time; others might discount the purchase price on a single item every day. Having an item's manufacturer, model number, and other identifying information can help you to get the best price for that you want.Read sale advertisings carefully. Some may say "quantities limited," "no rainwater investigations," or "unavailable in any way stores." Before you come out the hinged door, call ahead to make certain the item is had by the merchant in stock. If you're searching for a favorite or hard-to-find item, ask the merchant if he'd be willing to carry that until you can reach the store.Take travel and time costs under consideration. If something is discounted, but it's way anywhere, how much are you saving once you element in your time and effort really, your transportation, and parking?Search for price-matching insurance policies. Some stores will match, or beat even, a competitor's prices -- at least for a restricted time. Browse the merchant's pricing insurance plan. It might not apply to all items.Go online. Have a look at websites that compare charges for items offered online. Some sites may compare prices offered by stores locally also. If you opt to buy online, keep transport delivery and costs amount of time in head.Calculate great deal offers that derive from acquisitions of additional items. For instance, "buy one, get one free," "free surprise with purchase," or "free shipment with minimum amount purchase" may appear enticing. Unless you want or need that, it isn't a deal.Ask about deal adjustments. If something is purchased by you at regular price and it continues on deal another week, can a credit is acquired by you or refund for the marked down amount? What documents shall you will need?Enquire about go back and refund insurance policies on the market items. Merchants have different refund and return policies on the market items often, clearance merchandise especially.

   A Battery for Every Need   Batteries Plus Bulbs has a wide selection of batteries that can help you power all of your John Deere farm equipment, whether it’s for a small plot of land or a massive farm. Plus, all of our batteries will meet the OEM specifications of your old battery. You’ll also want to consider a few things before buying a new battery: What climate do you typically work in? – If you need your farm equipment to start in colder environments, you’ll want a battery with enough cold cranking amps to get the power going. How often will you use the battery? – The more you use your battery, the stronger that battery needs to be. If you’ll demand a lot from your battery, consider getting a deep cycle cell. Can you afford unexpected issues? – If a faulty battery will cause a significant amount of stress or financial burden, you’ll want to consider the length and coverage of the battery’s warranty when you purchase it. Most of our batteries have extensive warranties to cover these types of situations.     Farm Equipment Battery Recycling   You rely on the earth for a living, so shouldn’t we return the favor? As an industry leader in recycling spent batteries, we’re proud to offer a drop-off point for your old John Deere farm equipment batteries. We’ll make sure your battery is disposed of in an environmentally friendly manner. Learn more about our recycling programs for consumers and businesses. Have more questions?

Connolly's Tom & Jerry Batter returns to Superior production in time for the holidays

By Christa Lawler
 on Nov 12, 2012  at 12:00 a.m.





Steve Knauss (left), John Kurth and Nan Hillmeyer are up to their necks in Connolly's Tom & Jerry Batter used in a traditional winter holiday cocktail. The three took over production for Upper Lakes Foods, the current holders of the Connolly's recipe. They make it in a large kitchen in Superior and sell it at local Super One and liquor stores. (Bob King / rking@duluthnews.com)It's about this time of year when Mark Connolly gets a few messages from enthusiasts around the country looking for a product he hasn't been associated with for years, but that still bears his family name: Connolly's Tom & Jerry Batter.

 
Mark Connolly's father, Jack, created the recipe in the back of his shop -- Connolly's Bakery, a mainstay on Belknap Street in Superior from the late 1940s until the mid-1980s."Last week I just got a Facebook message from someone in Tennessee," said Connolly, father of 2012 Hobey Baker Memorial Award winner Jack Connolly. He also hears from batter fans in Las Vegas and, of course, in Duluth and Superior.The batter recipe, which traditionally is mixed with a jigger of rum, a jigger of brandy and hot water, has been passed around a few industrial kitchens since the Connolly family sold it in 1986. The winter of 2011 was the first since 1949 without a fresh stock of Connolly's in the refrigerator case at local liquor and grocery stores.Now it's back.A trio of local families has joined forces to whip the ingredients into frothy peaks at a kitchen in the Superior Business Center. Steve Knauss, who owns Thirsty Pagan Brewing in Superior, said he was approached by Upper Lakes Foods, the current holders of the recipe. The Cloquet-based company is in the distribution business and wanted someone to take on production of the batter. John Kurth and Nan and Michael Hillmeyer also signed on."It's crazy good," Knauss said.The product is made in batches that include 30 pounds of sugar mix and three gallons of eggs, whipped in 60-quart batches. Between August and the end of the holiday season, they will have made 12,000 containers of the batter, which is then distributed to Super One and liquor stores.As for comparisons to the original, it's the same recipe that has been used all along. This crew isn't in the product development business, Knauss said."Believe me," he said, "we aren't that creative. It's an excellent product created by people who knew what they were doing. The wheel's already been invented. Why redo it?"As a kid, Mark Connolly put dollops into his hot chocolate. As a teenager, he made deliveries to local stores. And as an adult, just he and his father had the recipe committed to memory. Between November and New Year's Eve, Connolly said the batter was in constant production at the back of the bakery and in a kitchen at the Superior IGA grocery store.

They were always aware of the competing brands."Every year there would be one or two new ones," he said. "We'd buy the other brand and check it out. (Connolly's) had such a cult following. It was so much better than anyone else's. It had to do with the ingredients. They had tweaked it to do it right. What they had stumbled on was just a really good recipe."Despite his connection to the product, Connolly said he doesn't make it at home. It's a baking project, and it's better in bulk, he said."The science doesn't break down right," he said. "I know what's in it. I could take the ingredients and experiment with it and come up with something close."Jack Connolly sold the recipe to Paul Heytens, then-owner of The Shack in Superior. Upper Lakes Foods bought the recipe in the mid-1990s, and it was produced by their ice cream manufacturer in Alexandria, Minn. Eventually, production went to Cedar Crest Ice Cream, which is based in Cedarburg, Wis.When Cedar Crest stopped making it after the 2010 season, they were without a producer."The Connolly's Tom & Jerry Batter, from a Superior standpoint, is a well-known product," said Susan Ryan, president of Upper Lakes Foods. "And the recipe is very good. People in this area really know it and like it, and Mr. Connolly, who started it, he really made a name for it in our communities."The new recipe-holders had to go through trial and error with early batches, and they checked in with Heytens for tips."We've gotten a lot faster toward the end," Kurth said.Nan Hillmeyer said you know the batch is done when it shines and looks ready to crest over the top of the 60-gallon mixer.Connolly didn't know the product was back. The batter reminds him of the years he spent working alongside his father and the busy holiday season for a small hometown bakery, he said."From a nostalgia standpoint, even though my family -- other than the name -- isn't part of it, I've got a lot of good memories, for sure."

                Battery Comparison Chart
            










With so many battery choices, you’ll need to find the right battery type and size for your particular device. Energizer provides a battery comparison chart to help you choose.     There are two basic battery types: Single-use batteries have a finite life and need to be replaced.  These include alkaline batteries like Energizer® MAX® and Energizer® EcoAdvanced®, and lithium batteries like our Energizer® Ultimate Lithium™ are good examples.  Other single-use batteries include silver oxide and miniature lithium specialty batteries and zinc air hearing aid batteries. Rechargeable batteries, of course, can be recharged again and again – some of them up to 1,000 times!  Check out the Energizer® Recharge® for more information.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
