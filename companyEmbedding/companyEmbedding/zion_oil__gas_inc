Learn about the Direct Stock Purchase Plan. 
"Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord, The people He has chosen as His own inheritance." Psalm 33:12 



Zion Oil and Gas, Inc. / Learn about the Direct Stock Purchase Plan 







We feel that in 2017, we will encounter that first significant commercial production of oil and gas.
Victor G. Carrillo, Zion CEO


Zion is unique. Zion’s shareholders are unique. They are more interested in benefitting Israel than they are to make a quick dollar.
Bill Avery, Zion General Counsel


Invest Online Now >>
WHY INVEST IN THE DIRECT STOCK PURCHASE PLAN?
The Direct Stock Purchase Plan (DSPP) provides Zion Oil & Gas with the financial means to be able to explore for oil and gas in Israel. Purchasing stock through this plan allows you to share in the success of Zion Oil & Gas.

The DSPP is intended to be a convenient and simple way for you to purchase Zion stock directly from the company, allowing you to build your long-term investment over time while avoiding those dreadful brokerage fees. The Plan is not intended to provide shareholders short-term profits through rapid turnover of shares acquired at a discount.

The minimum investment is $250.00. Once you have your account set up with our Plan Agent, The American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, you may invest as little as $50.00 at a time. There is also an option for automatic monthly withdrawal directly from your bank account.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.
