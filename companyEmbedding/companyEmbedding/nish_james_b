Gibraltar Industries Appoints Sharon M. Brady and James B. Nish as 
      Directors, Completing Succession Plans




New Independent Directors Bring Additional Talent Development and 
      Finance/M&A Experience to Board


Appointments Temporarily Expand Board to 9 in Anticipation of Planned 
      Retirements of Directors Colombo and Sadler








August 06, 2015 07:29 AM Eastern Daylight Time



BUFFALO, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Gibraltar Industries (NASDAQ: ROCK), a leading manufacturer and 
      distributor of products for residential and industrial markets, today 
      announced the appointment of Sharon M. Brady and James B. Nish as 
      independent directors of the Company, effective immediately. The 
      appointments of Brady and Nish will temporarily expand Gibraltar’s Board 
      to nine members, in anticipation of the retirement of long-term 
      directors William J. Colombo and Robert E. Sadler, Jr. during the next 
      nine months.
    


      These transitions are part of Gibraltar’s succession plan and further 
      align the Company with best practices in corporate governance by 
      decreasing the average tenure of its directors. Including Brady and 
      Nish, Gibraltar has added six new board members during the past 18 
      months. In addition, as a result of the Company’s recent change to a 
      de-classified board in line with best corporate governance practices, 
      all directors will stand for annual election at the end of their current 
      terms.
    

      “We welcome Sharon Brady and James Nish as they broaden the diversity of 
      perspectives and complement the range of capabilities on our board, as 
      well as help guide Gibraltar in its transformation,” said William P. 
      Montague, Chairman of the Board. “Sharon provides significant experience 
      in global talent development, which will be critical to Gibraltar as it 
      expands its worldwide operations while maintaining a strong corporate 
      culture. We also look forward to benefiting from Jim’s financial acumen 
      and deep M&A and capital markets experience as we grow the Company 
      organically and through acquisitions. The addition of these two new 
      independent directors continues our thoughtful, future-focused 
      succession planning process for the organization.”
    

      Sharon M. Brady is a Human Resources Executive with 36 years of 
      leadership experience in the industrial manufacturing and retail 
      sectors. From 2006 to 2014 she was Senior Vice President of Human 
      Resources at Illinois Tool Works, Inc. (ITW), a Fortune 200 diversified 
      industrial manufacturer. Prior to ITW, she progressed through a series 
      of leadership roles for large cap companies in the manufacturing retail, 
      and pharmaceutical industries. Throughout her career, Ms. Brady has led 
      the implementation of leadership development frameworks. Her experience 
      also includes executive compensation plans, governance processes, and 
      strategies to support culture changes, including diversity initiatives. 
      Ms. Brady is currently the executive director of Leading Women 
      Executives, a leadership program to improve and sustain the advancement 
      for women in the corporate world.
    

      James B. Nish brings 28 years of experience in investment banking 
      serving clients across a variety of international industrial 
      manufacturing markets. From 2008 to 2012, he led the Mid-Cap Corporate 
      Investment Banking team at J.P. Morgan Chase. Prior to that, he was head 
      of the Industrial Manufacturing Group at Bear Stearns, where he worked 
      for 22 years. His experiences centered on helping global industrial 
      manufacturing companies accelerate their growth through mergers, 
      acquisitions, and capital market transactions. Mr. Nish, a Certified 
      Public Accountant, is an adjunct professor at Baruch College and Pace 
      University where he teaches both Undergraduate Business School and MBA 
      program courses.
    

      “On behalf of the Board of Directors, I would like to thank both Robert 
      Sadler and William Colombo for their long-time service to the board and 
      their strong dedication to Gibraltar,” said Montague. “Since 2003, both 
      men have provided valuable insight in a number of critical areas as we 
      reshaped the Company and prepared to advance Gibraltar to its next stage 
      of growth and profitability. And further, we appreciate Bob’s and Bill’s 
      willingness to stay on to complete the transition period for the newly 
      appointed directors. We wish them well.”

If the company isn't reporting the account correctly, you can submit a dispute to the credit bureaus asking them to correct it.

If you were a grad victim you don't need to fill out a fraud package. Google it. And send it to the credit bureaus.

I live on a fixed income. Its very difficult. My father and I are fairly comfortable, but due to the 40+ derogatory items on my credit report, which are all medically related. Lexington law, if you can afford their services, have done soo much for me. In only two months time, they removed 25+ items off my report. Unfortunately I'm unable to continue working with them, due to the roughly $100/mo fee, which is a bit too high for me.… read more

Who is taking it?  If you are just paying taxes and insurance no one can take it from you if you send a letter of intentions and pay what you can every month.  You might put the home up for a fast sale and with the money move into something affordable while paying the six thousand.

Board - USA / Can., Board Listed/Public Companies, Diversity on Board


– USA, NY – Gibraltar Industries (NASDAQ: ROCK), a leading manufacturer and distributor of products for residential and industrial markets, today announced the appointment of Sharon M. Brady and James B. Nish as independent directors of the Company, effective immediately. The appointments of Brady and Nish will temporarily expand Gibraltar’s Board to nine members, in anticipation of the retirement of long-term directors William J. Colombo and Robert E. Sadler, Jr. during the next nine months.
These transitions are part of Gibraltar’s succession plan and further align the Company with best practices in corporate governance by decreasing the average tenure of its directors. Including Brady and Nish, Gibraltar has added six new board members during the past 18 months. In addition, as a result of the Company’s recent change to a de-classified board in line with best corporate governance practices, all directors will stand for annual election at the end of their current terms.
“We welcome Sharon Brady and James Nish as they broaden the diversity of perspectives and complement the range of capabilities on our board, as well as help guide Gibraltar in its transformation,” said William P. Montague, Chairman of the Board. “Sharon provides significant experience in global talent development, which will be critical to Gibraltar as it expands its worldwide operations while maintaining a strong corporate culture. We also look forward to benefiting from Jim’s financial acumen and deep M&A and capital markets experience as we grow the Company organically and through acquisitions. The addition of these two new independent directors continues our thoughtful, future-focused succession planning process for the organization.”
Sharon M. Brady is a Human Resources Executive with 36 years of leadership experience in the industrial manufacturing and retail sectors. From 2006 to 2014 she was Senior Vice President of Human Resources at Illinois Tool Works, Inc. (ITW), a Fortune 200 diversified industrial manufacturer. Prior to ITW, she progressed through a series of leadership roles for large cap companies in the manufacturing retail, and pharmaceutical industries. Throughout her career, Ms. Brady has led the implementation of leadership development frameworks. Her experience also includes executive compensation plans, governance processes, and strategies to support culture changes, including diversity initiatives. Ms. Brady is currently the executive director of Leading Women Executives, a leadership program to improve and sustain the advancement for women in the corporate world.
James B. Nish brings 28 years of experience in investment banking serving clients across a variety of international industrial manufacturing markets. From 2008 to 2012, he led the Mid-Cap Corporate Investment Banking team at J.P. Morgan Chase. Prior to that, he was head of the Industrial Manufacturing Group at Bear Stearns, where he worked for 22 years. His experiences centered on helping global industrial manufacturing companies accelerate their growth through mergers, acquisitions, and capital market transactions. Mr. Nish, a Certified Public Accountant, is an adjunct professor at Baruch College and Pace University where he teaches both Undergraduate Business School and MBA program courses.
“On behalf of the Board of Directors, I would like to thank both Robert Sadler and William Colombo for their long-time service to the board and their strong dedication to Gibraltar,” said Montague. “Since 2003, both men have provided valuable insight in a number of critical areas as we reshaped the Company and prepared to advance Gibraltar to its next stage of growth and profitability. And further, we appreciate Bob’s and Bill’s willingness to stay on to complete the transition period for the newly appointed directors. We wish them well.”
