Early life and education[edit]
Thornton is the son of John V. Thornton, a former vice chairman of the Consolidated Edison Company, and Edna Lawson Thornton, a lawyer.[6][7] He attended the Hotchkiss School, and would later serve as President of the school’s Board of Trustees.[8]
Thornton received a bachelor's degree in history from Harvard College in 1976, a B.A/M.A. in jurisprudence from Oxford University in 1978, and an M.A. in Public and Private Management from the Yale School of Management in 1980. He was awarded an honorary doctorate from the Bank Street College of Education in 2003.[9] Thornton was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2007[10] and an Honorary Fellow of St John’s College, Oxford University in 2009.[11]
Career[edit]
Thornton joined Goldman Sachs in 1980 and became a partner at age 34.[12] In 1983, he founded and developed Goldman Sachs' European mergers and acquisitions business. He first began work in London in 1985, and served as co-CEO of Goldman Sachs International in London from 1995 to 1996. Thornton was Chairman of Goldman Sachs Asia from 1996 to 1998, where he expanded the firm's regional franchise during the Asian financial crisis. He announced his retirement from Goldman Sachs in 2003 to take up an academic position in China, although he would remain an adviser on issues related to China. According to the New York Times, Thornton's decision to retire "was prompted by a recognition that Mr. Paulson, who is 56, plans to remain Goldman's leader for at least three to five more years, delaying Mr. Thornton's expected promotion."[12]
In 2013, Barrick Gold faced criticism over Thornton's compensation, following the company’s decision to award him an $11.9 million sign-on bonus. According to the Globe and Mail, the company later acknowledged shareholder concerns and vowed to make changes to its compensation practices.[13] At the company’s 2016 annual general meeting, more than 90% of Barrick’s shareholders approved the company’s compensation practices.[14][15]
Thornton has served on the boards of many large public companies including China Unicom, HSBC, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Intel and News Corporation. He is currently Executive Chairman of Barrick Gold Corporation,[16] a member of the board of Ford Motor Company[17] and also serves as Non-Executive Chairman of Pinebridge Investments.[18]
He is also Chairman of the Board of trustees of the Brookings Institution.
In 2007, Institutional Investor Magazine named John Thornton one of forty individuals who have had the greatest influence in shaping global financial markets over the past forty years.[19] He received the 2009 Intercollegiate Tennis Association (ITA) Achievement Award,[20] which every year honors one past participant in collegiate tennis who has made unique contributions to society as well as achieving excellence in their careers.
Thornton appeared on the National Post’s 2017 Power List of the most influential people shaping Canadian business. The newspaper noted Thornton has “overseen a massive overhaul at Toronto-based Barrick” following which the company “has shed billions of dollars of debt and generated excellent financial results."[21]
Interest in China[edit]
Thornton's interest in China stretches to the 1980s, where he helped build Goldman's presence in Asia. At the time of his retirement, Goldman had become the lead underwriter for major Chinese state-owned companies.[12]
In 2006, Thornton funded the establishment of the John L. Thornton China Center at the Brookings Institution.[22] In 2009, he also became a member of the International Advisory Council of the Chinese sovereign wealth fund China Investment Corporation.[23]
He supported the launch of the Schwarzman Scholarship in 2013, attending its launch at Tsinghua University,[24] and serving as an honorary board member.[25]
In 2008, he was awarded the Friendship Award of the People’s Republic of China, the highest honor accorded to a non-Chinese citizen.[26] The Chinese government also named him as one of fifteen ‘foreign experts’ who have made the most significant contribution to China’s development over the past three decades.[27]
Personal life[edit]
Thornton is married to Margaret Bradham Thornton. They have four children.[28]

Early life and education[edit]
Thornton is the son of John V. Thornton, a former vice chairman of the Consolidated Edison Company, and Edna Lawson Thornton, a lawyer.[6][7] He attended the Hotchkiss School, and would later serve as President of the school’s Board of Trustees.[8]
Thornton received a bachelor's degree in history from Harvard College in 1976, a B.A/M.A. in jurisprudence from Oxford University in 1978, and an M.A. in Public and Private Management from the Yale School of Management in 1980. He was awarded an honorary doctorate from the Bank Street College of Education in 2003.[9] Thornton was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2007[10] and an Honorary Fellow of St John’s College, Oxford University in 2009.[11]
Career[edit]
Thornton joined Goldman Sachs in 1980 and became a partner at age 34.[12] In 1983, he founded and developed Goldman Sachs' European mergers and acquisitions business. He first began work in London in 1985, and served as co-CEO of Goldman Sachs International in London from 1995 to 1996. Thornton was Chairman of Goldman Sachs Asia from 1996 to 1998, where he expanded the firm's regional franchise during the Asian financial crisis. He announced his retirement from Goldman Sachs in 2003 to take up an academic position in China, although he would remain an adviser on issues related to China. According to the New York Times, Thornton's decision to retire "was prompted by a recognition that Mr. Paulson, who is 56, plans to remain Goldman's leader for at least three to five more years, delaying Mr. Thornton's expected promotion."[12]
In 2013, Barrick Gold faced criticism over Thornton's compensation, following the company’s decision to award him an $11.9 million sign-on bonus. According to the Globe and Mail, the company later acknowledged shareholder concerns and vowed to make changes to its compensation practices.[13] At the company’s 2016 annual general meeting, more than 90% of Barrick’s shareholders approved the company’s compensation practices.[14][15]
Thornton has served on the boards of many large public companies including China Unicom, HSBC, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Intel and News Corporation. He is currently Executive Chairman of Barrick Gold Corporation,[16] a member of the board of Ford Motor Company[17] and also serves as Non-Executive Chairman of Pinebridge Investments.[18]
He is also Chairman of the Board of trustees of the Brookings Institution.
In 2007, Institutional Investor Magazine named John Thornton one of forty individuals who have had the greatest influence in shaping global financial markets over the past forty years.[19] He received the 2009 Intercollegiate Tennis Association (ITA) Achievement Award,[20] which every year honors one past participant in collegiate tennis who has made unique contributions to society as well as achieving excellence in their careers.
Thornton appeared on the National Post’s 2017 Power List of the most influential people shaping Canadian business. The newspaper noted Thornton has “overseen a massive overhaul at Toronto-based Barrick” following which the company “has shed billions of dollars of debt and generated excellent financial results."[21]
Interest in China[edit]
Thornton's interest in China stretches to the 1980s, where he helped build Goldman's presence in Asia. At the time of his retirement, Goldman had become the lead underwriter for major Chinese state-owned companies.[12]
In 2006, Thornton funded the establishment of the John L. Thornton China Center at the Brookings Institution.[22] In 2009, he also became a member of the International Advisory Council of the Chinese sovereign wealth fund China Investment Corporation.[23]
He supported the launch of the Schwarzman Scholarship in 2013, attending its launch at Tsinghua University,[24] and serving as an honorary board member.[25]
In 2008, he was awarded the Friendship Award of the People’s Republic of China, the highest honor accorded to a non-Chinese citizen.[26] The Chinese government also named him as one of fifteen ‘foreign experts’ who have made the most significant contribution to China’s development over the past three decades.[27]
Personal life[edit]
Thornton is married to Margaret Bradham Thornton. They have four children.[28]

Item Description: ReInk Books, 2017. Softcover. Book Condition: NEW. Reprinted from 1828 edition. Language: eng. NO changes have been made to the original text. This is NOT a retyped or an ocr'd reprint. Illustrations, Index, if any, are included in black and white. Each page is checked manually before printing. As this reprint is from very old book, there could be some missing or flawed pages, but we always try to make the book as complete as possible. Fold-outs, if any, are not part of the book. If the original book was published in multiple volumes then this reprint is of only one volume, not the whole set. This paperback book is SEWN, where the book block is actually sewn (smythe sewn/section sewn) with thread before binding which results in a more durable type of paperback binding. It can also be open wide. The pages will not fall out and will be around for a lot longer than normal paperbacks. This print on demand book is printed on high quality acid-free paper. Original Publisher: Boston: : Condon Printer. 26 pages.  Bookseller Inventory # 451007141

How the BuildZoom Score works








Follow this contractor

















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Washington:













Does Thornton, John L carry a valid contracting license?



Any work that impacts the value of real estate in Washington, requires a licensed contractor.
Thornton, John L currently holds license THORNJL881DW , which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Washington?



The Washington State Department of Labor & Industries requires licensees to maintain a bond and liability insurance for the protection of consumers.











Your liability risk when hiring Thornton, John L



Licensed contractors in Washington are required to maintain general liability coverage that includes a $50,000 property damage policy and $200,000 public liability policy; or $250,000 combined single limit policy.











Financial recourse when hiring Thornton, John L



Licensed general contractors in Washington are required to maintain a $12,000 bond and specialty contractors are required to maintain a $6,000 bond. This provides consumers with financial recourse in case they perform defective work or violate license regulations.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The standard board recommendation is to get at least three written bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/24/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

By Lesley Wroughton. U.S. labor union leaders and Democratic lawmakers on Monday reminded U.S. President Donald Trump they expect him to keep election campaign promises to protect American workers in NAFTA talks, but they stopped short of demanding termination of the 1994 trade pact with Canada and Mexico.

'American made' products will be in focus as the Trump administration kicks off the latest in its theme messaging. Only a handful of cars can be considered mostly "American made" when parts and labor are considered. Two Ohio-built SUVs from Fiat Chrysler are the most American-made vehicles to roll off the assembly line, according to a Cars.com index released in late June.

John Thornton Retiring as President and Co-COO of Goldman Sachs











 



 



 



 



 



 




 NEW YORK - The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE: GS) today announced that John L. Thornton will retire as president and co-chief operating officer as of July 1, 2003, and will not stand for re-election as a director of the Corporation. After his retirement, Mr. Thornton will continue to serve as senior advisor to the firm and as a director of the Goldman Sachs Foundation. As senior advisor, Mr. Thornton will be available to work closely with Hank Paulson and John Thain on certain strategic matters, to advise Goldman Sachs and our clients on China strategy, and to work closely with select clients of the firm.

 
Starting from September, 2003, Mr. Thornton will serve as professor and Director for the newly established program for Global Leadership at the prestigious Tsinghua University in Beijing. This is a joint appointment of both the School of Economics and Management and the School of Public Policy and Management. He will be the first retired Western business leader to dedicate full time to teach a regular graduate course at Tsinghua University since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949. Additionally, Mr. Thornton will be serving as a special advisor on China to Richard C. Levin, President of Yale University. He will also be devoting more time to the Brookings Institution where he is Chairman of the Executive Committee.
 
Henry M. Paulson, Jr. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Goldman Sachs said of Mr. Thornton's departure, "John will be greatly missed. He exemplifies the best of our firm: a tireless devotion to client service, to excellence, and to the development of our people. From the beginning of his career, John recognized the importance of the international business and has been a driving force behind our development into a global firm. We are grateful for his dedication and service over the past 22 years, and we are pleased that he will continue to be available to us as an advisor."
 
Mr. Thornton joined Goldman Sachs in 1980 in the Mergers Department. He became a partner in 1988 and co-chief executive officer of Goldman Sachs International in 1995. From 1996 to 1998, he was chairman of Goldman Sachs Asia. He was named president and co-chief operating officer of Goldman Sachs in 1999.
________

Note for Editors
 
Tsinghua University, located in Beijing (and another sister institution with the same name and reputation, located in Taiwan), is China's foremost institution of higher learning. For a century, it has been the most important training ground for China's top scientists, engineers, business and government leaders. The University's 4500-strong faculty and 18,000 students are considered China's finest.
 
Tsinghua University is especially renowned for its science and engineering departments, long known as the "MIT of China". Its faculty and alumni account for over one-quarter of the members of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Chinese Academy of Engineering Sciences, the nation's most prestigious academies. There are four Nobel laureates in physics and chemistry among Tsinghua faculty and graduates.
 
Tsinghua alumni are highly influential in China's education, arts and literature, science and engineering, state industry, and government sectors. The University has also trained a lion's share of China's past and current political leaders. Former Prime Minister Zhu Rongji, President Hu Jintao, National People's Congress Chairman Wu Bangguo, Vice Premier Huang Ju and Vice Premier Zeng Peiyan are Tsinghua graduates. Four out of the Party's 9-member Politburo Standing Committee, the most powerful political group in China, are Tsinghua graduates. And there are a large number of Tsinghua alumni serving as ministers, governors and mayors across China.
 
The School of Economics and Management at Tsinghua University  China's first Western-style business school  was founded in the early 1980s as the country's market-oriented economic reforms dramatically increased demand for professional managers. The School is now ranked as China's best business school. Former Prime Minister Zhu Rongji was the founder and served as dean until 2001. There are now 1200 MBA students, 500 undergraduates, and 200 graduate students enrolled in the master's and PhD programs. There are a number of pioneering international exchange programs at the School, including the joint Tsinghua-Harvard executive program. The School established an international advisory board, with Hank Paulson serving as its first chairman, and John Thornton as a member.
 
The School of Public Policy and Management was established in 1996, with the goal to train China's next generation of public sector leaders. There are 300 MPA (Master of Public Administration) students.
 
Brookings Institution
 
The Brookings Institution, based in Washington, DC, is an independent, nonpartisan organization devoted to research, analysis, education, and publication focused on public policy issues in the areas of economics, foreign policy, and governance. The goal of Brookings activities is to improve the performance of American institutions and the quality of public policy by using social science to analyze emerging issues and to offer practical approaches to those issues in language aimed at the general public. In its conferences, publications, and other activities, Brookings serves as a bridge between scholarship and policymaking, bringing new knowledge to the attention of decision makers and affording scholars greater insight into public policy issues. The Institution's activities are carried out through three research programs (Economic Studies, Foreign Policy Studies, and Governance Studies), as well as through the Center for Public Policy Education and the Brookings Institution Press, which publishes about fifty books a year.
