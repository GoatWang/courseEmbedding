MINNEAPOLIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Arctic Cat Inc. (NASDAQ: ACAT) today announced two strategic hires into 
      newly created roles and a promotion, as the company builds its sales and 
      marketing capabilities for the future under new president and CEO, Chris 
      Metz. Effective immediately, Greg Williamson joins Arctic Cat as its 
      first-ever chief marketing officer, while Brit Reich joins as vice 
      president of North America sales. Mike Webster has been promoted to 
      director of North America sales.
    


      The roles of chief marketing officer and vice president of North America 
      sales have been created at a time when Arctic Cat is positioning itself 
      for future growth and an increased focus on customer engagement to drive 
      sales.
    

      “Greg joining Arctic Cat at this pivotal point elevates the importance 
      of marketing for the organization,” stated Metz. “I have witnessed 
      firsthand Greg’s strategic vision, mastery of the contemporary marketing 
      toolbox, and leadership qualities necessary to oversee and cultivate the 
      Arctic Cat brand.”
    

      In his new role as chief marketing officer, Williamson is responsible 
      for positioning the Arctic Cat brand to generate future growth and 
      develop a world-class, customer-focused organization that aligns the 
      company around brand and marketing strategies, and promotes consumer 
      awareness and engagement. In his former role as chief marketing officer 
      at Spectrum Brands, Home Improvement, he led the product, channel and 
      brand strategies for several industry-leading hardware brands, including 
      Kwikset, Baldwin, Weiser, and National Hardware. Williamson holds a B.A. 
      from Louisiana State University and an M.B.A. from the University of 
      Texas.
    

      Reich is responsible for developing and implementing sales and dealer 
      strategies to increase market share, and focus on geography-centric 
      initiatives, in his role as vice president of North America sales. These 
      initiatives include increasing product and brand recognition in local 
      markets where Arctic Cat believes it is underrepresented. Reich was 
      formerly the executive vice president of sales at American Recreation 
      Products, where he was responsible for global sales of outdoor equipment 
      and apparel, including Kelty, Sierra Designs, Slumberjack and Wenzel 
      brands, creating and executing go-to-market strategies. Reich holds a 
      B.A. from San Diego State University. “Brit is an experienced senior 
      sales leader, sharp business person and skilled collaborative problem 
      solver. Arctic Cat will benefit greatly from his leadership, insight and 
      work ethic,” said Metz.
    

      Also as part of Arctic Cat’s strategic sales and marketing moves, 
      Webster, who was formerly Arctic Cat’s Eastern region sales manager, was 
      promoted to director of North America sales. Webster has a strong track 
      record of identifying market growth opportunities and delivering 
      outstanding results. In his new role, Webster will oversee Arctic Cat’s 
      entire field sales force in the United States and Canada. Metz 
      commented, “Mike is a seasoned and respected sales veteran who has 
      extensive power sports industry experience and a history of success in 
      sales, dealer and market development.”

      widely recognized and respected in the recreational vehicle industry. 
      The company designs, engineers, manufactures and markets all-terrain 
      vehicles (ATVs), side-by-sides and snowmobiles, in addition to related
