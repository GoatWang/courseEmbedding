TEM Suite Invoice ManagementTelecom bills are often riddled with errors—it is not unusual for an enterprise to overpay by 10% – 15% each month. Escalating telecom expenses and services are driving invoice management automation tools and best practices.
MTS TEM Suite’s Invoice Management lets you drive down telecom costs by taking control of vendor invoices. MTS Invoice Management provides a truly comprehensive solution that goes beyond the traditional approach and is based on business process automation, best practices and robust auditing and optimization tools.
Start Cutting Costs Immediately
Automated invoice auditing against contracted rates at the transaction level, asset status, flagged transaction exceptions and rate variances; will quickly identify billing errors, cramming/slamming or unused assets. Sophisticated alerting mechanism notifies analysts of errors, disputes, invoices that have not arrived from your service provider and invoices payments which are due.
Identify and Resolve Contract Errors
Easily manage contract terms and rates and the system will automatically flag billing errors that are in conflict with your negotiated contract terms or rate variance thresholds.
Accounts Payable Integration
With MTS Invoice Management, paying invoices is as easy as it comes. Once an invoice is loaded and automatically audited, authorized personnel can access, approve (in full or in part), and transmit payment information to the Accounts Payable (A/P) system.
The result? Total control – from procure to pay, from contract to cost.

RA'ANANA, Israel and RIVER EDGE, N.J., June 30, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- MTS – Mer Telemanagement Solutions Ltd. (NASDAQ Capital Market: MTSL), a global provider of telecommunications expense management and enterprise mobility management solutions and video advertising solutions for online and mobile platforms, announced today that after submitting its plan to regain compliance with the minimum $2,500,000 in stockholders' equity requirement as set forth in NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 4320(e)(2)(B), it received a notice from the Listing Qualifications Department of NASDAQ advising that it has until August 15, 2017 to regain compliance.








The Company's plan to regain compliance with the minimum stockholders' equity requirement includes the conversion of $1.2 million of outstanding debt owed to the former shareholders of Vexigo Ltd. into equity and a proposed infusion of equity capital, subject to obtaining a tax pre-ruling and to corporate and regulatory approvals. The plan to regain compliance is detailed in the Company's Proxy Statement for its Annual General Meeting of Shareholders to be held on August 13, 2017, that was furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 29, 2017. Among the items to be voted on at the Annual Meeting is the approval of a proposed equity investment by certain current shareholders of the Company, including certain directors and a former officer. No assurance can be given that the Company will be successful in its efforts to regain compliance.
As previously announced, the Company has until August 21, 2017 to regain compliance with the $1.00 minimum bid price requirement of NASDAQ. If at any time prior to August 21, 2017, the closing bid price of the Company's ordinary shares is at least $1.00 for a minimum of ten consecutive business days, the Company will regain compliance. In the event the Company does not regain compliance, it may be eligible for an additional 180 calendar days' extension to regain compliance. To qualify, the Company will be required to meet the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares and all other listing standards for the Nasdaq Capital Market, with the exception of the bid price requirement, and will need to provide written notice of its intention to cure the deficiency during the second compliance period, by effecting a reverse stock split, if necessary. Shareholder ratification of a reverse split is also being sought at the August 13, 2017 Annual Meeting.

Mer Telemanagement Solutions Ltd. Receives Extension To Regain Compliance With NASDAQ's Minimum Stockholders' Equity Requirement









PR Newswire




Jun 30, 2017 11:28 AM EDT













 




























































 RA'ANANA, Israel and RIVER EDGE, N.J., June 30, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- MTS - Mer Telemanagement Solutions Ltd. (NASDAQ Capital Market: MTSL), a global provider of telecommunications expense management and enterprise mobility management solutions and video advertising solutions for online and mobile platforms, announced today that after submitting its plan to regain compliance with the minimum $2,500,000 in stockholders' equity requirement as set forth in NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 4320(e)(2)(B), it received a notice from the Listing Qualifications Department of NASDAQ advising that it has until August 15, 2017 to regain compliance. The Company's plan to regain compliance with the minimum stockholders' equity requirement includes the conversion of $1.2 million of outstanding debt owed to the former shareholders of Vexigo Ltd. into equity and a proposed infusion of equity capital, subject to obtaining a tax pre-ruling and to corporate and regulatory approvals. The plan to regain compliance is detailed in the Company's Proxy Statement for its Annual General Meeting of Shareholders to be held on August 13, 2017, that was furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 29, 2017. Among the items to be voted on at the Annual Meeting is the approval of a proposed equity investment by certain current shareholders of the Company, including certain directors and a former officer. No assurance can be given that the Company will be successful in its efforts to regain compliance. As previously announced, the Company has until August 21, 2017 to regain compliance with the $1.00 minimum bid price requirement of NASDAQ. If at any time prior to August 21, 2017, the closing bid price of the Company's ordinary shares is at least $1.00 for a minimum of ten consecutive business days, the Company will regain compliance. In the event the Company does not regain compliance, it may be eligible for an additional 180 calendar days' extension to regain compliance. To qualify, the Company will be required to meet the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares and all other listing standards for the Nasdaq Capital Market, with the exception of the bid price requirement, and will need to provide written notice of its intention to cure the deficiency during the second compliance period, by effecting a reverse stock split, if necessary. Shareholder ratification of a reverse split is also being sought at the August 13, 2017 Annual Meeting.   About MTS  Mer Telemanagement Solutions Ltd. (MTS) is a provider of video advertising solutions for online and mobile platforms through Vexigo as well as a provider of innovative products and services for telecom expense management (TEM) and enterprise mobility management (EMM).
