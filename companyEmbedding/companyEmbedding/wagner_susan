Early life and education[edit]
Born into a Jewish family, Wagner grew up in the Chicago area, graduated in 1982 with honors from Wellesley College with a BA in English and Economics, and earned an MBA in Finance from the University of Chicago in 1984.
Career[edit]
After earning her MBA, Wagner joined Lehman Brothers' investment banking unit in New York City. During her years at Lehman she worked on mergers and acquisitions, fixed income products, and developed her expertise in strategic acquisitions. In 1988 Wagner and her friend Ralph Schlosstein left Lehman to join Blackstone Financial Group. Later, Blackstone Financial Group changed their name to BlackRock.
As one of the founders of BlackRock, Wagner has served as Vice Chairman, Chief Operating Officer and orchestrated BlackRock's mergers and acquisitions, which included Quellos, Merrill Lynch Investment Management, and Barclays Global Investors. Prior to retiring from BlackRock, Wagner expanded the company into Asia, the Middle East and Brazil.[5] Since retiring from BlackRock, she serves on the BlackRock Board of Directors as well as serving as an officer and member of the board of trustees of the Hackley School.[6]
In May 2014 Wagner was asked by Wellesley's Class of 2014 to deliver the commencement address.[7]
In July 2014, Wagner was named to the board of Apple Inc., replacing long-time board member William Campbell.[8] Wagner is just the second woman on the Apple eight-member board and the only director with a strong financial background.[9]
Wagner leads the Nathan and Esther K. Wagner family foundation. She and her husband, Michael J. Lippitz, have been trustees since 2002. In addition to strengthening the Institute's presence in Chicago, Susan and her family helped launch and sustain Fikra Forum, an initiative of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. The Institute's English-Arabic blog supports Arab democrats in their struggle against authoritarians and extremists. In honor of their parents, Susan and her sisters supported the Institute's special research on Israel and U.S. national interests.[10]
Personal life[edit]
Wagner is married, a mother of three school-aged children, and lives in the suburbs of New York. She describes herself as a "down to earth New York commuter."

				Unique functional art adapted to your space. Tile Art is a way of transforming what would be a "pretty" installation into a beautifully striking surface. Themes can range from Modern to Rustic to Zen, or anywhere in between. Tile Art can be deployed on virtually any dry vertical surface, and will often find its way into kitchen or bar backsplashes. Entryways, fireplace surrounds and separator walls can also be wonderful locations for an artistically-accented statement.Tile Art is based on glass and brilliantly-finished cast stone (concrete), providing a range of colors and textures including a palette of lustrous metallics. Please contact Susan Wagner Designs for information on pricing and availability.

But before you start sending out dozens of emails and making phone calls, sit down and think about your project. What's your budget? What is the scope of your project? Will you need more than one type of professional to complete your home improvement project? Can you afford to complete the full project now, or should you tackle it bit by bit?Once you've settled on your project’s priorities, budget and scope, it's time to start researching home design professionals. Don't sell yourself short and settle on the first professional you set your sights on. Make sure that you're working with someone local, who can get to the jobsite easily and efficiently. Look into the person’s reviews, ask to speak with former clients and to see previous jobs in person. Take a good look at their portfolio photos: How similar are these projects to your own? Be honest — that mansion might look beautiful, but it might not have a lot in common with your little bungalow.Reach out to multiple professionals — especially for larger projects — and don't settle for the first bid you hear. Comparing multiple Santa Cruz, CA professionals' bids and experiences can help you find the one that’s best for you. Ask a lot of questions now, so you won't have unexpected answers later.Find a home design professional on Houzz. Narrow down your search by type of professional and location. Browse Santa Cruz, CA portfolio photos, read client reviews and contact each Santa Cruz, CA professional for more information.
