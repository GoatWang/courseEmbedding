VALLEY FORGE, Pa., June 16, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Vanguard today announced plans for its money market mutual fund lineup that will enable individual and institutional investors to continue to have access to cash management vehicles at a stable $1 net asset value (NAV). 
The moves are in response to rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2014, the last compliance date for which is in October 2016. 
"We are pleased to preserve Vanguard's money market funds as a stable-price cash management option for our individual and institutional clients," said Vanguard CEO Bill McNabb. "Our retail clients will continue to have the choice to invest in our taxable and tax-exempt money market funds, and all investors, including institutional clients, will be able to invest in our newly reopened Federal Money Market Fund."
Preserving access for individualsVanguard plans to designate its $133.4 billion Prime Money Market Fund and its six tax-exempt funds (one national and five state municipal money funds) as "retail funds," meaning that individual investors will continue to have access to these funds at a stable $1 NAV. 
In addition, Vanguard announced two name changes, effective December 2015:

Institutional Shares of Vanguard Prime Money Market Fund (ticker symbol: VMRXX) will be renamed Admiral Shares. 
Vanguard Admiral Treasury Money Market Fund (ticker symbol: VUSXX) will be renamed Vanguard Treasury Money Market Fund. 
An option for institutional investorsVanguard is reopening its $2.8 billion Federal Money Market Fund immediately. All investors, including institutional investors, will now have access to a money fund with a stable $1 NAV that will not be subject to new liquidity-fee or redemption-gate requirements.
Under the new rules, the SEC has defined U.S. government money funds as those that invest at least 99.5% (formerly 80%) of their total assets in cash, government securities, and/or repurchase agreements that are collateralized solely by government securities or cash. Such funds are excluded from the floating NAV requirements, as well as the new fee and gate requirements.
The Federal Money Market Fund and the $9.6 billion Treasury Money Market Fund currently invest more than 99.5% of their total assets in U.S. government securities or repurchase agreements, and plans to operate in accordance with the new definition of a government money market fund. The Treasury Money Market Fund will remain closed to new investors.
Money funds continue to play an important role for Vanguard clients, providing a high-quality, liquid investment (the funds invest in highly rated short-term investments) in periods of both stability and uncertainty in financial markets. Vanguard has managed money funds for 40 years as an integral part of its product lineup, and currently holds more than $174 billion in both taxable and tax-exempt money market funds.
About VanguardVanguard, headquartered in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, is one of the world's largest investment management companies. As of May 31, 2015, Vanguard managed more than $3.1 trillion in U.S. mutual fund assets, including more than $475 billion in ETF assets. The firm offers 159 funds to U.S. investors and more than 120 additional funds in non-U.S. markets. For more information, visit vanguard.com.
All asset figures are as of May 31, except where noted.
For more information about Vanguard funds, visit vanguard.com or call 800-662-7447 to obtain a prospectus. Investment objectives, risks, charges, expenses, and other important information about a fund are contained in the prospectus; read and consider it carefully before investing.
All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest.
An investment in a money market fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Although a money market fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in such a fund.

John Bogle era (1975–1996)
The Vanguard Group was an outcome of a 1974 corporate struggle at the Wellington Management Company that resulted in the firing of Wellington's CEO, John Bogle. Bogle appealed to the Wellington Company's mutual funds' board of directors to retain him as the funds' chairman and CEO. The board agreed, and a settlement was reached whereby a new firm, Vanguard, was established (May 1, 1975) to handle administrative and legal services for the funds. At it's founding, the firm had eleven funds, 28 employees,  372,648 investor accounts and provided an average expense ratio of 0.66%[5]
Over the next two years the new firm instituted a series of steps that reflected Bogle's vision of mutual fund management. The new firm was established as a mutual organization with the mutual funds (and by extension, fund shareholders) owning the management company, which would provide services to the funds at cost and reduce conflicts of interest.[6] (The SEC gave final approval of Vanguard's mutual form of business organization in 1981.)[7] In 1976, the firm created the first index fund available to retail investors, Vanguard Index Trust (now known as Vanguard 500 Index Fund). In 1977, the firm abandoned broker distribution and moved to no-load fund distribution. The year also saw the creation of a series of defined maturity bond funds (short term, intermediate term, and long term).[6]
Under John Bogle's direction (1975–1996), Vanguard became known for providing both low costs and clear direct communication with fund shareholders. In 1981 Vanguard began managing most of its fixed income funds in-house with the establishment of its Fixed Income Group.[5] The firm continued its development of index funds, bringing the first bond index fund to retail investors in 1986 and the first retail international index funds in 1990.[8]
The growth of employer-provided 401k plans led the firm to establish what was to become Vanguard Institutional in 1982. One year later, Bogle partnered with an outside brokerage firm (Pershing) to create Vanguard Brokerage Services (VBS) [9]. Bogle continued outside partnerships, this time with insurers (what is now Monumental Life Insurance Company,  and in New York, Transamerica Financial Life Insurance Company) to bring a no-load, no surrender fee, low-cost  variable annuity program to the firm in 1991. One of Bogle's final innovations was the creation of Vanguard's series of tax-managed funds in 1994. The following year the company added its investment advisory service (staffed with salaried certified financial planners).[5]
In 1996 John Bogle, nearing mandatory retirement age, transitioned management of Vanguard to his successor CEO, John Brennan. At the close of Bogle's stewardship, 
Vanguard had grown to 89 funds and 3,927 employees. The firm was managing 6,681,460 investor accounts at an average 0.31% expense ratio.[5]

John Brennan era (1996–2008)
 Vanguard headquarters, Malvern, PA.
Under the direction of John Brennan Vanguard began expanding its operations into international markets and offering additional investment services in an ever evolving financial world. The firm made a commitment to technology, culminating in the establishment of on-line trading in 1998.[5]
International expansion began in 1996 when Vanguard created Vanguard Investments Australia Ltd. to serve Australian investors. Over the next seven years additional international investment companies were created to serve other international domiciled investors.

1998 Investments Europe NA; 
2000 Investments Ltd. Japan;
2002 Services extended to Central and South America, as well as Canada;
2003 Services extended to Singapore[10]

In 2007, Vanguard surpassed the $100 billion mark in assets managed outside the US.[5]
In 1997 Vanguard launched its  donor-advised charity program, known as theVanguard Charitable Endowment Program .[11] The firm also became  a large player in the developing  529 savings plan market.
The advent and growing popularity of the ETF provided a growing competitive threat to Vanguard's index fund base. Vanguard responded to this competitive challenge by first offering a program of lower cost shares for certain qualifying investors (Admiral shares established in 2000). Over time the program was to be gradually liberalized to include more of the Vanguard shareholder base. After losing a legal case  with Standard and Poors concerning the licensing  of the S&P 500 index for a proposed ETF share class of the firm's 500 Index fund, Vanguard soon switched index tracking to MSCI indices and launched its own ETFs, originally called VIPERS (subsequently known as Vanguard ETFs). By the close of Brennan's tenure as CEO, Vanguard was the third largest manager of ETFs.
The firm expanded its offerings of annuities during this period, partnering with insurance companies to offer a deferred fixed annuity and establishing in 2003 a Single Premium Immediate Annuity (SPIA) with both variable and fixed income payout options. The company also opened two series of balanced fund of funds designed for retirement investing. The series of  Target Retirement Funds was launched in 2003. The series of Managed Payout funds opened in 2008.
By 2005 Vanguard was managing 130 funds and employing 11,205 people. The firm was managing 21,037,532 shareholder accounts at an average expense ratio of 0.21%.[5]
John Brennan stepped down as Vanguard CEO in 2008, transitioning the firm's direction to William McNabb.

William McNabb era (2008-2017)
 Vanguard worldwide diversified asset base
2009–2012
Recent developments at Vanguard have seen evolutionary changes in existing programs. In 2009 Vanguard Brokerage service ended its partnership arrangement with Pershing, as Vanguard decided to run the brokerage internally.[12]  The year also marked the expansion of the company's  international fund management operations to  investors in the United Kingdom when Vanguard opened Vanguard Investments UK Ltd.[13] International expansion continued when Vanguard announced on June 6, 2011, the opening of Vanguard Investments Canada Inc.[14]
In 2010 the company cut the cost of investing for its mutual fund and exchange traded fund shareholders by a broad expansion of lower cost Admiral shares ($10,000 minimum investment) in most of the company's index fund offerings, and by VBS granting commission free transactions on Vanguard ETF transactions.[15] Vanguard also greatly expanded its ETF offerings  by launching a suite of new ETFs based on S&P and Russell US stock indices.[16]
The year also saw Vanguard replace its fixed deferred annuity product with a new service designed to bring to investors cost transparency and institutional pricing for deferred and immediate fixed annuities. The new service,  Vanguard Annuity Access™, is offered in collaboration with Hueler Investment Services, Inc. through that firm's Income Solutions platform.[17]

2013–2017
In October 2013, in a bid to lower costs, Vanguard announced a change in index providers for many of its US and international index funds. The firm switched from MSCI benchmarks to CRSP and FTSE indexes.
In 2014, continued strong asset accumulation at Vanguard brought global assets under management to 3.1 trillion dollars. Such asset accumulation meant that by year-end Vanguard:

 Became the second largest provider of exchange-traded funds, trailing only Blackrock iShares as a provider.
 Became the largest provider of defined contribution plans in the U.S.
 Became the largest provider of target date retirement funds.[18]
The firm announced a new investment advisory program, Personal Advisor Services, designed to offer investors professional investment advice from certified financial planners at a 0.30% asset under management fee.[18]
At year-end 2014, Vanguard was managing 3.1 trillion dollars of investor assets at an asset weighted expense of 0.14% of assets. The firm employed over 14,000 employees.[18]

Vanguard performance
The Vanguard Group's family wide investment performance, as measured by fund rating services, has been above average.

Vanguard reports the percentage number of its funds surpassing the returns of Lipper peer group averages over one, three, five, and ten year periods. The first tab in the following table provides results as of year-end 2014.[19]
Morningstar rates fund family investment performance by scoring a firm's asset weighted fund's star ratings within an asset class (US stocks; international stocks; taxable bonds; municipal bonds)  and scoring them on a 1 to 5 rating scale, with one representing the lowest rating; five the highest.
A score below 2.5 is an indication that the firm has met with little success in that asset class. A score between 2.5 and 3.5 indicates the firm is about average. A score above 3.5 indicates the firm has a fair amount of prowess. The more funds a firm manages in an asset class, the stronger a signal the Fund Family Score is about the firm's performance.[20]
The Morningstar measure as of the end of the third quarter of 2013[21] can be accessed on the second tab of Table 2.

Problematic Vanguard initiatives
This section requires expansion.  (December 2012)
Not all of Vanguard's initiatives have proved successful. Some programs have been shuttered. Some mutual funds have been liquidated or merged out of existence into other mutual funds. While not a recognition of failure, Vanguard has at times radically changed a given fund's fundamental investment mandate so that the fund no longer provides investors with the originally designed sector coverage.

Program liquidations
Vanguard's first forays into providing equity real estate investments for investors were the offering of two finite-lived equity REIT stocks, listed originally on the Amex exchange. The Vanguard Real Estate Fund I was offered in 1986[22] and the Vanguard Real Estate Fund II was offered in 1987[23]. These stocks were designed to invest in commercial real estate properties but liquidate between years seven and twelve. The offerings coincided with a down cycle in the real estate markets (concurrent with the savings and loans scandals and real estate tax reform). Returns on the stocks at liquidation were modest. By 1996, growth in the equity REIT market made it feasible for Vanguard to introduce an Equity REIT index fund.
In the fall of 2001, Vanguard expanded its insurance program by offering the Vanguard® Term Insurance Program to its shareholder base. The program offered 10- or 20-year level-premium term insurance with coverage amounts ranging from $100,000 to $10 million.[24] In 2005 Vanguard closed down the program, citing that the plan was not cost effective.[25]

Fund liquidations
The following table shows Vanguard funds that have been merged or liquidated from existence. Fund mergers or liquidations are the primary actions a mutual fund company takes to eliminate poor performing or small net asset funds. However one should note that some of Vanguard's fund mergers (Treasury money market fund and the Institutional bond and developed market funds) were taken to consolidate identical funds into a single fund in order to gain management and cost efficiencies, and that the liquidation/merger of the Preferred Stock and the Insured Tax Exempt funds were due to significant structural changes --tax rate changes on preferred stocks and municipal bond insurance firm bankruptcies-- in the funds' underlying asset classes.

Fund mandate changes
Vanguard occasionally makes mandate changes in a fund's investment objective that radically affects the fund's representation of an asset class. Two such changes in Vanguard sector funds devoted to utilities and gold stocks essentially negated these funds' applicability for defined sector allocation strategies.
In early 2002 shareholders approved a Vanguard proposal to change the mandate of the Vanguard Utilities fund into a Dividend Growth Fund:

As part of the  proposals,  the fund would no longer invest at least 80% of
its assets in common stocks of utility companies.  Instead, it would invest in a
wide range of companies from various  industries.  The fund, renamed Vanguard(R)
Dividend  Growth  Fund,  would not be  permitted  to invest more than 25% of its
assets in any single  industry.  Shareholders  are also being asked to approve a
new  investment  objective  for the fund: to provide  above-average  income and,

secondarily, to provide long-term growth of capital and income.[27]
Curiously, Vanguard was to create a Utilities ETF in 2004. 
In 2004 Vanguard broadened the mandate of the Vanguard Precious Metals fund to include base metal and other materials mining stocks.[28] The move essentially ended the fund's applicability as an allocation in gold equity.

Index funds could help lower long-term costs
Get the high quality and low costs you'd expect from the company that introduced indexing to individual investors.
What are index mutual funds?



Instead of hiring fund managers to actively select which stocks or bonds the fund will hold, an index fund buys all (or a representative sample) of the securities in a specific index, like the S&P 500 Index.The goal of an index fund is to track the performance of a specific market benchmark as closely as possible. That's why you may hear it referred to as a "passively managed" fund.

Index funds offer built-in benefits








Low costs
Because index funds hold investments until the index itself changes, they generally have lower management and transaction costs.
 




Lower risk through broader diversification
Some index funds give you exposure to potentially thousands of securities in a single fund.
 




Tax efficiency
Broad index funds generally don't trade as much as actively managed funds might, so they're typically generating less taxable income, which reduces the drag on your investments.
 
Compare index funds vs. actively managed funds 

Could actively managed funds help you beat the market?

Active bond fund managers

	All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss in a declining market. Bond funds are subject to the risk that an issuer will fail to make payments on time and that bond prices will decline because of rising interest rates or negative perceptions of an issuer's ability to make payments. Investments in stocks issued by non-U.S. companies are subject to risks including country/regional risk, which is the chance that political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters will adversely affect the value of securities issued by companies in foreign countries or regions; and currency risk, which is the chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates. Funds that concentrate on a relatively narrow market sector face the risk of higher share-price volatility. Past performance is no guarantee of future returns. The performance of an index is not an exact representation of any particular investment, as you cannot invest directly in an index.

Broad index funds generally don't trade as much as actively managed funds might, so they're typically generating less taxable income, which reduces the drag on your investments.

	All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss in a declining market. Bond funds are subject to the risk that an issuer will fail to make payments on time and that bond prices will decline because of rising interest rates or negative perceptions of an issuer's ability to make payments. Investments in stocks issued by non-U.S. companies are subject to risks including country/regional risk, which is the chance that political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters will adversely affect the value of securities issued by companies in foreign countries or regions; and currency risk, which is the chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates. Funds that concentrate on a relatively narrow market sector face the risk of higher share-price volatility. Past performance is no guarantee of future returns. The performance of an index is not an exact representation of any particular investment, as you cannot invest directly in an index.

Vanguard stock funds


93% of our low-cost stock mutual funds performed better than their peer-group averages over the past 10 years.*




Give your money a chance to grow over the long term
Get higher potential for investment growth



Stock mutual funds aim to provide long-term growth, unlike bond funds, which focus on income. In exchange for more growth, however, you're likely to experience more ups and downs in the value of your investment.

Increase diversification in your portfolio



A stock fund could give you access to hundreds—sometimes thousands—of stocks, which spreads out risk more than owning individual stocks.

Get broad exposure to the stock markets



You can use just a few funds to complete the stock portion of your portfolio. Each of these index funds gives you access to a wide variety of stocks in a single, diversified fund.

Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund holds more than 3,000 domestic stocks.

Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund holds more than 5,500 non-U.S. stocks.

How to choose a stock fund



Here are a few questions to ask yourself while you're considering the right Vanguard stock fund for your portfolio:

How do stock mutual funds differ from one another?



When looking for a stock fund, consider these two characteristics:

Investing style. In general, stock funds invest in value stocks, growth stocks, or a blend of the two.

Capitalization. Stock funds also choose investments based on the size, or capitalization, of a company. Companies are considered either small-, mid-, or large-cap.


See a complete list of Vanguard stock funds


Do I want domestic or international stocks?








Investing in both U.S. and international stock funds can add another level of diversification to an already well-balanced portfolio.

Would I prefer index or active funds?



Do you feel more comfortable tracking the market, or would you rather try to beat it?

Index funds try to track the performance of a specific market benchmark.

Actively managed funds are steered by our expert portfolio managers who select specific securities for the fund. While actively managed funds give you a chance to beat the benchmark, they can also underperform.


Compare index funds vs. actively managed funds


Should I focus on a specific industry?



You can choose a fund that invests solely in a specific sector of the market, like health care, technology, or telecommunications.But remember, these funds have a very narrow focus and expose you to more risk. Sector and specialty funds should only be used to supplement an already diversified portfolio.

What is an ETF?



The simplest definition of an exchange-traded fund, or ETF, is that it's an investment that's built like a mutual fund but trades like an individual stock.The most common ETFs are designed to track the performance of a market benchmark, or "index."

Enjoy the same built-in benefits of mutual funds








Diversification
One fund can hold potentially hundreds—sometimes thousands—of individual stocks and bonds, which helps spread out risk.
 




Professional management
You don't have to keep track of every single investment your ETF owns. The fund is managed by fund experts who take care of that for you.
 

Get more control with ETFs—at lower costs








While ETFs are in many ways the same as mutual funds, there are some features that make them unique.Trading flexibility
ETFs offer you the same intraday pricing you get when trading stocks and bonds through a broker on a major stock exchange.Lower cost
Funds that track an index, like ETFs and index mutual funds, generally offer lower expense ratios than conventional mutual funds.Tax savings
Like index mutual funds, ETFs are typically more tax-efficient, which could translate into tax savings for you.Lower minimums
You can buy an ETF for as low as the cost of one share—giving you the opportunity to start investing in a diversified investment with less money.
See how low-cost, commission-free ETFs are just the start

You must buy and sell Vanguard ETF Shares through a broker like Vanguard Brokerage Services (we offer them commission-free) or through another broker (you may incur commissions). See the Vanguard Brokerage Services commission and fee schedules for limits. Vanguard ETF Shares aren't redeemable directly with the issuing fund other than very large aggregations worth millions of dollars. Like stocks, ETFs are subject to market volatility. When buying or selling an ETF, you'll pay or receive the current market price, which may be more or less than net asset value.

Layer opened.Read the transcript







Liz Tammaro: So we received quite a few questions in advance when you all registered for this webcast. We're going to get started with our first question and, Jim, I'm going to give this one to you. So it makes a lot of sense before we get started, let's define what is an ETF. Jim Rowley: Simply put, an ETF is an exchange-traded fund, right− It's a pooled investment vehicle that acquires or disposes of securities. Investors own a pro rata share of the assets in that fund. The fund issues new shares or redeems existing shares to meet investor demand. Furthermore, and I should say providing some type of an investment exposure to those advisors, whether it's an index in particular or a market strategy. And when you think about even more so what makes them similar to mutual funds is that the majority of ETFs are organized and regulated as investment companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940. And that's the same regulatory regime under which mutual funds operate. So for all the discussions sometimes we hear about differences between mutual funds and ETFs, they're overwhelmingly similar actually. Liz Tammaro: And even thinking about that, we can talk about maybe what are some of the benefits of the mutual fund versus an ETF or, sorry, even vice versa, ETF versus mutual fund. And even maybe what are some of the disadvantages. Jim Rowley: I'll take that because I think I don't necessarily like the word disadvantage. I think differences is maybe the more appropriate term. And we just addressed some of the similarities between ETFs and mutual funds, so it's maybe more important to know what are the actual differences. And really the differences come down to two major items and they both relate to how investors transact in shares of those funds, right− We're talking about exchange-traded funds. ETF investors they trade with each other on exchange in terms of buying or selling their securities, and the price that they get is a tradeable market price. Mutual fund investors, on the other hand, they are buying and selling their shares directly with the fund and they might do that through some type of intermediary but it's back and forth with the fund itself and they get an end-of-day NAV. So we think about all the similarities and, again, sometimes there's a discussion about how different they are; but, really, the differences come down to those two items. It's trading on exchange versus direct with the fund and it's trading at a market price rather than getting the end-of-day NAV. Jim Rowley: I think we actually have a great way to illustrate that. I think we have a chart that addresses that point that Doug was talking about that ETFs are overwhelming. They just happen to be index funds. And when the chart comes up, a simple way to illustrate this is we look at expense ratios. But instead of breaking them down by ETF versus mutual fund, we break them down by index fund versus nonindex fund separated into ETF and mutual fund. And when you see the expense ratios, you see that given an indexing strategy, whether it's a mutual fund or an ETF, the expense ratios tend to be lower than they are for the nonindex strategies, whether it's an ETF or a mutual fund. So it has a lot more to do with whether or not it's an indexing strategy than whether or not it's an ETF or a mutual fund. Liz Tammaro: And similar to that question, we have another one that's come in from Bruce asking about how easy is it to buy and/or sell an ETF versus a mutual fund− Jim Rowley: A lot of moving parts in that question because I think the default has always been mutual funds because they've been around longer. So it becomes a lot of a comfort decision in many ways where purchasing a mutual fund is usually done in dollars. You put your orders in in dollar terms. You're happy to hit the enter button on your keyboard because you know at the end of the day your order is going to execute at the end of the day with a 4 PM NAV. You might be able to get fractional shares because your order gets rounded up into dollars and the mutual fund takes care of the automatic reinvestment for you. With an ETF, investors need to be aware of transacting through their brokerage account. And now the dynamic might be a little bit different because you have to put your order in in shares, mutually speaking. There's no fractionals there. When you put your order in shares, you get a corresponding dollar amount rather than put the order in dollars and you get a corresponding share amount. So, you know, the ease comes with a comfort level that a particular individual might choose or have a preference for doing. Important information All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss. For more information about Vanguard funds or Vanguard ETFs, visit vanguard.com, or call 877-662-7447, to obtain a prospectus. Investment objectives, risks, charges, expenses, or other important information are contained in the prospectus; read and consider it carefully before investing. Vanguard ETF Shares are not redeemable with the issuing Fund other than in very large aggregations worth millions of dollars. Instead, investors must buy and sell Vanguard ETF Shares in the secondary market and hold those shares in a brokerage account. In doing so, the investor may incur brokerage commissions and may pay more than net asset value when buying and receive less than net asset value when selling.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:

How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
