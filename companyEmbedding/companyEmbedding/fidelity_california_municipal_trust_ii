Before investing, consider the funds' investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.







Past performance is no guarantee of future results.



Diversification and asset allocation do not ensure a profit or guarantee against loss.


          * Fidelity's goal is to make financial expertise broadly accessible and effective in helping people live the lives they want. With assets under administration of $5.6 trillion, including managed assets of $2.1 trillion as of September 30, 2016, we focus on meeting the unique needs of a diverse set of customers: helping more than 24 million people invest their own life savings, nearly 20,000 businesses manage employee benefit programs, as well as providing nearly 10,000 advisory firms with technology solutions to invest their own clients' money.
	
    

          1. Fidelity Management & Research Company and Fidelity Institutional Asset Management, as of 9/30/16. Data is unaudited. These figures reflect the resources of Fidelity Management & Research Company, a U.S. company, and its subsidiaries. Research professionals include portfolio managers, research analysts and research associates.
	
    

          2. Highly rated funds are defined as those funds that have a 4- or 5-Star Morningstar rating. For each fund, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar RatingTM metric each month by subtracting the return on a 90-day U.S. Treasury Bill from the fund's load-adjusted return for the same period, and then adjusting this excess return for risk. The top 10% of funds in each broad asset class receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.) Although gathered from reliable sources, data completeness and accuracy cannot be guaranteed by Morningstar.
	
    

          3. You could lose money by investing in a money market fund. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Fidelity Investments and its affiliates, the fund’s sponsor, have no legal obligation to provide financial support to the fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the fund at any time. Fidelity's government and U.S. Treasury money market funds will not impose a fee upon the sale of your shares, nor temporarily suspend your ability to sell shares if the fund's weekly liquid assets fall below 30% of its total assets because of market conditions or other factors.
	
    

          4. You could lose money by investing in a money market fund. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. The fund may impose a fee upon the sale of your shares or may temporarily suspend your ability to sell shares if the Fund's liquidity falls below required minimums because of market conditions or other factors. An investment in the fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Fidelity Investments and its affiliates, the fund's sponsor, have no legal obligation to provide financial support to the fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the fund at any time.


          5. You could lose money by investing in a money market fund. Because the share price of the fund will fluctuate, when you sell your shares they may be worth more or less than what you originally paid for them. The fund may impose a fee upon the sale of your shares or may temporarily suspend your ability to sell shares if the fund's liquidity falls below required minimums because of market conditions or other factors. An investment in the fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Fidelity Investments and its affiliates, the fund's sponsor, have no legal obligation to provide financial support to the fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the fund at any time.


Because of their narrow focus, sector investments tend to be more volatile than investments that diversify across many sectors and companies.


          Foreign securities are subject to interest rate, currency exchange rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.
	
    

The securities of smaller, less well known companies can be more volatile than those of larger companies.


Because of their narrow focus, sector investments tend to be more volatile than investments that diversify across many sectors and companies.


In general, the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk, liquidity risk, call risk, and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a maturity date, so holding them until maturity to avoid losses caused by price volatility is not possible.



Indexes are unmanaged. It is not possible to invest directly in an index.

(photo_of_Edward_C_Johnson_3d)                                                  
DEAR SHAREHOLDER:                                                               
Although financial turmoil in Pacific Basin countries was a catalyst            
for significant volatility in U.S. markets in late October and into             
November, the Standard & Poor's 500 Index has risen more than 31%               
year-to-date, almost three times its historical annual average.                 
Meanwhile, bond markets - primarily influenced by a relatively steady           
flow of positive news on the inflation front - continued to post solid          
returns through the first 11 months of 1997.                                    
While it's impossible to predict the future direction of the markets            
with any degree of certainty, there are certain basic principles that           
can help investors plan for their future needs.                                 
First, investors are encouraged to take a long-term view of their               
portfolios. If you can afford to leave your money invested through the          
inevitable up and down cycles of the financial markets, you will                
greatly reduce your vulnerability to any single decline. We know from           
experience, for example, that stock prices have gone up over longer             
periods of time, have significantly outperformed other types of                 
investments and have stayed ahead of inflation.                                 
Second, you can further manage your investing risk through                      
diversification. A stock mutual fund, for instance, is already                  
diversified, because it invests in many different companies. You can            
increase your diversification further by investing in a number of               
different stock funds, or in such other investment categories as                
bonds. You should also keep money you'll need in the near future in a           
more stable investment.                                                         
Finally, no matter what your time horizon or portfolio diversity, it            
makes good sense to follow a regular investment plan, investing a               
certain amount of money in a fund at the same time each month or                
quarter and periodically reviewing your overall portfolio. By doing             
so, you won't get caught up in the excitement of a rapidly rising               
market, nor will you buy all your shares at market highs. While this            
strategy - known as dollar cost averaging - won't assure a profit or            
protect you from a loss in a declining market, it should help you               
lower the average cost of your purchases.                                       
If you have questions, please call us at 1-800-544-8888. We are                 
available 24 hours a day, seven days a week to provide you the                  
information you need to make the investments that are right for you.            
Best regards,                                                                   
Edward C. Johnson 3d                                                            
PERFORMANCE: THE BOTTOM LINE                                                    

To evaluate a money market fund's historical performance, you can look          
at either total return or yield. Total return reflects the change in            
the value of an investment, assuming reinvestment of the fund's                 
dividend income. Yield measures the income paid by a fund. Since a              
money market fund tries to maintain a $1 share price, yield is an               
important measure of performance. If Fidelity had not reimbursed                
certain fund expenses, the life of fund total return would have been            
lower.

CUMULATIVE TOTAL RETURNS show the fund's performance in percentage              
terms over a set period - in this case, one year, five years or since           
the fund started on March 17, 1988. For example, if you had invested            
$1,000 in a fund that had a 5% return over the past year, the value of          
your investment would be $1,050. To measure how the fund's performance          
stacked up against its peers, you can compare it to the New Jersey              
tax-free money market funds average, which reflects the performance of          
municipal money market funds with similar objectives tracked by IBC             
Financial Data, Inc. The past one year average represents a peer group          
of 13 money market funds. (The periods covered by IBC Financial Data,           
Inc. numbers are the closest available match to those covered by the

YIELD refers to the income paid by the fund over a given period.                
Yields for money market funds are usually for seven-day periods,                
expressed as annual percentage rates. A yield that assumes income               
earned is reinvested or compounded is called an effective yield. The            
chart above shows the fund's current seven-day yield at quarterly               
intervals over the past year. You can compare these yields to the New           
Jersey tax-free money market funds average. Or you can look at the              
fund's tax-equivalent yield, which is based on a combined effective             
1997 federal and state income tax rate of 40.08%. A portion of the              
fund's income may be subject to the alternative minimum tax. Figures

Yields on tax-free investments                                                  
are usually lower than yields on                                                
taxable investments. However, a                                                 
straight comparison between the                                                 
two may be misleading because                                                   
it ignores the way taxes reduce                                                 
taxable returns. Tax-equivalent

have to earn on a similar taxable                                               
investment to match the tax-free                                                
yield - makes the comparison                                                    
more meaningful. Keep in mind                                                   
that the U.S. government neither                                                
insures nor guarantees a money

assurance that a money fund

FUND TALK: THE MANAGER'S OVERVIEW                                               

An interview with Scott Orr, Portfolio Manager of Fidelity New Jersey           
Municipal Money Market Fund                                                     
Q. SCOTT, WHAT WAS THE INVESTING ENVIRONMENT LIKE OVER THE PAST 12              
MONTHS?                                                                         
A. During the first several months of the period, investors tried to            
figure out when the Federal Reserve Board might raise the fed funds             
rate, which is the rate banks charge each other for overnight loans.            
Over that period, data showed growth in the economy, but the pace of            
that growth was inconsistent and there were no signs of inflation. As           
a result, the Fed kept the fed funds rate steady at 5.25%. In February          
and March, however, signs that the economy was growing at a stronger            
clip changed market sentiment. Expectations of a rate increase                  
culminated in the Fed's announcement at its March 25 meeting that it            
had increased the fed funds rate from 5.25% to 5.50%. For the next              
month or so, the market expected the Fed to continue to raise rates.            
However, at its May meeting, the Fed decided to hold off because                
economic growth had moderated and inflation was still benign.                   
Q. WHAT'S HAPPENED SINCE THEN?                                                  
A. Economic activity was moderate to fairly strong, but inflation               
remained in check. The Fed opted to keep rates unchanged, but remained          
biased toward raising rates if signs of stronger inflation emerge. In           
fact, in mid-October, several Fed officials made comments indicating            
that they were thinking of raising rates in order to slow the economy.          
However, that was before economic and  market turmoil hit Southeast             
Asia in late October and continued through November. Because of this            
instability in the global financial markets, it now appears that the            
Fed will hold off raising rates in order to avoid roiling the markets           
and causing more anxiety. As a result, most market participants feel            
the Fed will wait until the market disruption in Asia moderates before          
deciding if a strong U.S. domestic economy still warrants a rate                
increase.                                                                       
Q. WHAT WAS THE FUND'S STRATEGY DURING THIS PERIOD?                             
A. For most of the period, the environment was one in which we                  
expected rates to be higher in the ensuing months. As a result, part            
of our strategy was to invest in variable-rate securities because they          
move up or down with changes in interest rates. At the same time, we            
sought to buy fixed-rate notes when they were expected to provide a             
higher yield than variable-rate securities over the terms of the                
notes. In the New Jersey market, fixed-rate instruments often offer a           
yield advantage over variable-rate notes because there is much                  
stronger demand for the latter. As a result of focusing more on                 
longer-term, fixed-rate securities in order to pick up extra yield,             
the fund tended to maintain an average maturity in the 60-70 day                
range. Since September, though, the maturity has come down somewhat             
because variable-rate securities and new short-term issues became more          
attractive. As a result, the average maturity was down to 50 days as            
of November 30.                                                                 
Q. HOW DID THE FUND PERFORM?                                                    
A. The fund's seven-day yield on November 30, 1997, was 3.24%,                  
compared to 3.19% six months ago. The more recent seven-day yield was           
the equivalent of a 5.41% taxable rate of return for New Jersey                 
investors in the 40.08% combined state and federal income tax bracket.          
Through November 30, 1997, the fund's 12-month total return was 3.03%,          
compared to 3.00% for the New Jersey tax-free money market funds                
average, according to IBC Financial Data, Inc.                                  
Q. WHAT'S YOUR OUTLOOK?                                                         
A. Over the next several months, I believe the Fed will still be                
biased toward raising rates, and that it is looking for reasons to do           
so. At this point, the Fed has held off raising rates in spite of the           
strength of the economy, because inflation has remained under control           
and the uncertainty created in global financial markets from the                
fallout in Asia has continued. With any inkling of inflationary                 
pressures, however, I believe the Fed would pull the trigger and raise          
the fed funds rate at least one more time. As a result, I'm managing            
the fund with the expectation that that will happen, although the               
timing of a rate increase is unclear. A rate increase in the next few           
months may help the U.S. economy, but it might send the worldwide               
financial markets into an uproar. Therefore, I think the Fed would              
like Asian markets to stabilize before it takes action.

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES.                                             
Fidelity New Jersey Municipal Money Market Fund (the fund) is a fund            
of Fidelity Court Street Trust II (the trust) and is authorized to              
issue an unlimited number of shares. The trust is registered under the          
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act), as an                
open-end management investment company organized as a Delaware                  
business trust. The financial statements have been prepared in                  
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles which permit           
management to make certain estimates and assumptions at the date of             
the financial statements. The following summarizes the significant              
accounting policies of the fund:                                                
SECURITY VALUATION. As permitted under Rule 2a-7 of the 1940 Act, and           
certain conditions therein, securities are valued initially at cost             
and thereafter assume a constant amortization to maturity of any                
discount or premium.                                                            
INCOME TAXES. As a qualified regulated investment company under                 
Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code, the fund is not subject to           
income taxes to the extent that it distributes substantially all of             
its taxable income for its fiscal year. The schedule of investments             
includes information regarding income taxes under the caption "Income           
Tax Information."                                                               
INTEREST INCOME. Interest income, which includes amortization of                
premium and accretion of original issue discount, is accrued as                 
earned. Accretion of market discount represents unrealized gain until           
realized at the time of a security disposition or maturity.                     
EXPENSES. Most expenses of the trust can be directly attributed to a            
fund. Expenses which cannot be directly attributed are apportioned              
between the funds in the trust.                                                 
DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS. Dividends are declared daily and paid            
monthly from net interest income.                                               
SECURITY TRANSACTIONS. Security transactions are accounted for as of            
trade date. Gains and losses on securities sold are determined on the           
basis of identified cost.                                                       
2. OPERATING POLICIES.                                                          
MUNICIPAL CENTRAL CASH FUND. Pursuant to an Exemptive Order issued by           
the Securities and Exchange Commission(the SEC), the fund may invest            
in the Municipal Central Cash Fund (the Cash Fund) managed by FMR               
Texas Inc. an affiliate of Fidelity Management & Research Company               
(FMR). The Cash Fund is an open-end money market fund available only            
to investment companies and other accounts managed by FMR and its               
affiliates. The Cash Fund seeks preservation of capital, liquidity,             
and current income by investing in high-quality, short-term municipal           
securities of various states and municipalities. Income distributions           
from the Cash Fund are declared daily and paid monthly from net                 
interest income. Income distributions received by the fund are                  
recorded as interest income in the accompanying financial statements.           
2. OPERATING POLICIES -                                                         
CONTINUED                                                                       
DELAYED DELIVERY TRANSACTIONS. The fund may purchase or sell                    
securities on a delayed delivery basis. Payment and delivery may take           
place a month or more after the date of the transaction. The price of           
the underlying securities and the date when the securities will be              
delivered and paid for are fixed at the time the transaction is                 
negotiated. With respect to purchase commitments, the fund identifies           
securities as segregated in its custodial records with a value at               
least equal to the amount of the commitment. Losses may arise due to            
changes in the market value of the underlying securities or if the              
counterparty does not perform under the contract.                               
RESTRICTED SECURITIES. The fund is permitted to invest in securities            
that are subject to legal or contractual restrictions on resale. These          
securities generally may be resold in transactions exempt from                  
registration or to the public if the securities are registered.                 
Disposal of these securities may involve time-consuming negotiations            
and expense, and prompt sale at an acceptable price may be difficult.           
At the end of the period, restricted securities (excluding 144A                 
issues) amounted to $33,900,000 or 7.0% of net assets.                          
3. FEES AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES.                                 
MANAGEMENT FEE. As the fund's investment adviser, FMR receives a                
monthly fee that is calculated on the basis of a group fee rate plus a          
fixed individual fund fee rate applied to the average net assets of             
the fund. The group fee rate is the weighted average of a series of             
rates and is based on the monthly average net assets of all the mutual          
funds advised by FMR. The rates ranged from .1100% to .3700% for the            
period.  The annual individual fund fee rate is .25%. In the event              
that these rates were lower than the contractual rates in effect                
during the period, FMR voluntarily implemented the above rates, as              
they resulted in the same or a lower management fee. For the period,            
the management fee was equivalent to an annual rate of .39% of average          
net assets.                                                                     
SUB-ADVISER FEE. As the fund's investment sub-adviser, FMR Texas Inc.,          
a wholly owned subsidiary of FMR, receives a fee from FMR of 50% of             
the management fee payable to FMR. The fee is paid prior to any                 
voluntary expense reimbursements which may be in effect.                        
TRANSFER AGENT AND ACCOUNTING FEES. UMB Bank, n.a. (UMB) is the                 
custodian and transfer and shareholder servicing agent for the fund.            
UMB has entered into a sub-contract with Fidelity Service Company,              
Inc. (FSC), an affiliate of FMR, under which FSC performs the                   
activities associated with the fund's transfer and shareholder                  
servicing agent and accounting functions. The fund pays account fees            
and asset-based fees that vary according to account size and type of            
account. FSC pays for typesetting, printing and mailing of all                  
shareholder reports, except proxy statements. The accounting fee is             
based on the level of average net assets for the month plus                     
3. FEES AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES -                                
CONTINUED                                                                       
TRANSFER AGENT AND ACCOUNTING                                                   
FEES - CONTINUED                                                                
out-of-pocket expenses. For the period, FSC received transfer agent             
and accounting fees amounting to $831,528 and $93,106, respectively.            
For the period, the transfer agent fees were equivalent to an annual            
rate of .18% of average net assets.                                             
Shareholders participating in the Fidelity Ultra Service                        
Account(registered trademark) Program (the Program) paid a $5.00                
monthly fee to Fidelity Brokerage Services, Inc. (FBSI), an affiliate           
of FMR, for performing services associated with the Program. For the            
period, fees paid to FBSI by shareholders participating in the Program          
amounted to $33,909. Effective September 1, 1997, the monthly fee was           
eliminated.                                                                     
4. EXPENSE REDUCTIONS.                                                          
FMR has entered into an arrangement on behalf of the fund with the              
fund's transfer agent whereby credits realized as a result of                   
uninvested cash balances were used to reduce a portion of the fund's            
expenses. During the period, the fund's expenses were reduced by                
$6,468 under this arrangement.                                                  
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS                                               

To the Trustees of Fidelity Court Street Trust II and the Shareholders          
of Fidelity New Jersey Municipal Money Market Fund:                             
We have audited the accompanying statement  of assets and liabilities           
of Fidelity Court Street Trust II: Fidelity New Jersey Municipal Money          
Market Fund, including the schedule of portfolio investments, as of             
November 30, 1997, and the related statement  of operations for the             
year then ended, the statement  of changes in net assets for each of            
the two years in the period then ended and the financial highlights             
for each of the five years in the period then ended. These financial            
statements and financial highlights are the responsibility of the               
fund's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on               
these financial statements and financial highlights based on our                
audits.                                                                         
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing          
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit           
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements           
and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. An audit            
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts            
and disclosures in the financial statements. Our procedures included            
confirmation of securities owned as of November 30, 1997 by                     
correspondence with the custodian. An audit also includes assessing             
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by                
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement               
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis             
for our opinion.                                                                
In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights               
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the                 
financial position of Fidelity Court Street Trust II: Fidelity New              
Jersey Municipal Money Market Fund as of November 30, 1997, the                 
results of its operations for the year then ended, the changes in its           
net assets for each of the two years in the period then ended, and the          
financial highlights for each of the five years in the period then              
ended, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
