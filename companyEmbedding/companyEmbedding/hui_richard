Shorty, Richard



Cultural Background: Northern Tuchone Nation, Yukon
Richard was born in Whitehorse, Yukon Territory in 1959 and belongs to Northern Tuchone Tribe. Richard is a self taught artist. He originally started painting wildlife at an early age along with painting his favorite rock star or sports idol. In 1978, Richard moved to Vancouver.
In the early 1980’s, Richard started painting West Coast Native design and soon developed his own distinct, style, using the wildlife form of the animal and adding his native design on the inside of the form. By now, stores were asking for and purchasing his work.
Over the years, Richard has moved around – Vancouver Island, Richmond, Whitehorse, always returning to Vancouver. Today, Richard is one of the most sought after Native artists, with works in many galleries throughout. He is very versatile, working on drums, paddles, masks, rattles in addition to his paintings. His pieces are collected internationally.

Origine Culturelle: Northern Tuchone Nation, Yukon
Richard est né à Whitehorse, dans les territoire du Yukon en 1959 et fait partit de la tribu autochtone du nord. Richard est un artiste autodidacte. Il peignait la faune dès son jeune âge ainsi que ses idoles sportifs et artistes rock préférés. En 1978, Richard déménage à Vancouver.
Au début des années 80, Richard a commencé à peindre des designs autochtones de la côte ouest et par la suite développa son propre style distinct, utilisant la forme animale de la faune et en insérant un design indigène à l’intérieur de la forme. Depuis ce temps, les magasins en demandent et achètent ses œuvres.
Au cours des années, Richard déménage souvent – sur l’île de Vancouver, à Richmond, à Whitehorse, mais toujours en revenant à Vancouver. Aujourd’hui, Richard est un des artistes autochtones les plus recherchés, ses œuvres étant mis en exposition dans plusieurs galeries. Il est très versatile, il travaille sur tambours, pagaies, masques, hochets en plus de ses tableaux. Ses pièces sont collectionnées au niveau international.

FAQ
CONTACT US

SIZING
1. WHAT SIZES ARE AVAILABLE FOR YOUR CLOTHING?We offer different sizes for every piece of clothing. Each product should have their own measurements for you to compare yourself/a garment you have. If there are none, let us know by email and we can get you them! Please keep in mind all our clothing are based in Asia, so expect them to be considerably smaller than Europe/US!
*ALSO PLEASE HAND-WASH SO AESTHETIC CLOTHING!
PAYMENT
1. What payment methods do you accept?

ONLY Paypal, credit card, and debit card (linked to Paypal). No 'mailed cash' or bank transfers, etc.

 

2. I am not from the United States and do not use their currency "USD." Do you accept (my country's currency)?
The default prices of our cases are in USD, but can be purchased from any country with any currency. Although you may see the price of our items in your currency, during checkout, the price will go back to USD numbers, so do not be alarmed by that! Your currency will simply convert to USD upon paying.
 

RETURNS/EXCHANGES

1. I changed my mind. Can I cancel my order and get my money back please?
We do not issue refunds once the order is in the PROCESS OF CREATION or SHIPPED. However, if you contact us quickly after making the order, we can cancel your order and refund your money!
 

2. Can I return an item for a full refund?
Unfortunately, there are strictly no returns UNLESS there are defects in the products. If there is, please inform us within a WEEK OF RECEIVING. In that case, we would be happy to reship a brand new one, provide a refund, or ship another item from our shop to you (without returning your defective one)!
 

3. Can I exchange an item for a larger/smaller size?
We do not do exchanges. All of our products have different measurements, so it is VERY important to compare the measurements in each product to the measurements of a garment you already own at home for accuracy. Are there no measurements or you want more information about a specific product? Email us!
 

SHIPPING/DELIVERY

1. Do you ship internationally? How much is shipping? 
Yes we do ship EVERYWHERE and shipping is FREE in 99.9% of cases!
 


2. WHERE DO YOU SHIP FROM? We ship from our partnered factories located in China. So, please expect your items to be shipped separately (if you order more than one item) as different factories specialize in different areas of manufacturing. Our shop's currency is in USD though!

 



3. HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE TO RECEIVE MY ORDER?Order processing time takes 1-7 business days before shipment. Deliveries can take up to 1 week to 2 months. It depends what you purchased. You can 'CONTACT US' or email soaestheticshop@gmail.com for specific shipping times.
 

4. MY ORDER HAS NOT ARRIVED YET? WHY?
While some parcels can arrive early, some others may experience shipping delays, or you may live in a more isolated region from where we produce (China). If it does not arrive by 8 weeks upon ordering, we can help reship your order or refund! :) 

5. I HAVE RECEIVED ONLY PART OF MY SHIPMENT, WHERE ARE THE OTHER ITEMS?We ship from different parts of China so some items might arrive earlier than others. If you'd like to know the status of your other items, please email us with your name and order number.6. WHAT ABOUT POSSIBLE CUSTOM FEES? We are not responsible for any custom fees once the items have shipped. By purchasing our products, you consent that one or more packages may be shipped to you and may get custom fees when they arrive to your country (very rarely this happens).7. WILL THIS ITEM GET TO ME BEFORE _________? If you plan to give one of our items as a holiday or occasional gift, we do not recommend buying the items during the month when the holiday is happening. There is a risk of the item not arriving there on time. We are not held responsible for items that do not arrive before specified dates.

Chiropractor reviews in New York

        Real People ~ Real Reviews ~ Real Results      




My first visit and the ones after went great!!!. I like the atmosphere of the office and I loved the treatments. The one thing that stands out to me is that Dr. Provider name locked. did not try to scare me into believing that I had so much damange to me that it would take a year or more to help me. The other Chiropractor had been treating me for months and continued to tell me that I needed to come to him twice a week with no end in sight. 

            - Faylene F.          




As mentioned, to my surprise (and contrary to what i was told on the phone), they assigned a very young doctor to see me. I did not want to seem prejudiced, and wanted to give him a Provider name locked. , so I did not make a scene. They insisted on taking x-rays, even though I had no reason to think they are necessary (I had MRIs and x-rays from before and there was no reason to think anything changed). Then despite my warnings the young doctor manipulated my legs and lower back in a manner that caused me significant pain, required electrical stimulation and ice, and I was barely able to walk out of the clinic. They called to apologize and ask if I will come back. Of course I will never do so. Maybe their experienced doctors are better, but the bait and switch they ran on me makes me wonder about the integrity of the whole practice.  

            - Ron P.          




The office staff is very friendly, even before going to the office. I felt welcomed by the receptionist on the phone. Provider name locked. is kind, personable and enthusiastic. He did a thorough and wonderful job adjusting me. I feel much better already. 

            - Katherine F.
