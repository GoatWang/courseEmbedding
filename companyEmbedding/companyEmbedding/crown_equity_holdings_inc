The publication will also give customers access to other product and service which will increase the value of its site, as describe in the industry and market description.
INDUSTRY AND MARKET DESCRIPTION
The publishing industry is involved in the production of magazines, newspapers and books, and encompasses general, professional and academic disciplines. The printed word is under increasing pressure from online publishing such as CRWE WORLD, as readers turn to online resources over reading printed materials such as newspapers.
In fact, the global mobile online ad-spend market has recorded remarkable expansion. It�s predicted that global mobile ad spending will reach $35.55 billion U.S. dollars by the end of 2015. It is expected to be $59.67 billion by the end of 2017. One of the key drivers has been the ability of online content to adapt and evolve with Internet user trends quickly, much more proficiently than TV or print.
The CRWE WORLD network is a specialized online local news, information and directory publishing and marketing solutions for local, state, national and global businesses. The company will offer community based businesses solutions to boost its consumer market visibility with affordable tools for small-to-medium sized business enterprises to extend their marketing reach via the internet that serves their community/target market.
Also, CRWE WORLD has adapted to add the blogging capabilities for individual � as opposed to just a being a local newspaper and directory. This will increase social activity, as well as adding traffic to the network, relieving pressure on staffers to generate page views.
In addition to the above mentioned, CRWE WORLD will offer other distinct services for its readership to have access to, such as; real estate listings, discounted vouchers and coupons, business listings, business reviews, international membership manufacturers trading, video hosting and sharing placement, press release publishing and distribution, VoIP telecommunication services, domain name search and registration, as well as web hosting.
MARKETING
In addition to CRWE WORLD creating an engaged community readership of its publications through the publishing of updated quality community and global news, the company will also use its blogging capabilities offering to increase its readership and community interaction.
The Marketing team will work with Publishing and Sales team to design, create, and deliver marketing communications/sales support programs to facilitate the expansion and growth of the company brands.
The company�s will also engaged community readership through giving advertisement space on its sites to some of the community/city�s nonprofits organizations, which will adds to the local feel of each publication.
In reference to CRWE WORLD real estate listings, according to ComScore, real estate websites are generating hundreds of millions in revenue and have helped turned buying a house into entertainment.
Vouchers and coupons are a huge staple of life in the United States and increasingly, around the world. A recent report from Juniper Research suggests that the mobile coupon market will exceed $43 billion globally by 2016. �Mobile coupons are going main-stream.� Juniper Research analyst David Snow said. �To ignore the potential of mobile coupons would be to ignore the future of mobile commerce.�
The Database and Directory Publishing industry offers two main services: the sale of advertising space and the sale of listings and subscriptions to directories. The sale of advertising space makes up about 62.9% of industry revenue in 2014. Because the industry relies heavily on revenue from advertising sales, any downturn in advertising has a negative impact on industry operators� bottom lines. As print advertising has continued to decline over the five years to 2014, the industry has more aggressively targeted online advertising. Thus far, revenue from online advertisements has not been enough to stem the decline of revenue from print advertisements. Consequently, advertisements� share of revenue has declined.
Press releases are the best mode of communication around the world. The industry�s growth soared during the past five years as entrepreneurs used the internet for online press releases to capture a wide audience and broadcast their news and information. In 2014, the press release industry revenues were $826 million within the United States.
The press release service will be available through CRWE World under the brand CRWE Press Release. (See information in reference to CRWE PRESS RELEASE above.)
In reference to CRWE WORLD international membership manufacturers trading, the 2010 U.S. Census data shows estimates for B2B revenue transacted online at approximately US$300 billion. Compare that with almost $200 billion in B2C transactions. None the less, the latest figures from the U.S. Census bureau shows that U.S. manufacturers shipped $3.0 trillion worth of orders placed electronically in 2012, which was up from 2011. All indicating that the next decade will be an innovative and demanding one for B2B e-commerce. Forrester estimates that by the end of 2013, customer-facing front-end B2B ecommerce will reach $559 billion.
Online video-sharing hosting service Allowing viewers to share embed and comment on videos is an important aspect of online video marketing. Video SEO is becoming an important aspect of organic search marketing, not only for video search, but as a way to enhance and optimize keyword phrase rankings for web searches. The use for video uploading has and still is growing.
Companies across the nation have been touting the benefits of VoIP communications. Recent industry analysis shows the VoIP market continuing to grow throughout the United States. According to IBISWorld�s VoIP in the U.S. report, the market has increased 16.7 percent annually over the last five years, generating $15 billion in revenue each year. In addition, Juniper Research recently predicted that mobile VoIP users would reach 1 billion by 2017.

In addition, the company will implement a �PPM� (Pay per 1,000 impressions) and �PPC� (Pay Per Click) to generate income, management intends to hire several independent sales executives that will sell advertising space to advertisers throughout the United States. The business will also promote new advertising sales by partnering with major marketing and advertising firms that will place new advertisements within the company.

Crown Trading Systems and IMB Lenovo





Crown Trading Systems is one of IBM Lenovo's Channel Partners; About LenovoLenovo is an innovative, international technology company formed as a result of the acquisition by the Lenovo Group of the IBM Personal Computing Division.In 1981, IBM envisioned computing at a new level - a personal level - to extend the power and the productivity of information technology from the mainframe to the individual, at home and at work. That vision led to the founding of a new unit within IBM, the Personal Computing Division, which virtually invented personal computing. PCD advanced the state-of-the-art with a series of innovations ranging from the very first laptop computers to the latest high-security technologies, such as the built-in "air-bag" that protects data, and biometric identification that protects user identity. PCD created the icon of notebook computing, the ThinkPad, and the unique software tools, known as ThinkVantage Technologies, which increase user productivity.In 1984, not long after PCD was founded, 11 computer scientists in Beijing, China also had a vision - to create a company that would bring the advantages of information technology to the Chinese people. With RMB200,000 (US$25,000) in seed money and the determination to turn their research into successful products, the 11 engineers and researchers set up shop in a loaned space - a small, one-story bungalow in Beijing. The company they founded, Legend, opened the new era of consumer PCs in China.Since it was established, the company has affected the lives of millions of Chinese: It first introduced PCs to households, then promoted PC usage in China by establishing retail shops nationwide. It also developed the pioneering Legend Chinese Character Card that translated English operating software into Chinese characters, and achieved breakthroughs like PCs with one-button access to the Internet.By 1994, Legend was trading on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange; four years later, it produced its one-millionth personal computer. In 2003, Legend changed its brand name to Lenovo, taking the "Le" from Legend, a nod to its heritage, and adding "novo," the Latin word for "new," to reflect the spirit of innovation at the core of the company. The company name changed from Legend to Lenovo a year later.In 2003, Lenovo introduced a self-developed collaborative application technology, which heralds the important role Lenovo is going to play in the 3C era (computer, communications and consumer electronics). These and other market-leading personal computing products catapulted Legend to a leadership position in China for eight consecutive years with over 25% market share in 2004.Today, these two visionary companies are united under the Lenovo name. With Lenovo's landmark acquisition of IBM's Personal Computing Division in May 2005, the new Lenovo is a leader in the global PC market, with approximately $13 billion in annual revenue, and products serving enterprises and consumers the world over.Our values Lenovo and its employees are committed to four company values that are the foundation for all that we do: Customer service: We are dedicated to the satisfaction and success of every customer.  Innovative and entrepreneurial spirit: Innovation that matters to our customers, and our company, created and delivered with speed and efficiency.  Accuracy and truth-seeking: We manage our business and make decisions based on carefully understood facts.  Trustworthiness and integrity: Trust and personal responsibility in all relationships.A Heritage of Innovation and Excellence Legend's entrepreneurial spirit and PCD's track record of breakthroughs live on in today's Lenovo, an IT giant with global reach, competing worldwide.Globally, the company offers customers the award-winning ThinkPad notebooks and ThinkCentre desktops, featuring the ThinkVantage Technologies software tools, as well as ThinkVision monitors and a full line of PC accessories and options. The Think family is consistently ranked as the undisputed premium-brand leader in the global PC industry, with products rated "best-in-class" and "number one" in survey after survey. No other family of personal computers has won as much recognition.In China, Lenovo commands more than one-third of the PC market, covering all segments. Its leading-edge PCs are highly acclaimed for their user-friendly, tailor-made designs and customized solutions for various customer needs, including the Tianjiao and Fengxing consumer desktops and Yangtian and Kaitian enterprise desktops. Lenovo also has a broad and expanding product line encompassing mobile handsets, servers, peripherals and digital entertainment products for the Chinese market.

BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry

                    1. Follow federal, state/provincial and local advertising laws.
                

                    2. Abide by the BBB Code of Advertising. Supply, upon request, substantiation for advertising and selling claims. Correct advertising and selling practices, when recommended by BBB.
                
3. Adhere to applicable BBB industry codes of advertising.
4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    6. Avoid misleading customers by creating the false impression of sponsorship, endorsement, popularity, trustworthiness, product quality or business size through the misuse of logos, trustmarks, pictures, testimonials, or other means
                







Tell the Truth









            Honestly represent products and services, including clear and adequate disclosures of all material terms.

                    2. Ensure that any written materials are readily available, clear, accurate and complete.
                







Be Transparent









            Openly identify the nature, location, and ownership of the business, and clearly disclose all policies, guarantees and procedures that bear on a customer's decision to buy.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Upon request, provide BBB with all information required to evaluate compliance with BBB standards. This may include, but is not limited to business name, address and contact information; names and background of principles; business and banking references; licensing and/or professional accreditation; and a complete description of the nature of the business.
                

                    2. Clearly disclose to customers:

                    
1. direct and effective means to contact the business
2. terms of any written contract
3. any guarantees or warranties accompanying a product

                            4. any restrictions or limitations imposed (e.g. limited supply,maximum number available per customer)
                        
5. the business' return/refund policy

                            6. any recurring commitment into which the customer may be entering, including information on how future billing will occur

Honor Promises









            Abide by all written agreements and verbal representations.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 
1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached. 2. Honor representations by correcting mistakes as quickly as possible.







Be Responsive









            Address marketplace disputes quickly, professionally, and in good faith.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Promptly respond to all complaints forwarded by BBB by: 
1. Resolving the complaint directly with the complainant and notifying BBB, or

                            2. Providing BBB with a response that BBB determines: 

                                    1. is professional,
                                
2. addresses all of the issues raised by the complainant,
3. includes appropriate evidence and documents supporting the business' position, and

                                    4. explains why any relief sought by the complainant cannot or should not be granted.
                                





                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.
