Thank you. Welcome to XO Group's fourth quarter conference call and webcast.

Forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words like may, should, expect, plan, intend and other similar terms.

Changes in economic, business, competitive, regulatory and other factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the projections or forward-looking statements made today.
For more detailed information about these factors and other risks that may impact our business, please review the periodic reports and other documents filed from time to time by XO Group with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Thank you for your participation and interest in XO Group. I will now pass the call to our Chief Executive Officer, Michael Steib.
Michael F. Steib - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thanks, Ivan, and welcome, everyone, to the earnings call. Our mission at XO is to help couples navigate and enjoy life's biggest moments together. As we've discussed throughout the year, we committed in 2014 to drive stronger long-term financial performance for our shareholders by focusing our company, investing in talent and delivering great products.
In my first year as CEO, we have achieved these initial goals and successfully transformed The Knot into a wedding vendor marketplace, all while continuing to grow our core revenue and generate healthy cash flow.

We focused this year by exiting noncore businesses like our Ijie and wedding supplies fulfillment operations and consolidating a number of ancillary websites and offices. These efforts ensure that we focus our attention on only businesses in which we can be best in class and that are positioned to deliver value for our shareholders.
We've brought in even more exceptional talent in product, mobile development, open source engineering, and business execution. 50% of the leadership team here at XO has joined within the last 18 months, bringing new perspectives and a renewed spirit to the entire organization. In addition, we strengthened our Board of Directors and taken further steps to ensure good corporate governance.
We have now replaced every priority app and website in the company with new best-in-class products. Our new apps have significantly increased our mobile sessions and have driven 5x the engagement with our vendors compared to our legacy websites. And in the last few weeks, we launched completely rebuilt sites for The Knot and The Bump that incorporate all of the great features from our apps, providing a seamless experience for our couples across devices. These products are increasing engagement between our couples and vendors, driving more business to the vendors in our marketplace and putting us on a path for future growth.
We believe our Knot wedding vendors marketplace is a significant growth opportunity for us. A successful marketplace engages its users, matches them to relevant vendors and facilitates connections between the two. In 2014, we did a better job of engaging our couples as demonstrated for instance by our growth in unique visitors. The Knot has grown by 11% and is larger than our three largest competitors combined. We also improved the matching process between our couples and vendors by providing a more personalized experience in our mobile products, adding more than 200,000 vendor listings and significantly increasing our user-generated reviews on theknot.com. These improvements have contributed to our record low churn rates and strong top line financial results for our local online business.
In 2015, in our wedding vendor marketplace, look for us to continue to share with you our progress as we increase engagement, better match our couples and vendors and further facilitate and monetize the connection between the two.
For The Bump, we completely re-architected our mobile applications, shifting from a portal experience to a feed of relevant content, community and tools, personalized to the age and stage of the pregnancy and baby.
Our team also delivered strong revenue results growing Bump national online by 57%. Our new Bump website launched last month should mark the beginning of an exciting year for this promising brand. It's been a good year and there's still a lot of hard work ahead. We have ambitious long-term goals for both our wedding vendor marketplace and our Bump brand.
For our marketplace, we will know we have succeeded when we have inspired, planned and booked every wedding in America. With The Bump, we want to be the only source parents turn to for all things pregnancy and baby anytime, anywhere.
I want to thank our fellow shareholders for all of their support throughout 2014 and our employees for all of their hard work and dedication.
With that, I'll turn it over to Gillian for the financial review. Thanks, guys.
Gillian Munson - Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Mike. We've got a lot to cover on this call. So I'm going to break it down into about three parts. First, I'm going to provide you detail on our GAAP Q4 results and the items included in those results and track comparability. I will then walk you through our non-GAAP operating results we believe more accurately represent our cooperation. And finally, I'll give you some color how we are thinking about 2015.

Our reported GAAP loss per share for Q4 was $0.16, as outlined in our press release issued earlier today. This compares to a loss of $0.12 in the year ago quarter. In our release, we laid out a detailed list of the items that impact comparability in our GAAP results for both Q4 and full year 2014. If you exclude these items, during the fourth quarter, our non-GAAP EPS were $0.06 up from $0.02 a year ago. It's been a year of change at XO. And as a result, our Q4 GAAP results include a number of charges related to transitions in our businesses. These largely fall into three areas.
First, we posted a $1.8 million pre-tax charge related to the exit of our Ijie operations. Of note, our initial estimate for the total cost associated with this exit was $3 million pre-tax. As we worked through the particulars of the wind-down, our total costs came in at the $1.8 million pre-tax level, as I just mentioned. And we had $1.5 million in incremental taxes, bringing the total to $3.3 million including tax.
Secondly, we incurred charges related to the shutdown of our wedding supplies fulfillment operations in the amount of $572,000 during the quarter. This represents severance and asset impairments. We are on track to finalize the shutdown by the end of Q1. Our initial estimate for the total cost of our wedding supplies shutdown was $2.5 million to $3.5 million. We are updating that estimate now to be in the $1 million to $1.5 million range. The change in estimate is due to the amazing work of our Redding, California team who were able to monetize inventory at a better rate than we previously forecasted.
Third, we incurred charges related to our separation with David Liu and Carley Roney, who transitioned to non-management roles at the end of 2014. This was in the amount of $733,000.
From here forward, I'll predominantly stick to operating results which exclude the items I just mentioned unless specifically called out. For a reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to the relevant GAAP financial measure, please see the reconciliation table included in our investor presentation which was released prior to the start of this conference call.
Total revenue for the fourth quarter was $37 million, up 14% year-over-year and up 15% if you exclude merchandise. Looking at our revenue lines individually, local online which is roughly 41% of our total revenue, increased 11% year-over-year. Our local enterprise team, led by Kristin Savilia, has done a great job of staying focused on growing the top line as we expand the marketplace features of this business.
Our national team had an excellent Q4. National online, which is 23% of our revenue, increased 37% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. The increase was driven by good sales execution on both our baby and wedding properties. Jennifer Garrett, the leader of our National Enterprise Group focused the sales team on big advertising deals and they were able to attract key new clients and grow average TTMs (10:32) on both The Knot and The Bump. Publishing and other revenue grew 3% year-over-year, primarily driven by increases in our national publication. And our registry services revenue increased 19% in Q4.
Our results in e-commerce reflect the decision made to shut down our wedding merchandise fulfillment operations by the end of Q1. Fourth quarter revenue increased 2% year-over-year, driven by increased promotions as we clear inventory in advance of our shutdown. I'd note this revenue growth came at low clearing level gross margins of 8.4%.
Overall, gross margin increased to 84% from 83% a year ago, driven by increases in our higher margin advertising businesses, partly offset by the merchandising margin I mentioned before. We continue to benefit from a mix shift to digital in our revenue line. Given our transition, we watch gross margin dollar growth closely. In Q4, it grew 15%, slightly faster than revenue, which is an encouraging trend.

Total operating expenses were $29 million, up 9% year-over-year. This growth rate was lower than the gross margin dollar growth rate giving us EPS growth year-over-year. When you look at OpEx growth versus gross margin dollar growth on an annual basis, you will see the investment we have made in our business to fuel our transformation. In the interest of quantifying the impact of that investment, we have estimated that any spending over 5% year-over-year for the year 2014 was incremental. And using that framework, total incremental spending for the full year was roughly $10 million.
Looking at our total operating expenses for the quarter, product and content grew 5% year-over-year. This is a moderation in our year-to-year growth rate due to slower than expected hiring in the quarter.
Sales and marketing increased 14% year-over-year, driven by higher compensation expense associated with the strong advertising results for the quarter. And G&A grew a moderate 7% year-over-year. Stock-based compensation for the quarter was $1.7 million, down 21% year-over-year due to the executive changes we made during the year.
Depreciation and amortization was $1.6 million in the quarter, up 6% year-over-year. The growth was driven by typical increases in amortization related to product (12:42) releases and the previously announced acceleration of our WeddingChannel trade name amortization. Q4 was the last quarter of this accelerated expense which totaled $2.1 million for the year.
I'd like to pause here to mention our tax line. As you can see in our GAAP results, we had a high tax rates during both the quarter and the year. A normal effective tax rate for us should be in the 41% to 43% range. If you assume a 42.5% tax rate on our GAAP pre-tax income, that would have resulted in roughly $2.9 million of income tax expense in 2014. The additional $3.6 million of tax expense we recorded was primarily driven by the sale of Ijie and yearend work, including adjustments for our NOL valuations. For modeling purposes, you should model a 41% to 43% effective tax rate going forward.
Turning to our balance sheet. We ended the year with $90 million in cash, flat compared to the prior year. During the year, positive cash flow from operating activities was offset by cash used for acquisitions and investments of $9.7 million.
Capital expenditures of $4.8 million to satisfy tax withholding obligations for employees related to vesting and stock repurchases under our authorized repurchase plans of $1.6 million.
Finally, I'll give you some color on how we're thinking about 2015. I want to remind you that our long-term financial model is for double digit revenue growth, target gross margins of 90% to 95%. Operating expense below revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA margins of at least 20%. We won't get there in 2015 but we believe we will begin to see the signs of progress towards the end of the year.
We entered 2015 in the midst of our investment mode. As you model our potential results, I'd like to give you some inputs to consider. As you look at our 2015 revenue, I encourage you to model our core businesses in all of our businesses excluding merchandising and what you would expect for Ijie in the high-single digits.
I'd note when determining this growth rate, we adjusted for the unusually strong national online growth in Q4. For gross margin, you should model close to our target gross margin model. Given the shutdown of our wedding supplies fulfillment operations and given the fact that our business will shift even more to the digital side, in terms of operating expenses, we are still in the midst of a transition and you should expect our operating expenses to be up modestly year-over-year. Meaning, savings from the exit of our Ijie and wedding supplies operations will be reinvested into the business. One thing to know on OpEx, D&A should be down every year due to the end of the WeddingChannel trade name amortization I mentioned before.

In terms of our effective tax rate, with the disposition of Ijie behind us and the revised estimates for NOL, you should model a 41% to 43% of FX tax rate going forward.
Turning to capital allocation. We continue to carefully evaluate three uses of our cash. One, investments in the business. As per my guidance, we are still in the middle of our transformation and we will be growing our total OpEx in 2015. Two, stock buybacks. During 2014, we repurchased 1.6 million of shares. And as of the end of February, we have repurchased an additional $6 million of our shares. Finally, strategic investments and M&A. At this time, we have no news to share on that front.
Thank you for your continued interest and support of our company. This concludes our prepared remarks. And I'll now turn the call over for questions. Thank you.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Sameet Sinha from B. Riley. Your line is open.
Sameet Sinha - B. Riley & Co. LLC
Yes. Thank you very much. First, Mike, if you can talk about what sort of other product launches you're planning for rest of the year, so that we can look out for those whether it's mobile site, online site or apps that will be helpful?
Secondly, as these products are launched, can you also give us the kind of the cadence for investment as you reinvest those cost savings back in to the business. Should that be more first-half frontloaded kind of or evenly say throughout the year?
And third, as the marketplace develops, what are some of the metrics that we can keep track or that you should be able to provide that will give us a sense of the trajectory and the health of the business? Then I have a couple of follow-ups. Thank you.
Michael F. Steib - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Hey, Sameet, thank you. First, on launches, in 2014, we had to completely rebuild most of our core products, our apps and our websites. So the activities of our product tech work (17:58) this year were unusual and that they were full relaunches of the products. What you should expect in 2015 is the enhancement and improvement of those products to better engage our users and vendors, to better match our users to the vendors that can fulfill their needs of the day of their wedding and to connect it to and facilitate transactions.
So don't expect in 2015 big announces around launch days like we've had this year – like we had the last 12 months, the websites and the apps, instead expect to see us steadily improving the products and growing now to what is one of your next questions, some of the key metrics around engaging our users, matching our users to vendors and facilitating those connections and transactions between the two. Stay tuned for more specific metrics on some of our upcoming calls around engaging, matching and connecting.
Some of this that you've already heard from us today, you've heard from us in recent calls around traffic, around engagements between our users and vendors. And then retention of our vendors and total revenue are still going to be some of the key ones that we're going to pay very close attention to and you should be following.
Gillian Munson - Chief Financial Officer
Sameet, on the operating expenses, we don't give quarterly guidance on OpEx but I don't see anything that would say that our quarterly sequential rates of OpEx are not unlike they have been in the past. And so, when you think about how our revenue growth will roll out, you would likely see that rate of growth diverting again towards the second half of the year. In terms of the OpEx themselves (19:42), you'll see more of investment in the products and content area than in the other two lines in the operating expense line.
Sameet Sinha - B. Riley & Co. LLC

Okay. And specifically about national advertising, so we saw the strength and you spoke about the execution. My impression has been that national was – seems like it's doing really well. So that's great, seems like you're going up from negative (20:05). Now what in terms of your focus as you look across the portfolio of your products, where does National figure in that and how should we think about it, let's say, over the next couple of years?
Michael F. Steib - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
The way that we think about our national business is it's a strong contributor and one where we want to continue to foster steady performance. The opportunity for national has been going to our advertisers with our vastly improved products, which often can unlock more spend, continuing to drive the core business. And as you heard this year, we're seeing some really exciting traction in The Bump. So those should continue to give us steady performance and steady growth in our national advertising business.
Sameet Sinha - B. Riley & Co. LLC
Okay. Fair enough. Thank you very much.
Michael F. Steib - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Pleasure.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of George Askew from Stifel. Your line is open.
George I. Askew - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Yes. Congratulations on a very nice quarter.
Michael F. Steib - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thanks, George. Nice to hear from you today.
George I. Askew - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Thank you. Three questions. On the local marketplace business, from the perceptive of the vendor, can you give us a sense of what they are seeing, how they are seeing the increased engagement? Specifically, are they seeing more leads, are they seeing better conversion, are they seeing better ASPs? What's prompting them to be more involved and frankly to lower that churn? That'd be the first question.
Michael F. Steib - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
George, they are seeing significantly more traffic to their store fronts. They are seeing significantly more leads. And much of that in 2014 has been driven by our success in mobile apps.
George I. Askew - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Okay, good. With regard to national advertising, uniques were up 11% but can you kind of break down what's going on there? You mentioned The Bump is having great traction there. Are you winning more advertising customers there? Are you getting pricing because of some of the engagement? Is it driven by the traffic? What are the drivers there as well?
Michael F. Steib - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
George, in our local business, Kristin Savilia who's running that business has been with XO for a while. And so, we've had the benefit of strong execution in the local business for years. What you saw in 2014 was that we complemented strong execution with product enhancements that further strengthened the value proposition for our local vendors.
In our national business, Jenny Garrett is still relatively new to the organization. She's been with us for about a year. And in Q4, I think you saw a lot of her work over the last year start to come to roost. So I think the national story in 2014 was very much an execution story. And in 2015, we should see the combination of that ongoing strong execution, our new product launches and higher quality products coming together, for national to continue to be a steady contributor to the organization.
George I. Askew - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Okay, good. And then lastly, the merchandise business, obviously, you're in the final stages of the transition there, but clearly, that's a business that your users leveraged and used, how are you going to replace that service to the brides, and how do you get paid for it, and where we're going to see it in the income statement?

Michael F. Steib - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
So, what you'll see us doing now George is identifying those moments of commercial intent for our users and connecting them to our business partners who can fulfill on those moments of commercial intent. And rather than us play the role of manufacturer, we're going to play the role of connector between our audience and people who do the manufacturing.
In the case of The Knot shop, while we've exited the manufacturing business, we continue to maintain that section of our site and continue to market products like those to our users. They are now fulfilled by a company called Weddingstar with whom we've partnered. And we'll continue to drive some revenue to our organization without us having to take on the costs of the fulfillment.
George I. Askew - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Yeah. Perfect. Okay. Thank you. Those are my questions.
Gillian Munson - Chief Financial Officer
Thank you.
Operator
And our next question comes from the line of Sameet Sinha of B. Riley. Your line is open.
Sameet Sinha - B. Riley & Co. LLC
Yes. Thank you. So a couple of follow-ups actually on national advertising. Where did you see the strength? Was it in your kind of the core wedding or pregnancy categories, or was it from kind of non-endemic advertisers? And have you been able to do a study of maybe your CPMs were much below the market and now you have an opportunity to increase those and if you could give us a sense of magnitude.
Secondly, also wanted, Gillian, if you can kind of just quickly go through the guidance that you gave, kind of a broad guidance that you gave for the next year, and in that context could you specifically address kind of the trends in the publishing business? Thank you.
Michael F. Steib - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Sameet, we're seeing growth on both The Knot and The Bump. The percentage growth on The Bump is impressive off of what is immediately a smaller base. CPMs for this business are solid. As I'm sure you are paying attention to the websites, you're seeing big name advertisers both endemic and non-endemic on The Knot and The Bump. And with strong execution out of Jenny and her team this year, I think what you're seeing in our results is that we're unlocking deeper partnerships with bigger and more strategic accounts.
Gillian Munson - Chief Financial Officer
As to the guidance, let me answer your second question, first. On the publishing business, the strategy we have for publishing is to maintain healthy momentum in that business and that continues to be the strategy we will carry into 2015. In terms of 2015 guidance, 2015 continues to be a transitional year for our company as we continue to enter the year in an investment mode for the company. So the specific guidance we gave was that core revenue, excluding e-commerce, will grow in the high single digits and we chose that number because of the particularly strong growth in national that we put that into that number.
Secondly, that we would expect our operating expense growth in total to be moderate which means that savings from Ijie and e-comm will be reinvested into the business. We commented that D&A will come down as we get past the amortization of the WeddingChannel trade name. And that we think all of this places us well to have a shot at getting at our target model in 2015. And as a reminder, that model remains the same, which is for our company to generate revenue growth into the double digits, target growth margins of 90% to 95%, operating expense growth that grows below revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA margin of at least 20%.
Sameet Sinha - B. Riley & Co. LLC
Thank you.
Gillian Munson - Chief Financial Officer
You're welcome.

At this time, there are no further questions. Are there any further remarks?
