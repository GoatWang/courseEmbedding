STAMFORD, Conn., July  24, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Richard Muskus, Jr., President of Patriot National Bancorp, Inc. (the "Company") (NASDAQ:PNBK) and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Patriot Bank, N.A.

A photo accompanying this announcement is available at http://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/34a36426-6476-4055-9915-1689637ed93e
In January 2017, Mr. Muskus, 49, was elevated to president, having formerly served as the institution's Executive Vice President and Chief Lending Officer.  He has spent his career in financial services and community banking.
Patriot Bank has recorded multiple strong fiscal quarters and proven earnings stability.  Last week, the Bank announced its intention to begin making quarterly dividends for shareholders of its stock, another sign of its continuing strong performance. 
The Bank reinstated its dividend policy, which was suspended during the financial crisis, by declaring a quarterly dividend of $.01 per share.  The record date for this quarterly dividend will be July 24, 2017, with a dividend payment date of August 1, 2017.
At the end of the 2016 fiscal year, Patriot surpassed the three quarters of a billion-dollar milestone, with strong growth continuing into 2017.  In the first fiscal quarter of 2017, Patriot reported net income of $1,730,000, or $0.44 per diluted share, a 165% increase over the prior year.  First quarter earnings also increased 66% over the prior quarter. 
"Patriot Bank's consistent growth and market success over recent years is very exciting and demonstrates the successful strategic vision the board and bank's executive leadership have put into place and that has put us ahead of our peer banks," said Mr. Muskus.
Mr. Muskus is a lifelong resident of Greenwich, CT, where he lives with his wife, Lindsay, and three children. He earned his Bachelor of Science in Accounting at Bentley University in Waltham, MA with a concentration in corporate taxation.
He is Director Emeritus and former President of the Board of Directors of the Transportation Association of Greenwich, CT, a nonprofit assisting in the transportation of the city's elderly and disabled residents. He also serves as fiduciary and administrator of the Jane C. Bausman Memorial Scholarship Fund.

Patriot
National Bank proudly announces the addition of Richard A. Muskus, Jr. to their
management team as Executive Vice President and Chief Lending Officer. A
lifelong Greenwich resident, ‘Rick’ is a second-generation banker who brings a
wealth of commercial banking experience and a career that spans more than 20
years.  In
1993 Rick joined State Street Bank in Quincy, Mass. as a Portfolio Accountant
and soon after moved to New York City where he became a Financial Analyst at JP Morgan Investment Management, Inc. In 1996, Rick
joined Patriot National Bank beginning his career in community banking where
among his other duties as Senior Credit Analyst, he developed commercial loan
portfolio underwriting methodologies and credit standards. He was subsequently
promoted, assuming a new role focusing on the development of commercial loan
customers. In
2001 Rick joined The Greenwich Bank & Trust
Company as Vice President in the commercial lending area, continuing in his
hometown footsteps (Rick’s father began his banking career with the First
National Bank of Greenwich in 1957, later evolving into the Union Trust
Company). Rick went on to become Senior Vice President of Commercial Lending
and was later promoted to Division President, overseeing lending and operations
of
multiple offices before “coming back home” to Patriot. Rick
dedicates a large portion of his time to community involvement – as Board
President of the Transportation Association of Greenwich and as the fiduciary
of the Jane Bausman Scholarship Fund in addition to various appointments within
the Greenwich school system and other non-profit efforts. Rick
is a 1991 graduate of Bentley College in Waltham, Mass. where he earned his Bachelor
of Accountancy Degree. He resides in Riverside with his wife Lindsay and their
three children. Says
Rick, “Patriot is well positioned to meet the needs of local businesses within
the communities we serve; I am grateful for the opportunity to join Patriot
under the experienced leadership of Ken Neilson and I am looking forward to
contributing to their planned growth.”For more information go to: www.pnbk.comOr contact: Susan Neilson, Patriot National Bank, 203-252-5954, sneilson@pnbk.com
