The rug  we received looked nothing like this.  It was totally red. I took it to Home Depot to return and they talked with the HD warehouse and it was reported that this rug is no longer being manufactured.  Yet the rug we received is not on the website.   Therefore we returned the rug.  Why would HD have a rug like the one above of their website and discontinue it.  This makes for poor merchandising and customer service.

Browse Wishlist      Compare SKU: 550-walk-behind-scraper Category: Walk Behind Scrapers            Description   Additional Information   Blades    Product Description The manual powered walk behind scraper is a great tool for the do-it-yourself home owner who wishes to peel up their old carpet or vinyl prior to installing new flooring. It runs off any standard 110v outlet, and it’s oscillating blade makes removal of soft flooring much easier than using a razor blade or metal scraper bar. This unit runs much quieter, faster and smoother than a jack hammer or air hammer. While it’s not recommended for the removal of ceramic tile or hardwood, there are some cases where it can assist in the partial removal, if the tile or wood is not down too hard. All scraper blades can easily be re-sharpened with a standard hand grinder and the correct grinding head, allowing the operator to get the longest possible life out of their blades, instead of have to replace them after a single use. With the removal of soft flooring (like carpet, vinyl rubber floors and mastic) it’s not uncommon for an operator to get 5,000 square feet or more out of a single blade, just by re-sharpening it after every couple thousand feet of use.
