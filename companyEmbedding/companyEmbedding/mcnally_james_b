Ativa Medical Names James M. McNally, Ph.D., President and CEO




Developer of world’s first micro lab hires new leadership in 
      preparation for clinical studies and commercialization






July 11, 2014 01:10 PM Eastern Daylight Time



ST. PAUL, Minn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Ativa Medical Corp., developer of the world’s first multi-detection 
      micro lab to help clinicians make immediate treatment decisions, today 
      announced James M. McNally, Ph.D., as president and CEO.
    


      McNally brings to Ativa 25-plus years of executive leadership experience 
      in the medical device and diagnostic industry, including most recently 
      serving as vice president of Quest Diagnostics’ Products Division, 
      including its point-of-care companies. He has been awarded 12 patents 
      for his health care and diagnostic innovations.
    

      “In my career, I’ve had the opportunity to review hundreds of diagnostic 
      instruments and businesses; we believe Ativa’s system will be able to 
      deliver central lab quality results in about 5 minutes during a single 
      office visit. Clinicians will be able to better diagnose and treat 
      patients, while significantly reducing traditional lab test costs,” 
      McNally said. “I look forward to taking this important technology 
      through commercialization.”
    

      When launched, Ativa’s system should allow health care professionals to 
      obtain results in minutes, rather than hours or days, to improve the 
      patient experience. Practitioners will get critical test information for 
      detecting and managing disease during the clinical visit, where it is 
      most valuable.
    

      The Ativa system also reduces the chances for lab test errors and 
      misdiagnoses, as it does not require sample handling by multiple health 
      care staff. “(Central) laboratory testing is subject to many factors 
      that potentially could adversely affect the integrity of the sample and 
      prevent the timely reporting of an accurate test result to your 
      provider,” according 
      to a 2014 report by Lab Tests Online.
    

      “Ativa’s micro lab, with the footprint of a toaster, will ultimately be 
      able to accurately and efficiently test up to 90 percent of Medicare’s 
      top 30 blood tests,” McNally said. “Ativa’s patented disposable 
      microfluidic cards need only a drop of blood yet compete with the 
      quality and consistency of large lab instruments, based on our 
      pre-clinical complete blood count results. The Ativa system holds great 
      potential where speed-to-diagnosis is critical, such as emergency rooms 
      and urgent care facilities, as well as in private physician offices and 
      retail clinics and pharmacies. Because of the system’s affordability and 
      portability, we believe there will be great interest in this system in 
      emerging countries, many of which lack access to quality lab testing of 
      any kind.”
    

      “Jim McNally’s experience with an array of point-of-care products, 
      including navigating commercialization issues and the FDA, gives him 
      important insights to lead Ativa at this stage,” said James B. Stake, 
      chairman of Ativa’s board of directors. “This system presents a 
      breakthrough product in clinical diagnostics.”

About Ativa Medical Corp.Ativa Medical Corp. is a privately 
      held, emerging growth medical diagnostic company developing and 
      commercializing novel point-of-care diagnostic technologies. Ativa is 
      currently pursuing the commercialization of an innovative tabletop micro 
      lab for clinical use. This technology will enable health care 
      professionals to perform critical hematology and blood chemistry tests 
      on-site and get accurate results within about 5 minutes. For more 
      information, visit www.ativamed.com.
    

About the Ativa Micro Lab SystemHealth care systems 
      worldwide are demanding that companies develop a more efficient 
      treatment model, as 70 percent of physician decisions are driven by 
      diagnostic testing. Ativa’s micro lab will help clinicians make 
      treatment decisions immediately, aiming to improve outcomes. The micro 
      lab is compact and designed to perform the most common blood-based lab 
      tests in a physician’s office. The system combines flow cytometry, 
      electrochemistry, colorimetric testing and imaging into a single system. 
      Each test is run on a single, inexpensive, disposable card specifically 
      tailored to the test of choice. The Ativa micro lab has advanced to 
      demonstrating equivalence to central lab-based systems costing many 
      times the price. The Ativa system’s technology, including key 
      microfluidic components, sample preparation, disposable test cards, 
      diagnostic tests and instrumentation, is covered by 80 U.S. patents and 
      184 patents worldwide. See the Ativa system in action at www.ativamed.com/videos/microlab.

 McNALLY, James B. "Jim" 73, beloved husband of Mary McNally, died peacefully on November 1, 2012, surrounded by his loving family at his home in Braintree. Jim was born in Leitrim, Ireland and moved to the United States in 1963, where he met his wife, Mary O'Driscoll, whom he has been married to for 44 years.

Jim worked as a self-employed carpenter doing beautiful work throughout the South Shore with his brother-in-law and dearest friend, Patrick O'Driscoll. Jim was a good-natured man with a wonderful sense of humor who loved to spend time with his family and friends. He enjoyed remaining connected to his Irish roots and was a member of the Leitrim Society of Boston. He will be deeply missed by all who knew him, especially members of his family including siblings and many nieces and nephews residing in the US, England, Ireland, France, and Australia. Reposing at the Cartwright-Venuti Funeral Home, 845 Washington Street, BRAINTREE until 10:15AM on Monday followed by a Funeral Mass at 11:00AM in St. Francis of Assisi Church, Braintree.

Pharmacy Choice - Pharmaceutical News - Ativa Medical Names James M. McNally, Ph.D., President and CEO - July 26, 2017
Pharmacy News Article






							 7/11/14 - Ativa Medical Names James M. McNally, Ph.D., President and CEO
						




Developer of world's first micro lab hires new leadership in
      preparation for clinical studies and commercialization

    ST. PAUL, Minn.(BUSINESS WIRE)
      Ativa Medical Corp., developer of the world's first multi-detection
      micro lab to help clinicians make immediate treatment decisions, today
      announced James M. McNally, Ph.D., as president and CEO.
    

      McNally brings to Ativa 25-plus years of executive leadership experience
      in the medical device and diagnostic industry, including most recently
      serving as vice president of Quest Diagnostics Products Division,
      including its point-of-care companies. He has been awarded 12 patents
      for his health care and diagnostic innovations.
    

      In my career, Ive had the opportunity to review hundreds of diagnostic
      instruments and businesses; we believe Ativa's system will be able to
      deliver central lab quality results in about 5 minutes during a single
      office visit. Clinicians will be able to better diagnose and treat
      patients, while significantly reducing traditional lab test costs,
      McNally said. I look forward to taking this important technology
      through commercialization.
    

      When launched, Ativa's system should allow health care professionals to
      obtain results in minutes, rather than hours or days, to improve the
      patient experience. Practitioners will get critical test information for
      detecting and managing disease during the clinical visit, where it is
      most valuable.
    

      The Ativa system also reduces the chances for lab test errors and
      misdiagnoses, as it does not require sample handling by multiple health
      care staff. (Central) laboratory testing is subject to many factors
      that potentially could adversely affect the integrity of the sample and
      prevent the timely reporting of an accurate test result to your
      provider, according
      to a 2014 report by Lab Tests Online.
    

      Ativa's micro lab, with the footprint of a toaster, will ultimately be
      able to accurately and efficiently test up to 90 percent of Medicare's
      top 30 blood tests, McNally said. Ativa's patented disposable
      microfluidic cards need only a drop of blood yet compete with the
      quality and consistency of large lab instruments, based on our
      pre-clinical complete blood count results. The Ativa system holds great
      potential where speed-to-diagnosis is critical, such as emergency rooms
      and urgent care facilities, as well as in private physician offices and
      retail clinics and pharmacies. Because of the system's affordability and
      portability, we believe there will be great interest in this system in
      emerging countries, many of which lack access to quality lab testing of
      any kind.
    

      Jim McNally's experience with an array of point-of-care products,
      including navigating commercialization issues and the FDA, gives him
      important insights to lead Ativa at this stage, said James B. Stake,
      chairman of Ativa's board of directors. This system presents a
      breakthrough product in clinical diagnostics.

About Ativa Medical Corp.Ativa Medical Corp. is a privately
      held, emerging growth medical diagnostic company developing and
      commercializing novel point-of-care diagnostic technologies. Ativa is
      currently pursuing the commercialization of an innovative tabletop micro
      lab for clinical use. This technology will enable health care
      professionals to perform critical hematology and blood chemistry tests
      on-site and get accurate results within about 5 minutes. For more
      information, visit www.ativamed.com.
    

About the Ativa Micro Lab SystemHealth care systems
      worldwide are demanding that companies develop a more efficient
      treatment model, as 70 percent of physician decisions are driven by
      diagnostic testing. Ativa's micro lab will help clinicians make
      treatment decisions immediately, aiming to improve outcomes. The micro
      lab is compact and designed to perform the most common blood-based lab
      tests in a physician's office. The system combines flow cytometry,
      electrochemistry, colorimetric testing and imaging into a single system.
      Each test is run on a single, inexpensive, disposable card specifically
      tailored to the test of choice. The Ativa micro lab has advanced to
      demonstrating equivalence to central lab-based systems costing many
      times the price. The Ativa system's technology, including key
      microfluidic components, sample preparation, disposable test cards,
      diagnostic tests and instrumentation, is covered by 80 U.S. patents and
      184 patents worldwide. See the Ativa system in action at www.ativamed.com/videos/microlab.
