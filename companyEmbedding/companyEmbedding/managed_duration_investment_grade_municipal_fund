The Global Bond Markets Are Changing





The global bond market is undergoing a series of profound changes, challenging the traditional role of income and stability that bonds have played and creating new opportunities. We believe investors should understand these changes and adapt their portfolios to the new fixed-income landscape.











Interest Rates May Challenge Investors
 






Opportunities Exist Across the Globe, Across the Spectrum
 






Divergence in Global Growth
 






Lower Liquidity, May Mean Higher Volatility
 











Can Your Portfolio Keep Up?





We believe investors should consider dynamic and flexible fixed income investments that attempt to neutralize or even benefit from rising interest rates. Investors should also consider strategies that seek value across all sectors of the global fixed income market, allowing them to diversify geographically and take advantage of diverging growth patterns.  Overall investors may prefer highly liquid mutual funds for their long-term investments, not individual bonds, and money market funds for their short-term investments.

2017 Investment Outlook


































The Long Cycle Continues





We expect the long post-crisis economic recovery to continue in 2017. As a base case, we think growth is poised to broaden out to more countries, with the global economy drawing on more sources of strength than at any point since 2010.
From an investment perspective, our base case view is broadly supportive for risk assets. We prefer equities over credit and credit over rates, but we expect low returns from these traditional exposures given 1) elevated valuations, 2) limited upside for corporate earnings from current levels and 3) limits to economic growth potential. Broadening exposure beyond conventional stocks and bonds, identifying opportunities in emerging markets and deploying more dynamic asset allocation strategies are some ways to adapt.
In some respects, our outlook represents an extension of the same long cycle we envisioned heading into 2016. The key difference for 2017 revolves around four emerging transitions. Populism is challenging globalism and creating new tail risks. Concerns about low growth are giving way to concerns about inflation. Years of focus on monetary policy are giving way to a close watch over fiscal policy. And concerns about new regulation are acceding to hopes for de-regulation.
Transition will be an evolving theme in 2017, and we will be re-visiting it in our publications throughout the year. In this Investment Outlook, we highlight specific signposts we will be watching, both to gauge the pace of transition and to test our base case view on the key investment questions.









Three Key Questions







Is it time to de-risk?
Is it time to de-risk?
No. We think de-risking would be premature, at
least from a purely return-generating standpoint. We
expect the macro environment to remain supportive
of risk assets during 2017 amid a slow-but-steady
expansion in developed markets and an acceleration
of growth in some emerging markets.

What’s driving the expansion?
What’s driving the expansion?
We believe this is a slow-growth recovery best
explained by cyclical economic drivers. We believe
the concerns about the developed world being mired
in a pattern of underinvestment and stalled growth—
so-called secular stagnation—are overdone.

Where do we see opportunities?
Where do we see opportunities?
In a low-return world, we look for sources of
return beyond conventional stock and bond market
approaches. We also think range-bound or volatile
markets create opportunities for more dynamic
investment strategies.

Transitions We’re Watching in 2017


















												Globalism to Populism
											



The biggest transition in the current environment is a shift away from globalism to a rising populist trend.















												Stagnation to Inflation
											



We expect concerns around potential secular stagnation to give way to a more inflationary paradigm in the US.















												Monetary to Fiscal Policy
											



The focus for stimulus is shifting toward fiscal spending, as central banks are stretching toward the limits of their easing ability.
















												Regulation to De-Regulation
											



We see the potential for greater regulatory divergence globally and the potential for competitive de-regulation.

Next Generation of ETF Investing

                Over the last two decades, investors have increasingly turned to Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) seeking to benefit from a defined strategy, diversified exposure to stocks, tax efficiency and low costs. Today, we combine the potential benefits of ETFs with the advanced strategies of Goldman Sachs Asset Managment (GSAM).
            









What Are the Potential Benefits of ETFs?





ETFs have grown in popularity due to the many benefits they offer: intraday trading ease, relative transparency and a likelihood of tax efficiency—all typically at lower total cost than most actively managed mutual funds.
 











The Four Ts

We note that ETFs are not riskless investments, so investors can lose money. Please see the ETF Risk Disclosures for additional risk considerations in the end disclosures. Ordinary brokerage commissions apply. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns.
Goldman Sachs does not provide legal, tax or accounting advice to its clients. All investors are strongly urged to consult with their legal, tax, or accounting advisors regarding any potential transactions or investments. There is no assurance that the tax status or treatment of a proposed transaction or investment will continue in the future. Tax treatment or status may be changed by law or government action in the future or on a retroactive basis.










Exponential Growth of the ETF Market





Developed in the early 1990s with lower cost, transparency and tax efficiency in mind, today there are ETFs representing both broad and narrow sectors of the market, and hundreds of ways to diversify. With $2 trillion in investor assets, it’s safe to say that ETFs are here to stay.

Next Generation of Equity Index Investing

                GSAM has developed a series of ETFs built on smart beta1 principles—a transparent, rules-based strategy that goes beyond stocks’ market capitalization, resulting in a more economically intuitive way to invest.

Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta™ ETFs















Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta™ ETFs

 / 






















Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta™ ETFs





These ETFs are designed to track an ActiveBeta® Index, a proprietary performance-seeking methodology from Goldman Sachs, which tilts towards stocks based on four well-established drivers of performance, often referred to as factors.








The Four Factors














The Advantages of Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta™ Investing









Opportunity to Outperform the Market




To construct the ActiveBeta® Index, GSAM employs a simple, transparent process that helps identify and emphasize stocks within the market-cap weighted universe, potentially providing greater returns.
 









A Diversified Approach




Individual factors can be cyclical in the short run, which may lead to timing and performance challenges. Combining four complementary smart beta factors equally can potentially result in a more consistent investment experience over time.
 









Lower Cost




Not only are ActiveBeta™ ETFs a fraction of the price of most smart beta ETFs, they are also among the most competitively priced products on the market.2

Next Generation Fixed Income Investing

                GSAM now offers the next generation, smart beta Access ETFs that seek better risk-adjusted returns to help meet the needs of today’s fixed income investor.
            









Access ETFs by Goldman Sachs





GSAM’s Access ETFs can help investors build efficient fixed income portfolios. Going a step further than traditional market-value weighted methodology, a smart beta approach selects bonds based on liquidity and customized fundamentals.














The Advantages of Goldman Sachs Fixed Income Investing









Smarter Access to Bond Markets




The index employs a simple, transparent process that helps identify an investible universe, then eliminates issuers with relative deteriorating fundamentals to offer exposure to existing sector or market beta.
 









Seeks Smoother Performance, Less Volatility




As bond investors look for income and diversification, a smart beta approach seeks liquidity while minimizing exposure to factors historically associated with volatility and underperformance.
 









Lower Cost




Access ETFs are among the most competitively priced ETFs on the market. They also offer transparency and can alleviate some of the challenges of buying bonds in the over-the-counter market.3

Access to Top Insights

                GSAM developed the Goldman Sachs Hedge Fund VIP Index, which tracks insights from some of the leading thinkers in the hedge fund universe. The Goldman Sachs Hedge Industry VIP ETF seeks to track this index and provides exposure to hedge fund managers’ most important long equity ideas.
            









Introducing the Goldman Sachs Hedge Industry VIP ETF (Ticker: GVIP)





The fund seeks to track the Goldman Sachs Hedge Fund VIP Index, which is constructed in accordance with a rules-based methodology derived from concepts previously developed by Goldman Sachs’ Global Investment Research division. The Index is designed to measure the performance of fundamentally-driven hedge fund managers' “Very-Important-Positions” — those positions that appear most frequently among their top 10 long equity holdings. The Goldman Sachs Hedge Industry VIP ETF (Ticker: GVIP) seeks to deliver these high-conviction ideas through the ease, transparency and liquidity of an ETF.









The Advantages of Investing in GVIP














The Fund is not a hedge fund and does not invest in hedge funds.
1. ETFs offer many benefits, including intraday trading, relative transparency and tax efficiency potential, all at typically lower expense ratios than most actively-managed mutual funds.

Access to the Treasury Market

                GSAM developed an ETF that provides access to Treasuries with a maturity of less than a year, which are backed by the full faith and credit of the US Government. Investors in the Goldman Sachs TreasuryAccess 0-1 Year ETF can gain easy access to Treasury markets while avoiding the operational and pricing complexities of US Treasury Auctions and over-the-counter market.
            









Introducing the Goldman Sachs TreasuryAccess 0-1 Year ETF (Ticker: GBIL)





The fund seeks to track the Citi US Treasury 0–1 Year Composite Select Index, which is designed to measure the performance of U.S. Treasury Obligations4 with a maximum remaining maturity of one year. The Goldman Sachs TreasuryAccess 0–1 Year ETF (Ticker: GBIL) provides access to the Treasury market through a lower cost, convenient and transparent ETF. The fund benefits from the experience of the GSAM Liquidity Solutions team, providing trade execution, price negotiation and security selection in the short-term Treasury market.









The Advantages of Investing in GBIL










Any guarantee on U.S Treasury Obligations applies only to the underlying securities of the Fund if held to maturity and not to the value of the Fund’s shares.
Individual shares may only be purchased and sold in secondary market transactions through brokers; shares trade at market prices rather than NAV; shares may trade at a price greater than or less than NAV; and investors may incur commission costs when buying or selling shares.
The Fund is not a money market fund and does not attempt to maintain a stable net asset value.

							A Word On Risk

							Mutual fund investing involves risk; principal loss is possible. Debt or fixed income securities such as those held by the Fund, are subject to market risk, credit risk, interest rate risk, call risk, tax risk, political and economic risk, and income risk. As interest rates rise, bond prices fall. Credit risk refers to an issuers ability to make interest and principal payments when due. The Fund concentrates in non-investment-grade and unrated bonds with shorter maturities and durations which carry heightened credit risk, liquidity risk, and potential for default. In addition, the Fund may engage in a moderate amount of portfolio leverage and in doing so, assumes a higher level of risk in pursuit of its objectives. Leverage involves the risk that the Fund could lose more than its original investment and also increases the Fund's exposure to volatility, interest rate risk and credit risk.


						








Returns quoted represent past performance which is no guarantee of future performance.  Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate so that when shares are redeemed, they may be worth more or less than their original cost. Income is generally exempt from regular federal income taxes. Some income may be subject to state and local taxes and to the federal alternative minimum tax. Capital gains, if any, are subject to tax. Due to market conditions, current performance may be higher or lower than the data shown. Returns without sales charge do not reflect the imposition of the maximum sales charge, which would reduce returns. Total returns for a period of less than one year are cumulative.Performance assumes the reinvestment of dividends and capital gains. Class A shares have a 2.5% maximum sales charge. Class C and C2 shares have a 1% CDSC for redemptions within less than one year, which is not reflected in the one-year total return. Class I shares have no sales charge and may be purchased under limited circumstances or by specified classes of investors.Expense ratios are based on the Fund's most recent fiscal year end. The net expense ratio excludes credits earned on the Fund's cash on deposit with the custodian bank but includes interest expense on borrowings and interest and related expenses on self-deposited inverse floaters held by the Fund, if any.





      The fund employs high yield strategies, including significant investment in below investment grade bonds and opportunistic use of portfolio leverage during certain periods through investment in inverse floating rate securities, which other funds in its Morningstar category may not have used to the same extent.  As a result, performance comparisons may be less meaningful.
      



*Some income may be subject to state and local taxes and to the federal alternative minimum tax. Capital gains, if any, are subject to tax.

¹ Latest declared distribution per share annualized and divided by the current share price.
² Distributions may be paid from sources of income other than ordinary income, such as short term capital gains, long term capital gains or return of capital. If a distribution consists of something other than ordinary income, a 19(a) notice detailing the anticipated source(s) of the distribution will be made available. The 19(a) notice will be posted to the Fund's website and to the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation so that brokers can distribute such notices to Shareholders of the Fund. Section 19(a) notices are provided for informational purposes only and not for tax reporting purposes. The final determination of the source and tax characteristics of all distributions in a particular year will be made after the end of the year. This information is not legal or tax advice. Consult a professional regarding your specific legal or tax matters.

4 Expense ratios are annualized and reflect the funds operating expense, including interest expense and risk of fee waivers, as of the most recent annual or semi-annual report. The expense ratio, including interest expense and excluding fee waivers was 1.58%. 
 
Investment objective 
The Fund's investment objective is to provide its common shareholders with high current income exempt from regular Federal income tax while seeking to protect the value of the Fund's assets during periods of interest-rate volatility. There can be no assurance that the Fund's investment objective will be realized. 
Under normal market conditions, the Fund seeks to achieve its objective by investing at least 80% of its total assets in municipal bonds of investment grade quality (those rated Baa or higher by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. ("Moody's") or BBB or higher by either Standard & Poor's Ratings Group ("S&P"), or Fitch, Inc. ("Fitch")), or unrated municipal securities considered by the Fund's investment adviser to be of comparable quality which normally invest substantially all of its total assets in securities of investment grade quality. 
For periodic shareholder reports and recent fund-specific filings, please visit the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") website here.  
Fund Manager 
The Insight team of fixed-income professionals uses a combination of surveillance, risk management, fundamental, quantitative and technical analysis to continuously assess interest rate, security and liquidity risks to their investment-grade bond holdings. Insight Investment intends to seek consistently attractive risk-adjusted returns in the Fund through careful selection of the bond portfolio, ongoing management of the duration and the employment of an actively-managed hedging strategy. Unless you are notified to the contrary, the products and services mentioned are not insured by the FDIC (or by any governmental entity) and are not guaranteed by or obligations of The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation or any of its affiliates.

Frequently Asked Questions 
What are municipal bonds?Municipal bonds are debt instruments issued by state and local governments for the purpose of financing projects such as new schools, health care facilities and general infrastructure construction and improvement projects. In that municipal bond investors are generally allowed to exclude interest paid on a municipal bond from regular federal, and, if applicable, state and local income tax, municipal bonds may yield less than other debt instruments having similar attributes such as credit quality and duration. 
What is duration?Duration is the dollar-value weighted-average timing of a bond's cash flows and is a measure of the price sensitivity of a fixed income security relative to changes in interest rates. 
Why is Insight Investment managing the duration of this Fund?Insight Investment manages the Fund's duration to attempt to provide shareholders with the highest amount of risk-adjusted return while seeking to reduce the volatility of the Fund's income and net asset value. The management of the Fund's duration may include the utilization of a variety of hedging strategies. There can be no assurance that duration management will be successful in preserving the net asset value of any of the Fund. 
What does the "Ex-Div" or the "Ex-Dividend" date refer to?Every month the Fund pays dividends and those investors who purchase the Fund before the ex-dividend date will receive the next dividend distribution. Investors who purchase on or after the ex-dividend date will not receive the next dividend distribution. The value of the dividend is subtracted from the Fund's NAV on the ex-dividend date each month. So when the NAV is reported with an "ex-div" behind it, this means that the amount of the dividend has already been taken out of the NAV. 
Describe the differences between closed-end and open-end funds?An open-end fund may be purchased or sold at NAV. An open-end fund will issue new shares when an investor wants to purchases shares in the fund and will sell assets to redeem shares when an investor wants to sell shares. When selling an open-end fund, the price the seller receives is established at the close of the market when the NAV is calculated. Unlike an open-end fund, a closed-end fund has a limited number of shares outstanding and trades on an exchange at the market price based on supply and demand. An investor may purchase or sell shares at market price while the exchange is open. The common shares may trade at a discount or premium to the NAV. 
What is the DRIP and how does it work?DRIP is the Dividend Reinvestment Plan. The number of shares of common stock distributed to participants in the Plan in lieu of a cash dividend is determined in the following manner. Whenever the market price per share of the Fund's common stock is equal to or exceeds the net asset value per share on the valuation date, participants in the Plan will be issued new shares valued at the higher of net asset value or 95% of the then-current market value. Otherwise, the Administrator will buy shares of the common stock in the open market, on the NYSE or elsewhere. 
The Fund's annual and semi-annual reports offer a more thorough discussion of the risks and considerations associated with an investment in the Fund. Such risks and considerations include, but are not limited to: Investment Risk, Market and Selection Risk, Municipal Bond Market Risk, Interest Rate Risk, Credit Risk, Reinvestment Risk, Leverage Risk, Hedging Risk, Derivatives Risk, Anti-Takeover Provisions Risk, Market Disruption Risk, Auction Market Preferred Shares Risk and Non-Diversification Risk. 
RisksThere can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. The value of the Fund will fluctuate with the value of the underlying securities. Closed-end funds often trade at a discount to their net asset value. Risk is inherent in all investing, including the loss of your entire principal. Therefore, before investing you should consider the following risks carefully. 
An investment in the Fund may not be suitable for investors who are, or as a result of this investment would become, subject to the Federal Alternative Minimum Tax ("AMT") because the securities in the Fund may pay interest that is subject to taxation under the AMT. Special rules apply to corporate holders. Additionally, any capital gains dividends will be subject to capital gains taxes. 
Market Risk and Selection RiskMarket risk is the risk that the municipal bond market will go down in value, including the possibility that the market will go down sharply and unpredictably. Selection risk is the risk that the securities that the Fund's investment adviser, Insight, selects will underperform the municipal bond market, the relevant market indices, or other funds with similar investment objectives and investment strategies. 
Municipal Bond Market RiskThe amount of public information available about the municipal bonds in the Fund's portfolio is generally less than that for corporate equities or bonds, and the investment performance of the Fund may therefore be more dependent on the analytical abilities of Insight than that of an equity fund or taxable bond fund. The ability of municipal issuers to make timely payments of interest and principal may be diminished during general economic downturns and as governmental cost burdens are reallocated among federal, state and local governments. In addition, laws enacted in the future by Congress or state legislatures or referenda could extend the time for payment of principal and/or interest, or impose other constraints on enforcement of such obligations, or on the ability of municipalities to levy taxes. In the event of bankruptcy of an issuer, the Fund could experience delays in collecting principal and interest and the Fund may not, in all circumstances, be able to collect all principal and interest to which it is entitled. 
Revenue bonds issued by state or local agencies to finance the development of low-income, multi-family housing involve special risks in addition to those associated with municipal securities generally, including that the underlying properties may not generate sufficient income to pay expenses and interest costs. Such securities are generally non-recourse against the property owner, may be junior to the rights of others with an interest in the properties, may pay interest that changes based in part on the financial performance of the property, may be prepayable without penalty and may be used to finance the construction of housing developments which, until completed and rented, do not generate income to pay interest. Increases in interest rates payable on senior obligations may make it more difficult for issuers to meet payment obligations on subordinated bonds. 
Municipal leases and certificates of participation involve special risks not normally associated with general obligations or revenue bonds. Leases and installment purchase or conditional sale contracts (which normally provide for title to the leased asset to pass eventually to the governmental issuer) have evolved as a means for governmental issuers to acquire property and equipment without meeting the constitutional and statutory requirements for the issuance of debt. Such debt issuance limitations are usually deemed to be inapplicable because of the inclusion in many leases or contracts of "non-appropriation" clauses that relieve the governmental issuer of any obligation to make future payments under the lease or contract unless money is appropriated for such purpose by the appropriate legislative body on a yearly or other periodic basis. In addition, such leases or contracts may be subject to temporary abatement of payments in the event the governmental issuer is prevented from maintaining occupancy of the leased premises or utilizing the leased equipment. Although the obligations may be secured by the leased equipment or facilities, the disposition of the property in the event of non-appropriation or foreclosure might prove difficult, time consuming and costly, and may result in a delay in recovering or the failure to fully recover ownership of the assets. 
Certificates of participation, which represent interests in unmanaged pools of municipal leases or installment contracts, involve the same risks as the underlying municipal leases. In addition, the Fund may be dependent upon the municipal authority issuing the certificate of participation to exercise remedies with respect to the underlying securities. Certificates of participation also entail a risk of default or bankruptcy, both of the issuer of the municipal lease and also the municipal agency issuing the certificate of participation. 
Municipal securities, like other debt obligations, are subject to the risk of nonpayment. The ability of issuers of municipal securities to make timely payments of interest and principal may be adversely impacted in general economic downturns and as relative governmental cost burdens are allocated and reallocated among federal, state and local governmental units. Such nonpayment would result in a reduction of income to the Fund and could result in a reduction in the value of the municipal security experiencing nonpayment and a potential decrease in the net asset value of the Fund. A decline in income could affect the Fund's ability to pay dividends on the common shares. 
Interest Rate and Credit RiskThe Fund invests in municipal bonds which are subject to interest rate and credit risk. Interest rate risk is the risk that prices of municipal bonds generally increase when interest rates decline and decrease when interest rates increase. Prices of longer term securities generally change more in response to interest rate changes than prices of shorter-term securities. The common share net asset value and market price per common share of the Fund will fluctuate more in response to changes in market interest rates when the Fund invests primarily in longer-term bonds rather than shorter-term bonds. The Fund's use of leverage by the issuance of Auction Market Preferred Shares ("AMPS") and any investment in inverse floating obligations may increase interest rate risk. Market interest rates for investment grade municipal bonds in which the Fund primarily invests have declined significantly below the historical average rates for such bonds and market interest rates are near historical lows. These levels increase the risk that these rates will rise in the future (which would cause the value of the Fund's net assets to decline). Credit risk is the risk that the issuer will be unable to pay the interest or principal when due. The degree of credit risk depends on both the financial condition of the issuer and the terms of the obligation. The Fund intends to invest at least 80% of its total assets in municipal bonds that are rated investment grade by S&P, Moody's or Fitch. It may also invest in unrated and non-investment-grade-rated municipal bonds. 
Variable and Floating Rate SecuritiesVariable and floating rate instruments involve certain obligations that may carry variable or floating rates of interest, and may involve a conditional or unconditional demand feature. Such instruments bear interest at rates which are not fixed, but which vary with changes in specified market rates or indices. The interest rates on these securities may be reset daily, weekly, quarterly, or some other reset period, and may have a set floor or ceiling on interest rate changes. There is a risk that the current interest rate on such obligations may not accurately reflect existing market interest rates. 
Call and Redemption RiskCertain municipal bonds are structured so that the issuer may call the bond for redemption prior to maturity. If this happens to a municipal bond held by the Fund, the Fund may lose income and may have to invest the proceeds in municipal bonds with lower yields. 
Private Activity BondsThe Fund may invest in certain tax exempt securities classified as "private activity bonds." These bonds may subject certain investors in the Fund to the AMT. The Fund may invest up to 25% of its total assets in municipal bonds subject to the AMT. The Fund is not restricted with respect to investing in private activity bonds that are not subject to the AMT. 
LeverageLeverage creates certain risks for common shareholders, including higher volatility of both the net asset value and the market price of the common shares, because common shareholders bear the effects of changes in the value of the Fund's investments. Leverage also creates the risk that the investment return on the Fund's common shares will be reduced to the extent the dividends paid on preferred shares and other expenses of the preferred shares exceed the income earned by the Fund on its investments. If the Fund is liquidated, preferred shareholders will be entitled to receive liquidating distributions before any distribution is made to common shareholders. When the Fund uses leverage, the fees paid to Insight will be higher than if leverage was not used. 
Inflation RiskInflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from an investment will be worth less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. As inflation increases, the real value of the common shares and distributions can decline. In addition, during periods of rising inflation, preferred share dividend rates would likely increase, which would tend to further reduce returns to common shareholders. 
Portfolio StrategiesThe Fund may engage in various portfolio strategies both to seek to hedge its portfolio against adverse effects from movements in interest rates and in the securities markets generally and to seek to increase the return of the Fund. These strategies include the use of derivatives such as exchange traded financial futures and option contracts, options on futures contracts, or over-the-counter dealer transactions in caps, swap agreements or swaptions, the risks of which are summarized in the description of Derivatives Risk. Such strategies subject the Fund to the risk that, if Insight incorrectly forecasts market values, interest rates or other applicable factors, the Fund's performance could suffer. Certain of these strategies may provide investment leverage to the Fund's portfolio and result in many of the same risks of leverage to the holders of the Fund's common shares as discussed in the description of Leverage. The Fund is not required to use derivatives or other portfolio strategies and may not do so. Distributions by the Fund of any income or gain realized on the Fund's hedging transactions generally will not be exempt from regular Federal income tax. There can be no assurance that the Fund's portfolio strategies will be effective. 
Derivatives RiskDerivatives are financial contracts whose value depends on, or is derived from, the value of an underlying asset, reference rate or index, or the relationship between two indices. The Fund may invest in a variety of derivative instruments for hedging purposes, such as exchange-traded financial futures and option contracts, options on futures contracts, or over-the-counter dealer transactions in caps, swap agreements or swaptions. The Fund may use derivatives as a substitute for taking a position in an underlying security or other asset and/or as part of a strategy designed to reduce exposure to other risks, such as interest rate risk. The Fund also may use derivatives to add leverage to the portfolio. The Fund's use of derivative instruments involves risks different from, and possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in securities and other traditional investments. Derivatives are subject to a number of risks such as liquidity risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, leveraging risk, counterparty risk, the risk of ambiguous documentation and selection risk. They also involve the risk of mispricing or improper valuation and the risk that changes in the value of the derivative may not correlate perfectly with the underlying asset, rate or index. Under the terms of certain derivative instruments, the Fund could lose more than the principal amount invested. The use of derivatives also may increase the amount of taxes payable by common shareholders. Also, suitable derivative transactions may not be available in all circumstances and there can be no assurance that the Fund will engage in these transactions to reduce exposure to other risks when that would be beneficial. 
Affiliated UnderwritingsProvisions of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder (the "1940 Act"), may limit the Fund's purchases of municipal bonds in the new issue or secondary market for which BNY Mellon acts as underwriter or receives fees for services provided to issuers or underwriters thereof.  However, based upon current market conditions, the size of the Fund and the current amount of outstanding preferred shares, Insight believes that such inability should not adversely affect the Fund's ability to achieve its investment objective. 
Anti-takeover ProvisionsThe Fund's Amended and Restated Agreement and Declaration of Trust dated as of July 21, 2003 (the "Declaration") and By-laws include provisions that could limit the ability of other entities or persons to acquire control of the Fund or to change the composition of its Board of Trustees. Such provisions could limit the ability of common shareholders to sell their shares at a premium over prevailing market prices by discouraging a third party from seeking to obtain control of the Fund. 
Risk of Investing in Auction Market Preferred Shares (AMPS)The AMPS market continues to remain illiquid as auctions for nearly all AMPS continue to fail. A failed auction is not a default, nor does it require the redemption of a fund's auction-rate preferred shares. Provisions in the Fund's offering documents provide a mechanism to set a maximum rate in the event of a failed auction, and, thus, investors will continue to be entitled to receive payment for holding these AMPS. 
Recent Market Developments RiskGlobal and domestic financial markets have experienced periods of unprecedented turmoil. Recently, markets have witnessed more stabilized economic activity as expectations for an economic recovery increased. However, risks to a robust resumption of growth persist. Continuing uncertainty as to the status of the euro and the European Monetary Union has created significant volatility in currency and financial markets generally. A return to unfavorable economic conditions or sustained economic slowdown could adversely impact the Fund's portfolio. Financial market conditions, as well as various social and political tensions in the US and around the world, have contributed to increased market volatility and may have long-term effects on the US and worldwide financial markets and cause further economic uncertainties or deterioration in the US and worldwide. Insight does not know how long the financial markets will continue to be affected by these events and cannot predict the effects of these or similar events in the future on the US and global economies and securities markets.

Ratings shown are assigned by one or more Nationally Recognized Statistical Credit Rating Organizations ('NRSRO'), such as Standard & Poor's, Moody's and Fitch. The ratings are an indication of an issuer's creditworthiness and typically range from AAA or Aaa (highest) to D (lowest). When two or more ratings are available, the lower rating is used; and when only one is available, that rating is used. The Non-Rated category consists of securities that have not been rated by an NRSRO. U.S. Treasury securities and U.S. Government Agency securities are not rated but deemed to be equivalent to securities rated AAA/Aaa. Credit quality, as rated by S&P, Moody's or Fitch, is an assessment of the credit worthiness of an issuer of the underlying security and not the Fund or its shares. Ratings are subject to change.

A closed-end fund is not continuously offered. After the initial public offering, shares are sold on the open market through a stock exchange. Additional information regarding the fund can be found in the fund's most recent shareholder report. This material is presented only to provide information and is not intended for trading purposes. 
Risks and Other Considerations:  There can be no assurance that the fund will achieve its investment objective. The value of the Fund will fluctuate with the value of the underlying securities. Historically, closed-end funds often trade at a discount to their net asset value. The Fund is subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of the entire amount that you invest. Municipal Bond Market Risk. The amount of public information available about the Municipal Bonds in the fund's portfolio is generally less than that for corporate equities or bonds, and the investment performance of the Fund may therefore be more dependent on the analytical abilities of Insight than that of an equity fund or taxable bond fund. The secondary market for municipal bonds also tends to be less well-developed, or liquid, than many other securities markets, which may adversely affect the Fund's ability to sell its bonds at attractive prices or at prices approximating those at which the Fund currently values them. The ability of municipal issuers to make timely payments of interest and principal may be diminished during general economic downturns and as governmental cost burdens are reallocated among federal, state and local governments. In addition, laws enacted in the future by Congress or state legislatures or referenda could extend the time for payment of principal and/or interest, or impose other constraints on enforcement of such obligations, or on the ability of municipalities to levy taxes. In the event of bankruptcy of an issuer, the Fund could experience delays in collecting principal and interest and the Fund may not, in all circumstances, be able to collect all principal and interest to which it is entitled. Municipal income may be subject to state and local taxes. Some income may be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax for certain investors. Capital gains, if any, are taxable. Portfolio Strategies. The use of derivatives involve risks different from, or possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in the underlying assets. Derivatives can be highly volatile, illiquid, and difficult to value and there is the risk that changes in the value of a derivative held by the portfolio will not correlate with the underlying instruments or the portfolio's other investments. Distributions by the Fund of any income or gain realized on the Fund's hedging transactions generally will not be exempt from regular Federal income tax. There can be no assurance that the Fund's portfolio strategies will be effective. Interest Rate and Credit Risk. Bonds are subject to interest rate, credit, liquidity, call and market risks, to varying degrees. Generally, all other factors being equal, bond prices are inversely related to interest-rate changes and rate increases can cause price declines. Credit risk is the risk that the issuer will be unable to pay the interest or principal when due. The degree of credit risk depends on both the financial condition of the issuer and the terms of the obligation. The Fund intends to invest in Municipal Bonds that are rated investment grade by S&P, Moody's or Fitch. It may also invest in unrated municipal bonds that Insight believes are of comparable quality. Risks of Investing in AMPS. The Fund's use of leverage by the issuance of Auction Market Preferred Shares (“AMPS”) and any investment in inverse floating obligations may increase interest rate risk. The AMPS market continues to remain illiquid as auctions for nearly all AMPS continue to fail. A failed auction is not a default, nor does it require the redemption of a fund's auction-rate preferred shares. Provisions in the Fund's offering documents provide a mechanism to set a maximum rate in the event of a failed auction, and, thus, investors will continue to be entitled to receive payment for holding these AMPS. In addition to the risks described above, the Fund is also subject to: Market Risk and Selection Risk, Call and Redemption Risk, Private Activity Bonds, Risks of Tobacco-Related Municipal Bonds, Leverage, Inflation Risk, Derivatives Risk, Affiliated Insurers, and Anti-takeover Provisions, Market Disruption. Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, and expenses before investing. Please refer to the most recent annual or semi-annual report.

Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results, and current performance may be lower or higher than the figures shown. Since Inception returns assume a purchase of common shares at each Fund's initial offering price for market price returns or the Fund's initial net asset value (NAV) for NAV returns. Returns for periods of less than one year are not annualized. All distributions are assumed to be reinvested either in accordance with the dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP) for market price returns or NAV for NAV returns. Until the DRIP price is available from the Plan Agent, the market price returns reflect the reinvestment at the closing market price on the last business day of the month. Once the DRIP is available around mid-month, the market price returns are updated to reflect reinvestment at the DRIP price. All returns include the deduction of management fees, operating expenses and all other fund expenses, and do not reflect the deduction of brokerage commissions or taxes that investors may pay on distributions or the sale of shares. Please refer to the most recent annual or semi-annual report for additional information.

Ordinary Dividends, Tax-Exempt Income, Long-term Capital Gains and Return of Capital figures are a percentage of the total distribution. 
Final determination of the tax character of distributions aid by the Fund for the current calendar year will be distributed to shareholders in January of the following year. 
A closed-end fund is not continuously offered. After the initial public offering, shares are sold on the open market through a stock exchange. Additional information regarding the fund can be found in the fund's most recent shareholder report. This material is presented only to provide information and is not intended for trading purposes. 
Risks and Other Considerations:  There can be no assurance that the fund will achieve its investment objective. The value of the Fund will fluctuate with the value of the underlying securities. Historically, closed-end funds often trade at a discount to their net asset value. The Fund is subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of the entire amount that you invest. Municipal Bond Market Risk. The amount of public information available about the Municipal Bonds in the fund's portfolio is generally less than that for corporate equities or bonds, and the investment performance of the Fund may therefore be more dependent on the analytical abilities of Insight than that of an equity fund or taxable bond fund. The secondary market for municipal bonds also tends to be less well-developed, or liquid, than many other securities markets, which may adversely affect the Fund's ability to sell its bonds at attractive prices or at prices approximating those at which the Fund currently values them. The ability of municipal issuers to make timely payments of interest and principal may be diminished during general economic downturns and as governmental cost burdens are reallocated among federal, state and local governments. In addition, laws enacted in the future by Congress or state legislatures or referenda could extend the time for payment of principal and/or interest, or impose other constraints on enforcement of such obligations, or on the ability of municipalities to levy taxes. In the event of bankruptcy of an issuer, the Fund could experience delays in collecting principal and interest and the Fund may not, in all circumstances, be able to collect all principal and interest to which it is entitled. Municipal income may be subject to state and local taxes. Some income may be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax for certain investors. Capital gains, if any, are taxable. Portfolio Strategies. The use of derivatives involve risks different from, or possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in the underlying assets. Derivatives can be highly volatile, illiquid, and difficult to value and there is the risk that changes in the value of a derivative held by the portfolio will not correlate with the underlying instruments or the portfolio's other investments. Distributions by the Fund of any income or gain realized on the Fund's hedging transactions generally will not be exempt from regular Federal income tax. There can be no assurance that the Fund's portfolio strategies will be effective. Interest Rate and Credit Risk. Bonds are subject to interest rate, credit, liquidity, call and market risks, to varying degrees. Generally, all other factors being equal, bond prices are inversely related to interest-rate changes and rate increases can cause price declines. Credit risk is the risk that the issuer will be unable to pay the interest or principal when due. The degree of credit risk depends on both the financial condition of the issuer and the terms of the obligation. The Fund intends to invest in Municipal Bonds that are rated investment grade by S&P, Moody's or Fitch. It may also invest in unrated municipal bonds that Insight believes are of comparable quality. Risks of Investing in AMPS. The Fund's use of leverage by the issuance of Auction Market Preferred Shares (“AMPS”) and any investment in inverse floating obligations may increase interest rate risk. The AMPS market continues to remain illiquid as auctions for nearly all AMPS continue to fail. A failed auction is not a default, nor does it require the redemption of a fund's auction-rate preferred shares. Provisions in the Fund's offering documents provide a mechanism to set a maximum rate in the event of a failed auction, and, thus, investors will continue to be entitled to receive payment for holding these AMPS. In addition to the risks described above, the Fund is also subject to: Market Risk and Selection Risk, Call and Redemption Risk, Private Activity Bonds, Risks of Tobacco-Related Municipal Bonds, Leverage, Inflation Risk, Derivatives Risk, Affiliated Insurers, and Anti-takeover Provisions, Market Disruption. Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, and expenses before investing. Please refer to the most recent annual or semi-annual report.

Navigating Global Bond Markets















Navigating Global Bond Markets

 / 























The Global Bond Markets Are Changing





The global bond market is undergoing a series of profound changes, challenging the traditional role of income and stability that bonds have played and creating new opportunities. We believe investors should understand these changes and adapt their portfolios to the new fixed-income landscape.











Interest Rates May Challenge Investors
 






Opportunities Exist Across the Globe, Across the Spectrum
 






Divergence in Global Growth
 






Lower Liquidity, May Mean Higher Volatility
 











Can Your Portfolio Keep Up?





We believe investors should consider dynamic and flexible fixed income investments that attempt to neutralize or even benefit from rising interest rates. Investors should also consider strategies that seek value across all sectors of the global fixed income market, allowing them to diversify geographically and take advantage of diverging growth patterns.  Overall investors may prefer highly liquid mutual funds for their long-term investments, not individual bonds, and money market funds for their short-term investments.

2017 Investment Outlook


































The Long Cycle Continues





We expect the long post-crisis economic recovery to continue in 2017. As a base case, we think growth is poised to broaden out to more countries, with the global economy drawing on more sources of strength than at any point since 2010.
From an investment perspective, our base case view is broadly supportive for risk assets. We prefer equities over credit and credit over rates, but we expect low returns from these traditional exposures given 1) elevated valuations, 2) limited upside for corporate earnings from current levels and 3) limits to economic growth potential. Broadening exposure beyond conventional stocks and bonds, identifying opportunities in emerging markets and deploying more dynamic asset allocation strategies are some ways to adapt.
In some respects, our outlook represents an extension of the same long cycle we envisioned heading into 2016. The key difference for 2017 revolves around four emerging transitions. Populism is challenging globalism and creating new tail risks. Concerns about low growth are giving way to concerns about inflation. Years of focus on monetary policy are giving way to a close watch over fiscal policy. And concerns about new regulation are acceding to hopes for de-regulation.
Transition will be an evolving theme in 2017, and we will be re-visiting it in our publications throughout the year. In this Investment Outlook, we highlight specific signposts we will be watching, both to gauge the pace of transition and to test our base case view on the key investment questions.









Three Key Questions







Is it time to de-risk?
Is it time to de-risk?
No. We think de-risking would be premature, at
least from a purely return-generating standpoint. We
expect the macro environment to remain supportive
of risk assets during 2017 amid a slow-but-steady
expansion in developed markets and an acceleration
of growth in some emerging markets.

What’s driving the expansion?
What’s driving the expansion?
We believe this is a slow-growth recovery best
explained by cyclical economic drivers. We believe
the concerns about the developed world being mired
in a pattern of underinvestment and stalled growth—
so-called secular stagnation—are overdone.

Where do we see opportunities?
Where do we see opportunities?
In a low-return world, we look for sources of
return beyond conventional stock and bond market
approaches. We also think range-bound or volatile
markets create opportunities for more dynamic
investment strategies.

Transitions We’re Watching in 2017


















												Globalism to Populism
											



The biggest transition in the current environment is a shift away from globalism to a rising populist trend.















												Stagnation to Inflation
											



We expect concerns around potential secular stagnation to give way to a more inflationary paradigm in the US.















												Monetary to Fiscal Policy
											



The focus for stimulus is shifting toward fiscal spending, as central banks are stretching toward the limits of their easing ability.
















												Regulation to De-Regulation
											



We see the potential for greater regulatory divergence globally and the potential for competitive de-regulation.

Next Generation of ETF Investing

                Over the last two decades, investors have increasingly turned to Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) seeking to benefit from a defined strategy, diversified exposure to stocks, tax efficiency and low costs. Today, we combine the potential benefits of ETFs with the advanced strategies of Goldman Sachs Asset Managment (GSAM).
            









What Are the Potential Benefits of ETFs?





ETFs have grown in popularity due to the many benefits they offer: intraday trading ease, relative transparency and a likelihood of tax efficiency—all typically at lower total cost than most actively managed mutual funds.
 











The Four Ts

We note that ETFs are not riskless investments, so investors can lose money. Please see the ETF Risk Disclosures for additional risk considerations in the end disclosures. Ordinary brokerage commissions apply. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns.
Goldman Sachs does not provide legal, tax or accounting advice to its clients. All investors are strongly urged to consult with their legal, tax, or accounting advisors regarding any potential transactions or investments. There is no assurance that the tax status or treatment of a proposed transaction or investment will continue in the future. Tax treatment or status may be changed by law or government action in the future or on a retroactive basis.










Exponential Growth of the ETF Market





Developed in the early 1990s with lower cost, transparency and tax efficiency in mind, today there are ETFs representing both broad and narrow sectors of the market, and hundreds of ways to diversify. With $2 trillion in investor assets, it’s safe to say that ETFs are here to stay.

Next Generation of Equity Index Investing

                GSAM has developed a series of ETFs built on smart beta1 principles—a transparent, rules-based strategy that goes beyond stocks’ market capitalization, resulting in a more economically intuitive way to invest.

Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta™ ETFs















Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta™ ETFs

 / 






















Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta™ ETFs





These ETFs are designed to track an ActiveBeta® Index, a proprietary performance-seeking methodology from Goldman Sachs, which tilts towards stocks based on four well-established drivers of performance, often referred to as factors.








The Four Factors














The Advantages of Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta™ Investing









Opportunity to Outperform the Market




To construct the ActiveBeta® Index, GSAM employs a simple, transparent process that helps identify and emphasize stocks within the market-cap weighted universe, potentially providing greater returns.
 









A Diversified Approach




Individual factors can be cyclical in the short run, which may lead to timing and performance challenges. Combining four complementary smart beta factors equally can potentially result in a more consistent investment experience over time.
 









Lower Cost




Not only are ActiveBeta™ ETFs a fraction of the price of most smart beta ETFs, they are also among the most competitively priced products on the market.2

Next Generation Fixed Income Investing

                GSAM now offers the next generation, smart beta Access ETFs that seek better risk-adjusted returns to help meet the needs of today’s fixed income investor.
            









Access ETFs by Goldman Sachs





GSAM’s Access ETFs can help investors build efficient fixed income portfolios. Going a step further than traditional market-value weighted methodology, a smart beta approach selects bonds based on liquidity and customized fundamentals.














The Advantages of Goldman Sachs Fixed Income Investing









Smarter Access to Bond Markets




The index employs a simple, transparent process that helps identify an investible universe, then eliminates issuers with relative deteriorating fundamentals to offer exposure to existing sector or market beta.
 









Seeks Smoother Performance, Less Volatility




As bond investors look for income and diversification, a smart beta approach seeks liquidity while minimizing exposure to factors historically associated with volatility and underperformance.
 









Lower Cost




Access ETFs are among the most competitively priced ETFs on the market. They also offer transparency and can alleviate some of the challenges of buying bonds in the over-the-counter market.3

Access to Top Insights

                GSAM developed the Goldman Sachs Hedge Fund VIP Index, which tracks insights from some of the leading thinkers in the hedge fund universe. The Goldman Sachs Hedge Industry VIP ETF seeks to track this index and provides exposure to hedge fund managers’ most important long equity ideas.
            









Introducing the Goldman Sachs Hedge Industry VIP ETF (Ticker: GVIP)





The fund seeks to track the Goldman Sachs Hedge Fund VIP Index, which is constructed in accordance with a rules-based methodology derived from concepts previously developed by Goldman Sachs’ Global Investment Research division. The Index is designed to measure the performance of fundamentally-driven hedge fund managers' “Very-Important-Positions” — those positions that appear most frequently among their top 10 long equity holdings. The Goldman Sachs Hedge Industry VIP ETF (Ticker: GVIP) seeks to deliver these high-conviction ideas through the ease, transparency and liquidity of an ETF.









The Advantages of Investing in GVIP














The Fund is not a hedge fund and does not invest in hedge funds.
1. ETFs offer many benefits, including intraday trading, relative transparency and tax efficiency potential, all at typically lower expense ratios than most actively-managed mutual funds.

Access to the Treasury Market

                GSAM developed an ETF that provides access to Treasuries with a maturity of less than a year, which are backed by the full faith and credit of the US Government. Investors in the Goldman Sachs TreasuryAccess 0-1 Year ETF can gain easy access to Treasury markets while avoiding the operational and pricing complexities of US Treasury Auctions and over-the-counter market.
            









Introducing the Goldman Sachs TreasuryAccess 0-1 Year ETF (Ticker: GBIL)





The fund seeks to track the Citi US Treasury 0–1 Year Composite Select Index, which is designed to measure the performance of U.S. Treasury Obligations4 with a maximum remaining maturity of one year. The Goldman Sachs TreasuryAccess 0–1 Year ETF (Ticker: GBIL) provides access to the Treasury market through a lower cost, convenient and transparent ETF. The fund benefits from the experience of the GSAM Liquidity Solutions team, providing trade execution, price negotiation and security selection in the short-term Treasury market.









The Advantages of Investing in GBIL










Any guarantee on U.S Treasury Obligations applies only to the underlying securities of the Fund if held to maturity and not to the value of the Fund’s shares.
Individual shares may only be purchased and sold in secondary market transactions through brokers; shares trade at market prices rather than NAV; shares may trade at a price greater than or less than NAV; and investors may incur commission costs when buying or selling shares.
The Fund is not a money market fund and does not attempt to maintain a stable net asset value.
