The Revolution In Cardiac DiagnosticsLaboratory accuracy testing in the palm of your hand
Taking diagnosis to a new, super-sensitive, nano-magnetic level
Learn More    Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the Western WorldAccounting for more than 17 million deaths p.a. In Europe and the US alone approximately 15-20 million patients a year visit an
Emergency Department (ED) reporting chest pain which must be investigated as possibly caused by a cardiac event.

People in the U.S. died from heart disease, stroke and other cardiovascular diseases in 2013. That’s around one of every three deaths in America.

Every 43 seconds someone in the US
has a heart attack.

Spent on unnecessary admissions
annually in the US alone.Acute Myocardial Infarction (heart attack, Acute Myocardial Infraction “AMI”) affects all of us at some point in our lives, directly or indirectly, Rapid diagnosis is key; treatment in the first “Golden Hour” being crucial to survival. Equally, early “rule out” of AMI as  the cause of chest pain can save healthcare providers $billions.About Our TechnologyOur MissionThrough our Joint Venture ownership in MIDS Medical we are developing MIDS Cardiac™, a cost-effective hand held Point of Care rapid cardiac diagnostic device. MIDS Medical applies patent-protected magnetic nanoparticle detection technology and world-class technical expertise.Our development targets the delivery of a hand held device to support high sensitivity tests to identify or discount AMI (Heart Attack), with accuracy equal or better than gold standard laboratory tests, within minutes. This will significantly accelerate the triage, diagnosis, treatment and disposition of patients reporting chest pain and with suspected Acute Myocardial Infarction.The system is designed to be used with a minimum of training; by any ER nurse or by paramedics at the scene. We believe such a device will be in universal demand; able to meet a critical medical need and rapidly penetrate a multi-billion dollar market.Learn MoreMIDS Cardiac™Rapid detection of very low levels of cardiac markers with a primary focus on troponin I and T, designed to equal or exceed gold standard laboratory levels of accuracy, at the Point of Care.

MIDS Cardiac™ is being developed to deliver the following key features:

Equal or superior to gold standard laboratory high sensitivity assays

Single troponin I or T test within 3 minutes and three panel test (additional cardiac biomarkers within 8 minutes)

A fraction of the cost of laboratory analyzers and results not requiring interpretation from specialized medical personnel

Handheld reader design: automated operation by minimally trained personnel, little manual intervention, digital output with low power usage and connectivity to hospital and health authority IT systems

Detects most cardiac biomarkers at the magnetic nanoparticle level. Examples are troponin T & I, D-dimer, Myoglobin and CK-MB

Requires a tiny finger prick blood sample. Existing AMI tests require anything from 3 to 400 times this amount of blood, causing distress and discomfort to the patientLearn More

					Full Description



Zenosense, Inc. (Zenosense), incorporated on August 11, 2008, is focused on commencing the business of developing specialized and non-invasive disease sensory devices. The Company's focus is on products designed to detect methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) /Staphylococcus aureus (SA) when present in healthcare environments and to detect the presence of lung cancer in a patient. The Company's product is focused on sampling the air and continuously monitoring the airborne, the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) signatures emitted, by MRSA/SA. The Company's device with a single sensor is focused on performing the entire VOC spectrum scan, as the adaptive processing software enables it to perform various scans, creating multiple virtual sensors from a single sensor. At the detection stage the VOC detection intends to electronically process and pattern process in a neural network. The MRSA/SA VOC signatures are emitted, when the bacteria has infected and expressed itself as a disease in the patient. The Company's device is intended to be produced in two forms: a wearable/bed-positioned device, powered by a rechargeable battery to be positioned on the person; patients and medical staff, and in the event of any infection, the MRSA device intends to detect the VOCs produced by the infected person and express an audio/visual alarm, and an adapted, fixed device positioned in the room, mains powered, with culture-amplification of any MRSA/SA presence, to monitor the room volume, which would be network monitored.The Lung Cancer Technology is focused on three phases of development. The Phase I focuses on a review of current research on lung cancer biomarkers and an analysis of hospital research; Phase II is focused on a series of tests for sensitivity and specificity of the developed sensor as applied to the selected biomarkers meeting the specificity threshold, and Phase III is focused on planning the prototyping of a Zenosense device for lung cancer detection. The MRSA technology's development stages include Phase I, wherein a prototype of MRSA/SA detection device is produced; Phase II, which focuses on producing a MRSA device ready and used to test over 100 MRSA colonized patients, and Phase III, which focuses on completing over two months of hospital-based intensive testing by hospital personnel to test the sensibility, specificity and accuracy of the Zenosense MRSA device.The Company competes with Cepheid, Nerac and FCubed.
