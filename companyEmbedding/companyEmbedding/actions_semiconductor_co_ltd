^ The term "Cortex-A9 family" used by Actions is similar to the description used by the company for the CPU cores inside the ATM7029, which have been proven to be Cortex-A5 cores. The ARM Cortex-A5 would be more be accurately described as being "Cortex-A7 family", being slower than but otherwise equivalent to the ARM Cortex-A7, rather than being directly related to the higher-performance ARM Cortex-A9.



Adoption[edit]




Close-up of the Ainol Hero 10 II PCB showing the Actions Semiconductor ATM7029 SoC ASIC and the ATC2603A Mixed signal ASIC.


S1 MP3 players use chipsets designed by Actions.
In 2012, Actions Semiconductor produced the ATM7029 which is a quad-core ARM Cortex-A5-based SoC using Vivante Corporations GC1000 GPU.[15] This SoC has been used in the Ainol NOVO10 Hero II tablet and other low end tablets.[16]
For Q2 2014, Actions was reported to be fourth largest supplier of tablet processors to the Chinese market.[17]
Legal cases[edit]
At one point, Actions was sued by Sigmatel with Sigmatel prevailing. The findings were that Actions infringed upon Sigmatel by directly copying the ASICs designed by Sigmatel, once a world leader in the MP3 ASIC market. Sigmatel later was sold to Freescale Semiconductor.

The ARM Cortex-A5 would be more be accurately described as being "Cortex-A7 family", being slower than but otherwise equivalent to the ARM Cortex-A7, rather than being directly related to the higher-performance ARM Cortex-A9.



Adoption[edit]

S1 MP3 players use chipsets designed by Actions.
In 2012, Actions Semiconductor produced the ATM7029 which is a quad-core ARM Cortex-A5-based SoC using Vivante Corporations GC1000 GPU.[15] This SoC has been used in the Ainol NOVO10 Hero II tablet and other low end tablets.[16]
For Q2 2014, Actions was reported to be fourth largest supplier of tablet processors to the Chinese market.[17]
Legal cases[edit]
At one point, Actions was sued by Sigmatel with Sigmatel prevailing. The findings were that Actions infringed upon Sigmatel by directly copying the ASICs designed by Sigmatel, once a world leader in the MP3 ASIC market. Sigmatel later was sold to Freescale Semiconductor.

Actions Semiconductor Introduces 0.18 Micron Product with New Power Management Technology


ZHUHAI, China -- June 19, 2006 -- Actions Semiconductor Co., Ltd., one of China's leading fabless semiconductor companies that provides comprehensive mixed-signal system-on-a-chip (SoC) solutions for portable consumer electronics, today announced that its new 0.18 micron mixed signal multimedia SoC product has passed all necessary preproduction trials and will be ready for shipment in approximately 8 weeks. Actions' latest multimedia product is the Company's first product to adopt the 0.18 micron process, new audio decoding technology, and new power management technology. This new audio decoding technology supports higher audio compression rates, which prevents data loss during file compression and produces better audio quality, comparable to a CD. The new power management design is further optimized by reduced power consumption when compared to previous products, and avoids potential technology overlap with competitors. The product is compatible with APE and OGG audio formats, as well as traditional MP3 and WMA formats. It is also compatible with Windows Media Digital Rights Management 10 (WMDRM10) and Media Transfer Protocol (MTP). Additionally, the new product supports USB 2.0 high-speed transfer rates, image storage and display, battery charge protection, and video display on movement. The product also supports Actions' AMV video engine, enabling smoother video playback with better audio quality for multimedia players by maximizing battery life and power management capabilities. "Our design technology is already recognized as industry leading," commented Mr. Nan-Horng Yeh, the Chief Executive Officer of Actions. "The unique design of our 0.25 micron technology products made them comparable to our competitors' 0.18 micron process products. Actions' migration to 0.18 micron will further enhance our ability to provide cutting edge solutions and compelling cost advantages." About Actions Semiconductor Actions Semiconductor is one of China's leading fabless semiconductor companies that provides mixed-signal and multimedia SoC solutions for portable consumer electronics. Actions Semiconductor products include SoCs, firmware, software, solution development kits, as well as detailed specifications of other required components and references to the providers of those components.

Actions Semiconductor Co., Ltd. Company Profile

   Portable media players are the bread and butter of this firm. Actions Semiconductor is one of China's leading fabless semiconductor companies. Competition and the global recession, which slowed sales of consumer electronics, have dampened Actions' sales. The company designs system-on-a-chip (SoC) products for the development and manufacture of battery-powered, portable consumer electronic devices that capture, store, and play digital media files, such as compressed audio, image, and video files, including MP3 players. Five value-added distributors in China collectively account for nearly two-thirds of the company's sales. Customers located in China and Hong Kong provide nearly all of sales.

Turning Signal Integrity Inside Out














WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO TURN SIGNAL INTEGRITY
                SIMULATION INSIDE OUT?






> Today's electronics requires more than circuit analysis






> Physics-based simulation supported by circuit and system simulation
                rather than the other way around






> Assembly techniques eliminate errors and accelerates the design
                process 
              






> Automation leads to design innovation

Zoltan J. Cendes is IEEE fellow and the founder of Ansoft Corporation
                (acquired by ANSYS, Inc. in 2008). Cendes has made significant
                contributions in the area of finite element modeling of electromagnetic
                fields. In particular, introducing a number of new technologies
                in numerical electromagnetics including Delaunay tessellation;
                adaptive mesh refinement; edge elements; tangential vector elements;
                the transfinite element method; and model order reduction.





















Founded in 1970, ANSYS employs nearly 3,000 professionals, many of
              whom are expert M.S. and Ph.D.-level engineers in finite element
              analysis, computational fluid dynamics, electronics, semiconductors,
              embedded software and design optimization. Our exceptional staff
              is passionate about pushing the limits of world-class simulation
              technology so our customers can turn their design concepts into successful,
              innovative products faster and at lower cost.  As a measure
              of our success in attaining these goals, ANSYS has been recognized
              as one of the world’s most innovative companies by prestigious publications
              such as Bloomberg Businessweek and FORTUNE magazines.














Electronic products have evolved to the point where 3D electromagnetic
                  effects can no longer be ignored. 




The design flow must have the physics as primary and supported
                  by circuits.

^ The term "Cortex-A9 family" used by Actions is similar to the description used by the company for the CPU cores inside the ATM7029, which have been proven to be Cortex-A5 cores. The ARM Cortex-A5 would be more be accurately described as being "Cortex-A7 family", being slower than but otherwise equivalent to the ARM Cortex-A7, rather than being directly related to the higher-performance ARM Cortex-A9.



Adoption[edit]




Close-up of the Ainol Hero 10 II PCB showing the Actions Semiconductor ATM7029 SoC ASIC and the ATC2603A Mixed signal ASIC.


S1 MP3 players use chipsets designed by Actions.
In 2012, Actions Semiconductor produced the ATM7029 which is a quad-core ARM Cortex-A5-based SoC using Vivante Corporations GC1000 GPU.[15] This SoC has been used in the Ainol NOVO10 Hero II tablet and other low end tablets.[16]
For Q2 2014, Actions was reported to be fourth largest supplier of tablet processors to the Chinese market.[17]
Legal cases[edit]
At one point, Actions was sued by Sigmatel with Sigmatel prevailing. The findings were that Actions infringed upon Sigmatel by directly copying the ASICs designed by Sigmatel, once a world leader in the MP3 ASIC market. Sigmatel later was sold to Freescale Semiconductor.

The ARM Cortex-A5 would be more be accurately described as being "Cortex-A7 family", being slower than but otherwise equivalent to the ARM Cortex-A7, rather than being directly related to the higher-performance ARM Cortex-A9.



Adoption[edit]

S1 MP3 players use chipsets designed by Actions.
In 2012, Actions Semiconductor produced the ATM7029 which is a quad-core ARM Cortex-A5-based SoC using Vivante Corporations GC1000 GPU.[15] This SoC has been used in the Ainol NOVO10 Hero II tablet and other low end tablets.[16]
For Q2 2014, Actions was reported to be fourth largest supplier of tablet processors to the Chinese market.[17]
Legal cases[edit]
At one point, Actions was sued by Sigmatel with Sigmatel prevailing. The findings were that Actions infringed upon Sigmatel by directly copying the ASICs designed by Sigmatel, once a world leader in the MP3 ASIC market. Sigmatel later was sold to Freescale Semiconductor.
