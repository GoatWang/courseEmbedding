BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB:

Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed.

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

Leads Groups
 
Are you looking to grow your business? Finding more prospects is the goal of the Chamber’s various lead generation groups. We have four leads groups that meet weekly. Additionally, all the leads groups meet together for networking once per quarter during our Jump Start Your Morning event. As a leads group member, you have the opportunity to educate the other members on their products and services offered and how to identify their ideal prospect. You can net your business 10-20 part-time sales people through the members of your group because they will know and understand your business. Thus, they can refer you to the business people and consumers that they meet every day. Take advantage of this cost-effective networking tool to further enhance your business. There are currently three organized leads groups available to Chamber members.

 Testimonials


The Conyers-Rockdale Chamber is a great way to meet business people in the community and to make business connections that benefit every one involved. Also a great way to plug in by serving on any of the many committees that the Chamber offers. Definitely a positive return on our investment at Conyers Flower Shop, Inc.
Alan Sherrill, Conyers Flower Shop, Inc.















As a local non-profit joining the Conyers-Rockdale Chamber has been on of the most effective and beneficial decisions we at AWAKE Coffee Community have made. Now in our third consecutive year, I firmly believe we would not have experienced the growth we have without the support and encouragement of our Thursday community connecters leads group.
Noelle Cosby, President and Co-Founder















As one of the oldest businesses in Conyers, we have been part of the Conyers-Rockdale Chamber most of those 37 years and have always found value in the many programs offered by the Chamber.
Owners, Danny & Cindy Lockhart Your Town Magazine and Clean & Tidy Carpet Cleaning

















As a young professional getting started in the insurance industry, the chamber of commerce has been an incredible resource.The opportunity to be able to network and connect with business owners who have been in the game for a while has provided invaluable experience. I truly feel like I can attribute much of my success so far to a strong chamber of commerce and all the opportunities that are provided to get plugged in.
Chris Simmons, Chapman Insurance Group Inc., Nationwide Insurance















Using the Chamber as part of your marketing strategy will provide you a great deal of value and return for your investment many times over.
Ken Holmes, Selective Solutions















The Leads Group experience has brought a very personal touch to our Chamber membership. We have been able to make many connections that have increased our organization’s presence in the community!
Melanie Hutcheson, Rockdale CASA, Inc.















Copy Central has been in business in Conyers/ Rockdale County for the past 9 years. Shortly after we opened in Conyers we joined the Chamber with the hopes that we would meet prospective customers. Being an active Member of the Chamber has allowed us not only to grow our Customer base but to get involved in the Community on a more personal basis. Many members of the Chamber are not only Customers of Copy Central but are valued Friends and Partners in Community Affairs.
Dotti Bala, Copy Central, Inc.















My Thursday morning leads group has been great for my business. In the last 12months, I have had about 20 different leads passed to me and that equaled about $80,000 in closed business. We are like family now!
