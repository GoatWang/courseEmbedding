Marketing Cooperation

When China ACM is unable to service projects due to geographic limitations, the Company refers projects to several other independently-owned mixture stations as part of its marketing cooperation program through existing relationships with contractors. In these instances, China ACM is paid a certain percentage of the sales price of the business that is referred. The marketing cooperation allows China ACM to earn revenue on business that might otherwise be uneconomical due to capital requirements.

Concrete Vs. Cement


	Cement is a commodity and is merely one ingredient in the chemically engineered mixed product that is concrete.


What is concrete?
Concrete is one of the most essential construction materials. It is economical, offers continuity and solidity, and bonds with other materials. The active ingredients in concrete are cement and water which when combined create a chemical reaction. Cement includes the inactive ingredients, gravel and sand for cement strength. 

Characteristics:

Strength of Concrete 
The compressive strength of concrete is very high, but its tensile strength is relatively low. Since concrete must resist a great deal of stretching, bending, or twisting, it must be reinforced with steel. 
Durability of Concrete
The durability of concrete, or its strength, is determined largely by the water-cement ratio. This durability gives concrete the ability to resist deterioration caused by ‘wear and tear’ and exposure to the elements. The character, size, and grading of the aggregate also have important effects on both strength and durability.
 However, the character, size, and grading of the aggregate also have important effects on both strength and durability.
Water tightness of Concrete 
In order to keep the concrete as watertight as possible, the amount of water used must be minimized to achieve the necessary degree of workability.
Concrete is also strong and fireproof.  
Concrete that is subject to wear, such as floor slabs and pavements, must be capable of resisting abrasion.
Concrete has a wide variety of applications:
All important building elements, foundations, columns, walls, slabs, and roofs are made from concrete. Concrete is also used in the construction of roads, runways, bridges and dams. 


What is cement?
Most cement used today is Portland cement. This is a combination of lime, silica, iron oxide, and alumina. It is usually manufactured from limestone mixed with shale, clay, or marl.
The major use of cement is for the production of concrete, which is one of the best hard-wearing construction materials available.  TThe other important application of cement is for the production of mortar, which is used primarily for joining bricks, blocks, or stones in walls. Cement can also be used independently as a grouting material. In modern technology, cement is also used in the process of solidification/stabilization that is a technique used for the removal of contaminated wastes. Another significant use of cement is in the engineered soils by which the poor quality soils are improved by the addition of cement, after which the soils are usable as a base for foundations for different constructions.  
The production of cement causes a number of harmful effects to the environment, including significant carbon dioxide emissions.  Additional pollution is generated by the release of dust and gases from the operation of machinery and blasting conducted in the quarries. Appropriate equipment is used to minimize the dust emissions and to separate gases in order to reduce the harmful effects on the environment.



Cement is a commodity
Concrete is a value added product


Chad Syverson, Associate Professor of Economics, University of Chicago states, "A good place to start is to clear up some confusion that I constantly encounter. First, cement and concrete are not the same thing, even though the two terms are often used interchangeably in conversation. Concrete comprises the roads we drive on and the buildings in which we live and work. Cement is an ingredient in concrete; it is mixed with sand, gravel, water, and small amounts of chemical admixtures to make concrete. Cement holds the key reagent that allows concrete to harden (through a chemical reaction called "hydration") into a useful structural material, but it is worthless for such purposes if used by itself. Referring to concrete as "cement" is a bit like referring to bread as "flour."
A second confusion is that the ready-mixed (alternatively: ready-mix) concrete industry is the same as the industry of precast or prefabricated concrete products. Ready-mixed concrete is the fluid form of concrete delivered to construction sites in the familiar barrel-backed mixer trucks (not "cement" trucks!) and poured into a desired shape. Precast or prefabricated concrete products, like block, brick, pipe, and reinforced structural members, are instead made by pouring concrete into molds and curing them on the factory site. In the government industrial classification systems, ready-mix concrete is SIC 3273 or NAICS 32732, while precast or prefabricated concrete products are classified separately, as SICs 3271 and 3272 or NAICS 32733 and 32739."

	CHINA ADVANCED CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS GROUP, INC. AND
	SUBSIDIARIES




	NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
	STATEMENTS



	Note 1  Organization and description of business



	China Advanced Construction Materials Group, Inc. (CADC
	Delaware) was incorporated in the State of Delaware on February 15, 2007. CADC
	Delaware, through its 100% owned subsidiaries and its variable interest entities
	(VIEs), is engaged in producing general ready-mix concrete, customized
	mechanical refining concrete, and other concrete-related products that are
	mainly sold in the Peoples Republic of China (the PRC). CADC Delaware has a
	wholly-owned subsidiary in the British Virgin Islands, Xin Ao Construction
	Materials, Inc. (BVI-ACM), which is a holding company with no operations.
	BVI-ACM has a wholly-owned foreign subsidiary, Beijing Ao Hang Construction
	Material Technology Co., Ltd. (China-ACMH), and China-ACMH has contractual
	agreements with an entity that is considered to be a VIE of CADC Delaware.


	On August 1, 2013, CADC Delaware consummated a reincorporation
	merger with its newly formed wholly-owned subsidiary, China Advanced
	Construction Materials Group, Inc. (China ACM), a Nevada corporation, with
	CADC Delaware merging into China ACM and China ACM being the surviving company,
	for the purpose of changing CADC Delawares state of incorporation from Delaware
	to Nevada.


	Beijing XinAo Concrete Group (Xin Ao), a VIE of China ACM, is
	engaged in the business of consulting, concrete mixing and equipment rental
	services. Xin Ao had five wholly owned subsidiaries in the PRC: (1) Beijing Heng
	Yuan Zheng Ke Technical Consulting Co., Ltd, (2) Beijing Hong Sheng An
	Construction Materials Co., Ltd, (3) Beijing Heng Tai Hong Sheng Construction
	Materials Co., Ltd, (4) Da Tong Ao Hang Wei Ye Machinery, Equipment Rental Co.,
	Ltd, and (5) Luan Xian Heng Xin Technology Co., Ltd. Since their establishment
	none of these five entities had any operations and the Company did not plan to
	pursue operations for these entities. As of March 31, 2017, all five
	subsidiaries were dissolved.


	China ACM, BVI-ACM, China-ACMH and Xin Ao are collectively
	referred to as the Company.

	analyzes its cash on-hand and its operating and capital expenditure commitments.

	operating expenses and capital expenditure obligations.


	The Company engages in the production of advanced construction
	materials for large scale infrastructure, commercial and residential
	developments. The Companys business is capital intensive and the Company is
	highly leveraged. Debt financing in the form of short term bank loans, loans
	from related parties and bank acceptance notes have been utilized to finance the
	working capital requirements and the capital expenditures of the Company. Due to
	recurring losses, the Companys working capital was approximately $6.9 million
	as of March 31, 2017, as compared to $16.4 million as of June 30, 2016. As of
	March 31, 2017, the Company had cash on-hand of approximately $1.4 million and
	restricted cash balances of approximately $3.9 million, with remaining current
	assets mainly composed of accounts receivables and prepayments and advances.


	Although the Company believes that it can realize its current
	assets in the normal course of business, the Companys ability to repay its
	current obligations will depend on the future realization of its current assets.
	Management has considered its historical experience, the economic environment,
	trends in the construction industry, the expected collectability of its accounts
	receivable and other receivables and the realization of the prepayments on
	inventory, and provided for an allowance for doubtful accounts as of March 31,
	2017. The Company expects to realize the balance of its current assets net of
	the allowance for doubtful accounts within the normal operating cycle of a
	twelve month period. If the Company is unable to realize its current assets
	within the normal operating cycle of a twelve month period, the Company may have
	to consider supplementing its available sources of funds through the following:




	 


	  



	Financial support and credit guarantee commitments from
	the Companys majority shareholders (See Note 7 - Related party
	transactions).

	STATEMENTS




	 


	  



	Other available sources of financing from PRC banks and
	other financial institutions, given the Companys credit history.





	Based on the above considerations, the Companys management is
	of the opinion that it has sufficient funds to meet the Companys working
	capital requirements and debt obligations as they become due. However, there is
	no assurance that management will be successful in their plans. There are a
	number of factors that could potentially arise that could undermine the
	Companys plans, such as changes in the demand for the Companys products,
	economic conditions, competitive pricing in the concrete-mix industry, the
	Companys operating results continuing to deteriorate, or the inability of the
	Companys bank and shareholders to provide continued financial support.



	Basis of presentation



	The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial
	statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
	accepted in the United States of America (US GAAP) for interim financial
	information pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
	Commission (SEC). These financial statements include the accounts of all the
	directly and indirectly owned subsidiaries and VIEs listed below. All material
	intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. In
	the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring
	adjustments, considered necessary to give a fair presentation have been
	included. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results of a full
	year. The information in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with
	information included in the annual report for the fiscal year ended June 30,
	2016 on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on September 28, 2016.



	Principles of consolidation



	The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
	reflect the activities of the following subsidiaries and VIEs. All material
	intercompany transactions have been eliminated.

	VIEs are generally entities that lack sufficient equity to
	finance their activities without additional financial support from other parties
	or whose equity holders lack adequate decision making ability. All VIEs with
	which the Company is involved must be evaluated to determine the primary
	beneficiary of the risks and rewards of the VIEs. The primary beneficiary is
	required to consolidate the VIEs for financial reporting purposes.


	Management makes ongoing assessments of whether China ACM is
	the primary beneficiary of Xin Ao. Based upon a series of contractual
	arrangements, the Company determined that Xin Ao is a VIE subject to
	consolidation and that China ACM is the primary beneficiary. Accordingly, the
	accounts of Xin Ao are consolidated with those of China ACM.


	The carrying amount of the VIEs assets and liabilities are as
	follows:

	Use of estimates and assumptions



	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US
	GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
	reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
	and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported
	amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. The significant
	estimates and assumptions made in the preparation of the Companys unaudited
	condensed consolidated financial statements include allowance for doubtful
	accounts, deferred income taxes, prepayments and advances, stock-based
	compensation, and fair value and useful lives of property, plant and equipment.
	Actual results could be materially different from those estimates.



	Foreign currency translation



	The reporting currency of the Company is the U.S. dollar. The
	functional currency of China ACM and BVI-ACM is the U.S. dollar. China-ACMH and
	Xin Ao use their local currency Chinese Renminbi (RMB) as their functional
	currency. In accordance with the US GAAP guidance on Foreign Currency
	Translation, the Companys results of operations and cash flows are translated
	at the average exchange rates during the period, assets and liabilities are
	translated at the exchange rates at the balance sheet dates, and equity is
	translated at historical exchange rates. As a result, amounts related to assets
	and liabilities reported on the consolidated statements of cash flows will not
	necessarily agree with changes in the corresponding balances on the consolidated
	balance sheets.


	Asset and liability accounts at March 31, 2017, and June 30,
	2016, were translated at RMB 6.89 to $1.00 and RMB 6.64 to $1.00, respectively.
	The average translation rates applied to the consolidated statements of
	operations and comprehensive loss for the three months ended March 31, 2017, and
	2016 were RMB 6.89 and RMB 6.54 to $1.00, respectively. The average translation
	rates applied to the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive
	loss and cash flows for the nine months ended March 31, 2017, and 2016 were RMB
	6.79 and RMB 6.40 to $1.00, respectively.


	Translation gains (losses) that arise from exchange rate
	fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional
	currency are included in the results of operations. There were no foreign
	currency transaction gains or losses for each of the three and nine months ended
	March 31, 2017, and 2016. The effects of foreign currency translation
	adjustments are included in shareholders equity as a component of accumulated
	other comprehensive income.



	Revenue recognition



	Revenue is realized or realizable and earned when four criteria
	are met:




	 


	  


	Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists
	(the Company considers its sales contracts to be pervasive evidence of an arrangement);

	


	Delivery has occurred;




	 


	


	The sellers price to the buyer is fixed or
	determinable; and




	 


	


	Collectability of payment is reasonably
	assured.




	The Company sells its concrete products primarily to major
	local construction companies. Sales agreements are signed with each customer.
	The agreements list all terms and conditions with the exception of delivery date
	and quantity, which are evidenced separately in purchase orders. The purchase
	price of products is fixed in the agreement and customers are not permitted to
	renegotiate after the contracts have been signed. The agreements include a
	cancellation clause if the Company or customers breach the contract terms
	specified in the agreement.


	The Company recognizes revenue when title and ownership of the
	goods are transferred upon shipment to the customer by the Company and
	collectability of payment is reasonably assured.


	The Company includes the shipping and handling fee in both
	revenue and cost of revenue.



	Financial instruments



	US GAAP regarding fair value of financial instruments and
	related fair value measurements define fair value, establish a three-level
	valuation hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable
	inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.


	The three levels of inputs are defined as follows:


	Level 1 inputs to the valuation
	methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities
	in active markets;


	Level 2 inputs to the valuation
	methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active
	markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either
	directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial
	instrument;


	Level 3 inputs to the valuation
	methodology are unobservable.


	Financial instruments included in current assets and current
	liabilities are reported in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets
	at face value or cost, which approximate fair value because of the short period
	of time between the origination of such instruments and their expected
	realization and their current market rates of interest.



	Cash and cash equivalents



	The Company considers all highly liquid investments with the
	original maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash
	equivalents. The Company currently maintains substantially all of its day-to-day
	operating cash balances with major financial institutions within the PRC and the
	United States. As of March 31, 2017, and June 30, 2016, the Company had deposits
	in excess of federally insured limits totaling approximately $1.2 million and
	$0.9 million, respectively, in the PRC.



	Restricted cash



	As of March 31, 2017, and June 30, 2016, restricted cash
	consisted of collateral representing cash deposits for bank guarantees and notes
	payable.

	NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
	STATEMENTS



	Accounts and notes receivable



	The Company extends unsecured credit to its customers in the
	normal course of business. Accounts are considered past due after 30 days. In
	establishing the required allowance for doubtful accounts, management considers
	historical experience, the economic environment, trends in the construction
	industry and the expected collectability of the overdue receivables. Management
	reviews its accounts receivable each reporting period to determine if the
	allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate. An estimate for doubtful accounts
	is recorded when collection of the full amount is no longer probable. Account
	balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection
	have been exhausted and the potential for recovering is considered remote. The
	Company provides a provision of 15% of the allowance for doubtful accounts for
	accounts receivable balance that are past due more than 180 days but less than
	one year, 40% of the allowance for doubtful accounts for accounts receivable
	past due from one to two years, 75% of the allowance for doubtful accounts for
	accounts receivable past due beyond two years, 100% of the allowance for
	doubtful accounts for accounts receivable past due beyond three years, plus
	additional amounts as necessary, which the Companys collection department had
	determined the collection of the full amount is remote with the approval from
	the Companys management to provide 100% of the allowance for doubtful accounts.
	The Companys management has continued to evaluate the reasonableness of the
	valuation allowance policy and will update it if necessary.


	Notes receivable represent trade accounts receivable from
	various customers where the customers' banks have guaranteed such customers
	obligation. The notes are non-interest bearing and typically have a three or six
	month maturity date. The Company has the ability to submit requests for payment
	to a customer's bank earlier than the scheduled maturity date, subject to a
	discount on interest charged and a processing fee.



	Inventories



	Inventories consist of raw materials and are stated at the
	lower of cost or market, as determined using the weighted average cost method.
	Management compares the cost of inventories with the market value and an
	allowance is made for writing down the inventory to its market value, if lower
	than cost. As of March 31, 2017, and June 30, 2016, the Company determined that
	no reserves for obsolescence were necessary.



	Other receivables



	Other receivables primarily include prepayments to be refunded
	by our suppliers if the supplies do not meet the Companys specification needs,
	advances to employees, amounts due from unrelated entities, VAT tax refunds and
	other deposits. Management regularly reviews the aging of receivables and
	changes in payment trends and records allowances when management believes
	collection of amounts due are at risk. Accounts considered uncollectible are
	written off against allowances after exhaustive efforts at collection are made.
	The Company provides a provision of 5% of the allowance for doubtful accounts
	for other receivables balance that are aged within one year, 50% of the
	allowance for doubtful accounts for other receivables aged from one to two
	years, and 100% of the allowance for doubtful accounts for other receivables
	aged beyond two years.



	Prepayments and advances



	Prepayments are funds deposited or advanced to outside vendors
	for future inventory purchases. As is standard practice in the PRC, many of the
	Companys vendors require a certain amount to be deposited with them as a
	guarantee that the Company will complete its purchases on a timely basis. This
	amount is refundable and bears no interest. The Company has legally binding
	contracts with its vendors, which require any outstanding prepayments to be
	returned to the Company when such contracts end.


	The Company recovered approximately $18,000 and wrote off $0.2
	million on unrealizable prepayments for the three and nine months ended March
	31, 2017, respectively.



	Property, plants and equipment



	Property, plants and equipment are stated at cost. Expenditures
	for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred while
	additions, renewals and improvements are capitalized. Depreciation is provided
	over the estimated useful life of each class of depreciable assets and is
	computed using the straight-line method with a 5% residual value. Leasehold improvements are amortized over
	the lesser of estimated useful lives or lease terms, as appropriate.

	CHINA ADVANCED CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS GROUP, INC. AND
	SUBSIDIARIES


	NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
	STATEMENTS


	The estimated useful lives of assets are as follows:





	 


	Useful life




	Transportation equipment


	7-10 years




	Plants and machinery


	10 years




	Office equipment


	5 years




	Buildings and improvements


	3-20 years






	Accounting for long-lived assets



	The Company classifies its long-lived assets into: (i)
	machinery and equipment; (ii) transportation equipment; (iii) office and
	equipment; and (iv) buildings and improvements.


	Long-lived assets held and used by the Company are reviewed for
	impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
	carrying value of such assets may not be fully recoverable. It is possible that
	these assets could become impaired as a result of technological or other
	industry changes. If circumstances require a long-lived asset or asset group to
	be tested for possible impairment, the Company first compares undiscounted cash
	flows expected to be generated by that asset or asset group to its carrying
	value. If the carrying value of the long-lived asset or asset group is not
	recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, an impairment is recognized to
	the extent that the carrying value exceeds its fair value. Fair value is
	determined through various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow
	models, quoted market values and third-party independent appraisals, as
	considered necessary.


	If the value of an asset is determined to be impaired, the
	impairment to be recognized is measured in the amount by which the carrying
	amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Assets to be disposed
	of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value, less
	disposition costs.


	Due to recurring losses, the deterioration of the concrete-mix
	industry in Beijing, PRC, and competitive pricing pressures, the Company has
	performed an impairment analysis and determined its long-lived assets were
	impaired during the year ended June 30, 2016. As a result, the Company recorded
	an impairment charge of $2.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. These
	charges were related to the impairment of the Companys transportation
	equipment, plants and machinery. The loss was determined using Level 3 inputs.
	There were no impairment charges for the three and nine months ended March 31,
	2017 and 2016.


	Competitive pricing pressures and changes in interest rates
	could materially and adversely affect the Companys estimates of future net cash
	flows to be generated by the long-lived assets, and thus could result in future
	impairment losses.



	Stock-based compensation



	The Company records stock-based compensation expense at fair
	value on the grant date and recognizes the expense over the employee's requisite
	service period. The Companys expected volatility assumption is based on the
	historical volatility of Companys stock. The expected life assumption is
	primarily based on historical exercise patterns and employee post-vesting
	termination behavior. The risk-free interest rate for the expected term of the
	option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.
	The expected dividend yield is based on the Companys current and expected
	dividend policy.



	Income taxes



	The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC
	740, Income Taxes, which requires the Company to use the assets and liability
	method of accounting for income taxes. Under the assets and liability method, deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax
	consequences of temporary differences by applying enacted statutory tax rates
	applicable to future years to differences between financial statement carrying
	amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities and operating loss
	and tax credit carry forwards. Under this accounting standard, the effect on
	deferred income taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the
	period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recognized if
	it is more likely than not that some portion, or all of, a deferred tax asset
	will not be realized.

	NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
	STATEMENTS


	ASC 740-10, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes,
	defines uncertainty in income taxes and the evaluation of a tax position as a
	two-step process. The first step is to determine whether it is more likely than
	not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including the
	resolution of any related appeals or litigation based on the technical merits of
	that position. The second step is to measure a tax position that meets the
	more-likely-than-not threshold to determine the amount of benefit to be
	recognized in the financial statements. A tax position is measured at the
	largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likelihood of being
	realized upon ultimate settlement. Tax positions that previously failed to meet
	the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold should be recognized in the first
	subsequent period in which the threshold is met. Previously recognized tax
	positions that no longer meet the more-likely-than-not criteria should be
	de-recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which the
	threshold is no longer met. Penalties and interest incurred related to
	underpayment of income tax are classified as income tax expense in the period
	incurred. United States federal, state and local income tax returns prior to
	2013 are not subject to examination by any applicable tax authorities.



	Value Added Tax



	Enterprises or individuals who sell commodities, engage in
	repair and maintenance, or import and export goods in the PRC are subject to a
	value added tax. The standard VAT rate for the Companys industry is 3% of gross
	sales.



	Research and development



	Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. The
	cost of materials and equipment that are acquired or constructed for research
	and development activities, and have alternative future uses, either in research
	and development, marketing, or sales, are classified as property and equipment,
	and depreciated over their estimated useful lives.



	Earnings (loss) per share



	The Company reports earnings (losses) per share in accordance
	with the US GAAP, which requires presentation of basic and diluted earnings
	(losses) per share in conjunction with the disclosure of the methodology used in
	computing such earnings per share. Basic earnings (losses) per share excludes
	dilution and is computed by dividing income (loss) available to common
	shareholders by the weighted average common shares outstanding during the
	period. Diluted earnings per share takes into account the potential dilution
	that could occur if securities or other contracts, such as warrants, options,
	restricted stock based grants and convertible preferred stock, to issue common
	stock were exercised and converted into common stock. Common stock equivalents
	having an anti-dilutive effect on earnings per share are excluded from the
	calculation of diluted earnings per share..


	Stock dividends or stock splits are to be accounted for
	retroactively if the stock dividends or stock splits occur during the period, or
	retroactively if the stock dividends or stock splits occur after the end of the
	period but before the release of the financial statements, by considering if
	outstanding of the entirety of each period presented.


	Dilution is computed by applying the treasury stock method.
	Under this method, options and warrants are assumed to be exercised at the
	beginning of the period (or at the time of issuance, if later), and as if funds
	obtained thereby were used to purchase common stock at the average market price
	during the period.



	Comprehensive income (loss)



	Comprehensive income (loss) consists of net income (loss) and
	foreign currency translation adjustments.

	Separately Identifiable Cash Flows and Application of the Predominance
	Principle. The amendments are effective for public business entities for fiscal
	years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal
	years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The
	amendments should be applied using a retrospective transition method to each
	period presented. If it is impracticable to apply the amendments retrospectively
	for some of the issues, the amendments for those issues would be applied
	prospectively as of the earliest date practicable. Management does not believe
	the adoption of this ASU would have a material effect on the Companys unaudited
	condensed consolidated financial statements.


	In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-17, Consolidation
	(Topic 810): Interests held through related parties that are under common
	control. The amendments in this ASU require that the reporting entity, in
	determining whether it satisfies the second characteristic of a primary
	beneficiary, to include all of its direct variable interests in a VIE and, on a
	proportionate basis, its indirect variable interests in a VIE held through
	related parties, including related parties that are under common control with
	the reporting entity. The amendments are effective for public business entities
	for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods
	within those fiscal years. For all other entities, the amendments in this ASU
	are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim
	periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is
	permitted, including adoption in an interim period. Management does not believe
	the adoption of this ASU would have a material effect on the Companys
	consolidated financial statements.


	In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-18, "Statement
	of Cash Flows: Restricted Cash". The amendments address diversity in practice
	that exists in the classification and presentation of changes in restricted cash
	on the statement of cash flows. The amendment is effective for public companies
	for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods
	within those fiscal years. Management believes that the adoption of this ASU on
	the Companys statement of cash flows will increase cash and cash equivalents by
	the amount of the restricted cash on the Companys unaudited condensed
	consolidated financial statements.


	In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01, Business
	Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the definition of a business. The
	amendments in this ASU is to clarify the definition of a business with the
	objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether
	transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or
	businesses. The definition of a business affects many areas of accounting
	including acquisitions, disposals, goodwill, and consolidation. The amendments
	are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after
	December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. For all
	other entities, the amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years
	beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within fiscal years
	beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company does not believe the adoption of
	this ASU would have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial
	statements.


	In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-09, Scope of Modification
	Accounting, which amends the scope of modification accounting for share-based
	payment arrangements and provides guidance on the types of changes to the terms or
	conditions of share-based payment awards to which an entity would be required to
	apply modification accounting under ASC 718. For all entities, this ASU is
	effective for annual reporting periods, including interim periods within those
	annual reporting periods, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is
	permitted, including adoption in any interim period. The Company does not expect
	that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on the Companys
	unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.

	On February 29, 2016, the Company terminated an operating lease
	for its concrete plant in the eastern suburban area of Beijing because the plant
	was not operating at ideal capacity and the Company did not anticipate it would
	in the foreseeable future. The Company entered into an agreement with the lessor
	to terminate its operating lease, which was originally effective from August 18,
	2013 to August 17, 2021, and for the sale of certain of the Companys assets and

	Note 8  Income taxes




	(a) Corporate income tax



	China ACM is organized in the United States. China ACM had no
	taxable income for United States income tax purposes for the three and nine
	months ended March 31, 2017, and 2016, respectively. China ACMs net operating
	loss for the nine months ended March 31, 2017, amounted to approximately $0.2
	million. As of March 31, 2017, China ACMs net operating loss carry forward for
	United States income taxes was approximately $0.9 million. The net operating
	loss carry forward are available to reduce future years taxable income through
	year 2036. Management believes that the realization of the benefits from these
	losses appears uncertain due to the Companys operating history and continued
	losses in the United States. Accordingly, the Company has provided a 100%
	valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset to reduce the asset to zero. As of
	March 31, 2017, and June 30, 2016, valuation allowance for deferred tax assets
	was approximately $0.3 million and $0.2 million, respectively. Management
	reviews this valuation allowance periodically and makes changes accordingly.


	BVI-ACM is incorporated in the British Virgin Islands (BVI),
	where its income tax rate is 0% under current BVI law.

	China-ACMH and VIEs-Chinese operations



	China-ACMH and Xin Ao are governed by the income tax laws of
	the PRC. Income tax provisions in respect to operations in the PRC are
	calculated at the applicable tax rates on the taxable income for the periods
	based on existing legislation, interpretations and practices in respect thereof.
	Under the Chinese Enterprise Income Tax (EIT) law, the statutory corporate
	income tax rate applicable to most companies is 25%. In 2009, Xin Ao applied and
	received an Enterprise High-Tech Certificate. The certificate was awarded based
	on Xin Aos involvement in producing high-tech products, its research and
	development, as well as its technical services. As granted by the State
	Administration of Taxation of the PRC, Xin Ao is entitled to a reduction in its
	income tax rate from 25% to 15% until 2018.


	The EIT Law imposes a 10% withholding income tax, subject to
	reduction based on tax treaties where applicable, for dividends distributed by a
	foreign invested enterprise to its immediate holding company outside China. Such
	dividends were exempted from PRC tax under the previous income tax law and
	regulations. The Company intends to permanently reinvest undistributed earnings
	of its Chinese operations located in the PRC. As a result, there is no deferred
	tax expense related to withholding tax on the future repatriation of these
	earnings.

	As of March 31, 2017, and June 30, 2016, the Company believes
	it is more likely than not that its PRC operations will be unable to fully
	utilize its deferred tax assets related to its allowance for doubtful accounts,
	impairment loss of long-lived assets and the net operating loss carryforward in
	the PRC. If the Company continues to incur losses in its PRC operations, it is
	more likely than not that it will not have sufficient income to utilize its
	deferred tax assets. As of March 31, 2017, the Company has a net operating loss
	carry forward in the PRC that expires in 2021. As a result, the Company provided
	a 100% allowance on all deferred tax assets of approximately $7.9 million and
	$6.5 million related to its operations in the PRC as of March 31, 2017, and June
	30, 2016, respectively.

	The Company has incurred losses from its United States
	operations during all periods presented. Accordingly, management provided
	approximately $0.3 million and $0.2 million of valuation allowance against the
	deferred tax assets related to the Companys United States operations as of
	March 31, 2017, and June 30, 2016, respectively, because the deferred tax
	benefits of the net operating loss carry forward in the United States might not
	be utilized.

	There were no uncertain tax positions as of March 31, 2017, and
	June 30, 2016. Management does not anticipate any potential future adjustments
	which would result in a material change to its tax positions. For the three and
	nine months ended March 31, 2017, and 2016, the Company did not incur any tax
	related interest and penalties.

	Restricted Stock Grants



	Restricted stock grants are measured based on the market price
	on the grant date. The Company has granted restricted shares of common stock to
	the members of the board of directors (the Board), senior management and
	consultants.


	Effective August 20, 2016, the Board granted an aggregate of
	106,859 shares of restricted common stock, which were issued with a market value
	of $308,823 to a consultant under the 2009 Plan. These shares shall be vested in
	two tranches upon achieving certain performance-based milestones. As of March
	31, 2017, these shares have not vested and the performance-based milestones have
	not been determined by the Board.


	Effective August 20, 2016, the Board granted an aggregate of
	100,000 shares of restricted common stock, which were issued with a market value
	of $289,000 to two employees under the 2009 Plan. These shares vested
	immediately upon grant.


	For the three months ended March 31, 2017, and 2016, the
	Company did not recognize any compensation expense related to restricted stock
	grants.


	For the nine months ended March 31, 2017, and 2016, the Company
	recognized approximately $0.3 million and $0.5 million, respectively, of
	compensation expense related to restricted stock grants.


	Following is a summary of the restricted stock grants:

	and nine months ended March 31, 2016, diluted loss per share is the same as
	basic loss per share since the addition of any contingently issuable shares
	would be anti-dilutive.





	Note 11  Reserves and dividends



	The laws and regulations of the PRC require that before a
	foreign invested enterprise can legally distribute profits, it must first
	satisfy all its tax liabilities, provide for losses in previous years, and make
	allocations, in proportions determined at the discretion of the board of
	directors, after setting aside statutory reserves. Statutory reserves include
	the surplus reserve fund and the common welfare fund.

	CHINA ADVANCED CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS GROUP, INC. AND
	SUBSIDIARIES


	NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
	STATEMENTS


	The Company is required to transfer 10% of its net income, as
	determined in accordance with the PRC accounting rules and regulations, to a
	statutory surplus reserve fund until such reserve balance reaches 50% of the
	Companys registered capital. As of June 30, 2016, the remaining reserve to
	fulfill the 50% registered capital requirement amounted to $1.9 million. As of
	March 31, 2017, the remaining capital reserve amount was reduced to
	approximately $0.8 million after the dissolution of Heng Yuan Zheng Ke, Hong
	Sheng An, Heng Tai, Da Tong, and Heng Xin.


	Transfers to statutory reserves must be made before the
	distribution of any dividends to the Companys shareholders. The surplus reserve
	fund is non-distributable other than during liquidation. The surplus reserve
	fund can however be used to fund previous years losses, if any, and may be
	utilized for business expansion or converted into share capital by issuing new
	shares to existing shareholders in proportion to their shareholding or by
	increasing the par value of the shares currently held by them, provided that the
	remaining reserve balance after such issue is not less than 25% of the
	registered capital.


	The PRC government restricts distributions of registered
	capital and the additional investment amounts required by foreign invested
	enterprises. Approval by the PRC government must be obtained before
	distributions of these amounts can be returned to the shareholders.



	Note 12  Employee post-retirement benefits



	The Company offers a defined contribution plan to eligible
	employees which consists of two parts: (i) the first part, paid by the Company,
	is 20% of the employees compensation from the prior year and (ii) the second
	part, paid by the employee, is 8% of the employees compensation. The Companys
	contributions of employment benefits were approximately $0.2 million for each of
	the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016. The Companys contributions to
	employment benefits were approximately $0.5 million and $0.6 million for each of
	the nine months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016.



	Note 13  Commitments and contingencies




	Lease Commitments



	The Company has a lease agreement for a concrete service plant
	with an unrelated party which will expire on December 31, 2017, with annual
	payments of approximately $195,000. The Company has a lease agreement for a
	roadway access in the west side entry of the concrete service plant with an
	unrelated party which will expire on June 30, 2019, with annual payment of
	approximately $15,000. The Company has a lease agreement to lease office space
	from Mr. Weili He, the Companys Interim Chief Financial Officer, through
	October 31, 2018, with annual payments of approximately $24,000, at a fair
	market rate.


	Operating lease expenses are allocated between the cost of
	revenue and selling, general, and administrative expenses. Total operating lease
	expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2017, and 2016 were approximately
	$59,000 and $0.2 million, respectively. Total operating lease expenses for the
	nine months ended March 31, 2017, and 2016 were approximately $0.2 million and
	$0.6 million, respectively. Future annual lease payments under non-cancelable
	operating leases with a term of one year or more consist of the following:

	Legal Contingencies



	From time to time, the Company is a party to various legal
	actions arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company accrues costs
	associated with these matters when they become probable and the amount can be
	reasonably estimated. Legal costs incurred in connection with loss contingencies
	are expensed as incurred. The Companys management does not expect any liability
	from the disposition of such claims and litigation individually or in the aggregate would have a material adverse impact on the
	Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

	ITEM 2. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
	CONDITION AND RESULT OF OPERATIONS.




	Overview



	We are a holding company whose primary business operations are
	conducted through our wholly-owned subsidiaries Xin Ao Construction Materials,
	Inc. (BVI-ACM),Beijing Ao Hang Construction Material Technology Co., Ltd.
	(China-ACMH), and our variable interest entity, Beijing XinAo Concrete Group
	(Xin Ao) and its subsidiaries. We engage in the production and supply of
	advanced construction materials for large scale commercial, residential, and
	infrastructure developments, and are primarily focused on producing and
	supplying a wide range of advanced ready-mix concrete materials for highly
	technical, large scale, and environmentally-friendly construction projects that
	are mainly sold in the Peoples Republic of China (PRC).


	During the nine months ended March 31, 2017, we supplied
	materials and provided services to our projects through one ready-mixed concrete
	plant in Beijing.


	Our management believes that we have the ability to capture a
	greater share of the Beijing market via expanding relationships and networking,
	signing new contracts, and continually developing market-leading innovative and
	eco-friendly ready-mix concrete products.



	Principal Factors Affecting Our Financial Performance



	We believe that the following factors will continue to affect
	our financial performance:




	 



	- 

	 



	Large Scale Contractor Relationships. We have contracts
	with major construction contractors that are constructing key
	infrastructure, commercial and residential projects. Our sales efforts
	focus on large-scale projects and large customers which place large
	recurring orders and present less credit risk to us. For the nine months
	ended March 31, 2017, one customer accounted for approximately 15.1% of
	our sales. Should we lose any large scale customers in the future and are
	unable to obtain additional customers, our revenues will suffer.





	 


	 








	 



	- 

	 



	Experienced Management. Managements technical knowledge
	and business relationships give us the ability to secure major
	infrastructure projects, which provides us with leverage to acquire less
	sophisticated operators, increase production volumes, and implement
	quality standards and environmentally sensitive policies. If there were to
	be any significant turnover in our senior management, it could deplete the
	institutional knowledge held by our existing senior management team.





	 


	 








	 



	- 

	 



	Innovation Efforts. We strive to produce the most
	technically and scientifically advanced products for our customers and
	maintain close relationships with Tsinghua University, Xian University of
	Architecture and Technology and Beijing Dongfang Jianyu Institute of
	Concrete Science & Technology. We entered technical service contracts
	with these research institutes to further improve our production and
	products. If our research and development efforts are not sufficient to
	adapt to the change in technology in the industry, our products may not
	compete effectively.





	 


	 








	 



	- 

	 



	Competition. Our competition includes a number of
	state-owned and large private PRC-based manufacturers and distributors
	that produce and sell products similar to ours. We compete primarily on
	the basis of quality, technological innovation and price. Essentially, all
	of the contracts on which we bid are awarded through a competitive bid
	process, with award contracts often being made awarded to the lowest
	bidder, though other factors such as shorter schedules or prior experience
	with the customer are often just as important. Within our markets, we
	compete with many national, regional and local state- owned and private
	construction entities some of which have achieved greater market
	penetration or have greater financial and other resources than us. In
	addition, there are a number of larger national companies in our industry
	that could potentially establish a presence in our markets and compete
	with us for contracts. If we are unable to compete successfully in our
	markets, our relative market share and profits could be reduced.

	Revenue


	. Our revenue is primarily generated from
	sales of our advanced ready-mix concrete products. For the three months ended
	March 31, 2017, we generated total revenue of approximately $13.6 million, as
	compared to approximately $16.1 million during the three months ended March 31,
	2016, a decrease of approximately $2.5 million, or 15%. The decrease in revenue
	was principally due to decreased sales volume by 14%, because of the
	strengthened result of the PRC governments increased inspections of overloaded
	transportation vehicles, which also affected our sales of our concrete truck
	transportation services. The decrease in revenue was offset by the increase in
	our selling price of concrete by 4% during the three months ended March 31,
	2017, as compared to the same period in 2016. The decrease was also attributable
	to the 5% depreciation of the Chinese Renminbi against the U.S. Dollar during
	the three months ended March 31, 2017, as compared to the same period in 2016.




	Cost of Revenue



	.

	Total cost of revenue,
	which consists of direct labor, rentals, depreciation, other overhead and raw
	materials, including inbound freight charges, was approximately $12.1 million
	for the three months ended March 31, 2017, as compared to approximately $17.0
	million for the three months ended March 31, 2016, a decrease of approximately
	$4.8 million, or 29%. The decrease in cost of revenue was primarily associated
	with the decrease of production volume and the decrease of unit production costs
	mainly caused by the decrease of concrete truck rental expenses after the
	termination of our operating lease for our concrete plant in the eastern
	suburban area of Beijing and because we had fewer repair expenses for our own
	trucks in our manufacturing overhead cost during the three months ended March
	31, 2017, as compared to the same period in 2016. As a result, our cost of
	revenue decreased by 29% during the three months ended March 31, 2017, as
	compared to the same period in 2016.




	Gross Profit (Loss)


	. Total gross profit was
	approximately $1.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, as
	compared to approximately $0.9 million in gross loss for the three months ended
	March 31, 2016, an increase of approximately $2.4 million, which was primarily a
	result of increases in unit selling prices and decreases in unit production
	costs during the three months ended March 31, 2017, as compared to the same
	period in 2016.




	Recovery for Doubtful Accounts


	. We had recovery
	for doubtful accounts charges of approximately $0.8 million for the three months
	ended March 31, 2017, as compared to approximately $1.3 million during the three
	months ended March 31, 2016, a decrease of approximately $0.5 million, or 40%.
	The decrease was attributable to the fact that fewer accounts receivable became
	over 720 days past due during the three months ended March 31, 2017, as compared
	to the same period in 2016, and because we have correspondingly decreased our
	provision for doubtful accounts in accordance with our allowance policy. At the
	end of each quarter, we conduct an aging analysis of each customers arrears to
	determine whether the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate. In
	establishing the allowance for doubtful accounts, we consider historical
	experience, the economic environment, trends in the construction industry,
	expected collectability of amounts receivable that are past due, and the
	expected collectability of overdue receivables. An estimate of doubtful accounts
	is recorded when collection of the full amount is no longer probable. Known bad
	debts are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts when
	identified. After reviewing individual balances, we provide a provision of 15%
	for accounts receivable past due more than 180 days but less than one year, 40%
	for accounts receivable past due from one to two years, 75% for accounts
	receivable past due beyond two years, 100% for accounts receivable past due
	beyond three years, plus additional amounts as necessary.

	Selling, General and Administrative Expenses


	.
	Selling, general and administrative expenses consist of sales commissions,
	advertising and marketing costs, office rent and expenses, costs associated with
	staff and support personnel who manage our business activities, and professional
	fees paid. We incurred selling, general and administrative expenses of
	approximately $1.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, as
	compared to approximately $1.8 million for the three months ended March 31,
	2016, a decrease of approximately $0.3 million. The decrease was primarily due to a
	$0.2 million decrease in professional fees, $0.2 million decrease in social
	security and benefits and other various G&A expenses, which was partially
	offset by a $0.2 million increase in salaries as compared to the three months
	ended March 31, 2016.


	24









	Research and Development (R&D) Expenses


	.
	Research and development expenses were approximately $99,000 for the three
	months ended March 31, 2017, as compared to $0.3 million for the same period in
	2016. The Company decreased its research and development expenditures during
	this period because the Company has determined to control its R&D expenses
	with respect to revenues.




	Loss from Termination of Lease.


	Effective
	February 29, 2016, we terminated an operating lease for our concrete plant in
	the eastern suburban area of Beijing because the plant was not operating at
	ideal capacity and we did not anticipate that it would in the foreseeable
	future. We entered an agreement with a third party to terminate the lease of the
	concrete plant. Under the agreement, the fair value of net assets of the related
	operation was determined to be RMB 13.7 million (approximately $2.1 million),
	and was settled for RMB 11.2 million (approximately $1.7 million). We recognized
	a loss of approximately $0.4 million from the termination of the lease for the
	three months ended March 31, 2016.




	Income (loss) from Operations.


	We had income from
	operations of approximately $0.6 million and incurred a loss from operations of
	approximately $2.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016,
	respectively. This change of approximately $2.8 million from loss to income was
	primarily due to a $2.4 million increase in gross profit, a $0.2 million
	decrease in research and development expenses, a $0.3 million decrease in
	selling, general and administration expenses, a $0.4 million decrease in loss
	from termination of lease, and was offset by a $0.5 million decrease in recovery
	for doubtful accounts.




	Other Expense, Net


	. Our other expense consists of
	interest income (expense), finance expense and other non-operating income
	(expense). We had other expense of approximately $0.2 million during the three
	months ended March 31, 2017, consisting primarily of aged customer deposits that
	we determined that we are no longer required to repay and recognized as other
	income accordingly. We earned interest income of approximately $15,000 and
	$3,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2017, and 2016, respectively.
	Approximately $0.2 million of interest expense was recorded for each of the
	three months ended March 31, 2017, and 2016, and approximately $0.2 million of
	finance expense was recorded for each of the three months ended March 31, 2017,
	and 2016, respectively.




	Provision for Income Taxes.


	We did not incur
	provision for income taxes for the three months ended March 31, 2017, because we
	had net operating losses on deferred tax assets for which we previously provided
	100% allowance to be utilized during the period. We did not incur provision for
	income for the three months ended March 31, 2016 as we did not generate any
	income for tax provision and provided 100% allowance from net operating losses
	on deferred tax assets.




	Net Income (Loss).


	We had net income of
	approximately $0.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, as
	compared to a net loss of approximately $2.6 million for the three months ended
	March 31, 2016, a positive change in the amount of approximately $3.0 million.
	Such change was the result of the combination of the changes as discussed above.

	Revenue


	. Our revenue is primarily generated from
	sales of our advanced ready-mix concrete products. For the nine months ended
	March 31, 2017, we generated total revenue of approximately $35.8 million, as
	compared to approximately $46.5 million during the nine months ended March 31,
	2016, a decrease of approximately $10.7 million, or 23%. The decrease in revenue
	was principally due to decreased sales volume by 17% resulting from the PRC
	governments increased inspections of overloaded transportation vehicles, which
	also affected sales of our concrete truck transportation services. In addition,
	because of increasing competition in the concrete industry in Beijing, our
	revenue decrease was also attributable to a decrease in our selling price by 2%
	for concrete during the nine months ended March 31, 2017, as compared to the
	same period in 2016. The decrease was also attributable to the 6% depreciation
	of the Chinese Renminbi against the U.S. Dollar during the nine months ended
	March 31, 2017, as compared to the same period in 2016.




	Cost of Revenue



	.

	Total cost of revenue,
	which consists of direct labor, rentals, depreciation, other overhead and raw
	materials, including inbound freight charges, was approximately $36.2 million
	for the nine months ended March 31, 2017, as compared to approximately $43.8
	million for the nine months ended March 31, 2016, a decrease of approximately
	$7.6 million, or 17%. The decrease in cost of revenue was primarily associated
	with the decrease in our sales volume. The decrease in our cost of revenue was
	offset by the increase of the purchase unit price of cement for our production
	use during the nine months ended March 31, 2017 as compared to the same period
	in 2016. As a result, our cost of revenue has decreased by 17% during the nine
	months ended March 31, 2017, as compared to the same period in 2016.




	Gross Profit (Loss)


	. Total gross loss was
	approximately $0.4 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2017, as compared
	to approximately $2.7 million of gross profit for the nine months ended March
	31, 2016, a decrease of approximately $3.1 million, which was primarily due to
	the decrease of sales volume, the decrease of our selling price of concrete, and
	the increase of the purchase unit price of cement for production use during the
	nine months ended March 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016.




	Provision for Doubtful Accounts


	. We incurred a
	provision for doubtful accounts charges of approximately $3.6 million for the
	nine months ended March 31, 2017, as compared to approximately $1.2 million
	during the nine months ended March 31, 2016, an increase of approximately $2.4
	million, or 202%. The increase was attributable to the fact that more accounts
	receivable have become over 720 days past due during the nine months ended March
	31, 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016 and we have correspondingly
	increased our provision for doubtful accounts in accordance with our allowance
	policy. At the end of each quarter, we conduct an aging analysis of each
	customers arrears to determine whether the allowance for doubtful accounts is
	adequate. In establishing the allowance for doubtful accounts, we consider the
	historical experience, the economy, trends in the construction industry,
	expected collectability of amounts receivable that are past due and the expected
	collectability of overdue receivables. An estimate of doubtful accounts is
	recorded when collection of the full amount is no longer probable. Known bad
	debts are written off against allowance for doubtful accounts when identified.
	After reviewing individual balances, we provide a provision of 15% for accounts
	receivable past due more than 180 days but less than one year, 40% for accounts
	receivable past due from one to two years, 75% for accounts receivable past due
	beyond two years, 100% for accounts receivable past due beyond three years, plus
	additional amounts as necessary.




	Selling, General and Administrative Expenses


	.
	Selling, general and administrative expenses consist of sales commissions,
	advertising and marketing costs, office rent and expenses, costs associated with
	staff and support personnel who manage our business activities, and professional
	fees paid to third parties. We incurred selling, general and administrative
	expenses of approximately $4.6 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2017,
	as compared to approximately $5.1 million for the nine months ended March 31,
	2016, a decrease of approximately $0.5 million. The decrease was primarily due
	to a $0.2 million decrease in stock compensation expense, $0.3 million decrease
	in professional fees, $0.2 million decrease in depreciation expenses on
	administrative equipment, $0.2 million decrease in social security and benefits
	and $0.3 million increase in other various G&A expenses, which was partially
	offset by a $0.7 million increase in salaries as compared to the nine months
	ended March 31, 2016.




	Research and Development Expenses


	. Research and
	development expenses were approximately $0.8 million for the nine months ended
	March 31, 2017, as compared to $0.6 million for the same period in 2016. The
	Company increased its research and development expenditures during this period
	as the Company determined to improve its competitive advantage with respect to
	its products.




	Loss from Termination of Lease.


	Effective
	February 29, 2016, we terminated an operating lease for our concrete plant in
	the eastern suburban area of Beijing due to the fact that the plant was not
	operating at ideal capacity and we did not anticipate that it would in the
	foreseeable future. We entered an agreement with a third party to terminate the
	lease of the concrete plant. Under the agreement, the fair value of net assets
	of the related operation was determined to be RMB 13.7 million (approximately
	$2.1 million), and was settled for RMB 11.2 million (approximately $1.7
	million). We recognized a loss of approximately $0.4 million from the
	termination of lease for the three months ended March 31, 2016.




	Loss from Operations.


	We incurred a loss from
	operations of approximately $9.4 million and $4.6 million for the nine months
	ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. This increase of approximately
	$4.8 million in loss from operations was primarily due to a $3.1 million
	decrease in gross profit, a $2.4 million increase in provision of doubtful
	accounts, a $0.2 million increase in research and development expenses, and was
	offset by $0.5 million decrease in selling, general and administration expenses
	and by $0.4 million decrease in loss from termination of lease.


	26









	Other Expense, Net


	. Our other expense consists of
	interest income (expense), finance expense and other non-operating income
	(expense). We had other income of approximately $0.4 million during the nine
	months ended March 31, 2017 consisting primarily of aged payables and aged
	customer deposits that we determined that we are no longer required to pay and
	recognized as other income accordingly. We earned interest income of
	approximately $27,000 and $0.3 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2017,
	and 2016, respectively. The decrease in interest income was mainly due to a very
	minimal average outstanding balance of short term investment held in a financial
	investment company during the nine months ended March 31, 2017, as opposed to
	$2.7 million average outstanding balance during the same period in 2016.
	Approximately $0.6 million of interest expense was recorded for each of the nine
	months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, and approximately $0.5 million of finance
	expense was recorded for each of the nine months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016.




	Provision for Income Taxes.


	We did not incur
	provision for income tax for the nine months ended March 31, 2017, and 2016,
	because we did not generate any income for tax provision and provided a 100%
	allowance from net operating losses on deferred tax assets.




	Net Loss.


	We incurred net loss of approximately
	$10.1 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2017, as compared to a net
	loss of approximately $5.5 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2016, a
	negative change in the amount of $4.6 million. Such change was the result of the
	combination of the changes as discussed above.



	Liquidity and Capital Resources



	As of March 31, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents of
	approximately $1.4 million and restricted cash of approximately $3.9 million,
	which was held by subsidiaries located outside the U.S. We would be required to
	accrue and pay U.S. taxes if we were to repatriate these funds. Any company
	which is registered in mainland PRC must apply to the State Foreign Exchange
	Administration for approval in order to remit foreign currency to any foreign
	country. We currently do not intend to repatriate to the U.S. the cash and
	short-term investments held by our foreign subsidiaries. However, if we were to
	repatriate funds to the U.S., we would assess the feasibility and plan any
	transfer in accordance with foreign exchange regulations, taking into account
	tax consequences. As we conduct all of our operations in the PRC, the
	restriction on the conversion of cash and short-term investments held in RMB to
	other currencies should not affect our liquidity.


	In assessing our liquidity, we monitor and analyze our cash
	on-hand and our operating and capital expenditure commitments. Our liquidity
	needs are to meet our working capital requirements, operating expenses and
	capital expenditure obligations.


	We engage in the production of advanced construction materials
	for large scale infrastructure, commercial and residential developments. Our
	business is capital intensive and we are highly leveraged. Debt financing in the
	form of short-term bank loans, loans from related parties and bank acceptance
	notes, have been utilized to finance our working capital requirements and
	capital expenditures. Because of recurring losses, working capital was
	approximately $6.9 million as of March 31, 2017, as compared to $16.4 million as
	of June 30, 2016. As of March 31, 2017, in additional to cash on-hand and
	restricted cash, we also have other current assets mainly composed of accounts
	receivables and prepayments and advances to suppliers.


	Although we believe that we can realize our current assets, our
	ability to repay our current obligations will depend on the future realization
	of our current assets. Management has considered historical experience, the
	economic environment, trends in the construction industry, the expected
	collectability of accounts receivable and the realization of the prepayments on
	inventory, and provided for an allowance for doubtful accounts as of March 31,
	2017. We expect to realize balances net of allowance within the normal operating
	cycle of a twelve-month period. If we are unable to realize our current assets
	within the normal twelve-month operating cycle, we may have to consider
	supplementing our available sources of funds through the following:




	 


	  



	Financial support and credit guarantee commitments from
	our shareholders.





	 


	 



	 





	 


	  



	Other available sources of financing from PRC banks and
	other financial institutions, given our credit history.





	Based on the above considerations, management is of the opinion
	that we have sufficient funds to meet our working capital requirements and debt
	obligations as they become due. However, there is no assurance that management
	will be successful in their plans. There are a number of factors that could
	potentially arise that could undermine the Companys plans, such as changes in
	the demand for our products, economic conditions, competitive pricing in the
	concrete-mix industry, our operating results not continuing to deteriorate and
	our bank and shareholders being able to provide continued financial support.

	Operating Activities.


	Net cash provided by
	operating activities totaled approximately $5.4 million for the nine months
	ended March 31, 2017, which was primarily attributable to net loss of $10.1
	million, which was offset by the net loss adjusted to reconcile to net cash
	provided by operating activities of $4.8 million, including adjustments for $0.9
	million of depreciation, $0.3 million of stock-based compensation expense, and
	$3.6 million provision for doubtful accounts as well as $10.8 million cash
	inflow from a change in operating assets and liabilities. Net cash from changes
	in operating assets and liabilities resulted in a net cash inflow, which mainly
	included cash inflow for reduction in inventories of $0.3 million, collection of
	other receivables of $7.4 million as we increased our efforts on other
	receivables collections, reduction of prepayments and advances of $2.9 million
	as we have already secured enough materials for production, additional accounts
	payable of $8.7 million, excluding non-cash offset of $10.3 million, as we were
	in waiting for our accounts receivable collection and maturities of notes
	receivable to repay our vendors, and additional other payables, including
	related party payables, of $5.7 million, due to accrued research and development
	expenses, accrued salary and rental expense payable to our related parties, and
	was primarily offset by additional accounts and notes receivable of $9.6
	million, excluding a non-cash offset of $10.3 million, due to delays in the
	receipt of customer payments, a reduction of customer deposits of approximately
	$3.9 million and a reduction of accrued liabilities of $0.8 million.






	Investing Activities


	. Net cash used in investing
	activities was approximately $53,000 for the nine months ended March 31, 2017,
	which was primarily attributable to the purchase of equipment.




	Financing Activities


	. Net cash used in financing
	activities totaled approximately $5.0 million for the nine months ended March
	31, 2017, which was primarily attributable to $18.5 million in cash proceeds
	from bank loans and bank guarantees, $24.6 million in proceeds from notes
	payable and $0.1 million in borrowing from shareholders, which was offset by
	$19.3 million for the repayment of bank loans and bank guarantees, and $29.0
	million for the repayment of notes payable.




	Cash and cash equivalents



	.

	As of March 31,
	2017, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $1.4 million as compared
	to approximately $1.0 million as of June 30, 2016. We believe that our cash and
	revenues from ongoing operations, in addition to the close management of our
	accounts payable and accounts receivable and our ability to obtain loan
	financing, will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital requirements for
	all of our ongoing operations. However, we may need to raise additional capital
	if we undertake any plans for expansion.




	Loan Facilities


	. We had a total of approximately
	$15.2 million and $16.6 million outstanding on loans and credit facilities as of
	March 31, 2017, and June 30, 2016, respectively. See Note 6 to our unaudited
	condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this
	report.





	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates



	While our significant accounting policies are more fully
	described in Note 2 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
	included elsewhere in this report, we believe that the following accounting
	policies are the most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating
	this management discussion and analysis:



	Principles of consolidation



	The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial
	statements include the financial statements of China ACM and its wholly owned
	subsidiaries, BVI-ACM, China-ACMH, and its variable interest entity Xin Ao
	(collectively, the Company). All significant inter-company transactions and
	balances have been eliminated in consolidation. In accordance with FASB ASC 810,
	Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, variable interest entities, or
	VIEs, are generally entities that lack sufficient equity to finance their
	activities without additional financial support from other parties or whose
	equity holders lack adequate decision making ability. All VIEs with which the
	Company is involved must be evaluated to determine the primary beneficiary of
	the risks and rewards of the VIE. The primary beneficiary is required to
	consolidate the VIE for financial reporting purposes. In connection with the
	adoption of this ASC810, the Company concludes that Xin Ao is a VIE and China
	ACM is the primary beneficiary. The financial statements of Xin Ao is
	consolidated with China ACMs financial statements.



	Use of estimates and assumptions



	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
	accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (US
	GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
	reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
	and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported
	amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. The significant
	estimates and assumptions made in the preparation of the Companys unaudited
	condensed consolidated financial statements include allowance
	for doubtful accounts, deferred taxes, and prepayments and advances, stock-based
	compensation, and fair value and useful lives of property, plant and equipment.
	Actual results could be materially different from those estimates.


	28








	Revenue recognition



	Revenue is realized or realizable and earned when four criteria
	are met:




	 


	  



	Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists (the Company
	considers its sales contracts to be pervasive evidence of an arrangement);





	 


	  



	Delivery has occurred;





	 


	  



	The sellers price to the buyer is fixed or determinable;
	and





	 


	  



	Collectability of payment is reasonably assured.





	The Company sells its concrete products primarily to major
	local construction companies. Sales agreements are signed with each customer.
	The agreements list all terms and conditions with the exception of delivery date
	and quantity, which are evidenced separately in purchase orders. The purchase
	price of products is fixed in the agreement and customers are not permitted to
	renegotiate after the contracts have been signed. Each agreement includes a
	cancellation clause if the Company or the customers breach the contract terms
	specified in the agreement.


	The Company recognizes revenue when title and ownership of the
	goods are transferred upon shipment to the customer by the Company and
	collectability of payment is reasonably assured.


	The Company includes the shipping and handling fee in both
	revenue and cost of revenue.



	Financial instruments



	US GAAP regarding fair value of financial instruments and
	related fair value measurements define fair value, establish a three-level
	valuation hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable
	inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair
	value.


	The three levels of inputs are defined as follows:


	Level 1 inputs to the valuation
	methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities
	in active markets;


	Level 2 inputs to the valuation
	methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active
	markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either
	directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial
	instrument;


	Level 3 inputs to the valuation
	methodology are unobservable.


	Financial instruments included in current assets and current
	liabilities are reported in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets
	at face value or cost, which approximate fair value because of the short period
	of time between the origination of such instruments and their expected
	realization and their current market rates of interest.



	Accounts and notes receivable



	We extend unsecured credit to our customers in the normal
	course of business,. Accounts are considered past due after 30 days. In
	establishing the required allowance for doubtful accounts, management considers
	historical experience, the economic environment, trends in the construction
	industry, and the expected collectability of the overdue receivable. Management
	reviews its accounts receivable each reporting period to determine if the
	allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate. An estimate for doubtful accounts
	is recorded when collection of the full amount is no longer probable. Account
	balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection
	have been exhausted and the potential for recovering is considered remote. We
	provide a provision of 15% of the allowance for doubtful accounts for accounts
	receivable balance that are past due more than 180 days but less than one year,
	40% of the allowance for doubtful accounts for accounts receivable past due from
	one to two years, 75% of the allowance for doubtful accounts for accounts
	receivable past due beyond two years, 100% of the allowance for doubtful
	accounts for accounts receivable past due beyond three years, plus additional
	amount as necessary, which our collection department had determined the
	collection of the full amount is remote with the approval from our management to
	provide a 100% provision allowance for doubtful accounts. Our management have
	continued to evaluate the reasonableness of the valuation allowance policy and
	update it if necessary.


	29







	Notes receivable represent trade accounts receivable from
	various customers where the customers' banks have guaranteed such customers
	obligation. The notes are non-interest bearing and typically have a three or six
	month maturity date. The notes are generally charged with a transaction fee of
	0.1% of the notes amount. The Company has the ability to submit requests for
	payment to a customer's bank earlier than the scheduled maturity date, subject
	to a discount on interest charged and a processing fee.



	Accounting for long-lived assets



	We classify our long-lived assets into: (i) machinery and
	equipment; (ii) transportation equipment; (iii) office and equipment; and (iv)
	buildings and improvements.


	Long-lived assets held and used by us are reviewed for
	impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
	carrying value of such assets may not be fully recoverable. It is possible that
	these assets could become impaired as a result of technological or other
	industry changes. If circumstances require a long-lived asset or asset group to
	be tested for possible impairment, we first compare undiscounted cash flows
	expected to be generated by that asset or asset group to its carrying value. If
	the carrying value of the long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable on
	an undiscounted cash flow basis, an impairment is recognized to the extent that
	the carrying value exceeds its fair value. Fair value is determined through
	various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow models, quoted
	market values and third-party independent appraisals, as considered
	necessary.


	If the value of an asset is determined to be impaired, the
	impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying
	amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Assets to be disposed
	of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value, less
	disposition costs.


	Due to recurring losses, the deterioration of the concrete-mix
	industry in Beijing, PRC and because of competitive pricing pressures, we have
	performed an impairment analysis and determined our ong-lived assets are
	impaired. As a result, we recorded an impairment charge of $2.6 million for the
	year ended June 30, 2016. These charges were related to the impairment of our
	transportation equipment,plants and machinery. The loss was determined using
	Level 3 inputs. There was no impairment charge for the nine months ended March
	31, 2017, and 2016.


	Competitive pricing pressures and changes in interest rates
	could materially and adversely affect the Companys estimates of future net cash
	flows to be generated by long-lived assets, and thus could result in future
	impairment losses



	Income taxes



	We account for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, Income
	Taxes, which requires us to use the assets and liability method of accounting
	for income taxes. Under the assets and liability method, deferred income taxes
	are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences by applying
	enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between
	financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and
	liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carry forward. Under this
	accounting standard, the effect on deferred income taxes of a change in tax
	rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A
	valuation allowance is recognized if it is more likely than not that some
	portion, or all of, a deferred tax asset will not be realized.


	ASC 740-10, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, defines
	uncertainty in income taxes and the evaluation of a tax position as a two-step
	process. The first step is to determine whether it is more likely than not that
	a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of
	any related appeals or litigation based on the technical merits of that
	position. The second step is to measure a tax position that meets the
	more-likely-than-not threshold to determine the amount of benefit to be
	recognized in the financial statements. A tax position is measured at the
	largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likelihood of being
	realized upon ultimate settlement. Tax positions that previously failed to meet
	the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold should be recognized in the first
	subsequent period in which the threshold is met. Previously recognized tax
	positions that no longer meet the more-likely-than-not criteria should be
	de-recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which the
	threshold is no longer met. Penalties and interest incurred related to
	underpayment of income tax are classified as income tax expense in the period
	incurred.


	United States federal, state and local income tax returns prior
	to 2013 are not subject to examination by any applicable tax authorities.



	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements



	We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or
	are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
	condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of
	operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is
	material to our stockholders.

	Recently issued accounting pronouncements



	Refer to Note 2 of the unaudited condensed consolidated
	financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting standards and
	pronouncements.



	Interest Rate Risk



	We are exposed to interest rate risk while we have short-term
	bank loans outstanding. Although interest rates for our short-term loans are
	typically fixed for the terms of the loans, the terms are typically twelve
	months and interest rates are subject to change upon renewal. Interest rates are
	approximately 4.35% for RMB bank loans with a term of twelve months or less.



	Credit Risk



	The Company is exposed to credit risk from its cash in bank and
	fixed deposits, and accounts and notes receivable, other receivables and
	advances on equipment purchases. The credit risk on cash in bank and fixed
	deposits is limited because the counterparties are recognized financial
	institutions. However, the Companys cash in bank deposited in the financial
	institutions in the PRC is not insured. Accounts and notes receivable, other
	receivables and advances on inventory purchases are subjected to credit
	evaluations. An allowance has been made for estimated unrecoverable amounts
	which have been determined by reference to past default experience and the
	current economic environment.



	Foreign Exchange Risk



	The value of the RMB against the U.S. dollar and other
	currencies is affected by, among other things, changes in the PRCs political
	and economic conditions. The RMB does not fluctuate with the U.S. dollar.
	Although the Peoples Bank of China regularly intervenes in the foreign exchange
	market to prevent significant short-term fluctuations in the exchange rate, the
	RMB may appreciate or depreciate significantly in value against the U.S. dollar
	in the medium to long term. In August 2015, the PRCs currency dropped by a
	cumulative 4.4% against the U.S. dollar on hopes of boosting the domestic
	economy, making PRC exports cheaper and imports into the PRC more expensive by
	that amount. The effect on trade can be substantial. The trend of depreciation
	of RMB continued in the year 2016 and the three months ended March 31, 2017.
	Compared with the lowest point from RMB versus U.S. dollars in 2015, the RMB has
	depreciated by 5.9% compared to the exchange rate as of March 31, 2017.
	Moreover, it is possible that in the future, PRC authorities may lift
	restrictions on fluctuations in the RMB exchange rate and lessen intervention in
	the foreign exchange market.


	Because substantially all of our earnings and cash assets are
	denominated in RMB, but our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar, fluctuations
	in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the RMB will affect our balance
	sheet and our earnings per share in U.S. dollars. In addition, appreciation or
	depreciation in the value of the RMB relative to the U.S. dollar would affect
	our financial results reported in U.S. dollar terms without giving effect to any
	underlying change in our business or results of operations. Fluctuations in the
	exchange rate will also affect the relative value of any dividend we might issue
	in the future that will be exchanged into U.S. dollars and earnings from, and
	the value of, any dollar-denominated investments we make in the future.


	Very limited hedging transactions are available in the PRC to
	reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. To date, we have not entered
	into any hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to foreign
	currency exchange risk. While we may enter into hedging transactions in the
	future, the availability and effectiveness of these transactions may be limited,
	and we may not be able to successfully hedge our exposure at all. In addition,
	our foreign currency exchange losses may be magnified by PRC exchange control
	regulations that restrict our ability to convert RMB into foreign
	currencies.


	Most of the transactions of the Company are settled in RMB and
	U.S. dollars. In the opinion of the directors, the Company is not exposed to
	significant foreign currency risk.



	Inflation



	Inflationary factors, such as increases in the cost of raw
	materials and overhead costs, could impair our operating results. Inflation has
	had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations for the
	nine months ended March 31, 2017, a high rate of inflation in the future may
	have a continued adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of
	gross margin and selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of
	sales revenue if the selling prices of our products do not increase with these
	increased costs.

	ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.




	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures



	We maintain a system of disclosure controls and procedures. The
	term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined by regulations of the SEC,
	means controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information
	required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit to the SEC under
	the Securities of Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), is
	recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified
	in the SECs rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include,
	without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information
	required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit to the SEC
	under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management,
	including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer,
	or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely
	decisions to be made regarding required disclosures. Each of our Chief Executive
	Officer and our Interim Chief Financial Officer has evaluated the design and
	operating effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of March
	31, 2017. Based upon their evaluation, these executive officers have concluded
	that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of March 31,
	2017, due to ineffective internal controls over financial reporting that stemmed
	from the fact that we do not have any full-time accounting personnel who have
	U.S. GAAP experience.


	Despite the material weakness reported above, our management
	believes that our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included
	in this report fairly present in all material respects our financial condition,
	results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented because we have
	retained a consultant who has U.S. GAAP experience to assist us in the
	preparation of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.



	Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting



	During the quarter ended March 31, 2017, there were no changes
	in our internal controls over financial reporting identified in connection with
	the evaluation performed during the fiscal quarter covered by this report that
	has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our
	internal controls over financial reporting.

		AMID's Chinese Company Report (CCR) provides information on the Chinese large public-traded corporations, large manufacturing producers, large financial companies or large service providers. In the two past decades, the Chinese industry has been growing at a fast pace.   The dramatic expansions of the manufacturing capabilities and rising consumer consumptions in China have transformed China’s society and economy. China is one of the world’s major producers for industrial and consumer products. Far outpacing other economies in the world, China is the world’s fastest growing market for the consumptions of goods and services.  The Chinese economy maintains a high speed growth which has been stimulated by the consecutive increases of industrial output, imports & exports, consumer consumption and capital investment for over two decades. Rapid consolidation between medium and large players is anticipated since the Chinese government has been encouraging industry consolidation with an effort to regulate the industry and to improve competitiveness in the world market. Although China has enjoyed the benefits of an expanding market for production and distribution, the industry is suffering from minimal innovation and investment in R&D and new product development. The sector’s economies of scale have yet to be achieved. Most domestic manufacturers lack the autonomic intellectual property and financial resources to develop their own brand name products. This new study focuses on the company's business overiew, organzation structure, products and services, production locations, recent activities, and financail data Asia Market Info & Dev Co. is one of the leading sources for up-to-date market information and research on the fastest-growing Chinese markets. We have published over 2,000 reports focusing on the Chinese markets,  industry forecasts and company profiles. We provide hard-to-find market data and analyses.

Style Scores:



NA Value | NA Growth | NA Momentum | NA VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Buyer's Feedback


Easy Sourcing helps me trade easily!
As a new member to Made-in-China.com, I posted my first request on Easy Sourcing one month ago. Fortunately, I received the first quality quotation from supplier - Changzhou Ji****Co., Ltd. within 2 hours after submission! Finally I ordered Electronic Transformer from the supplier. In the past I had to spend several days to find a satisfied supplier. Now, I only need a few hours!

I have found several qualified suppliers through Easy Sourcing!
I have been a premium buyer with Made-in-China.com for many years. Since the first time posting sourcing request on Easy Sourcing, I have found several reliable suppliers, it's convenient for me to receive rapid quotations and compare the suppliers. Easy Sourcing has provided tremendous value to me. Now it's my favorite way to find Chinese suppliers.
