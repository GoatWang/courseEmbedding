 Seth  Grae
President and Chief Executive Officer
 Mr. Grae has led the strategic direction and financing efforts of Lightbridge since its founding, including taking the company public. During his tenure, Lightbridge has evolved into a leader in developing advanced nuclear fuel technologies and in providing advisory services to developing and existing nuclear energy programs seeking to meet the highest international standards of safety, non-proliferation, and transparency. He leads Lightbridge’s efforts to develop and deploy advanced nuclear reactor fuel that will result in significantly more electricity being provided from existing and new reactors, as well as dramatically enhanced safety, to allow nuclear power to compete and grow internationally as a non-emitting source of base load electricity. Lightbridge also advises governments of countries seeking to start nuclear power programs from feasibility studies through procurement and operations. Lightbridge’s first major international engagement was to develop the strategic plan—the Roadmap for Success—for commercial nuclear energy for the United Arab Emirates, and Mr. Grae and his family lived in Abu Dhabi during the procurement process for the initial four reactors. Lightbridge is engaged by domestic and overseas governmental entities on critically important civil nuclear advisory matters. Mr. Grae has worked extensively in North America, Asia, and Europe, and has also traveled extensively in South America, Africa, and Australia. Prior to Lightbridge, he worked as a corporate attorney in New York. Mr. Grae is regularly invited to guest lecture at universities, including MIT, Princeton, the University of Chicago, Brandeis, and George Washington. His opinions are also sought by national media, including the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg TV, Fox Business News, Washington Post, and MIT Technology Review, as well as international media such as BBC, Financial Times, and Times of India. He is also a regular invited speaker at major international conferences on energy, nuclear power, and the environment.
Mr. Grae is a member of the Civil Nuclear Trade Advisory Committee (CINTAC) to the U.S. Secretary of Commerce and is a member of the Nuclear Energy Institute's Suppliers Advisory Committee. He is also a member of the Dean’s Advisory Council at the Washington College of Law at American University. He has served as Vice Chair of the Governing Board of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, as a member of the Board of Directors of the Lawyers Alliance for World Security, and as Co-chair of the American Bar Association’s Committee on Arms Control & Disarmament.
Mr. Grae earned a B.A. (cum laude) from Brandeis University; an M.B.A. and an L.L.M. in international law (with honors) from Georgetown University; and a J.D. from American University.
