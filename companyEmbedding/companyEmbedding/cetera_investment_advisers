      “Our promise is this...we will always put your interests first. We will get to know your hopes and dreams, and we will always be there for you because at Financial Engines that's what we do.”        



LARRY M. RAFFONE
President and Chief Executive Officer




Connect with a top Financial Advisor in your area who will work hard for you.
You need to build a high-quality relationship that serves your needs and preferences.
        A key role of an advisor is to listen to your needs and concerns, and to provide the objective feedback and experience in financial markets that will keep your plans on track. Most of us wouldn’t dream of performing surgery on ourselves, pleading our own case in court, or designing structural supports for a house. But, amazingly, many doctors, lawyers, architects – and people from all walks of life – design and carry out their own financial plans. A financial advisor is not someone to meet once and never see again.
      





Do-it-yourself financial planning can be time-consuming and often delivers unfavorable results.
If you have built up significant savings of at least $50,000 or more, it is time to consider bringing in a professional financial advisor to help preserve and expand your nest egg. Someone trained, credentialed and experienced in financial planning can help you design and execute a plan that best meets your needs and tolerance for risk. And there’s no better time than the present to get started.

Strategies for Investing in Uncertain Markets
In an uncertain market, one thing is certain: Market declines are an inevitable part of investing.
These 5 investment strategies can help you ride out the bumps and keep your eyes on the big picture.












Stay Calm and Get Professional Advice

Avoid making quick moves on your own, as tempting as it may be. Instead, meet with your financial professional and share your concerns.
Resist making decisions on the basis of single events.
Re-examine your investment goals, time horizon and risk tolerance with your financial professional to make sure they remain appropriate.




 






Maintain a Diversified Investment Portfolio

Work with your financial professional to spread your risks.
Consider selecting a mix of mutual funds that invests in stocks and bonds. Additionally, keeping an appropriate amount of your portfolio in money market or cash equivalent mutual funds and other liquid investments can help you meet short-term needs. 
Include funds that invest outside the United States. Non-U.S. markets often move in their own market cycles.
Diversification doesn’t guarantee a profit, but over time it can help to reduce the effects of volatility.


Maintain a Diversified Investment Portfolio




 






Invest Regularly — In Good and Bad Times















Avoid moving everything into stocks at the hint of good news — or everything into cash following bad news.
Instead of fearing a down market, view it as an opportunity to buy shares at potentially lower prices.
Consider investing a fixed amount every month or quarter, a strategy known as dollar cost averaging. You won’t have to guess which way the market is going. You also won't risk the possibility of investing all of your money at the top of the market. (Please note that this strategy of regular investing does not ensure a profit or protect against loss.)


Invest Regularly — In Good and Bad Times


Invest Regularly — In Good and Bad Times




 






Invest for Income

Consider mutual funds that stress the role of dividends — or bond funds that produce a steady stream of interest payments.
Income-producing investments can provide a cushion during a down stock market. After all, a dividend is yours whether the stock price is rising or falling. 


Invest for Income




 






Avoid Jumping In and Out of the Market

Successful market timing during a bear market is extremely difficult because it requires two near-perfect actions: getting out at the right time and getting back in at the right time. As a result, investors typically end up buying high and selling low.
One reason it’s difficult: A bear market is not usually characterized by a straight-line decline in stock prices. Instead, it tends to be jagged — showing bursts of stock price increases and then declines that bring with them corresponding feelings of euphoria and concern.

 Staying the Course 
 


















Investments are not FDIC-insured, nor are they deposits of or guaranteed by a bank or any other entity, so they may lose value.
Investors should carefully consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other important information is contained in the fund prospectuses and summary prospectuses, which can be obtained from a financial professional and should be read carefully before investing. 


Regular investing does not ensure a profit or protect against loss. Investors should consider their willingness to keep investing when share prices are declining.

Global stocks produced mixed returns amid investor worries about sluggish economic growth and expectations for higher U.S. interest rates. European equities advanced on the promise of new monetary stimulus measures, however, U.S. stocks were flat and emerging markets retreated. Bonds also declined as Federal Reserve leaders indicated that a rate hike is likely in December. The dollar rose sharply against the euro and the yen.

 MARKET COMMENTARY   |  September 2015 
 Fed Rate Decision: Near-Zero For Now, But Higher Soon?  












The Federal Reserve has decided to keep interest rates close to zero, as concern about global economic conditions cast a shadow over an otherwise fairly bright outlook for the U.S. economy.
Looking forward, the Fed is expected to raise rates gradually, and an increase of 0.25%, for example, would be unlikely to have a significant impact on the economy.
Over time, higher interest rates can be beneficial for bond investors, enabling reinvestment in issues offering higher yields.
Rising rates have a varied impact on stocks. Selective investors who emphasize company-specific research should continue to find attractive longer term income and return opportunities.

 MARKET COMMENTARY   |  September 2015  |  FEATURING Timothy D. Armour & Robert W. Lovelace 
 Q&A With Portfolio Managers Tim Armour and Rob Lovelace  











Perspective on Recent Market Selloff Triggered by China Woes
Global stocks have tumbled in recent days amid investor concerns about slowing economic growth in China. A sharp decline in Chinese stocks and a surprise currency devaluation have further stoked fears that the outlook for China is deteriorating, and events there could hurt its global trading partners, including Japan, Europe and ultimately the United States. China lowered interest rates and eased reserve requirements on banks in an attempt to calm investors and stimulate the economy. Against this backdrop, portfolio managers Tim Armour and Rob Lovelace share their thoughts on the unfolding events:

China now accounts for roughly 15% of the world’s gross domestic product and therefore has a greater impact than ever before on the global economy.
The most significant catalyst of the selloff was China’s unexpected decision to devalue its currency, delivering a shock to financial markets.

 World Markets Review for August 2015  











Global stocks plummeted as fears that China’s economy may be weaker than previously expected hit every sector of the markets. Financial and consumer discretionary stocks fell the most, particularly those with high exposure to Asia. Defensive sectors, such as utilities and telecommunication services, fared somewhat better. High-grade bonds were essentially flat amid concerns about rising U.S. interest rates. The dollar lost ground against the euro and the yen.

Investment Management
Insights, Strategies and Solutions
Our experienced professionals have expertise in a broad spectrum of traditional, alternative and non-financial assets.  We can work with you to develop and manage a portfolio tailored to your needs.






Portfolio Consulting
A collaborative dialogue with your portfolio manager
Your portfolio manager is a key member of your U.S. Trust relationship team and serves as your personal "chief investment officer." He or she will work with you to create an Investment Policy Statement, which serves as a blueprint for your portfolio by documenting your:

Objectives
Risk tolerance
Cash flow needs
 Tax situation
Wealth aspirations

Your portfolio manager's ongoing role is to incorporate our best strategic and tactical thinking, most relevant research analysis, current market insights and appropriate investment solutions into your portfolio. He or she will regularly monitor your portfolio to make sure it conforms to your Investment Policy Statement, which will be updated whenever there are significant changes in your life or goals.
Asset management
A more complete approach to asset allocation1
We analyze a wide range of asset classes, including hedge and private equity funds2 and global investment opportunities, as potential components of an asset allocation. In addition, we believe that true diversification requires managing for cash flows across and within asset classes in various market environments — not simply allocating according to a grid.
Your asset allocation will be based on the long-term expectations established for each asset class by our most senior investment professionals. Over the shorter term, however, your portfolio manager can adjust your portfolio tactically in response to emerging opportunities and risks, and reflecting U.S. Trust insights about trends and themes relevant to you.
How you own your assets — personally or in trusts; in taxable or tax-exempt solutions — can have a material impact on the overall performance of your portfolio. At U.S. Trust we focus on this wealth structuring aspect of your portfolio in conjunction with managing the assets themselves.
Alternative Investments
SOPHISTICATED SOLUTIONS TO MEET YOUR NEEDS2
Alternative investments at U.S. Trust focus on non-traditional assets such as:

Hedge funds
Private equity
Real estate and tangible assets

Because performance is often differentiated from equity and fixed income markets, alternative investments may be an ideal complement to traditional investments. 
Through our access to the industry's premier managers, we are able to offer solutions that provide options for all client segments. And we support you every step of the way with knowledge built on our experience in alternatives, including industry-leading research, rigorous due diligence, and cutting-edge portfolio construction.
Drawing from the experience, resources and expertise of the firm, you and your portfolio manager can explore alternative investments that can help you pursue what matters most to you.
Specialty asset management
Expertise in nonfinancial assets3
Specialty asset management at U.S. Trust focuses on nonfinancial assets such as:

Farm and ranch land
Timberland
Oil and gas properties
Private businesses
Real estate

Our Specialty Asset Management team can work with your portfolio manager and wealth strategist, as appropriate, to integrate these real assets into your overall plan and portfolio.
We can help you realize your objectives with assets you already own, or help you acquire specific assets to take advantage of their capital growth and diversification potential — whether you own these assets outright or they are held in trust.
Our team of specialists can provide complete turnkey services including identifying and purchasing real property and providing ongoing management.
Capital markets
Sophisticated market-linked solutions4
Through our access to the resources of Merrill Lynch, one of the world's leading capital markets participants, we can tailor approaches to risks and opportunities in the foreign exchange, interest rate, commodity and equity markets. Derivative-based transactions target the risks you seek to hedge, and are designed to dovetail with your overall portfolio and wealth management strategies.

1 Asset allocation and diversification do not ensure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets.
2 Alternative Investments such as derivatives, hedge funds, private equity funds, and funds of funds can result in higher return potential but also higher loss potential. Changes in economic conditions or other circumstances may adversely affect your investments. Before you invest in alternative investments, you should consider your overall financial situation, how much money you have to invest, your need for liquidity, and your tolerance for risk. Alternative investments are speculative and involve a high degree of risk.
3 Nonfinancial assets, such as closely-held businesses, real estate, oil, gas and mineral properties, and timber, farm and ranch land, are complex in nature and involve risks including total loss of value.  Special risk considerations include natural events (for example, earthquakes or fires), complex tax considerations, and lack of liquidity.  Nonfinancial assets are not suitable for all investors.  Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager, and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax, or estate planning strategy.
4 Brokerage services are provided by Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, a registered broker-dealer, Member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation.
Certain U.S. Trust associates are registered representatives with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated ("MLPF&S") and may assist you with investment products and services provided through MLPF&S and other nonbank investment affiliates. MLPF&S is a registered broker-dealer, member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation ("BofA Corp."). U.S. Trust operates through Bank of America, N.A., and other subsidiaries of BofA Corp.

 Security








If you receive a suspicious e-mail bearing Cetera Investment Services’ name, immediately forward it to your Registered Representative.BackgroundThis information will help answer some of the concerns that you may have around the security of your online transactions.Cetera Investment Services makes every effort to enhance the security of your data. Protecting our customers is just good business. Despite all of our efforts, however, there are risks associated with doing business over the Internet. You can take some action to protect yourself, and we encourage you to read this information:1. What is “phishing”?2. Imitating Cetera Financial Institutions websites3. Advanced-fee fraud4. Verifying websites5. Protecting yourself6. More information7. Helpful guidelines1. What is “phishing”?A phishing attack is an online fraud technique that involves sending official-looking e-mail messages with return addresses, links and corporate branding that all appear to come from banks, retailers, credit card companies and other legitimate businesses.  These e-mails typically contain a hyperlink to a spoof website. The goal is to mislead account holders to enter confidential information and security details like IDs and passwords on the pretext that some of your information must be updated or changed. Once you provide this information, the cyber criminals can access legitimate sites and steal your money.It is important that you are suspicious of e-mails asking for your confidential information. Cetera Investment Services will never ask you for your personal information by e-mail. This may include your Social Security number, date of birth, bank account number and username and password.If you receive a suspicious e-mail bearing Cetera Investment Services’ name, immediately forward it to your Registered Representative.2. Imitating Cetera Investment Services’ websitesCetera Investment Services monitors the Internet to find imitation websites. These are often the first step made by scam artists. We work with the appropriate international authorities to get these websites closed down as quickly as possible, sometimes on the same day.3. Advanced-fee fraudYou may already have heard of advanced-fee fraud. In this instance, e-mails offering the recipients large sums of money are sent to thousands of e-mail addresses. A modest fee is required to cover legal costs, open an account or pay customs’ charges. Sometimes, the money offered is the result of a lottery even though you never bought a ticket. Other times, the money is held in an account overseas but the account owner cannot access it. The cyber criminals promise a percentage of the money in return for your help. In both cases, various fees have to be paid right away.Do not respond to these e-mails. They are part of a fraud and you will not receive any of the promised money.We warn our customers because the criminals committing these frauds do, on occasion, use the name of Cetera Investment Services or Cetera Investment Services subsidiaries as part of this scam.4. Verifying websitesCustomers can verify that the website they are entering is secure by following these two guidelines:The URL will begin with https://The application window will specify that SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is in use5. Protecting yourselfTake care of your personal informationYour account numbers, customer number, PIN number, password and other personal information are the keys to your account. Never write them down, give them to anyone else or include them in an e-mail. Destroy documents containing personal information securely, and be very cautious about posting personal details on social networking sites on the Internet. Criminals can use this information to commit fraud. Remember that protecting your personal information is your responsibility.Take care of your computerUpdate your computer by installing the latest software and patches to prevent hackers or viruses from exploiting any known weaknesses in your computer.Install and update virus protection to protect against viruses corrupting your computer and to prevent hackers from installing Trojan viruses on your computer.Install and update anti-spyware tools. (Spyware is computer software that is installed on your computer without your consent to collect various types of personal information or interfere with your computer in various ways.)Install and update personal firewalls. (A firewall is a hardware or software device that regulates the flow of information between computers).Use only programs from a known, trusted supplier.Beware of spam e-mailsSpam e-mails are messages that are sent simultaneously to thousands of e-mail addresses from an unfamiliar sender.Use a spam filter to avoid even seeing these messages.Never respond to a spam message; your e-mail address is then recorded as live and the spam will increase.Should you read a spam message, remember: If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is too good to be true.6. More informationThe U.S. Federal Trade Commission provides information on how to avoid phishing scams. Go to www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/tech.shtm.The Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG) provides statistics on phishing attacks and advice for individuals and companies. APWG is a global pan-industrial and law enforcement association focused on eliminating fraud and identity theft that result from phishing and other online scams. Go to www.antiphishing.org.7. Helpful guidelinesHelp protect your identity from theft by:Removing mail from your mailbox every day (or better yet, sign up for electronic statements!).Never leaving bills in your mailbox overnight—always put them in a secure U.S. postal mailbox (or better yet, get rid of them and pay bills online!).Knowing your billing cycles. Follow up with creditors if bills or new cards don’t arrive on time. (An identity thief may have filed a change of address request in your name with the creditor or the post office.)Shredding receipts and mail, especially pre-approved credit card applications.Eliminating the receipt of pre-approved offers of credit by calling 888-5-OPT-OUT.Never carrying your Social Security card or bank passwords or other sensitive information in your wallet.Accounting for all new checks when you receive them in the mail.Removing your name from direct mail lists and writing to the companies you do business with and ask them not to sell or rent your name. You can visit the Direct Marketing Association’s website (www.the-dma.org/) to learn about the laws that protect you as a consumer and how to get your name removed from these lists.Ordering copies of your credit report once a year from one of the three national credit-reporting agencies and looking for accuracy and for indications of fraud, such as unauthorized applications, unfamiliar credit accounts, credit inquiries and defaults and delinquencies that you did not cause.Checking your Social Security Earnings and Benefits statement once each year to make sure that no one else is using your Social Security number for employment.Be suspicious about telephone calls where:The company has a name that is intended to sound like a government agency or a well-known company.The company is unwilling to send you written information on the offer or give you references.Someone claims you’ve won a prize and you haven’t entered a contest.A telemarketer asks for your Social Security number, calling card or credit card number, so you can purchase products or qualify for prizes.You have to pay a fee before you receive complimentary goods or services.In general things sound too good to be true!Bank, shop and spend wisely by:Canceling your unused credit cards so that their account numbers will not appear on your credit report.Signing your credit cards immediately upon receipt.Doing business with companies you know are reputable, particularly online.Using a secure browser when you conduct business online that encrypts or scrambles purchase information. (Make sure your browser’s padlock or key icon is active.)Avoiding opening e-mail from unknown sources.Never clicking on an e-mail link. Go to the company’s website yourself and fill out information there or call them.Asking businesses what their privacy policies are and how they will use your information: Can you choose to keep it confidential? Do they restrict access to data?Helpful guidelines if your identity has been stolen:1. Contact your bank(s) and credit card issuer(s) immediately to:Protect the access to your accounts.Stop payments on missing checks.Change personal identification numbers (PINs) and online banking passwords.Open a new account if appropriate.2. File a report with your local police department and:Obtain a police report number with the date, time, police department, location and name of the police officer taking the report.Agree to an investigation (if the police recommend it) into the loss. The police report will be helpful when clarifying to creditors that you are a victim of identity theft. Complete an Identity Theft Affidavit form and submit it to the appropriate companies. You can download a copy of this form at www.consumer.gov/idtheft.3. Contact the three major credit bureaus and request a copy of your credit report and:Review your reports to make sure additional fraudulent accounts have not been opened in your name or unauthorized changes made to your existing accounts.Request the “inquiries” be removed from your report from the companies that opened the fraudulent accounts. Here are the major credit bureaus and their phone numbers: Trans Union (800.680.7289), Experian (888.397.3742) and Equifax (800.525.6285). You may also contact the FTC’s ID Theft Consumer Response Center toll-free at 877-IDTHEFT.4. Recheck your credit report in a few months to:Verify your corrections and changes.Make sure no new fraudulent activity has occurred. Request a “fraud alert” for your file and a victim’s statement asking creditors to call you before opening new accounts or changing your existing ones. This can help prevent an identity thief from opening additional accounts in your name.5. Check your mailbox for stolen mail to:Make sure no one has requested an unauthorized address change, title change, or PIN change or ordered new cards or checks to be sent to another address.If a thief has stolen your mail, contact your local post office and police.6. Maintain a written chronology of what happened by noting:What was lost.The steps you took to report the incident to the various agencies, banks and firms impacted.The date, time, contact telephone numbers, name of the person you talked to and any relevant report or reference number and instructions.7. Send a registered letter to all creditors where fraudulent accounts have been opened and:Include a copy of the police report.Include the ID Theft Affidavit.Request that the institution send you a letter of release to clean up the account and acknowledge that it is fraudulent.IMPORTANT CONTACT INFORMATIONFor credit checks and theft information, contact:InstitutionWebsitePhoneFederal Trade Commissionwww.consumer.gov/idtheft877-IDTHEFTEquifaxwww.equifax.com800.525.6285Experianwww.experian.com888.397.3742Trans Unionwww.transunion.com800.680.7289Telecheckwww.telecheck.com800.710.9898International Check ServicesN/A800.366.5010Identity Theft Resource Centerwww.idtheftcenter.org/858.693.7935Social Security SSN Fraud Hotline Administrationwww.ssa.gov800.269.0271The National Fraud Information Centerwww.fraud.org800.876.7060U.S. Postal SSN Fraud Hotline Inspection Servicepostalinspectors.uspis.gov800.372.8347

Life Insurance – We hope you never need it, but we can help ensure your loved ones are taken care of should the unthinkable ever happen.

Cetera Advisor Networks is an independent broker-dealer that was founded in 1983 as Financial Network Investment Corporation, a pioneer on the emergent independent-contractor broker-dealer scene. It was built on the belief that financial advisors could enjoy even greater success by joining high-performance teams offering local support and guidance, while sharing best practices across a nationwide network. From that belief, the firm's hallmark regional model was born – a model that built the firm into one of the nation's largest and most successful independent broker-dealers.

      “Our promise is this...we will always put your interests first. We will get to know your hopes and dreams, and we will always be there for you because at Financial Engines that's what we do.”        



LARRY M. RAFFONE
President and Chief Executive Officer




Connect with a top Financial Advisor in your area who will work hard for you.
You need to build a high-quality relationship that serves your needs and preferences.
        A key role of an advisor is to listen to your needs and concerns, and to provide the objective feedback and experience in financial markets that will keep your plans on track. Most of us wouldn’t dream of performing surgery on ourselves, pleading our own case in court, or designing structural supports for a house. But, amazingly, many doctors, lawyers, architects – and people from all walks of life – design and carry out their own financial plans. A financial advisor is not someone to meet once and never see again.
      





Do-it-yourself financial planning can be time-consuming and often delivers unfavorable results.
If you have built up significant savings of at least $50,000 or more, it is time to consider bringing in a professional financial advisor to help preserve and expand your nest egg. Someone trained, credentialed and experienced in financial planning can help you design and execute a plan that best meets your needs and tolerance for risk. And there’s no better time than the present to get started.

Strategies for Investing in Uncertain Markets
In an uncertain market, one thing is certain: Market declines are an inevitable part of investing.
These 5 investment strategies can help you ride out the bumps and keep your eyes on the big picture.












Stay Calm and Get Professional Advice

Avoid making quick moves on your own, as tempting as it may be. Instead, meet with your financial professional and share your concerns.
Resist making decisions on the basis of single events.
Re-examine your investment goals, time horizon and risk tolerance with your financial professional to make sure they remain appropriate.




 






Maintain a Diversified Investment Portfolio

Work with your financial professional to spread your risks.
Consider selecting a mix of mutual funds that invests in stocks and bonds. Additionally, keeping an appropriate amount of your portfolio in money market or cash equivalent mutual funds and other liquid investments can help you meet short-term needs. 
Include funds that invest outside the United States. Non-U.S. markets often move in their own market cycles.
Diversification doesn’t guarantee a profit, but over time it can help to reduce the effects of volatility.


Maintain a Diversified Investment Portfolio




 






Invest Regularly — In Good and Bad Times















Avoid moving everything into stocks at the hint of good news — or everything into cash following bad news.
Instead of fearing a down market, view it as an opportunity to buy shares at potentially lower prices.
Consider investing a fixed amount every month or quarter, a strategy known as dollar cost averaging. You won’t have to guess which way the market is going. You also won't risk the possibility of investing all of your money at the top of the market. (Please note that this strategy of regular investing does not ensure a profit or protect against loss.)


Invest Regularly — In Good and Bad Times


Invest Regularly — In Good and Bad Times




 






Invest for Income

Consider mutual funds that stress the role of dividends — or bond funds that produce a steady stream of interest payments.
Income-producing investments can provide a cushion during a down stock market. After all, a dividend is yours whether the stock price is rising or falling. 


Invest for Income




 






Avoid Jumping In and Out of the Market

Successful market timing during a bear market is extremely difficult because it requires two near-perfect actions: getting out at the right time and getting back in at the right time. As a result, investors typically end up buying high and selling low.
One reason it’s difficult: A bear market is not usually characterized by a straight-line decline in stock prices. Instead, it tends to be jagged — showing bursts of stock price increases and then declines that bring with them corresponding feelings of euphoria and concern.

 Staying the Course 
 


















Investments are not FDIC-insured, nor are they deposits of or guaranteed by a bank or any other entity, so they may lose value.
Investors should carefully consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other important information is contained in the fund prospectuses and summary prospectuses, which can be obtained from a financial professional and should be read carefully before investing. 


Regular investing does not ensure a profit or protect against loss. Investors should consider their willingness to keep investing when share prices are declining.

European equities advanced on the promise of new monetary stimulus measures, however, U.S. stocks were flat and emerging markets retreated. Bonds also declined as Federal Reserve leaders indicated that a rate hike is likely in December. The dollar rose sharply against the euro and the yen.

 Fed Rate Decision: Near-Zero For Now, But Higher Soon?  












The Federal Reserve has decided to keep interest rates close to zero, as concern about global economic conditions cast a shadow over an otherwise fairly bright outlook for the U.S. economy.
Looking forward, the Fed is expected to raise rates gradually, and an increase of 0.25%, for example, would be unlikely to have a significant impact on the economy.
Over time, higher interest rates can be beneficial for bond investors, enabling reinvestment in issues offering higher yields.
Rising rates have a varied impact on stocks. Selective investors who emphasize company-specific research should continue to find attractive longer term income and return opportunities.

 MARKET COMMENTARY   |  September 2015  |  FEATURING Timothy D. Armour & Robert W. Lovelace 
 Q&A With Portfolio Managers Tim Armour and Rob Lovelace  











Perspective on Recent Market Selloff Triggered by China Woes
Global stocks have tumbled in recent days amid investor concerns about slowing economic growth in China. A sharp decline in Chinese stocks and a surprise currency devaluation have further stoked fears that the outlook for China is deteriorating, and events there could hurt its global trading partners, including Japan, Europe and ultimately the United States. China lowered interest rates and eased reserve requirements on banks in an attempt to calm investors and stimulate the economy. Against this backdrop, portfolio managers Tim Armour and Rob Lovelace share their thoughts on the unfolding events:

China now accounts for roughly 15% of the world’s gross domestic product and therefore has a greater impact than ever before on the global economy.
The most significant catalyst of the selloff was China’s unexpected decision to devalue its currency, delivering a shock to financial markets.

Global stocks plummeted as fears that China’s economy may be weaker than previously expected hit every sector of the markets. Financial and consumer discretionary stocks fell the most, particularly those with high exposure to Asia. Defensive sectors, such as utilities and telecommunication services, fared somewhat better. High-grade bonds were essentially flat amid concerns about rising U.S. interest rates. The dollar lost ground against the euro and the yen.

Investment Management
Insights, Strategies and Solutions
Our experienced professionals have expertise in a broad spectrum of traditional, alternative and non-financial assets.  We can work with you to develop and manage a portfolio tailored to your needs.






Portfolio Consulting
A collaborative dialogue with your portfolio manager
Your portfolio manager is a key member of your U.S. Trust relationship team and serves as your personal "chief investment officer." He or she will work with you to create an Investment Policy Statement, which serves as a blueprint for your portfolio by documenting your:

Objectives
Risk tolerance
Cash flow needs
 Tax situation
Wealth aspirations

Your portfolio manager's ongoing role is to incorporate our best strategic and tactical thinking, most relevant research analysis, current market insights and appropriate investment solutions into your portfolio. He or she will regularly monitor your portfolio to make sure it conforms to your Investment Policy Statement, which will be updated whenever there are significant changes in your life or goals.
Asset management
A more complete approach to asset allocation1
We analyze a wide range of asset classes, including hedge and private equity funds2 and global investment opportunities, as potential components of an asset allocation. In addition, we believe that true diversification requires managing for cash flows across and within asset classes in various market environments — not simply allocating according to a grid.
Your asset allocation will be based on the long-term expectations established for each asset class by our most senior investment professionals. Over the shorter term, however, your portfolio manager can adjust your portfolio tactically in response to emerging opportunities and risks, and reflecting U.S. Trust insights about trends and themes relevant to you.
How you own your assets — personally or in trusts; in taxable or tax-exempt solutions — can have a material impact on the overall performance of your portfolio. At U.S. Trust we focus on this wealth structuring aspect of your portfolio in conjunction with managing the assets themselves.
Alternative Investments
SOPHISTICATED SOLUTIONS TO MEET YOUR NEEDS2
Alternative investments at U.S. Trust focus on non-traditional assets such as:

Hedge funds
Private equity
Real estate and tangible assets

Because performance is often differentiated from equity and fixed income markets, alternative investments may be an ideal complement to traditional investments. 
Through our access to the industry's premier managers, we are able to offer solutions that provide options for all client segments. And we support you every step of the way with knowledge built on our experience in alternatives, including industry-leading research, rigorous due diligence, and cutting-edge portfolio construction.
Drawing from the experience, resources and expertise of the firm, you and your portfolio manager can explore alternative investments that can help you pursue what matters most to you.
Specialty asset management
Expertise in nonfinancial assets3
Specialty asset management at U.S. Trust focuses on nonfinancial assets such as:

Farm and ranch land
Timberland
Oil and gas properties
Private businesses
Real estate

Our Specialty Asset Management team can work with your portfolio manager and wealth strategist, as appropriate, to integrate these real assets into your overall plan and portfolio.
We can help you realize your objectives with assets you already own, or help you acquire specific assets to take advantage of their capital growth and diversification potential — whether you own these assets outright or they are held in trust.
Our team of specialists can provide complete turnkey services including identifying and purchasing real property and providing ongoing management.
Capital markets
Sophisticated market-linked solutions4
Through our access to the resources of Merrill Lynch, one of the world's leading capital markets participants, we can tailor approaches to risks and opportunities in the foreign exchange, interest rate, commodity and equity markets. Derivative-based transactions target the risks you seek to hedge, and are designed to dovetail with your overall portfolio and wealth management strategies.

1 Asset allocation and diversification do not ensure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets.
2 Alternative Investments such as derivatives, hedge funds, private equity funds, and funds of funds can result in higher return potential but also higher loss potential. Changes in economic conditions or other circumstances may adversely affect your investments. Before you invest in alternative investments, you should consider your overall financial situation, how much money you have to invest, your need for liquidity, and your tolerance for risk. Alternative investments are speculative and involve a high degree of risk.
3 Nonfinancial assets, such as closely-held businesses, real estate, oil, gas and mineral properties, and timber, farm and ranch land, are complex in nature and involve risks including total loss of value.  Special risk considerations include natural events (for example, earthquakes or fires), complex tax considerations, and lack of liquidity.  Nonfinancial assets are not suitable for all investors.  Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager, and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax, or estate planning strategy.
4 Brokerage services are provided by Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, a registered broker-dealer, Member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation.
Certain U.S. Trust associates are registered representatives with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated ("MLPF&S") and may assist you with investment products and services provided through MLPF&S and other nonbank investment affiliates. MLPF&S is a registered broker-dealer, member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation ("BofA Corp."). U.S. Trust operates through Bank of America, N.A., and other subsidiaries of BofA Corp.

Wealth Structuring
Preservation and Transfer
Your wealth plan is designed to provide you and your family with thoughtful and innovative solutions customized to the financial and personal complexities of your life.  We bring you knowledge, experience and expertise across the broad range of wealth structuring disciplines.






Wealth Planning
Integrating your personal and financial affairs
By thinking holistically about all aspects of your wealth, we develop customized strategies to help pursue your unique goals. Wealth structuring can help you address issues including:

The cash flow required to help meet your lifestyle
The investments needed to help meet long-range objectives 
The most effective way to pursue estate planning goals 
The tax implications of the many aspects of managing and transferring your wealth

Trusts and Estates
Shaping your legacy and transferring your wealth
For more than two centuries, U.S. Trust has been helping many of America's wealthiest families build estate plans and implement wealth transfer strategies. Your team can work with you to build a sound estate plan that may help you:

Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan
Identify the best-qualified grant recipients
Monitor the impact of your efforts

We can help you design and implement a philanthropic strategy that helps you fulfill your values-based commitments in a way that is consistent with your lifestyle.

What’s Coming Out of Silicon Valley


				By Randall Stross			
August 23, 2012 6:20 am
August 23, 2012 6:20 am







Randall Stross, the Digital Domain columnist for The New York Times, has been following Y Combinator, the Silicon Valley start-up incubator, for more than a year. His book, “The Launch Pad: Inside Y Combinator, Silicon Valley’s Most Exclusive School for Startups,” will be published next month by Portfolio/Penguin. 
He got a rare insider look at all of the incubator’s fledgling start-ups in robotics, mobile apps, e-commerce services and software for companies. Here is his exhaustive, but not exhausting, special report for Bits on the current crop of companies Y Combinator has produced.

Peer through the window of a hospital nursery and you see rows and rows of cute babies. I think newborn start-ups possess the same kind of cheek-pinching appeal.
And nowhere can you find as large a collection of start-ups in a single place as those that come out of Y Combinator, the Mountain View, Calif., seed fund.
On Tuesday, YC, as insiders call it, staged its 15th semiannual Demo Day for investors. Sixty-three of the summer batch’s companies made a formal public presentation to investors and the press. That’s a lot of newborns.
The Demo Day format hasn’t changed much as YC has grown over the years, attracting ever larger numbers of applications and funding larger batches of start-ups. The purpose of the exercise is to give investors a tantalizing tidbit or two of information sufficient for determining whether to have the conversations that may eventually lead to an investment. Each presentation lasts just two or two and a half minutes, is filled with astounding figures (“a $150 billion market!”), comes in thematically random order, and is stacked one on top of the other, in a blur. (Eleven more presentations came at the end that were designated off-the-record.)
Sure, some of the babies appear to be a bit cuter than the others. But all deserve a chance to make their way. What can be done immediately is view the group portrait. YC’s summer 2012 batch captures prevailing start-up ideas in one moment in time.
A little more than half of the start-ups that presented are attempting to sell to business customers. Let’s start, however, with the start-ups that are consumer oriented. Many are fledgling media businesses built upon user-generated content.  We users apparently have very short attention spans. The humor site 9gag , which serves up silly memes found by users — and draws 65 million unique users a month — says “bite size is the future of entertainment.” Reelsurfer lets users reduce a video clip, which may already be short, to extremely short length.
For more conventional entertainment, there is Mars Frontier, a massively multiplayer, real-time strategy game, the first game produced by SpinPunch. What is not so conventional, at least not yet, is the use of HTML5, which requires no download as Flash-based games do.
Tapin, which like many of its batchmates incorporates the twin motifs of mobile and social, is a mobile video app designed for a speedy start. Kamcord also is in social and mobile entertainment: mobile game developers are invited to use its software so that gamers can record and share their gameplay. Another company makes the Coco Controller, a smartphone case that has physical buttons for use with mobile games that are written to work with the case. 
Circular applies the social theme to news, letting one’s friends act as a filter. Or, for those who would like to not have the social overlay on everything one does, there’s Everyday.me, an iPhone app that “captures all your life moments” but whose default setting is private: not to be shared with others.
There is some playful experimentation with communication. Visitors to Voicegem’s Web site can record a voice message that is sent to an e-mail address rather than a phone number.  Hubchilla matches users up with strangers to have conversations via texting but keeps the participants’ phone numbers hidden. (One of its co-founders, who is a 20 Under 20 Thiel Fellow, said he began coding at the age of 8.)
Tablets receive the focused attention of Grid, which makes a spreadsheet that does some tricks that no spreadsheet on a PC could ever match.
Amid the fascination with mobile, the Web has not disappeared completely, however. For sharing favorite images found on the Web, there’s Imgfave. For favorite links, with the pitch addressed to office workers in particular, there’s Kippt.  For finding stuff of our own that is stored in Google Docs, Collections provides a “finder for the cloud.”
No fewer than four of the start-ups in the batch provide travel-related services. Flightfox runs contests in which travel agents and other humans compete to find the lowest fare for international or multicity flights. Or travelers can use GetGoing, which describes itself as “the next-generation Priceline.” It supplies a deeply discounted fare for leisure travelers who are willing to agree to go to either of two separate destinations — but cannot choose which one it is.  Vayable offers unusual travel experiences, bringing travelers and independent guides together. TomoGuides is preparing smartphone city guides that will be offered free. 
Like Vayable, other start-ups are creating an online marketplace, bringing together suppliers and customers and offering prices lower than those available using existing middlemen in the physical world. Tastemaker does the same for interior designers and customers.
RegistryLove works with existing merchants but is attempting to create a consolidated wedding registry that spans all stores.
Healthy Labs, a start-up hosting what it calls “patient social networks” for chronic diseases, has begun with a site for those with Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis:  Crohnology.
In education, Knowmia has set up a site that invites teachers to contribute video lessons, what the company describes as “a crowdsourced Khan Academy.”  StudyEdge offers college students study guides, video content and live review sessions that address challenging courses at particular universities. It’s now available at the University of Florida. 
The personal finance category of software is an old one. SmartAsset, a Web-based service, applies its own analytical engine to the category, which supplies customized answers to users’ questions like how much house can one afford.
Instacart is an intrepid start-up that has entered another old category, one known for the notorious failure of early pioneers: Web-based grocery ordering. Its founder stressed that it carried no inventory (unlike the infamous failure Webvan): “We’re entirely software.”
A category of software with a much shorter history is that for 3-D printers. Dreamforge lets users create a customized design for a three-dimensional superhero that the company will print — that is, manufacture — then send back to the customer.
The blend of the physical and the digital is also found in Vastrm, a Web site that offers customized shirts, including a “Home Try-On Program,” similar to what Warby Parker offers for eyeglasses. Vastrm’s founder received one of the loudest appreciative laughs of the day when he pointed to Warby Parker’s success and remarked, “Not everyone wears glasses, but everyone wears a shirt.”
Suppose you’re not home when U.P.S. tries to deliver your Dreamforge superhero or Vastrm polo shirt to your apartment? Someday you may live close to a BufferBox location, each with a box containing multiple parcel lockers that are controlled through software. (BufferBox is rolling out its initial boxes in Toronto.)
The remaining start-ups in this summer batch are pitching to the enterprise or to fellow software developers.
Some services are focused on a particular industry and are highly specialized. Keychain Logistics brings together shippers and truckers, eliminating human brokers. Viacycle runs bike-sharing programs for universities, cities and businesses. Rentio tells apartment owners what they should charge for rent. Eligible helps insurance companies and health care providers fully automate insurance eligibility queries, eliminating the expense of placing, and fielding, phone calls between humans. Hiptype teams up with e-book publishers, embedding its software in the books to gather data for what it calls “data-driven book publishing.”
If the business is one in which individuals outside the company send in documents that must then be reviewed — résumés, grant applications, college applications — there’s a YC company that handles the process: Submittable.
Parallel Universe supplies a database service for businesses or organizations that manage vast amounts of spatial data in real time, like the Israeli air force, an early customer.
Amicus seeks to profit from helping nonprofits replace inefficient fund-raising using old means, like mail appeals and cold calls, with social media: friends referring friends.
Finance, with its large I.T. budgets, has attracted BigCalc, which does fast simulations for quants and algo traders, and DataNitro, which weds Python financial and math libraries to Excel spreadsheets. 
FundersClub wants to be “the future Nasdaq,” matching accredited investors with tech start-ups. Coinbase offers a way for nontechnical users to get started with Bitcoin, the digital currency.
Many of the start-ups that are selling to the enterprise aim at customers that belong to no particular industry.  MicroEval seeks to move performance reviews to the cloud. Statwing supplies easy “data visualization” to nontechnical people working with spreadsheets.  QuicklyChat is a video chat service for co-workers that the company claims is easy to use but will not interrupt the work of the person who is asked to respond because of the software’s “intelligent availability detection.”
Small and medium-size businesses that need a customized phone system can turn to Profig. For warehouse management, there’s HD Trade Services’ cloud-based inventory manager.
A large cluster of the start-ups are in marketing or advertising. Sponsorfied seeks to match corporate sponsors with targets. LeanMarket guides ad buyers on banner-ad exchanges. Canopy Labs does customer modeling to help clients evaluate the value of leads. Referly expands affiliate marketing, working with more than 30,000 retailers. Tracksby plans to arrange celebrity endorsements. Virool offers to help spread advertisers’ videos through social networks, blogs and phones. On behalf of clients, Survata distributes market research surveys to Web publishers, who let visitors who complete the surveys read articles free instead of paying.
Mth Sense provides mobile advertisers with information about the gender and interests of users;  the company deduces these by looking at what other apps are installed on a phone. (This company holds what I believe must be the day’s record for largest figure mentioned — 25 trillion — a reference to the number of in-app ads that the company says will appear in 2016.)
We come to the last category of start-ups in the batch, the one that is, by far, the largest: tools and services for software developers. YC has always attracted strong technical teams and no one knows better than developers and designers themselves what they need. This batch has Light Table, an interactive programming development that had raised more than $300,000 on Kickstarter last spring; Easel and Markupwand for Web site design; Scoutzie,  a marketplace for mobile app designers; Airbrite for tightly integrating e-commerce functionality to mobile apps; Clever, which has APIs for software developers who are working with schools and their student rosters; Plivo, challenging the dominant incumbent, Twilio, which has APIs for voice and SMS applications; Filepicker.io, which eases file movement between a local device and the cloud; and Zapier, which seeks to be the master translator of all APIs.
Representatives of one company in the batch stood out in particular; they were arguably the sensation of the day and had a thick knot of observers surrounding them at every break. These were the svelte robots of Double Robotics, designed to provide telepresence inexpensively. One iPad is mounted on top, facing outward; another iPad is held by the human who controls the machine. In developing it, the founders took on challenges in hardware as well as software, but they were able to come to market with a price of $2,000, a fraction of the price for telepresence robots from incumbents. The company received $500,000 of advance orders in just one week.
Gratifying, yes, but being in the hardware business means dealing with real materials and finite supplies. The company sold out its first production run and says orders placed today won’t be filled until early 2013.

Having concrete goals gives you confidence as you prepare for your future. Here at TD Ameritrade, we make goal planning easy, and it all starts with a call.


Making the call

Make an appointment to meet with a Financial Consultant either in person, or over the phone. We’ll ask you to gather some relevant information about your investment objectives and strategies so we can start drafting a detailed analysis.






Setting your goals

Planning together

We’ll determine how likely you are to achieve your financial goals based on various factors. We’re also able to see how hypothetical situations could influence your plan.






Leaving with a plan

End the session with an actionable plan in hand, and the confidence you need to know you’re on the right track.











IMPORTANT: The projections or other information generated by the TD Ameritrade Goal Planning tool (“Goal Planning”) regarding the likelihood of various investment outcomes are hypothetical in nature, do not reflect actual investment results, and are not guarantees of future results. Goal Planning results may vary with each use and over time.

Checklist: 9 Questions Every Advisor Should Be Able to Answer 




Whatever your priorities, this can help you find someone who understands you and has the resources to help you manage your financial life 











AT ONE TIME OR ANOTHER, WE ALL face major turning points in our lives—getting married, becoming a parent, receiving a life-changing promotion, getting ready to retire. At times like these, many people feel a need for financial help, and start to wonder whether working with a financial advisor might make sense. That's when the search begins.
The challenge is finding someone you'll feel comfortable talking to about the most personal things—your family, your money, your hopes for your future. Someone who'll be there for you for years to come, and who can provide more than just stock recommendations.
To find an advisor who can help you with those decisions, don't be afraid to ask the following tough questions—they'll help you get a clear idea of what you can expect from the relationship and whether it makes sense for you.
1. What types of clients do you work with?
Some advisors have special experience working with business owners or members of a specific profession. Others might have particular knowledge in a specialty, such as sustainable investing or retirement planning. Ask what team members or resources from around their company they can call upon to help you meet your specific needs.
The challenge is finding someone you'll feel comfortable talking to about the most personal things—your family, your money, your hopes for your future.
2. What is your track record?
No advisor can or should promise financial results based on past performance. And beware those who do. But an advisor with a record of long relationships with clients likely provides the kind of service that earns their loyalty.
3. How often will we talk?
An advisor should be committed to conversations in person, by phone, or online—whatever your preference is—as often as you require. Every client has different needs and expectations. Be upfront with the advisor about how frequently and by what means you would like to get together to discuss your finances.
4. How realistic are my goals?
Even if you have a strong idea of what you want to accomplish with your money, the right advisor can help you better understand and prioritize your goals, including making any necessary tradeoffs based on your finances, timelines and investing preferences.

5. How will we keep my strategy on course?
Even the best strategy will need adjusting as financial markets and your goals change. An advisor should have a plan for regular reviews and the ability to correct as market conditions and your priorities shift.
6. What happens if the markets are volatile? Will you call me?
When markets get scary, there's nothing worse than feeling isolated and alone. One of an advisor's most vital functions is to reach out at such times, hear your concerns, offer perspective, and talk about any needed adjustments to your strategy.
7. What if I'm upset about a service issue or an investment?
As life becomes increasingly automated, there's nothing like a human voice and quick response when you're concerned about a financial matter. Advisors who define their success by your success will be eager to quickly resolve any such issues.
8. Who will I actually be working with?
Many advisors have teams of professionals to enhance the services they provide. Ask who you'd be working with on a regular basis and their level of experience. Beyond the immediate team, does the company supporting them have access to a broad array of financial insights and resources?
9. How do I pay you for your work?
It's never easy to ask, but the right advisors will welcome this question. Clarity about fees is vital to a successful relationship. Payment—whether a percentage of assets or per transaction—should be structured around your needs and preferences.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
