Frequently asked questions





How many Lumas do I need?
The number of Lumas required for a household may vary depending on size of the home as well as construction materials, which may impede network signal strength. The average Luma broadcasts a signal out to cover an 1000-1500 sq ft home. However, this is additionally dependent on materials and should be treated as a flexible range on a case-by-case basis.
Will Luma work with my current ISP?
There are no restrictions with which ISP the Luma can work. Luma is compatible with any wired ethernet ISP including: TWC, Comcast, Charter, Brighthouse, Cox, AT&T, FiOS, etc.
What level of security does Luma have?
Luma scans every outbound connection from your network to analyze the URLs and IP addresses in order to detect malicious traffic and infected machines. The traffic is compared against a database of malicious hosts including malware, spam, spyware, botnet and fraudulent. If filtering is set to Unrestricted, then Lumas will detect but not block the malicious activity. If any filtering is set to Restricted or any other lower level, then Lumas will detect and block the malicious activity.





What download speed can Luma support?
Our Luma WiFi routers utilize the 802.11ac wireless network standard. On the backside of the Luma, you will also see 2 ethernet ports which are able to handle speeds up to 1 Gbps (gigabit per second). That means you will have the latest wireless standard, as well as the fastest download speed around your home.
How does ‘content filtering’ work?
Luma accesses a vast variety of databases to base content filtering on and is constantly monitoring traffic for inappropriate content.
How do I set a bedtime restriction for a user?
The Bedtime feature gives Luma administrators the ability to set bedtime rules for individuals on the network. A bedtime schedule can be set per user for the entire week or just certain days. During the selected bedtime period, the user will have their Internet access paused until the set awake time.

BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB:

4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    6. Avoid misleading customers by creating the false impression of sponsorship, endorsement, popularity, trustworthiness, product quality or business size through the misuse of logos, trustmarks, pictures, testimonials, or other means

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Upon request, provide BBB with all information required to evaluate compliance with BBB standards.

Be Responsive









            Address marketplace disputes quickly, professionally, and in good faith.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Promptly respond to all complaints forwarded by BBB by: 
1. Resolving the complaint directly with the complainant and notifying BBB, or

                            2. Providing BBB with a response that BBB determines: 

                                    1. is professional,
                                
2. addresses all of the issues raised by the complainant,
3. includes appropriate evidence and documents supporting the business' position, and

                                    4. explains why any relief sought by the complainant cannot or should not be granted.
                                





                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB. Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed. BBB may consider a business' willingness to participate in recommended dispute resolution options in determining compliance with these standards.
                

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.
                

                    4. Cooperate with BBB in efforts to eliminate the underlying cause of patterns of customer complaints that are identified by BBB.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

MSRP 
$399.00













Pros
Easy to install and configure. Built-in security and content filtering. Good close-proximity throughput in testing.


Cons
Expensive. Limited Ethernet ports. Lacks dedicated band control. No advanced management settings. Middling range performance.


Bottom Line
The Luma Home WiFi System is designed to extend your wireless network to all parts of your home. It's very easy to install, but it's pricey, and performance is mixed.







There's a new type of wireless product hitting the market: Wi-Fi systems use individual modules to create a mesh network that delivers wireless networking to all areas of your home. The Luma Home WiFi System ($399; 3-pack, or $149 each) joins the Eero, AmpliFi, and Plume systems as the latest modular Wi-Fi solution to tout ease of use and whole-house coverage. Luma makes it easy to invite users to a guest network and to create filter policies for each user. The system delivered good close-proximity throughput in our testing, but we found that performance took a hit as we moved away from the main module. Moreover, management options and ports are limited. For half the price, you can pick up a traditional midrange router, like our Editors' Choice Linksys EA7500 Max-Stream AC1900 MU-MIMO Gigabit Router, which delivers much better overall throughput and offers plenty of ports and management settings.

Design and Features
The 3-pack system of routers reviewed here (which Luma refers to as modules) is designed for the typical home, but you can add more modules (up to ten on a single network) if you require more coverage. In the box, you also get three power supplies, and one Ethernet cable. The hexagon-shaped modules are available in white, gold, orange, or silver, and measure 4.1 by 4.6 by 1.1 inches (HWD). There's a round LED ring on the face of the module that flashes blue during the initial setup, green when configuring the Wi-Fi network, and red when there's an error. The light goes out when everything is up and running. The modules communicate with one another via a proprietary mesh network and are designed to be placed within 40 feet of each other to blanket your home with Wi-Fi coverage.

Each module is an 802.11ac router and contains a quad-core processor and two radio bands (2.4GHz and 5GHz). They are AC1200 routers with a maximum data rate of 300Mbps on the 2.4GHz band and 867Mbps on the 5GHz band, as well as support for Multi-User Multiple Input, Multiple Output (MU-MIMO) data streaming. As with the Asus Google OnHub SRT-AC1900 router, the Luma uses automatic band steering and chooses which band is best, based on location and load. It's a nice feature, but it shows up as a single SSID, which means you can't dedicate a band to specific devices, such as gaming consoles and media servers. You only get one Gigabit LAN port on each module; it's on the back of the device and is joined by a Gigabit WAN input and a USB 2.0 port. The USB port can be used for charging peripherals, but at the time of this writing, it was not yet able to connect to USB hard drives.
The Luma network is controlled using a mobile app for Android and iOS users. As with the Starry Station, the Eero, and the Asus Google OnHub routers, the Luma does not offer a Web-based management console and can only be accessed and controlled using a mobile device. The app opens to the Wi-Fi page, which shows the placement of each module in a generic home floor plan. It tells you how many Luma devices are online, as well as your current upload and download speeds. Swiping the screen to the left brings you to a page where you can see each module by name; tapping a module displays the status and IP address for that module. The three-bar icon on the upper-left corner takes you to the Main Menu, where you can access Wi-Fi and Account settings, launch an online help page, and shop for Luma devices on Amazon.

Wi-Fi settings are limited to changing the network's name and password and enabling the Guest Network, and Account settings are limited to changing the name of each module. There are no QoS, Firewall, or Port Forwarding settings, nor are there settings for creating access schedules. Parental controls include a Content Filter policy with five rating levels: Unrestricted, R-rated, PG-13, PG, and G. You can apply a rating across the entire network or add users, and assign a different level to each user as you see fit. When you add a user, you can also add their frequently used client devices to make sure the filters are always in place. You can use the Control page to give users access to your guest network via text or email and to add new Luma modules to the network. There's also a Pause button that instantly switches off Internet access across the network until you disable it.
The Luma offers a built-in Security feature that continually scans all connected devices for malware and vulnerabilities to hacking and viruses. It will quarantine infected devices and attempt to purge them of infections, and will send a push alert to your mobile device when something is detected. You can check your status by tapping the Security icon on the bottom of the Home screen.
Installation and Performance
To install the Luma routers, you have to download the free Android or iOS app. When you first open the app, you press the Setup Luma button and select how many modules you are installing. You'll be asked to answer questions, such as what type of home you live in (single-family, apartment/condo, or townhouse) and how many floors are in your home. I chose single-family home with two floors (basement and main floor).

You then have to tell the app where your router/modem is located by clicking on an area of your home (front, back, middle, upstairs, or downstairs) and then create a network name and password. The app will prompt you to plug in the first Luma module, connect it to your modem, and restart the modem. You can then name the module using a list of room names (Master Bedroom, Kitchen, Office, etc). The light ring will spin blue briefly and turn solid blue when the module is initialized. Press the Start Wi-Fi button and wait for the light ring to flash green seven times. It will turn off when it's ready. The entire process took less than five minutes for me. You can tap Add Another Luma to install additional Luma modules or you can opt to add more at a later time.
When adding more Luma modules, the process is similar to that of setting up the first module, but the app will tell you where to install your next module based on the location of the first device. In my case, it was the upstairs center of my house. It took around one minute to initialize, and 25 seconds for the Wi-Fi setup. The app had me install the third module in the center of my basement, and the installation was as quick as the first two.
 See How We Test Wireless Routers
Performance in testing was mixed. I ran my usual throughput tests, but since I could not isolate the radio bands, results are based on the Luma's band-steering feature. On the close-proximity (same-room) test for the main module (the one connected to my modem), the Luma delivered an impressive 457Mbps. That's right up there with the Linksys EA7500 (495Mbps) and much faster than the Eero (188.7Mbps) and the Asus Google OnHub (307Mbps). The Starry Station managed 398Mbps on this test. On the 30-foot test the Luma's score of 76.1Mbps edged past the Eero (71.2Mbps) and beat the Asus Google OnHub (39.8Mbps) handily, but couldn't keep pace with the Starry Station (160Mbps) and the Linksys EA7500 (298Mbps).
I ran the same tests on each of the two satellite modules and found that the close-proximity throughput was significantly reduced (106Mbps for the upstairs module, and 101Mbps for the basement module), while the 30-foot test scores were nearly identical to the main module (77.2Mbps and 75Mbps, respectively).
Conclusion
The Luma Home WiFi System is a good bet if you seek simplicity when setting up and maintaining a home Wi-Fi network. Like Eero, it's relatively expensive, especially if you need more than three modules to cover your home, but technically challenged users will appreciate its built-in parental controls and no-hassle security features. If you want total control over your network, however, the Luma will likely disappoint, in which case you're better off with a traditional device, such as the Linksys EA7500 Max-Stream AC1900 MU-MIMO Gigabit Router, our Editors' Choice for midrange routers. It's about half the price of the Luma system, offers better throughput performance, and is packed with features, including multiple LAN ports and plentiful management settings.

Our Favorite Under-$500 Laptops












Time to Digitize: Top-Rated Photo Scanners
















Sjcam SJ7 Star


Editors' Rating: good
07.25.2017



 

at 



Bottom Line: The Sjcam SJ7 Star action cam delivers high-quality 4K capture for an affordable price, but omits digital stabilization at its top resolution.










Sony FDR-X3000


Editors' Rating: good
07.25.2017



 

at 



Bottom Line: The Sony FDR-X3000 action cam records optically stabilized 4K footage, but it's not as easy to use or squeeze into small places as a GoPro.










MGcool Explorer Pro


Editors' Rating: fair
07.25.2017



 

at 



Bottom Line: The Mgcool Explorer Pro action cam entices with a low asking price and promise of 4K video capture, but you can do better without spending more.










Scuf Impact


Editors' Rating: excellent
07.25.2017



 

at 



Bottom Line: The Scuf Impact is a fantastic-feeling controller with unprecedented options for customizability and personalization, but its high price might prove prohibitive to all but the most committed PS4 players.










Klipsch The Three



Editors' Rating: excellent
07.25.2017



 

at 



Bottom Line: Klipsch's stylish The Three speaker delivers terrific audio performance with serious bass response, and connects to a wide variety of wired and wireless sound sources.










Liquid Web Hosting



Editors' Rating: excellent
07.24.2017



 

at 



Bottom Line: Liquid Web is expensive and lacks shared Web hosting, but it's a flexible, feature-packed online host with outstanding customer service and excellent dedicated and VPS packages.










Netgear Arlo Baby 1080p HD Monitoring Camera


Editors' Rating: excellent
07.24.2017



 

at 



Bottom Line: The Arlo Baby 1080p HD Monitoring Camera from Netgear is a feature-rich baby monitor that delivers sharp video and uses motion and sound detection to help keep an eye on your child from your phone or PC.










iBaby Monitor M6S



Editors' Rating: excellent
07.24.2017



 

at 



Bottom Line: The iBaby Monitor MS6 is a full-featured baby monitor that uses your phone to keep tabs on your infant. It offers excellent 1080p video and a host of features including environment monitoring, two-way audio, pan and tilt, and motion and sound detection.










GoDaddy Web Hosting


Editors' Rating: excellent
07.24.2017



 

at 



Bottom Line: GoDaddy is a feature-packed web hosting service that boasts rock-solid uptime, excellent customer service, and flexible website-building tools.










Amazon S3


Editors' Rating: excellent
07.24.2017



 

at 



Bottom Line: Amazon S3 is the industry-standard answer for storing business data, especially for enterprise operations. But because Amazon designed S3 as an IT-oriented "bucket," it doesn't come with a user-friendly storage sync and backup application, instead providing only IT-centric tools and APIs. It's cost-effective, efficient, and secure, but plan to bring your own desktop software.










New Razer Blade Pro (2017)


Editors' Rating: excellent
07.24.2017



 

at 



Bottom Line: The New Blade Pro is a modest improvement on the previous iteration, with a THX-certified panel and audio alongside a slightly faster unlocked Core i7 processor.










InMotion Web Hosting


Editors' Rating: excellent
07.24.2017



 

at 



Bottom Line: InMotion is a feature-stacked web hosting service that offers many attractive features, but a few issues keep it from being the top dog.










A2 Web Hosting


Editors' Rating: excellent
07.24.2017



 

at 



Bottom Line: Packed with features, A2 is a web hosting service that's more than worthy of being the foundation for your website.










Yamaha YAS-706 MusicCast Wireless Multiroom Sound Bar


Editors' Rating: excellent
07.24.2017



 

at 



Bottom Line: The pricey Yamaha YAS-706 soundbar handles both movies and music with a strong mix of power, balance, and connectivity.










Apple MacBook (2017)


Editors' Rating: good
07.24.2017



 

at 



Bottom Line: The ever-slim Apple MacBook gets a faster processor and remains a battery life champ, but a persistent dearth of connectivity ports makes it unappealing compared with the similarly priced MacBook Pro and Windows competitors.










SurveyMonkey


Editors' Rating: excellent
07.21.2017



 

at 



Bottom Line: SurveyMonkey has a well-deserved reputation as a leader in online survey marketing with an intuitive user interface and advanced features like artificial intelligence.

Frequently asked questions





How many Lumas do I need?
The number of Lumas required for a household may vary depending on size of the home as well as construction materials, which may impede network signal strength. The average Luma broadcasts a signal out to cover an 1000-1500 sq ft home. However, this is additionally dependent on materials and should be treated as a flexible range on a case-by-case basis.
Will Luma work with my current ISP?
There are no restrictions with which ISP the Luma can work. Luma is compatible with any wired ethernet ISP including: TWC, Comcast, Charter, Brighthouse, Cox, AT&T, FiOS, etc.
What level of security does Luma have?
Luma scans every outbound connection from your network to analyze the URLs and IP addresses in order to detect malicious traffic and infected machines. The traffic is compared against a database of malicious hosts including malware, spam, spyware, botnet and fraudulent. If filtering is set to Unrestricted, then Lumas will detect but not block the malicious activity. If any filtering is set to Restricted or any other lower level, then Lumas will detect and block the malicious activity.





What download speed can Luma support?
Our Luma WiFi routers utilize the 802.11ac wireless network standard. On the backside of the Luma, you will also see 2 ethernet ports which are able to handle speeds up to 1 Gbps (gigabit per second). That means you will have the latest wireless standard, as well as the fastest download speed around your home.
How does ‘content filtering’ work?
Luma accesses a vast variety of databases to base content filtering on and is constantly monitoring traffic for inappropriate content.
How do I set a bedtime restriction for a user?
The Bedtime feature gives Luma administrators the ability to set bedtime rules for individuals on the network. A bedtime schedule can be set per user for the entire week or just certain days. During the selected bedtime period, the user will have their Internet access paused until the set awake time.





All Products

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
