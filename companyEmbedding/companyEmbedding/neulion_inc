NeuLion Digital Platform Overview





An overview of the NeuLion Digital Platform, a complete end-to-end video solution, delivering live and on-demand content in up to 4K to any connected device. 
NeuLion, Inc.





PLAINVIEW, N.Y., May  09, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NeuLion, Inc. (TSX:NLN), a leading technology product and service provider that specializes in the digital video broadcasting, distribution and monetization of live and on-demand content to Internet-enabled devices, today reported its financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. Q1 2017 Financial Highlights Revenue of $23.9 millionNeuLion® Digital Platform revenue of $15.6 millionNet loss of $1.9 millionCash totaled $32.7 million at March 31, 2017Share Repurchase Program resulted in an additional 2.3 million shares purchased and cancelled “Armed with an expanded global footprint and leading edge technology, we made solid progress in the first quarter growing and diversifying our customer base,” said Roy Reichbach, President and CEO of NeuLion. “Excluding revenue related to the NHL, with an expanded global sales team and footprint in place we grew our NeuLion Digital Platform revenue, year-over-year, by 13%.  We expect year-over-year revenue comparisons going forward to more directly reflect our growing current book of business, and new prospective customer opportunities.”  Reichbach added, “Our advanced all-in-one video platform provides our customers with the technology they need to quickly monetize and deliver their content with a high-quality and engaging experience for their consumers. We are in a great position to be able to support our core North American and EMEA markets while also targeting high-potential new deal opportunities in the Latin American and Asian markets.” Q1 2017 Operational Highlights  NeuLion partnered with the 23rd Annual Tampa Pro event – the longest-running contest in skateboarding – to launch the 2017 SLS Nike SB World Tour live via ETN, a brand-new platform powered by NeuLion that hosts live and original digital content.NeuLion signed an agreement with FEI TV to redesign their website and mobile user experiences through the new FEI TV app, allowing fans to watch equestrian competition action both live and on replay.NeuLion grew its presence in the NCAA market by building the first official athletic website in Seminole State College of Florida’s history, partnering with the University of New Orleans on a new digital ticketing platform and extending its agreement with the Southern Conference to continue to power their digital network.The NeuLion Digital Platform, which supports all 60 CHL clubs in the Western Hockey League (WHL), the Ontario Hockey League (OHL), and the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL), was selected to power live and on-demand streaming of the Canadian Hockey League playoffs for fans throughout the world.NeuLion delivered a new NBA game download option that allows subscribers to NBA International League Pass, the league’s live games subscription service powered by NeuLion for basketball fans outside of the United States, to download replays of full-length games or condensed games for convenient on-the-go viewing on both iOS and Android.NeuLion enhanced its technology licensed to Sony, Samsung and LG by making available the NeuLion CE SDK Version 9.0, which offers advance playback, mobile-to-TV interactivity, total security and live streaming up to 4K resolutions for Smart TV manufacturers.NeuLion delivered a new digital advertising solution for Univision Communications Inc. (UCI).  UCI’s Television Stations group, which includes 60 owned and operated stations in 19 designated market areas, now uses NeuLion-provided server-side ad insertion for its national and local digital advertising delivery to avoid the threat of ad blockers and provide a better viewer experience with targeted ads during live and on-demand streaming.NeuLion’s MainConcept business licensed its HEVC Decoder to Soliton Systems for its Smart-telecaster Zao Series.  The Smart-telecaster is a small, hand-sized device that can be plugged in to any professional cameras that supports HEVC/H.265 video formats. Q1 2017 Financial Review Total revenue was $23.9 million for the first quarter of 2017 (“Q1 2017”), a decrease of 9% over the prior year period. NeuLion Digital Platform revenues declined 14% to $15.6 million in Q1 2017, from $18.2 million for the prior year period.  NeuLion’s consumer electronics licensing and MainConcept revenue streams were $8.3 million in Q1 2017 compared to $8.9 million in the prior year period. Cost of revenue was $5.0 million, or 21% of revenue, in Q1 2017 compared to $4.7 million, or 18% of revenue, in the prior year period. Selling, general and administrative expenses, including stock-based compensation, were $14.7 million in Q1 2017, increasing 24% from $11.9 million in the prior year period.  Research and development expenses decreased 5% to $4.2 million in Q1 2017, from $4.4 million for the prior comparable period.  Operating loss was $2.4 million in Q1 2017, compared to operating income of $3.4 million in the prior year period.  Net loss was $1.9 million, or a net loss of $0.01 per basic and diluted share in Q1 2017, compared to a net income of $2.1 million, or a net income of $0.01 per basic and diluted share, in the prior year period.  Adjusted EBITDA decreased to $0.9 million in Q1 2017 from $7.0 million for the prior year period due to a decrease of $2.4 million in revenue, an exclusion of $0.9 million in revenue due to purchase price accounting adjustments made as a result of the DivX acquisition, and an increase in operating expenses related to investments in headcount and the expansion of NeuLion’s UK headquarters.  Please refer to the below table for the reconciliation of Consolidated Net (Loss) Income to Adjusted EBITDA. Share Repurchase Program On March 8, 2016, NeuLion announced that its Board of Directors had authorized the repurchase of up to $10 million of its common stock over the next 12 months through a normal course issuer bid (“NCIB”) for up to 14,109,057 shares of common stock.  On March 24, 2016, NeuLion announced that it had received the TSX’s approval to commence the NCIB, and that the NCIB would commence on April 1, 2016.  Under the program, NeuLion has purchased 9,295,104 million shares of common stock at a total cost of $7,690,161 million through March 31, 2017. Of that total, 875,000 shares were purchased at a cost of $588,147 on NeuLion’s behalf in March 2017 and subsequently settled and cancelled in April 2017.  The NCIB terminated by its terms on March 31, 2017. Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information In addition to NeuLion’s U.S. GAAP results, this press release also includes disclosure of certain non-GAAP financial measures, as such term is used by the Securities and Exchange Commission.  NeuLion defines “Adjusted EBITDA” as consolidated net income (loss) before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, purchase accounting adjustments, stock-based compensation, acquisition-related expenses, gain on revaluation of convertible note derivative and foreign exchange gain (loss).  Adjusted EBITDA is a key measure used by management to evaluate NeuLion’s results and make strategic decisions about the company, including potential acquisitions.  Management believes this measure is useful to investors because it is an indicator of operational performance.  Because not all companies use identical calculations, NeuLion’s presentation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.  These measures do not have any standardized meanings prescribed by U.S. GAAP and therefore are unlikely to be comparable to the calculation of similar measures used by other companies, and should not be viewed as alternatives to measures of financial performance or changes in cash flows calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, NeuLion has provided a reconciliation of U.S. GAAP Consolidated Net (Loss) Income to Adjusted EBITDA in the below tables.     Reconciliation of GAAP Net (Loss) Income to Adjusted EBITDA (in thousands):      Three months ended March 31,   2017  2016    GAAP Net (Loss) Income$  (1,886)$  2,082    Revenue excluded due to purchase accounting 17  866 Depreciation and amortization    2,410    1,974 Stock-based compensation    875    754 Income tax (benefit) expense   (443)   1,651 Other income   (52)   (327)   Adjusted EBITDA $  921 $  7,000     Quarterly Webcast NeuLion will host a live webcast tomorrow, May 10, 2017 at 8:00 a.m. ET that can be accessed at http://edge.media-server.com/m/p/x2dbwogu.
