Insured Income Trust, Series 157

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Insured Income Trust, Series 157 invests in a portfolio of long-term bonds.
The Trust seeks to provide a high level of current income and to preserve       
capital. The Trust is a unit investment trust included in Van Kampen Unit       
Trusts, Taxable Income Series 120.

                                Distributions            Distributions
                               -------------            ------------
Estimated Current Return:          5.27%                    5.31%   
Estimated Long Term Return:        5.02%                    5.06%   
CUSIP:                          92116E-82-6 92116E-81-8

Estimated current return shows the estimated cash you should receive each 
year divided by the Unit price. Estimated long term return shows the estimated  
return over the estimated life of your Trust. These estimates are as of the     
opening of business on the Date of Deposit and will vary thereafter. We base    
this estimate on an average of the bond yields over their estimated life. This  
estimate also reflects the sales charge and estimated expenses. We derive the   
average yield for your portfolio by weighting each bond's yield by its value and
estimated life. Unlike estimated current return, estimated long term return     
accounts for maturities, discounts and premiums of the bonds. These estimates   
show a comparison rather than a prediction of returns. No return calculation can
predict your actual return. Your actual return may vary from these estimates.

Van Kampen
Investments                                                                     

Investment Objective. The Trust seeks to provide a high level of current  
income and to preserve capital.                                                 

Principal Investment Strategy. The Trust invests in a portfolio of long-term
bonds. Insurance guaranteeing the timely payment, when due, of all principal and
interest on the bonds in the Trust has been obtained from a bond insurance      
company. In selecting bonds for the Trust, the Sponsor considered the following 
factors, among others:                                                          

   o    the bonds must have a Standard & Poor's rating of "AAA" or a Moody's
Investors Service, Inc. rating of "Aaa";                    

    o    the prices of the bonds relative to other bonds of comparable quality
and maturity;                                               

o    the current income provided by the bonds;                        

  o    the diversification of bonds as to purpose of issue and location of
issuer; and                                                 

  o    the probability of early return of principal or high legal or event
risk.                                                       

The portfolio generally consists of bonds maturing approximately 15 to 40 
years from the Date of Deposit.                                                 

Principal Risks. As with all investments, you can lose money by investing in
the Trust. The Trust also might not perform as well as you expect. This can     
happen for reasons such as these:                                               

     o    Bond prices will fluctuate. The value of your investment may fall over
time.                                                       

o    The value of the bonds will generally fall if interest rates, in 
         general, rise. No one can predict whether interest rates will rise or
fall in the future.                                         

o    A bond issuer or insurer may be unable to make interest and/or   
principal payment in the future.                            

    o    The financial condition of an issuer may worsen or its credit ratings
       may drop, resulting in a reduction in the value of your Units. This
         may occur at any point in time, including during the primary offering
period.                                                     

o    A bond issuer might prepay or "call" a bond before its stated    
         maturity. If this happens, the Trust will distribute the principal to
        you but future interest distributions will fall. A bond's call price
       could be less than the price the Trust paid for the bond. If enough
      bonds are called, the Trust could terminate earlier than expected.

   o     The Trust may concentrate in bonds of a particular type of issuer. This
     makes the Trust less diversified and subject to greater risk than a
    more diversified portfolio. The types of bond in the portfolio are
listed under "Portfolio Diversification" on the next page.    

     o    The Trust is considered to be concentrated in bonds of issuers located
 in California. These issuers make up approximately 34% of the
        principal amount of the bonds. The financial condition of California
   is affected by various national and local, economic, social and
       environmental policies and conditions and may have an effect on the
value of Units.                                             

o    We do not actively manage the portfolio. Except in limited       
        circumstances, the Trust will hold the same bonds even if the market
value declines.

(1) Some bonds may mature or be called or sold during your Trust's life. This   
    could include a call or sale at a price below par value. We cannot guarantee
 that the value of your Units will equal the principal amount of bonds per
Unit when you redeem them or when your Trust terminates.                

(2) After the first settlement date (November 9, 2007), you will pay accrued    
    interest from this date to your settlement date less interest distributions.

(3) We base this amount on estimated cash flows per Unit. This amount will vary 
with changes in expenses, interest rates and maturity, call or sale of  
bonds. The Information Supplement includes the estimated cash flows.    

(4) This shows estimated expenses in the first year other than insurance        
expenses. Estimated expenses are expected to fluctuate periodically.    

(5) Your Trust assesses this fee per $1,000 principal amount of bonds. Your     
Trust assesses other fees per Unit.                                     

(6)  During the first year the Trustee will reduce its fee by approximately $.08
per Unit (which is the estimated interest to be earned prior to the   
expected delivery dates for the "when, as and if issued" or "delayed  
    delivery" bonds). Should the interest exceed this amount, the Trustee will
  reduce its fee up to its annual fee. After the first year, the Trustee's
fee will be the amount indicated above. Estimated interest income will
 increase to $55.11. Estimated expenses will increase to $2.67 and $2.24
under the monthly and semi-annual distribution plans, respectively.   
Estimated net interest income will remain as shown.

Notes to Portfolio                                                              

(1) The bonds are represented by "regular way" or "when issued" contracts for   
  the performance of which an irrevocable letter of credit, obtained from an
   affiliate of the Trustee, has been deposited with the Trustee. Contracts to
   acquire the bonds were entered into during the period from October 10, 2007
to November 5, 2007.                                                    

(2) Other information regarding the bonds is as follows:

  ---------------      ---------------
$    7,054,549        $     69,632    

  The breakdown of the preinsured bond insurers is as follows: AMBAC Assurance
22%, Financial Guaranty 8%, MBIA 39%, FSA 4% and XL Capital Assurance 27%.      

The Sponsor may have entered into contracts which hedge interest rate     
fluctuations on certain bonds. The cost of any such contracts and the           
corresponding gain or loss as of the evaluation time of the bonds is included in
the Cost to Sponsor. Bonds marked by "##" following the maturity date have been 
purchased on a "when, as and if issued" or "delayed delivery" basis. Interest on
these bonds begins accruing to the benefit of Unitholders on their respective   
dates of delivery. Delivery is expected to take place at various dates after the
first settlement date.                                                          

"#" prior to the coupon rate indicates that the bond was issued at an     
original issue discount. See "The Trusts--Risk Factors" in Prospectus Part II.  
The tax effect of bonds issued at an original issue discount is described in    
"Federal Tax Status" in Prospectus Part II.                                     

(3) All ratings are by Standard & Poor's unless otherwise indicated. "*"        
   indicates that the rating of the bond is by Moody's. "o" indicates that the
rating is contingent upon receipt by the rating agency of a policy of   
insurance obtained by the issuer of the bonds. "NR" indicates that the  
rating service did not provide a rating for that bond. For a brief      
  description of the ratings see "Description of Ratings" in the Information
Supplement.                                                             

(4) This is the year in which each bond is initially or currently callable and  
the call price for that year. Each bond continues to be callable at     
 declining prices thereafter (but not below par value) except for original
    issue discount bonds which are redeemable at prices based on the issue price
    plus the amount of original issue discount accreted to redemption date plus,
   if applicable, some premium, the amount of which will decline in subsequent
years. "S.F." indicates a sinking fund is established with respect to an
   issue of bonds. The bonds may also be subject to redemption without premium
  at any time pursuant to extraordinary optional or mandatory redemptions if
   certain events occur. See "The Trusts--Risk Factors" in Prospectus Part II.

Tax Status. The Trust intends to qualify as a "regulated investment company"
under the Federal tax laws. For a discussion of the Federal tax status of income
earned on Units, see "Federal Tax Status--Regulated Investment Companies" in    
Prospectus Part II.                                                             

Underwriting. The Underwriters named below have purchased Units in the    
following amounts from the Sponsor, the sole and exclusive principal            
underwriter. See "Public Offering--Sponsor and Underwriter Compensation" in     
Prospectus Part II.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Unitholders of Insured Income Trust, Series 157 (included in Van   
Kampen Unit Trusts, Taxable Income Series 120):                                 

We have audited the accompanying statement of condition including the     
portfolio of Insured Income Trust, Series 157 (included in Van Kampen Unit      
Trusts, Taxable Income Series 120) as of November 6, 2007. The statement of     
condition is the responsibility of the Sponsor. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on such statement of condition based on our audit.                   

   We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the statement
of condition is free of material misstatement. The Trust is not required to     
have, nor were we engaged to perform an audit of its internal control over      
financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over  
financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are          
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an      
opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust's internal control over financial     
reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes      
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in  
the statement of condition, assessing the accounting principles used and        
significant estimates made by the Sponsor, as well as evaluating the overall    
statement of condition presentation. Our procedures included confirmation with  
The Bank of New York, Trustee, of cash or an irrevocable letter of credit       
deposited for the purchase of securities as shown in the statement of condition 
as of November 6, 2007. We believe that our audit of the statement of condition 
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.                                    

   In our opinion, the statement of condition referred to above presents fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of Insured Income Trust, Series
157 (included in Van Kampen Unit Trusts, Taxable Income Series 120) as of       
November 6, 2007, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America.

THE TRUSTS 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

General. Your Trust was created under the laws of the State of New York   
pursuant to a Trust Indenture and Agreement (the "Trust Agreement"), dated the  
date of this prospectus (the "Date of Deposit") among Van Kampen Funds Inc., as 
Sponsor, Standard & Poor's Securities Evaluations, Inc., as Evaluator, Van      
Kampen Asset Management, as Supervisor, and The Bank of New York, as Trustee.   

Your Trust may be an appropriate medium for investors who desire to       
participate in a portfolio of taxable bonds with greater diversification than   
they might be able to acquire individually. Diversification of a Trust's assets 
will not eliminate the risk of loss always inherent in the ownership of bonds.  
For a breakdown of your Trust's portfolio, see "Portfolio" in Prospectus Part I.
In addition, bonds of the type initially deposited in the portfolio of a Trust  
are often not available in small amounts and may, in the case of any privately  
placed bonds, be available only to institutional investors.                     

  On the Date of Deposit, the Sponsor deposited with the Trustee the aggregate
principal amount of bonds indicated in the "Summary of Essential Financial
Information" in Prospectus Part I. The bonds initially consist of delivery      
statements relating to contracts for their purchase and cash, cash equivalents  
and/or irrevocable letters of credit issued by a financial institution.         
Thereafter, the Trustee, in exchange for the bonds, delivered to the Sponsor    
evidence of ownership of the number of Units indicated under "Summary of
Essential Financial Information" in Prospectus Part I. A Trust that holds       
primarily long-term bonds, as described on the cover of Prospectus Part I, is   
referred to herein as a "Long-Term Trust". A Trust that holds primarily         
intermediate-term bonds, as described on the cover of Prospectus Part I, is     
referred to herein as an "Intermediate-Term Trust". A Trust that holds a        
portfolio of bonds with "laddered" maturities, as described on the cover of     
Prospectus Part I, is referred to herein as a Trust". Trusts that hold only     
insured bonds are referred to herein as "Insured Trusts". Unless otherwise      
terminated as provided herein, the Trust Agreement will terminate at the end of 
the calender year prior to the fiftieth anniversary of its execution in the case
of a Long-Term Trust and at the end of the calender year prior to the twentieth 
anniversary of its execution in the case of an Intermediate-Term Trust.         

   Each Unit initially offered represents a fractional undivided interest in the
principal and net income of the Trust. To the extent that any Units are redeemed
by the Trustee, the fractional undivided interest in the Trust represented by   
each Unit will increase, although the actual interest in the Trust will remain  
unchanged. Units will remain outstanding until redeemed by Unitholders or until 
the termination of the Trust Agreement.                                         

Objective and Bond Selection. The objective of a Long-Term Trust is to    
provide a high level of current income and to preserve capital by investing in a
portfolio primarily consisting of long-term bonds. The objective of an          
Intermediate-Term Trust is to provide a high level of current income and to     
preserve capital by investing in a portfolio primarily consisting of            
intermediate-term bonds. The objective of a Laddered Trust is to provide a high 
level of current income and to preserve capital by investing in a portfolio     
consisting of bonds with laddered maturities of approximately 10, 15, 20, 25 and
30 years from the Date of Deposit. There is, of course, no guarantee that a     
Trust will achieve its objective. Your Trust may be an appropriate investment   
vehicle for investors who desire to participate in a portfolio of fixed income  
bonds with greater diversification than they might be able to acquire           
individually.                                                                   

In selecting bonds for each Trust, the Sponsor considered the following   
factors, among others: (a) with respect to Insured Trusts, the bonds must have a
Standard & Poor's rating of AAA or a Moody's Investor Service, Inc. ("Moody's") 
rating of Aaa and with respect to all other trusts, the bonds must have a       
Standard & Poor's rating of at least "BBB-", a Moody's rating of at least "Baa3"
or, if not rated, credit characteristics sufficiently similar to those of       
comparable bonds that were so rated as to be acceptable for acquisition by a    
Trust in the opinion of the Sponsor, (b) the prices of the bonds relative to    
other bonds of comparable quality and maturity, (c) the current income provided 
by the bonds; (d) the diversification of bonds as to purpose of issue and       
location of issuer; (e) the probability of early return of principal or high    
legal or event risk. After the Date of Deposit, a bond may cease to be rated or 
its rating may be reduced below the minimum required as of the Date of Deposit. 
Neither event requires elimination of a bond from a Trust but may be considered 
in the Sponsor's determination as to whether or not to direct the Trustee to    
dispose of the bond (see "Trust Administration--Portfolio Administration"). In  
particular, the ratings of the bonds in a Long-Term Investment Grade Trust or an
Investment Grade Trust could fall below "investment grade" (i.e., below "BBB-"  
or "Baa3") during the Trust's life and the Trust could continue to hold the     
bonds. See "The Trusts--Risk Factors".                                          

Insurance guaranteeing the timely payment, when due, of all principal and 
interest on the bonds in an Insured Trust has been obtained from a bond         
insurance company. For information relating to insurance on the bonds, see      
"Insurance on the Bonds in an Insured Trust". Neither the Public Offering Price 
nor any evaluation of Units for purposes of repurchases or redemptions reflects 
any element of value for the insurance obtained by an Insured Trust unless bonds
are in default in payment of principal or interest or in significant risk of    
such default. See "Public Offering--Unit Price".                                

In order for bonds to be eligible for insurance, they must have credit    
characteristics which would qualify them for at least the Standard & Poor's     
rating of "BBB-" or at least the Moody's Investors Service, Inc. rating of      
"Baa3", which in brief represent the lowest ratings for securities of investment
grade (see "Description of Ratings" in the Information Supplement). Insurance is
not a substitute for the basic credit of an issuer, but supplements the existing
credit and provides additional security. If an issue is accepted for insurance, 
a non-cancelable policy for the prompt payment of interest and principal on the 
bonds, when due, is issued by the insurer. A monthly premium is paid by a Trust 
for the insurance obtained by it. The Trustee has the right to obtain permanent 
insurance from a Portfolio Insurer in connection with the sale of a bond insured
under the insurance policy obtained from the respective Portfolio Insurer by an 
Insured Trust upon the payment of a single predetermined insurance premium from 
the proceeds of the sale of such bond. Accordingly, any bond in an Insured Trust
is eligible to be sold on an insured basis. All bonds insured by a Portfolio    
Insurer or by a Preinsured Bond Insurer receive a "AAA" rating by Standard &    
Poor's. Standard & Poor's describes securities it rates "AAA" as having "the    
highest rating assigned by Standard & Poor's to a debt obligation. Capacity to  
pay interest and repay principal is extremely strong." See "Insurance on the
Bonds in an Insured Trust".                                                     

Risk Factors. All investments involve risk. This section describes the main
risks that can impact the value of bonds in your Trust. You should understand   
these risks before you invest. If the value of the bonds falls, the value of    
your Units will also fall. You can lose money by investing in a Trust. No one   
can guarantee that your Trust will achieve its objective or that your investment
return will be positive over any period. The Information Supplement, which is   
available upon request, contains a more detailed discussion of risks related to 
your investment.                                                                

Market risk is the risk that the value of the bonds in your Trust will    
fluctuate. This could cause the value of your Units to fall below your original 
purchase price or below the par value. Market value fluctuates in response to   
various factors. These can include changes in interest rates, inflation, the    
financial condition of a bond's issuer or insurer, perceptions of the issuer or 
insurer, or ratings on a bond. Even though the Supervisor supervises your       
portfolio, you should remember that no one manages your portfolio. Your Trust   
will not sell a bond solely because the market value falls as is possible in a  
managed fund.                                                                   

  Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of bonds will fall if interest
rates increase. Bonds typically fall in value when interest rates rise and rise 
in value when interest rates fall. Bonds with longer periods before maturity are
often more sensitive to interest rate changes.                                  

   Credit risk is the risk that a bond's issuer or insurer is unable to meet its
obligation to pay principal or interest on the bond.                            

Call risk is the risk that the issuer prepays or "calls" a bond before its
stated maturity. An issuer might call a bond if interest rates fall and the bond
pays a higher interest rate or if it no longer needs the money for the original 
purpose. If an issuer calls a bond, your Trust will distribute the principal to 
you but your future interest distributions will fall. You might not be able to  
reinvest this principal at as high a yield. A bond's call price could be less   
than the price your Trust paid for the bond and could be below the bond's par   
value. This means that you could receive less than the amount you paid for your 
Units. If enough bonds in your Trust are called, your Trust could terminate     
early. Some or all of the bonds may also be subject to extraordinary optional or
mandatory redemptions if certain events occur, such as certain changes in tax   
laws, the substantial damage or destruction by fire or other casualty of the    
project for which the proceeds of the bonds were used, and various other events.
The call provisions are described in general terms in Prospectus Part I.        
Additional discussion of call provisions appears in the Information Supplement. 

Bond quality risk is the risk that a bond will fall in value if a rating  
agency decreases the bond's rating. Bond concentration risk is the risk that    
your Trust is less diversified because it concentrates in a particular type of  
bond. When a certain type of bond makes up 25% or more of a Trust, the Trust is 
considered to be "concentrated" in that bond type. The different bond types are 
described in the following sections.                                            

  Reduced diversification risk is the risk that your Trust will become smaller
and less diversified as bonds are sold, are called or mature. This could        
increase your risk of loss and increase your share of Trust expenses.           

 Liquidity risk is the risk that the value of a bond will fall if trading in
the bond is limited or absent. No one can guarantee that a liquid trading market
will exist for any bond because these bonds generally trade in the              
over-the-counter market (they are not listed on a securities exchange).         

Litigation and legislation risk is the risk that future litigation or     
legislation could affect the value of your Trust. Litigation could challenge an 
issuer's authority to issue or make payments on bonds.                          

 Taxable Municipal Bonds. Your Trust may invest significantly or exclusively
in taxable municipal bonds. States, municipalities and public authorities issue 
these bonds to raise money for a variety of purposes. In selecting bonds, the   
Sponsor seeks to diversify your portfolio by bond purpose. This section briefly 
describes different bond types to help you better understand your investment.   
The types of bonds in your portfolio are listed in Prospectus Part I. These     
bonds are also described in greater detail in the Information Supplement.       

General obligation bonds are backed by the general taxing power of the    
issuer. The issuer secures these bonds by pledging its faith, credit and        
unlimited taxing power for the payment of principal and interest.               

Revenue bonds are payable only from the revenue of a specific project or  
authority. They are not supported by the issuer's general power to levy taxes.  
The risk of default in payment of interest or principal increases if the income 
of the related project falters because that income is the only source of        
payment. All of the following bonds are revenue bonds.                          

 Airport bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate airports. The
ability of the issuer to make payments on these bonds primarily depends on the  
ability of airlines to meet their obligations under use agreements. Due to      
increased competition, deregulation, increased fuel costs and other factors,    
some airlines may have difficulty meeting these obligations.                    

 Bond banks are vehicles that pool various municipal obligations into larger
offerings. This reduces the cost of borrowing for the municipalities. The types 
of financing projects that these obligations support vary.                      

Certificates of participation are generally a type of municipal lease     
obligation. Lease payments of a governmental entity secure payments on these    
bonds. These payments depend on the governmental entity budgeting appropriations
for the lease payments. A governmental body cannot obligate future governments  
to appropriate for or make lease payments, but governments typically promise to 
take action necessary to include lease payments in their budgets. If a          
government fails to budget for or make lease payments, sufficient funds may not 
exist to pay interest or principal on these bonds.                              

Health care bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenue from     
hospitals and hospital systems. The ability of these issuers to make payments on
bonds depends on factors such as facility occupancy levels, demand for services,
competition resulting from hospital mergers and affiliations, the need to reduce
costs, government regulation, costs of malpractice insurance and claims, and    
government financial assistance (such as Medicare and Medicaid).                

 Higher education bonds are obligations of issuers that operate universities
and colleges. These issuers derive revenues from tuition, dormitories, grants   
and endowments. These issuers face problems related to declines in the number of
college-age individuals, possible inability to raise tuitions and fees,         
uncertainty of continued federal grants, state funding or donations, and        
government legislation or regulation.                                           

   Industrial revenue bonds finance the cost of acquiring, building or improving
industrial projects. Private corporations usually operate these projects. The   
ability of the issuer to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as
the creditworthiness of the corporation operating the project, revenues         
generated by the project, expenses of the project and environmental or other    
regulatory restrictions.                                                        

Multi-family housing bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues
from mortgage loans on multiple family residences, retirement housing or housing
projects for low to moderate-income families. These bonds are generally         
pre-payable at any time. It is likely that their life will be less than their   
stated maturity. The ability of these issuers to make payments on bonds depends 
on such factors as rental income, occupancy levels, operating expenses, mortgage
default rates, taxes, government regulations and appropriation of subsidies.    

Other care bonds include obligations of issuers that derive revenue from  
mental health facilities, nursing homes and intermediate care facilities. These 
bonds are similar to health care bonds and the issuers face the same general    
risks.                                                                          

Public building bonds finance the cost of acquiring, leasing, building or 
improving public buildings such as offices, recreation facilities, convention   
centers, police stations, correctional institutions and parking garages. The    
ability of the issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such  
as the government budgeting sufficient funds to make lease or mortgage payments 
on the facility, user fees or rents, costs of maintenance and decreases in use  
of the facility.                                                                

Public education bonds are obligations of issuers that operate primary and
secondary schools. The ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds 
depends primarily on ad valorem taxes. These issuers may also face problems     
related to litigation contesting state constitutionality of public education    
financing.                                                                      

Retail electric/gas/telephone bonds are obligations of issuers that derive
revenues from the retail sale of utilities to customers. The ability of these   
issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the rates and
demand for these utilities, competition, government regulation and rate         
approvals, overhead expenses and the cost of fuels.                             

 Single family housing bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues
from mortgage loans on single family residences. Single family residences       
generally include one to four-family dwellings. These bonds are similar to      
multi-family housing bonds and the issuers face the same general risks.         

 Tax district bonds are obligations secured by a pledge of taxing power by a
municipality, such as tax increment financing or tax allocation bonds. These    
bonds are similar to general obligation bonds. Unlike general obligation bonds, 
however, the municipality does not pledge its unlimited taxing power to pay     
these bonds. Instead, the municipality pledges revenues from a specific tax to  
pay these bonds. If the tax cannot support payment of interest and principal, a 
municipality may need to raise the related tax to pay these bonds. An inability 
to raise the tax could have an adverse affect on these bonds.                   

 Transportation bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate public
transit systems, ports, highways, turnpikes, bridges and other transportation   
systems. The ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on
variations in use, the degree of government subsidization, competition from     
other forms of transportation and increased costs. Port authorities derive      
revenues primarily from fees imposed on ships using the port facilities. These  
fees can fluctuate depending on the local economy and competition from air, rail
and truck transportation. Increased fuel costs, alternative transportation modes
and competition from toll-free bridges and roads will impact revenues of issuers
that operate bridges, roads or tunnels.                                         

Waste disposal bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from 
resource recovery facilities. These facilities process solid waste, generate    
steam and convert steam to electricity. These issuers face problems such as     
costs and delays due to environmental concerns, effects of conservation and     
recycling, destruction or condemnation of a project, void or unenforceable      
contracts, changes in the economic availability of raw materials, operating     
supplies or facilities, and other unavoidable changes that adversely affect     
operation of a project.                                                         

Water and sewer bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from
user fees from the sale of water and sewerage services. These issuers face      
problems such as the ability to obtain rate increases, population declines,     
difficulties in obtaining new fresh water supplies and "no-growth" zoning       
ordinances. These issuers also face many of the same problems of waste disposal 
issuers.                                                                        

   Wholesale electric bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from
selling electricity to other utilities. The ability of these issuers to make    
payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the rates and demand for     
electric utilities, competition, overhead expenses and government regulation and
rate approvals.                                                                 

 Consumer Product and Retail Issuers. Your Trust may invest significantly in
companies that manufacture or sell various consumer products. General risks of  
these companies include the general state of the economy, intense competition   
and consumer spending trends. A decline in the economy which results in a       
reduction of consumers' disposable income can negatively impact spending habits.
Competitiveness in the retail industry will require large capital outlays for   
the installation of automated checkout equipment to control inventory, track the
sale of items and gauge the success of sales campaigns. Retailers who sell their
products over the Internet have the potential to access more consumers, but will
require sophisticated technology to remain competitive.                         

Financial Services Companies. Your Trust may invest significantly in bonds
issued by financial services companies. Any negative impact on this industry    
will have a greater impact on the value of Units than on a portfolio diversified
over several industries. You should understand the risks of this industry before
you invest. Banks and their holding companies are especially subject to the     
adverse effects of economic recession; volatile interest rates; portfolio       
concentrations in geographic markets and in commercial and residential real     
estate loans; and competition from new entrants in their fields of business. In 
addition, banks and their holding companies are extensively regulated at both   
the federal and state level and may be adversely affected by increased          
regulations.                                                                    

  Banks will face increased competition from nontraditional lending sources as
regulatory changes, such as the recently enacted Gramm-Leach-Bliley financial   
services overhaul legislation, permit new entrants to offer various financial   
products. Technological advances such as the Internet allow these nontraditional
lending sources to cut overhead and permit the more efficient use of customer   
data. Banks are already facing tremendous pressure from mutual funds, brokerage 
firms and other financial service providers in the competition to furnish       
services that were traditionally offered by banks.                              

 Companies engaged in investment management and broker-dealer activities are
subject to volatility in their earnings and share prices that often exceeds the 
volatility of the securities markets in general. Adverse changes in the         
direction of the securities markets, investor confidence, equity transaction    
volume, the level and direction of interest rates and the outlook of emerging   
markets could adversely affect the financial stability of these companies.      
Additionally, competitive pressures, including increased competition with new   
and existing competitors, the ongoing commoditization of traditional businesses 
and the need for increased capital expenditures on new technology could         
adversely impact the profit margins of companies in the investment management   
and brokerage industries. Companies involved in investment management and       
broker-dealer activities are also subject to extensive regulation by government 
agencies and self-regulatory organizations, and changes in laws, regulations or 
rules, or in the interpretation of such laws, regulations and rules could       
adversely affect such companies.                                                

   Companies involved in the insurance, reinsurance and risk management industry
underwrite, sell or distribute property, casualty and business insurance. Many  
factors affect insurance, reinsurance and risk management company profits,      
including interest rate movements, the imposition of premium rate caps, a       
misapprehension of the risks involved in given underwritings, competition and   
pressure to compete globally, weather catastrophes or other disasters and the   
effects of client mergers. Already extensively regulated, insurance companies'  
profits may be adversely affected by increased government regulations or tax law
changes.                                                                        

Telecommunications Companies. Your Trust may invest significantly in bonds
issued by telecommunications companies. These companies are subject to          
substantial governmental regulation. For example, the United States government  
and state governments regulate permitted rates of return and the kinds of       
services that a company may offer. This industry has experienced substantial    
deregulation in recent years. Deregulation may lead to fierce competition for   
market share and can have a negative impact on certain companies. Recent federal
legislation governing the United States telecommunications industry remains     
subject to judicial review and additional interpretation, which may adversely   
affect the companies whose securities are held by your Trust. Competitive       
pressures are intense and telecommunications stocks can experience rapid        
volatility. Certain telecommunications products may become outdated very        
rapidly. A company's performance can be hurt if the company fails to keep pace  
with technological advances.                                                    

Several recent high-profile bankruptcies of large telecommunications      
companies have illustrated the potentially unstable condition of                
telecommunications companies. High debt loads that were accumulated during the  
industry growth spurt of the 1990s are catching up to the industry, causing debt
and stock prices to trade at distressed levels for many telecommunications      
companies and increasing the cost of capital for needed additional investment.  
At the same time, demand for some telecommunications services has fallen        
sharply, as several key markets have become oversaturated, some local customers 
have switched to substitute providers and technologies, and corporate profits   
and the economy generally remain weak. To meet increasing competition, companies
may have to commit substantial capital, particularly in the formulation of new  
products and services using new technologies. As a result, many companies have  
been compelled to cut costs by reducing their workforce, outsourcing,           
consolidating and/or closing existing facilities and divesting low selling      
product lines. Furthermore, certain companies involved in the industry have also
faced scrutiny for alleged accounting irregularities that may have led to the   
overstatement of their financial results, and other companies in the industry   
may face similar scrutiny. Due to these and other factors, the risk level of    
owning the securities of telecommunications companies has increased             
substantially and may continue to rise.                                         

Certain smaller companies in the portfolio may involve greater risk than  
larger, established issuers. Smaller companies may have limited product lines,  
markets or financial resources. Their securities may trade in lower volumes than
larger companies. As a result, the prices of these securities may fluctuate more
than the prices of other issuers.                                               

More About the Bonds. In addition to describing the purpose of the bonds, 
other information about the bonds is also listed in the "Portfolio" in          
Prospectus Part I. This information relates to other characteristics of the     
bonds. This section briefly describes some of these characteristics.            

Original issue discount bonds were initially issued at a price below their
face (or par) value. These bonds typically pay a lower interest rate than       
comparable bonds that were issued at or above their par value. In a stable      
interest rate environment, the market value of these bonds tends to increase    
more slowly in early years and in greater increments as the bonds approach      
maturity. The issuers of these bonds may be able to call or redeem a bond before
its stated maturity date and at a price less than the bond's par value.         

  Zero coupon bonds are a type of original issue discount bond. These bonds do
not pay any current interest during their life. If an investor owns this type of
bond, the investor has the right to receive a final payment of the bond's par   
value at maturity. The price of these bonds often fluctuates greatly during     
periods of changing market interest rates compared to bonds that make current   
interest payments. The issuers of these bonds may be able to call or redeem a   
bond before its stated maturity date and at a price less than the bond's par    
value.                                                                          

  "When, as and if issued" bonds are bonds that trade before they are actually
issued. This means that the Sponsor can only deliver them to your Trust "when,  
as and if" the bonds are actually issued. Delivery of these bonds may be delayed
or may not occur. Interest on these bonds does not begin accruing to your Trust 
until the Sponsor delivers the bond to the Trust. You may have to adjust your   
tax basis if the Sponsor delivers any of these bonds after the expected delivery
date. Any adjustment would reflect interest that accrued between the time you   
purchased your Units and the delivery of the bonds to your Trust. This could    
lower your first year estimated current return. You may experience gains or     
losses on these bonds from the time you purchase Units even though your Trust   
has not yet received them.                                                      

 No FDIC Guarantee. An investment in your Trust is not a deposit of any bank
and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or
any other government agency.                                                    

ESTIMATED CURRENT                                                               
AND LONG-TERM RETURNS 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The Estimated Current Returns and the Estimated Long-Term Returns as of the
Date of Deposit are set forth on the cover of Prospectus Part I. Estimated      
Current Return is calculated by dividing the estimated net annual interest      
income per Unit by the Public Offering Price. The estimated net annual interest 
income per Unit will vary with changes in fees and expenses of your Trust and   
with the principal prepayment, redemption, maturity, exchange or sale of bonds. 
The Public Offering Price will vary with changes in the price of the bonds.     
Accordingly, there is no assurance that the present Estimated Current Return    
will be realized in the future. Estimated Long-Term Return is calculated using a
formula which (1) takes into consideration, and determines and factors in the   
relative weightings of, the market values, yields (which takes into account the 
amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated          
retirements of the bonds and (2) takes into account the expenses and sales      
charge associated with Units. Since the value and estimated retirements of the  
bonds and the expenses of your Trust will change, there is no assurance that the
present Estimated Long-Term Return will be realized in the future. The Estimated
Current Return and Estimated Long-Term Return are expected to differ because the
calculation of Estimated Long-Term Return reflects the estimated date and amount
of principal returned while the Estimated Current Return calculation includes   
only net annual interest income and Public Offering Price.                      

In order to acquire certain bonds, it may be necessary for the Sponsor or 
Trustee to pay amounts covering accrued interest on the bonds which exceed the  
amounts which will be made available through cash furnished by the Sponsor on   
the Date of Deposit. This cash may exceed the interest which would accrue to the
First Settlement Date. The Trustee has agreed to pay for any amounts necessary  
to cover any excess and will be reimbursed when funds become available from     
interest payments on the related bonds.                                         

PUBLIC OFFERING 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

General. Units are offered at the Public Offering Price. During the initial
offering period the Public Offering Price is based on the aggregate offering    
price of the bonds, the sales charge described below, cash, if any, in the      
Principal Account and accrued interest, if any. The sales charge for an         
Intermediate-Term Trust is equal to 3.0% of the public offering price per Unit  
(3.093% of the aggregate offering price of the bonds), the sales charge for a   
Laddered Trust is equal to 3.90% of the public offering price per Unit (4.058%  
of the aggregate offering price of the bonds) and the sales charge for a        
Long-Term Trust is equal to 4.9% of the public offering price per Unit (5.152%  
of the aggregate offering price of the bonds). After the initial public offering
period, the secondary market public offering price is based on the bid prices of
the bonds, the sales charge described below, cash, if any, in the Principal     
Account and accrued interest, if any. The actual sales charge that may be paid  
by an investor may differ slightly from the sales charges shown herein due to   
rounding that occurs in the calculation of the Public Offering Price and in the 
number of Units purchased. The minimum purchase in the primary and secondary    
market is one Unit. Certain broker-dealers or selling firms may charge an order 
handling fee for processing Unit purchases.                                     

 The secondary market sales charge is computed as described in the following
table based upon the estimated long-term return life ("ELTR Life") of your      
Trust's portfolio:

The ELTR Life represents the estimated life of the bonds in a Trust's     
portfolio as determined for purposes of calculating Estimated Long-Term Return. 
See "Estimated Current and Long-Term Returns". The sales charges in the above   
table are expressed as a percentage of the aggregate bid prices of the bonds.   

 Reducing Your Sales Charge. The Sponsor offers a variety of ways for you to
reduce the sales charge that you pay. It is your financial professional's       
responsibility to alert the Sponsor of any discount when you purchase Units.    
Before you purchase Units you must also inform your broker-dealer of your       
qualification for any discount or of any combined purchases to be eligible for a
reduced sales charge.                                                           

  Large Quantity Purchases. You can reduce your sales charge by increasing the
size of your investment. If you purchase the amount of Units shown in the table 
below during the initial offering period, your sales charge will be as follows: 

  Sales Reduction per Unit
  ----------------------------------
Aggregate                Intermediate-Term                                      
Number of                  and Laddered        Long-Term                        
Units Purchased               Trusts            Trusts                          
-----------------          ------------      ------------                       
100-249 Units              $        4.00    $        4.00                       
250-499 Units                       6.00             6.00                       
500-999 Units                       9.00            14.00                       
1,000 or more Units                11.00            19.00                       

Except as described below, these quantity discount levels apply only to   
purchases of a single Trust made by the same person on a single day from a      
single broker-dealer. We apply these sales charges as a percent of the Public   
Offering Price per Unit at the time of purchase. We also apply the different    
purchase levels on a dollar basis using a $1,000 Unit equivalent. For example,  
if you purchase between $250,000 and $499,999, your sales charge discount per   
Unit for a Long-Term Trust will be $6.                                          

  Aggregated Purchases--For purposes of achieving these levels you may combine
purchases of Units of a Trust offered in this prospectus with purchases of units
of any other Van Kampen-sponsored unit investment trust in the initial offering 
period (including other Trusts offered in this prospectus). In addition, Units  
purchased in the name of your spouse or children under 21 living in the same    
household as you will be deemed to be additional purchases by you for the       
purposes of calculating the applicable quantity discount level. The reduced     
sales charge levels will also be applicable to a trustee or other fiduciary     
purchasing Units for a single trust, estate (including multiple trusts created  
under a single estate) or fiduciary account. To be eligible for aggregation as  
described in this paragraph, all purchases must be made on the same day through 
a single broker-dealer or selling agent. You must inform your broker-dealer of  
any combined purchases before your purchase to be eligible for a reduced sales  
charge.                                                                         

Letter of Intent--For purposes of calculating the reduced sales charge for
quantity purchases in the table above, purchasers who have entered into a letter
of intent with the Sponsor prior to February 20, 2007 to purchase a specified   
amount of Units of Van Kampen Unit Trusts, Taxable Income Series or Van Kampen  
Unit Trusts, Municipal Series unit investment trusts during the initial offering
period will be eligible to receive a reduced sales charge according to the      
quantity discount table above based on the amount of intended aggregate         
purchases as expressed in the letter of intent. New letters of intent are no    
longer being offered. By establishing a letter of intent, a Unitholder agrees   
that the first purchase of Units following the execution of such letter of      
intent will be at least 5% of the total amount of the intended aggregate        
purchases expressed in the Unitholder's letter of intent. Further, through the  
establishment of the letter of intent, the Unitholder agrees that Units         
representing 5% of the total amount of the intended purchases will be held in   
escrow by the Trustee pending completion of these purchases. All distributions  
on Units held in escrow will be credited to the Unitholder's account. If total  
purchases prior to the expiration of the letter of intent period equal or exceed
the amount specified in a Unitholder's letter of intent, the Units held in      
escrow will be transferred to the Unitholder's account. A Unitholder who        
purchases Units during the letter of intent period in excess of the number of   
Units specified in a Unitholder's letter of intent, the amount of which would   
cause the Unitholder to be eligible to receive an additional sales charge       
reduction, will be allowed such additional sales charge reduction on the        
purchase of Units which caused the Unitholder to reach such new breakpoint level
and on all additional purchases of Units during the letter of intent period. If 
the total purchases are less than the amount specified, the Unitholder involved 
must pay the Sponsor an amount equal to the difference between the amounts paid 
for these purchases and the amounts which would have been paid if the higher    
sales charge had been applied; the Unitholder will, however, be entitled to any 
reduced sales charge qualified for by reaching any lower breakpoint level. If   
the Unitholder does not pay the additional amount within 20 days after request  
by the Sponsor or the Unitholder's securities representative, the Sponsor will  
instruct the Trustee to redeem an appropriate number of the escrowed Units to   
meet the required payment. By establishing a letter of intent, a Unitholder     
irrevocably appoints the Sponsor as attorney to give instructions to redeem any 
or all of the Unitholder's escrowed Units, with full power of substitution in   
the premises. A Unitholder or his securities representative must notify the     
Sponsor whenever the Unitholder makes a purchase of Units that he wishes to be  
counted towards the intended amount.                                            

Fee Accounts. A portion of the sales charge is waived for certain accounts
described in this paragraph. Purchases by these accounts are subject only to the
portion of the sales charge that is retained by the Sponsor. Please refer to the
section called "Fee Accounts" for additional information on these purchases.    
Units may be purchased in the primary or secondary market at the Public Offering
Price less the concession the Sponsor typically allows to brokers and dealers   
for purchases by investors who purchase Units through registered investment     
advisers, certified financial planners and registered broker-dealers who in each
case either charge periodic fees for brokerage services, financial planning,    
investment advisory or asset management services, or provide such services in   
connection with the establishment of an investment account for which a          
comprehensive "wrap fee" charge ("Wrap Fee") is imposed ("Fee Accounts") if the 
Units are purchased for a Fee Account and the Trust is subject to a Wrap Fee    
(i.e. the Trust is "Wrap Fee Eligible"). The Sponsor reserves the right to limit
or deny purchases of Units described in this paragraph by investors or selling  
firms whose frequent trading activity is determined to be detrimental to a      
Trust.                                                                          

  Exchanges. During the initial offering period of a Trust, unitholders of any
Van Kampen-sponsored unit investment trust and unitholders of unaffiliated unit 
investment trusts may utilize their redemption or termination proceeds from such
a trust to purchase Units of a Trust offered in this prospectus at a reduced    
sales charge. The reduced sales charge will be equal to the lesser of $35 per   
Unit or 3.50% of the Public Offering Price per Unit for a Long-Term Trust and   
will be equal to the lesser of $25 or 2.50% of the Public Offering Price per    
Unit for an Intermediate-Term or Laddered Trust. In order to be eligible for the
sales charge discounts applicable to Unit purchases made with redemption or     
termination proceeds from other unit investment trusts, the termination or      
redemption proceeds used to purchase Units of a Trust must be derived from a    
transaction that occurred within 30 days of your Unit purchase. In addition, the
discounts will only be available for investors that utilize the same            
broker-dealer (or a different broker-dealer with appropriate notification) for  
both the Unit purchase and the transaction resulting in the receipt of the      
termination or redemption proceeds used for the Unit purchase. You may be       
required to provide appropriate documentation or other information to your      
broker-dealer to evidence your eligibility for these reduced sales charge       
discounts.                                                                      

Employees. Employees, officers and directors (including their spouses and 
children under 21 living in the same household, and trustees, custodians or     
fiduciaries for the benefit of such persons (collectively referred to herein as 
"related purchasers")) of Van Kampen Funds Inc. and its affiliates and          
Underwriters and their affiliates may purchase Units at the Public Offering     
Price less the applicable underwriting commission or less the applicable dealer 
concession in the absence of an underwriting commission. Employees, officers and
directors (including related purchasers) of dealers and their affiliates may    
purchase Units at the Public Offering Price less the applicable dealer          
concession. All employee discounts are subject to the policies of the related   
selling firm. Only employees, officers and directors of companies that allow    
their employees to participate in this employee discount program are eligible   
for the discounts.                                                              

Unit Price. The Public Offering Price of Units will vary from the amounts 
stated under "Summary of Essential Financial Information" in Prospectus Part I  
in accordance with fluctuations in the prices of the bonds. The price of Units  
on the Date of Deposit was determined by adding the applicable sales charge to  
the aggregate offering price of the bonds and dividing the sum by the number of 
Units outstanding. This price determination was made on the basis of an         
evaluation of the bonds prepared by the Evaluator. During the initial offering  
period, the Evaluator will value the bonds as of the Evaluation Time on days the
New York Stock Exchange is open for business and will adjust the Public Offering
Price of Units accordingly. The "Evaluation Time" is the close of trading on the
New York Stock Exchange on each day that the Exchange is open for trading,      
provided, however, on the Date of Deposit the Evaluation Time will be the close 
of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange or the time the registration  
statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission becomes effective,  
if later. The secondary market Public Offering Price per Unit will be equal to  
the aggregate bid price of the bonds plus the applicable secondary market sales 
charge and dividing the sum by the number of Units outstanding. For secondary   
market purposes, this computation will be made by the Evaluator as of the       
Evaluation Time for each day on which any Unit is tendered for redemption and as
necessary. The offering price of bonds may be expected to average approximately 
0.35-1% more than the bid price. The Public Offering Price per Unit will be     
effective for all orders received prior to the Evaluation Time on each business 
day. Orders received by the Sponsor prior to the Evaluation Time and orders     
received by authorized financial professionals prior to the Evaluation Time that
are properly transmitted to the Sponsor by the time designated by the Sponsor,  
are priced based on the date of receipt. Orders received by the Sponsor after   
the Evaluation Time, and orders received by authorized financial professionals  
after the Evaluation Time or orders received by such persons that are not       
transmitted to the Sponsor until after the time designated by the Sponsor, are  
priced based on the date of the next determined Public Offering Price per Unit  
provided they are received timely by the Sponsor on such date. It is the        
responsibility of authorized financial professionals to transmit orders received
by them to the Sponsor so they will be received in a timely manner.             

  The aggregate price of the bonds is determined on the basis of bid prices or
offering prices, as is appropriate, (a) on the basis of current market prices   
obtained from dealers or brokers who customarily deal in bonds comparable to    
those held by your Trust; (b) if these prices are not available, on the basis of
current market prices for comparable bonds; (c) by causing the value of the     
bonds to be determined by others engaged in the practice of evaluation, quoting 
or appraising comparable bonds; or (d) by any combination of the above. Market  
prices of the bonds will generally fluctuate with changes in market interest    
rates. Unless bonds are in default in payment of principal or interest or in    
significant risk of default, the Evaluator will not attribute any value to the  
insurance obtained by your Trust.                                               

 The Evaluator will consider in its evaluation of bonds which are in default
in payment of principal or interest or, in the Sponsor's opinion, in significant
risk of default (the "Defaulted Bonds") the value of any insurance guaranteeing 
interest and principal payments. The value of the insurance will be equal to the
difference between (i) the market value of Defaulted Bonds assuming the exercise
of the right to obtain Permanent Insurance (less the insurance premiums and     
related expenses attributable to the purchase of Permanent Insurance) and (ii)  
the market value of Defaulted Bonds not covered by Permanent Insurance. In      
addition, the Evaluator will consider the ability of a Portfolio Insurer to meet
its commitments under any insurance policy, including commitments to issue      
Permanent Insurance. No value has been ascribed to insurance obtained by your   
Trust, if any, as of the date of this prospectus.                               

A person will become the owner of Units on the date of settlement provided
payment has been received. Cash, if any, made available to the Sponsor prior to 
the date of settlement for the purchase of Units may be used in the Sponsor's   
business and may be deemed to be a benefit to the Sponsor, subject to the       
limitations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.                             

 Accrued Interest. Accrued interest is an accumulation of unpaid interest on
securities which generally is paid semi-annually, although your Trust accrues   
interest daily. Because of this, your Trust always has an amount of interest    
earned but not yet collected by the Trustee. For this reason, with respect to   
sales settling after the First Settlement Date, the proportionate share of      
accrued interest to the settlement date is added to the Public Offering Price of
Units. Unitholders will receive the amount of accrued interest paid on their    
Units on the next distribution date. In an effort to reduce the accrued interest
which would have to be paid by Unitholders, the Trustee will advance the amount 
of accrued interest to the Sponsor as the Unitholder of record as of the First  
Settlement Date. Consequently, the accrued interest added to the Public Offering
Price of Units will include only accrued interest from the First Settlement Date
to the date of settlement, less any distributions from the Interest Account     
after the First Settlement Date. Because of the varying interest payment dates  
of the bonds, accrued interest at any point in time will be greater than the    
amount of interest actually received by your Trust and distributed to           
Unitholders. If a Unitholder sells or redeems all or a portion of his Units, he 
will be entitled to receive his proportionate share of the accrued interest from
the purchaser of his Units.                                                     

Unit Distribution. Units will be distributed to the public by Underwriters,
broker-dealers and others at the Public Offering Price, plus accrued interest.  
The Sponsor intends to qualify Units for sale in a number of states. During the 
initial offering period, the Sponsor and Underwriters will sell Units to        
non-Underwriter broker-dealers and selling agents at the Public Offering Price  
(net of any sales charge discount) less the concession or agency commission     
described in the following sections.

and selling agents at the Public Offering Price (net of any sales charge        
discount) less the gross concession or agency commission set forth in the       
following table.

Non-Underwriter broker-dealers and other selling agents who purchase an   
aggregate of 250 or more Units from the Sponsor during the initial offering     
period will receive a net concession equal to the concession allowed to         
Underwriters described under "Sponsor and Underwriter Compensation" below. The  
Sponsor will offer a rebate per Unit equal to the difference between the        
applicable gross broker-dealer concession and the related Underwriter concession
so that the broker-dealer or selling agent receives the appropriate net         
concession or agency commission. The Sponsor will pay this rebate after the end 
of the initial offering period.                                                 

  For initial offering period transactions involving unitholders of other unit
investment trusts who use their redemption or termination proceeds to purchase  
Units of a Trust, the regular concession or agency commission allowed by the    
Sponsor to broker-dealers and other selling agents will equal $17.50 per Unit   
for an Intermediate-Term Trust.                                                 

 Underwriters other than the Sponsor will sell Units to other broker-dealers

commission not in excess of the concession allowed to the Underwriter by the    
Sponsor as described under "Sponsor and Underwriter Compensation" below.        

Laddered Trusts. During the initial offering period, the Sponsor will sell
Units of Laddered Trusts to non-Underwriter broker-dealers and selling agents at
the Public Offering Price (net of any sales charge discount) less the gross

   Notwithstanding the preceding table, non-Underwriter broker-dealers and other
selling agents that purchase 100 or more Units of a Trust from the Sponsor on   
the Date of Deposit ("Qualifying Broker-Dealers") will be allowed a concession  
or agency commission on such Units equal to the regular concession allowed to   
Underwriters described under "Sponsor and Underwriter Compensation" below. In   
addition, Qualifying Broker-Dealers will be allowed a concession or agency      
commission equal to $27 per Unit on subsequent Unit purchases from the Sponsor  
throughout the remainder of the initial offering period, provided, however, that
a Qualifying Broker-Dealer will be allowed a concession or agency commission    
equal to the concession or agency commission allowed to such firm on the Date of
Deposit for subsequent purchases on a single day equal to the lesser of (a)     
1,000 Units of a Trust (or all remaining Units if the sponsor has less than     
1,000 unsold Units available for sale) or (b) the number of Units of a Trust    
purchased on the Date of Deposit.                                               

Non-Underwriter broker-dealers and other selling agents (other than       
Qualifying Broker-Dealers) who purchase an aggregate of 250 or more Units from  
the Sponsor during the initial offering period will receive a net concession    
equal to $27 per Unit. This net concession will be paid by allowing the regular 
gross concession at the time of purchase and the Sponsor will offer a rebate per
Unit equal to the difference between the applicable gross broker-dealer         
concession and $27 per Unit so that the broker-dealer or selling agent receives 
the appropriate net concession or agency commission. The Sponsor will pay this  
rebate after the end of the initial offering period.                            

  For initial offering period transactions involving unitholders of other unit
investment trusts who use their redemption or termination proceeds to purchase  
Units of a Laddered Trust, the regular concession or agency commission allowed  
by the Sponsor to broker-dealers and other selling agents will equal $17.50 per 
Unit for the Trust.                                                             

 Underwriters other than the Sponsor will sell Units to other broker-dealers
and selling agents at the Public Offering Price less a concession or agency     
commission not in excess of the concession allowed to the Underwriter by the    
Sponsor as described under "Sponsor and Underwriter Compensation" below.        

Long-Term Trusts. During the initial offering period, the Sponsor will sell
Units of Long-Term Trusts to non-Underwriter broker-dealers and selling agents  
at the Public Offering Price (net of any sales charge discount) less the gross  
concession or agency commission set forth in the following table.

   Notwithstanding the preceding table, non-Underwriter broker-dealers and other
selling agents that purchase 100 or more Units of a Long-Term Trust from the    
Sponsor on the Date of Deposit ("Qualifying Broker-Dealers") will be allowed a  
concession or agency commission on such Units equal to the regular concession   
allowed to Underwriters described under "Sponsor and Underwriter Compensation"  
below. In addition, Qualifying Broker-Dealers will be allowed a concession or   
agency commission equal to $35 per Unit on subsequent Unit purchases from the   
Sponsor throughout the remainder of the initial offering period, provided,      
however, that a Qualifying Broker-Dealer will be allowed a concession or agency 
commission equal to the concession or agency commission allowed to such firm on 
the Date of Deposit for subsequent purchases on a single day equal to the lesser
of (a) 1,000 Units of a Trust (or all remaining Units if the Sponsor has less   
than 1,000 unsold Units available for sale) or (b) the number of Units of such  
Trust purchased on the Date of Deposit.                                         

Non-Underwriter broker-dealers and other selling agents (other than       
Qualifying Broker-Dealers) who purchase an aggregate of 250 or more Units from  
the Sponsor during the initial offering period will receive a net concession    
equal to $35 per Unit. This net concession will be paid by allowing the regular 
gross concession at the time of purchase and the Sponsor will offer a rebate per
Unit equal to the difference between the applicable gross broker-dealer         
concession and $35 per Unit so that the broker-dealer or selling agent receives 
the appropriate net concession or agency commission. The Sponsor will pay this  
rebate after the end of the initial offering period.                            

  For initial offering period transactions involving unitholders of other unit
investment trusts who use their redemption or termination proceeds to purchase  
Units of a Trust, the regular concession or agency commission allowed by the    
Sponsor to broker-dealers and other selling agents will equal $25 per Unit for a
Long-Term Trust.                                                                

 Underwriters other than the Sponsor will sell Units to other broker-dealers
and selling agents at the Public Offering Price less a concession or agency     
commission not in excess of the concession allowed to the Underwriter by the    
Sponsor as described under "Sponsor and Underwriter Compensation" below.        

General. The breakpoint concessions or agency commissions above are also  
applied on a dollar basis utilizing a breakpoint equivalent of $1,000 per Unit  
and will be applied on whichever basis is more favorable to the distributor. The
breakpoints above will be adjusted to take into consideration purchase orders   
stated in dollars which cannot be completely fulfilled due to the requirement   
that only whole Units be issued.                                                

 In addition to the concession or agency commission and rebates described in
the sections above, all broker-dealers and other selling firms (including       
Underwriters) will be eligible to receive additional compensation based on total
initial offering period sales of all eligible Van Kampen unit investment trusts 
during a Quarterly Period as set forth in the following table:                  

                  Additional
Initial Offering Period Sales                Volume                       
During Quarterly Period                  Concession                       
-------------------------------------------------------                         
$2 million but less than $5 million         0.025%                        
$5 million but less than $10 million         0.050                        
$10 million but less than $50 million        0.075                        
$50 million or more                          0.100                        

  "Quarterly Period" means the following periods: December - February; March -
May; June - August; and September - November. Broker-dealers and other selling  
firms will not receive these additional volume concessions on the sale of units 
which are not subject to a transactional sales charge (as defined in applicable 
prospectuses), however, such sales will be included in determining whether a    
firm has met the sales level breakpoints set forth in the table above. Secondary
market sales of all unit investment trusts are excluded for purposes of these   
volume concessions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Wachovia Securities, LLC will
receive the maximum volume concession set forth in the table above for all      
eligible unit sales. The Sponsor will pay these amounts out of the transactional
sales charge received on units within a reasonable time following each Quarterly
Period. For a trust to be eligible for this additional compensation for         
Quarterly Period sales, the trust's prospectus must include disclosure related  
to this additional compensation; a trust is not eligible for this additional    
compensation if the prospectus for such trust does not include disclosure       
related to this additional compensation.                                        

  Certain commercial banks may be making Units available to their customers on
an agency basis. A portion of the sales charge paid by these customers (equal to
the agency commission referred to above) is retained by or remitted to the      
banks. Any discount provided to investors will be borne by the selling dealer or
agent. For secondary market transactions, the Sponsor will sell Units to        
broker-dealers and selling agents at the Public Offering Price less a concession
or agency commission of 80% of the applicable sales charge. Dealers other than  
the Sponsor may sell Units in the secondary market to other broker-dealers and  
selling agents at the Public Offering Price less a concession or agency         
commission not in excess of the secondary market concession allowed to the      
dealer. The Sponsor reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any order
for the purchase of Units and to change the amount of the concession or agency  
commission to dealers and others from time to time.                             

Sponsor and Underwriter Compensation. The Sponsor will sell Units to      
Underwriters at the regular Public Offering Price per Unit less a gross         
concession described in the sections below. For a list of the Underwriters that 
have purchased Units from the Sponsor, see "Underwriting" in Prospectus Part I. 

Intermediate-Term Trusts. The Sponsor will sell Units of Intermediate-Term
Trusts to Underwriters at the regular Public Offering Price per Unit less a     
concession of $22 per Unit underwritten.                                        

In connection with Underwriter sales of Units which are sold in sufficient
size to qualify for quantity discounts, Underwriters are eligible to receive a  
rebate from the Sponsor. This rebate applies only to Units sold out of the      
Underwriter's inventory and will equal the amount by which the sum of the       
related broker-dealer concession and the sales charge discount exceeds the      
regular Underwriter concession. In addition, if a firm commits to act as an     
Underwriter for an Intermediate-Term Trust, the concessions or agency           
commissions allowed will equal the amounts shown above on all Units of such     
Trust distributed during the initial offering period and purchased directly from
the Sponsor rather than the broker-dealer concessions described under "Unit
Distribution", provided, however, that an Underwriter will be allowed a         
concession equal to the Underwriter concession allowed to such firm on the Date 
of Deposit for subsequent purchases equal to at least 1,000 Units of a Trust    
(including any additional compensation described in the next paragraph).        

  Each Underwriter who underwrites 1,000 or more Units in an Intermediate-Term
Trust will receive additional compensation from the Sponsor of $1.00 for each   
Unit it underwrites.                                                            

Laddered Trusts. The Sponsor will sell Units of Laddered Trusts to        
Underwriters at the regular Public Offering Price per Unit less the concession  
per Unit underwritten set forth in the following table.                         

               Underwriter
Units                                   Concession                        
------------------------------------------------------                          
Less than 500 Units                           $27                         
500 Units - 999 Units                          28                         
1,000 Units - 1,999 Units                      29                         
2,000 Units - 2,999 Units                      30                         
3,000 Units or more                            31                         

   In addition, Underwriters of these Trusts will be allowed a concession or
agency commission equal to $27 per Unit on subsequent Unit purchases throughout 
the remainder of the initial offering period rather than the broker-dealer      
concessions described under "Unit Distribution," provided, however, that an     
Underwriter will be allowed a concession equal to the Underwriter concession    
allowed to such firm on the Date of Deposit for subsequent purchases on a single
day equal to the lesser of (a) 1,000 Units of a Trust (or all remaining Units if
the Sponsor has less than 1,000 unsold Units available for sale) or (b) the     
number of Units of a Trust purchased on the Date of Deposit.                    

In connection with Underwriter sales of Units to non-Underwriter      
broker-dealers and other selling agents which Units in turn are sold to         
investors in sufficient size to qualify for quantity discounts, Underwriters are
eligible to receive a rebate from the Sponsor. This rebate is intended to       
reimburse Underwriters for discounts provided to such broker-dealers and agents,
and on these transactions will equal the amount by which the sum of the related 
broker-dealer concession and the sales charge discount exceeds the total        
Underwriter concession.                                                         

Long-Term Trusts. The Sponsor will sell Units of Long-Term Trusts to  
Underwriters at the regular Public Offering Price per Unit less the concession  
per Unit underwritten set forth in the following table.                         

               Underwriter
Units                                   Concession

Less than 500 Units                            $35                        
500 Units - 999 Units                           36                        
1,000 Units - 1,999 Units                       37                        
2,000 Units - 2,999 Units                       38                        
3,000 Units or more                             40                        

 In addition, Underwriters of a Long-Term Trust will be allowed a concession
or agency commission equal to $35 per Unit on subsequent Unit purchases         
throughout the remainder of the initial offering period rather than the         
broker-dealer concessions described under "Unit Distribution," provided,        
however, that an Underwriter will be allowed a concession equal to the          
Underwriter concession allowed to such firm on the Date of Deposit for          
subsequent purchases on a single day equal to the lesser of (a) 1,000 Units of a
Trust (or all remaining Units if the Sponsor has less than 1,000 unsold Units   
available for sale) or (b) the number of Units of such Trust purchased on the   
Date of Deposit.                                                                

In connection with Underwriter sales of Units to non-Underwriter          
broker-dealers and other selling agents which Units in turn are sold to         
investors in sufficient size to qualify for quantity discounts, Underwriters are
eligible to receive a rebate from the Sponsor. This rebate is intended to       
reimburse Underwriters for discounts provided to such broker-dealers and agents,
and on these transactions will equal the amount by which the sum of the related 
broker-dealer concession and the sales charge discount exceeds the regular      
Underwriter concession.                                                         

General. The breakpoints listed herein will also be applied on a dollar basis
utilizing a breakpoint equivalent of $1,000 per Unit and will be applied on     
whichever basis is more favorable to the Underwriter. The breakpoints will be   
adjusted to take into consideration purchase orders stated in dollars which     
cannot be completely fulfilled due to the requirement that only whole Units be  
issued.                                                                         

In addition, the Sponsor and certain Underwriters will realize a profit or
loss, as a result of the difference between the price paid for the bonds by the 
Sponsor and the cost of the bonds to a Trust. See "Portfolio" and "Notes to
Portfolio" in Prospectus Part I. The Sponsor and the Underwriters may also      
realize profits or losses with respect to bonds which were acquired by the      
Sponsor from underwriting syndicates of which they were members. The Sponsor has
not participated as sole underwriter or as manager or as a member of the        
underwriting syndicates from which the bonds were acquired. Underwriters may    
further realize profit or loss during the initial offering period as a result of
possible fluctuations in the market value of the bonds since all proceeds       
received from purchasers of Units (excluding dealer concessions or agency       
commissions allowed, if any) will be retained by the Underwriters. Affiliates of
an Underwriter are entitled to the same dealer concessions or agency commissions
that are available to the Underwriter. In addition to any other benefits        
Underwriters may realize from the sale of Units, the Sponsor will share on a pro
rata basis among senior Underwriters (those who underwrite at least 250 Units)  
50% of any gain (less deductions for accrued interest and certain costs)        
represented by the difference between the cost of the bonds to the Sponsor and  
the evaluation of the bonds on the Date of Deposit. The Sponsor and certain of  
the other Underwriters will also realize profits or losses in the amount of any 
difference between the price at which Units are purchased and the price at which
Units are resold in connection with maintaining a secondary market for Units and
will also realize profits or losses resulting from a redemption of repurchased  
Units at a price above or below the purchase price.                             

We may provide, at our own expense and out of our own profits, additional 
compensation and benefits to broker-dealers who sell Units of the Trust and our 
other products. This compensation is intended to result in additional sales of  
our products and/or compensate broker-dealers and financial advisors for past   
sales. We may make these payments for marketing, promotional or related         
expenses, including, but not limited to, expenses of entertaining retail        
customers and financial advisors, advertising, sponsorship of events or         
seminars, obtaining shelf space in broker-dealer firms and similar activities   
designed to promote the sale of the Trust and our other products. Fees may      
include payment for travel expenses, including lodging, incurred in connection  
with trips taken by invited registered representatives for meetings or seminars 
of a business nature. These arrangements will not change the price you pay for  
your Units.                                                                     

Market for Units. Although not obligated to do so, the Sponsor intends to,
and certain of the other Underwriters may, maintain a market for Units and offer
to purchase Units at prices, subject to change at any time, based upon the      
aggregate bid prices of the bonds plus accrued interest and any principal cash  
on hand, less any amounts representing taxes or other governmental charges      
payable out of your Trust and less any accrued Trust expenses. If the supply of 
Units exceeds demand or if some other business reason warrants it, the Sponsor  
and/or the Underwriters may either discontinue all purchases of Units or        
discontinue purchases of Units at these prices. If a market is not maintained   
and the Unitholder cannot find another purchaser, a Unitholder will be able to  
dispose of Units by tendering them to the Trustee for redemption at the         
Redemption Price. See "Rights of Unitholders--Redemption of Units". A Unitholder
who wishes to dispose of his Units should inquire of his broker as to current   
market prices in order to determine whether there is in any price in excess of  
the Redemption Price and, if so, the amount thereof. The Trustee will notify the
Sponsor of any tender of Units for redemption. If the Sponsor's bid in the      
secondary market at that time equals or exceeds the Redemption Price per Unit,  
it may purchase the Units not later than the day on which the Units would       
otherwise have been redeemed by the Trustee.                                    

FEE ACCOUNTS 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 As described above, Units may be available for purchase by investors in Fee
Accounts where the Portfolio is Wrap Fee Eligible. You should consult your      
financial professional to determine whether you can benefit from these accounts.
For these purchases you generally only pay the portion of the sales charge that 
is retained by your Trust's Sponsor, Van Kampen Funds Inc. You should consult   
the "Public Offering--General" section for specific information on this and     
other sales charge discounts. That section governs the calculation of all sales 
charge discounts. The Sponsor reserves the right to limit or deny purchases of  
Units in Fee Accounts by investors or selling firms whose frequent trading      
activity is determined to be detrimental to a Portfolio.                        

RIGHTS OF UNITHOLDERS 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Distributions of Interest and Principal. Interest received by a Trust, pro
rated on an annual basis, will be distributed monthly unless a Unitholder elects
to receive semi-annual distributions. The amount and time of the first          
distribution is described under "Summary of Essential Financial Information" in 
Prospectus Part I. The plan of distribution selected by a Unitholder will remain
in effect until changed. Unitholders who purchase Units in the secondary market 
will receive distributions in accordance with the election of the prior owner.  
Unitholders may change their distribution plan by indicating the change on a    
card which may be obtained from the Trustee and return the card to the Trustee  
with their certificates and other documentation required by the Trustee.        
Certificates should be sent by registered or certified mail to avoid their being
lost or stolen. If the card and certificate are properly presented to the       
Trustee, the change will become effective on the first day after the next       
semi-annual record date and will remain effective until changed.                

Interest received by a Trust, including that part of the proceeds of any  
disposition of bonds which represents accrued interest, is credited by the      
Trustee to the Interest Account. Other receipts are credited to the Principal   
Account. After deduction of amounts sufficient to reimburse the Trustee, without
interest, for any amounts advanced and paid to the Sponsor as the Unitholder of 
record as of the First Settlement Date, interest received will be distributed on
each distribution date to Unitholders of record as of the preceding record date.
All distributions will be net of estimated expenses. Funds in the Principal     
Account will be distributed on each semi-annual distribution date to Unitholders
of record as of the preceding semi-annual record date. The Trustee is not       
required to pay interest on funds held in the Principal or Interest Account (but
may itself earn interest thereon and therefore benefits from the use of these   
funds) nor to make a distribution from the Principal Account unless the amount  
available for distribution therein shall equal at least $1.00 per Unit. However,
should the amount available for distribution in the Principal Account equal or  
exceed $10.00 per Unit, the Trustee will make a special distribution from the   
Principal Account on the next monthly distribution date to Unitholders of record
on the related monthly record date.                                             

Because interest payments are not received by a Trust at a constant rate  
throughout the year, interest distributions may be more or less than the amount 
credited to the Interest Account as of the record date. For the purpose of      
minimizing fluctuations in interest distributions, the Trustee is authorized to 
advance amounts necessary to provide interest distributions of approximately    
equal amounts. The Trustee is reimbursed for these advances from funds in the   
Interest Account on the next record date. Persons who purchase Units between a  
record date and a distribution date will receive their first distribution on the
second distribution date after the purchase, under the applicable plan of       
distribution.                                                                   

Reinvestment Option. Unitholders may elect to have distributions on their 
Units automatically reinvested in shares of certain Van Kampen mutual funds     
which are registered in the Unitholder's state of residence (the "Reinvestment  
Funds"). Each Reinvestment Fund has investment objectives that differ from those
of your Trust. The prospectus relating to each Reinvestment Fund describes its  
investment policies and the procedures to follow to begin reinvestment. A       
Unitholder may obtain a prospectus for the Reinvestment Funds from Van Kampen   
Funds Inc.                                                                      

  After becoming a participant in a reinvestment plan, each Trust distribution
will automatically be applied on the applicable distribution date to purchase   
shares of the applicable Reinvestment Fund at a net asset value computed on such
date. Unitholders with an existing Planned Reinvestment Option (PRO) Program    
account (whereby a sales charge is imposed on distribution reinvestments) may   
transfer their existing account into a new PRO account which allows purchases of
Reinvestment Fund shares at net asset value. Confirmations of all reinvestments 
will be mailed to the Unitholder by the Reinvestment Fund. A participant may    
elect to terminate his or her reinvestment plan and receive future distributions
in cash by notifying the Trustee in writing at least five days before the next  
distribution date. Each Reinvestment Fund, its sponsor and investment adviser   
have the right to terminate its reinvestment plan at any time. Each reinvestment
plan is subject to availability or limitation by each broker-dealer or selling  
firm. Broker-dealers may suspend or terminate the offering of a reinvestment    
plan at any time. Please contact your financial professional for additional     
information.                                                                    

Redemption of Units. A Unitholder may redeem all or a portion of his Units by
tender to the Trustee, at Unit Investment Trust Division, 111 Sanders Creek     
Parkway, East Syracuse, New York 13057, of the certificates representing the    
Units to be redeemed, duly endorsed or accompanied by proper instruments of     
transfer with signature guaranteed (or by providing satisfactory indemnity, such
as in connection with lost, stolen or destroyed certificates) and by payment of 
applicable governmental charges, if any. Redemption of Units cannot occur until 
certificates representing the Units or satisfactory indemnity have been received
by the Trustee. No later than seven calendar days following satisfactory tender,
the Unitholder will receive an amount for each Unit equal to the Redemption     
Price per Unit next computed after receipt by the Trustee of the tender of      
Units. The "date of tender" is deemed to be the date on which Units are received
by the Trustee, except that as regards Units received after the Evaluation Time 
on days of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, the date of tender is the    
next day on which that Exchange is open and the Units will be deemed to have    
been tendered to the Trustee on that day for redemption at the Redemption Price.
Redemption requests received by the Trustee after the Evaluation Time, and      
redemption requests received by authorized financial professionals after the    
Evaluation Time or redemption requests received by such persons that are not    
transmitted to the Trustee until after the time designated by the Trustee, are  
priced based on the date of the next determined redemption price provided they  
are received timely by the Trustee on such date. It is the responsibility of    
authorized financial professionals to transmit redemption requests received by  
them to the Trustee so they will be received in a timely manner. Certain        
broker-dealers or selling firms may charge an order handling fee for processing 
redemption requests. Units redeemed directly through the Trustee are not subject
to such fees.                                                                   

Under Internal Revenue Service regulations, the Trustee is required to    
withhold a specified percentage of a Unit redemption if the Trustee has not     
received the Unitholder's tax identification number as required by such         
regulations. Any amount withheld is transmitted to the Internal Revenue Service 
and may be recovered by the Unitholder only when filing a return. Under normal  
circumstances the Trustee obtains the Unitholder's tax identification number    
from the selling broker. However, at any time a Unitholder elects to tender     
Units for redemption, the Unitholder should provide a tax identification number 
to the Trustee in order to avoid this possible "back-up withholding".           

The Redemption Price per Unit (as well as the secondary market Public     
Offering Price) will be determined on the basis of the bid price of the bonds as
of the Evaluation Time on days of trading on the New York Stock Exchange on the 
date any such determination is made. The Evaluator determines the Redemption    
Price per Unit on days Units are tendered for redemption. The Redemption Price  
per Unit is the pro rata share of each Unit on the basis of (i) the cash on hand
in a Trust or moneys in the process of being collected, (ii) the value of the   
bonds based on the bid prices of the bonds, except for cases in which the value 
of insurance has been included, (iii) accrued interest, less (a) amounts        
representing taxes or other governmental charges and (b) the accrued Trust      
expenses. The Evaluator may determine the value of the bonds by employing any of
the methods set forth in "Public Offering--Unit Price". In determining the      
Redemption Price per Unit no value will be assigned to the portfolio insurance  
maintained on the bonds in a Trust unless the bonds are in default in payment of
principal or interest or in significant risk of default. For a description of   
the situations in which the Evaluator may value the insurance obtained by a     
Trust, see "Public Offering--Unit Price". Accrued interest paid on redemption   
shall be withdrawn from the Interest Account or, if the balance therein is      
insufficient, from the Principal Account. All other amounts will be withdrawn   
from the Principal Account. Units so redeemed shall be cancelled.               

   The price at which Units may be redeemed could be less than the price paid by
the Unitholder and may be less than the par value of the bonds represented by   
the Units redeemed. The Trustee may sell bonds to cover redemptions. When bonds 
are sold, the size and diversity of your Trust will be reduced. Sales may be    
required at a time when bonds would not otherwise be sold and might result in   
lower prices than might otherwise be realized.                                  

The Trustee reserves the right to satisfy any redemption of 1,000 or more 
Units with an aggregate redemption price of $1,000,000 or more in an in-kind    
distribution of bonds. An in-kind distribution of bonds will be made by the     
Trustee through the distribution of each of the bonds in the Trust in bookentry 
form to the account of the Unitholder's broker-dealer at Depository Trust       
Company. Amounts representing fractional portions of a bond will be distributed 
in cash. The Trustee may adjust the bonds included in a Unitholder's in-kind    
distribution to facilitate the distribution of whole bonds. Special tax         
consequences will result if a Unitholder receives an in-kind distribution.      

   The right of redemption may be suspended and payment postponed for any period
during which the New York Stock Exchange is closed, other than for customary    
weekend and holiday closings, or during which the SEC determines that trading on
that Exchange is restricted or an emergency exists, as a result of which        
disposal or evaluation of the bonds is not reasonably practicable, or for other 
periods as the SEC may by order permit. Under certain extreme circumstances the 
Sponsor may apply to the SEC for an order permitting a full or partial          
suspension of the right of Unitholders to redeem their Units.                   

Exchange Option. When you redeem Units of your Trust or when your Trust   
terminates, you may be able to exchange your Units for units of other Van Kampen
unit trusts at a reduced sales charge. You should contact your financial        
professional for more information about trusts currently available for          
exchanges. Before you exchange Units, you should read the prospectus of the new 
trust carefully and understand the risks and fees. You should then discuss this 
option with your financial professional to determine whether your investment    
goals have changed, whether current trusts suit you and to dis-cuss tax         
consequences. We may discontinue this option at any time.                       

   Units. Ownership of Units is evidenced in book entry form unless a Unitholder
makes a written request to the Trustee that ownership be in certificate form.   
Units are transferable by making a written request to the Trustee and, in the   
case of Units in certificate form, by presentation and surrender of the         
certificate to the Trustee properly endorsed or accompanied by a written        
instrument or instruments of transfer. A Unitholder must sign the written       
request, or certificate transfer instrument, exactly as his name appears on the 
records of the Trustee and on the face of any certificate with the signature    
guaranteed by a participant in the Securities Transfer Agents Medallion Program 
("STAMP") or a signature guaranty program accepted by the Trustee. The Trustee  
may require additional documents such as, but not limited to, trust instruments,
certificates of death, appointments as executor or administrator or certificates
of corporate authority. Certificates will be issued in denominations of one Unit
or any multiple thereof. Although no such charge is now made, the Trustee may   
require a Unitholder to pay a reasonable fee for each certificate re-issued or  
transferred and to pay any governmental charge that may be imposed in connection
with each transfer or interchange. Destroyed, stolen, mutilated or lost         
certificates will be replaced upon delivery to the Trustee of satisfactory      
indemnity, evidence of ownership and payment of expenses incurred. Mutilated    
certificates must be surrendered to the Trustee for replacement.                

  Reports Provided. Unitholders will receive a statement of interest and other
receipts received for each distribution. For as long as the Sponsor deems it to 
be in the best interest of Unitholders, the accounts of your Trust will be      
audited annually by independent registered public accounting firm and the report
of the accountants will be furnished to Unitholders upon request. Within a      
reasonable period of time after the end of each year, the Trustee will furnish  
to each person who was a registered Unitholder during that year a statement     
describing the interest and principal received on the bonds, actual Trust       
distributions, Trust expenses, a list of the bonds and other Trust information. 
Unitholders will be furnished the Evaluator's evaluations of the bonds upon     
request to the Trustee. If you have questions regarding your account or your    
Portfolio, please contact your financial adviser or the Trustee. The Sponsor    
does not have access to individual account information.                         

INSURANCE ON THE BONDS 
IN AN INSURED TRUST 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Insurance has been obtained guaranteeing prompt payment of interest and   
principal, when due, in respect of the bonds in an Insured Trust. An insurance  
policy obtained by an Insured Trust is non-cancelable and will continue in force
so long as the Trust is in existence, the respective Portfolio Insurer is still 
in business and the bonds described in the policy continue to be held by the    
Trust. Any portfolio insurance premium for an Insured Trust is paid by the Trust
on a monthly basis. The premium for any Preinsured Bond insurance has been paid 
by the issuer, by a prior owner of the bonds or the Sponsor and any policy is   
non-cancelable and will continue in force so long as the bonds so insured are   
outstanding and the Preinsured Bond Insurer remains in business. The Portfolio  
Insurers and the Preinsured Bond Insurers are described in "Portfolio" for each 
Insured Trust and the notes thereto in Prospectus Part I. More detailed         
information regarding insurance on the bonds and the Preinsured Bond and        
Portfolio Insurers is included in the Information Supplement. See "Additional
Information".                                                                   

The portfolio insurance obtained by an Insured Trust guarantees the timely
payment of principal and interest on the bonds when they fall due. For this     
purpose, "when due" generally means the stated maturity date for the payment of 
principal and interest. However, in the event (a) an issuer defaults in the     
payment of principal or interest, (b) an issuer enters into a bankruptcy        
proceeding or (c) the maturity of the bond is accelerated, the affected         
Portfolio Insurer has the option to pay the outstanding principal amount of the 
bond plus accrued interest to the date of payment and thereby retire the bond   
from an Insured Trust prior to the bond's stated maturity date. The insurance   
does not guarantee the market value of the bonds or the value of the Units. The 
Trustee, upon the sale of a bond covered under a portfolio insurance policy has 
the right to obtain permanent insurance with respect to the bond (i.e.,         
insurance to maturity of the bond regardless of the identity of the holder) (the
"Permanent Insurance") upon the payment of a single predetermined insurance     
premium and expenses from the proceeds of the sale of the bond. It is expected  
that the Trustee would exercise the right to obtain Permanent Insurance only if 
upon exercise an Insured Trust would receive net proceeds in excess of the sale 
proceeds if the bonds were sold on an uninsured basis.                          

Each Portfolio Insurer is subject to regulation by the department of      
insurance in the state in which it is qualified to do business. Such regulation,
however, is no guarantee that each Portfolio Insurer will be able to perform on 
its contract of insurance in the event a claim should be made. At the date      
hereof, it is reported that no claims have been submitted or are expected to be 
submitted to any of the Portfolio Insurers which would materially impair the    
ability of any such company to meet its commitment pursuant to any contract of  
insurance. The information relating to each Portfolio Insurer has been furnished
by such companies. The financial information with respect to each Portfolio     
Insurer appears in reports filed with state insurance regulatory authorities and
is subject to audit and review by such authorities. No representation is made   
herein as to the accuracy or adequacy of such information or as to the absence  
of material adverse changes in such information subsequent to the dates thereof.

TRUST ADMINISTRATION 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Sponsor. Van Kampen Funds Inc. is the Sponsor of the Portfolio. The Sponsor
is a wholly owned subsidiary of Van Kampen Investments Inc. ("Van Kampen
Investments"). Van Kampen Investments is a diversified asset management company 
that services more than three million retail investor accounts, has extensive   
capabilities for managing institutional portfolios and has more than $120       
billion under management or supervision as of July 31, 2007. Van Kampen         
Investments has more than 50 open-end funds, more than 30 closed-end funds and  
more than 2,700 unit investment trusts that are distributed by authorized       
dealers nationwide. Van Kampen Investments is an indirect wholly owned          
subsidiary of Morgan Stanley, a preeminent global financial services firm that  
provides a wide range of investment banking, securities, investment management  
and wealth management services. Morgan Stanley is a full service securities firm
engaged in securities trading and brokerage activities as well as providing     
investment banking, research and analysis, financing and financial advisory     
services. The Sponsor's principal office is located at 522 Fifth Avenue, New
York, New York 10036. As of July 31, 2007, the total stockholders equity of Van 
Kampen Funds Inc. was $318,237,422 (unaudited).                                 

  Van Kampen Funds Inc. and your Trust have adopted a code of ethics requiring
Van Kampen's employees who have access to information on Trust transactions to  
report personal securities transactions. The purpose of the code is to avoid    
potential conflicts of interest and to prevent fraud, deception or misconduct   
with respect to your Trust. The Information Supplement contains additional      
information about the Sponsor. If we fail to or cannot perform our duties under 
the trust agreement or become bankrupt, the Trustee may appoint a new sponsor,  
continue to operate your Trust without a sponsor, or terminate your Trust and   
distribute the liquidation proceeds.                                            

   Trustee. The Trustee is The Bank of New York, a trust company organized under
the laws of New York. The Bank of New York has its principal unit investment    
trust division offices at 2 Hanson Place, 12th Floor, Brooklyn, New York 11217, 
telephone (800) 221-7668. If you have questions regarding your account or your  
Portfolio, please contact the Trustee at its principal unit investment trust    
division offices or your financial adviser. The Sponsor does not have access to 
individual account information. The Bank of New York is subject to supervision  
and examination by the Superintendent of Banks of the State of New York and the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and its deposits are insured  
by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to the extent permitted by law.    
Additional information regarding the Trustee is set forth in the Information    
Supplement, including the Trustee's qualifications and duties, its ability to   
resign, the effect of a merger involving the Trustee and the Sponsor's ability  
to remove and replace the Trustee. See "Additional Information".                

Portfolio Administration. Your Trust is not a managed fund and, except as 
provided in the Trust Agreement, bonds generally will not be sold or replaced.  
The Sponsor may, however, direct that bonds be sold in certain limited          
situations to protect your Trust based on advice from the Supervisor. These     
situations may include default in interest or principal payments on the bonds or
other obligations of an issuer, an advanced refunding or institution of certain 
legal proceedings. In addition, the Trustee may sell bonds designated by the    
Supervisor for purposes of redeeming Units or payment of expenses. The          
Supervisor will consider a variety of factors in designating bonds to be sold   
including interest rates, market value and marketability. Except in limited     
circumstances, the Trustee must reject any offer by an issuer to issue bonds in 
exchange or substitution for the bonds (such as a refunding or refinancing      
plan). The Trustee will promptly notify Unitholders of any exchange or          
substitution. The Information Supplement contains a more detailed description of
circumstances in which bonds may be sold or replaced. See "Additional
Information".                                                                   

  If a Trust is structured as a "regulated investment company" for federal tax
purposes, the Sponsor may direct the reinvestment of proceeds of the sale of    
bonds if the sale is the direct result of serious adverse credit factors which, 
in the opinion of the Sponsor, would make retention of the bonds detrimental to 
the Trust. In such a case, the Sponsor may, but is not obligated to, direct the 
reinvestment of sale proceeds in any other securities that meet the criteria for
inclusion in the trust on the Date of Deposit. The Sponsor may also instruct the
Trustee to take action necessary to ensure that such a Trust continues to       
satisfy the qualifications of a regulated investment company and to avoid       
imposition of tax on undistributed income of the Trust.                         

Replacement Bonds. No assurance can be given that a Trust will retain its 
present size or composition because bonds may be sold, redeemed or mature from  
time to time and the proceeds will be distributed to Unitholders and will not be
reinvested. In the event of a failure to deliver any bond that has been         
purchased under a contract ("Failed Bonds"), the Sponsor is authorized under the
Trust Agreement to direct the Trustee to acquire other bonds ("Replacement
Bonds") to make up the original portfolio of a Trust. Replacement Bonds must be 
purchased within 20 days after delivery of the notice of the failed contract and
the purchase price (exclusive of accrued interest) may not exceed the amount of 
funds reserved for the purchase of the Failed Bonds. The Replacement Bonds must 
(i) be long-term or intermediate term, as applicable, bonds, debentures, notes  
or other straight debt obligations (whether secured or unsecured and whether    
senior or subordinated) without equity or other conversion features, with fixed 
maturity dates substantially the same as those of the Failed Bonds having no    
warrants or subscription privileges attached; (ii) be payable in United States  
currency; (iii) not be when, as and if issued obligations or restricted         
securities; (iv) be issued after July 18, 1984 if the interest is United States 
source income; (v) be issued or guaranteed by an issuer subject to or exempt    
from the reporting requirements under Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities     
Exchange Act of 1934 (or similar provisions of law) or guaranteed, directly or  
indirectly, by means of a lease agreement, agreement to buy securities, services
or products, or other similar commitment of the credit of such an issuer to the 
payment of the substitute bonds; (vi) maintain the Standard & Poor's AAA rating 
for an Insured Trust; and (vii) be eligible for (and when acquired be insured   
under) the insurance obtained by an Insured Trust. The Trustee shall notify all 
Unitholders of a Trust within five days after the acquisition of a Replacement  
Bond and shall make a pro rata distribution of the amount, if any, by which the 
cost of the Failed Bond exceeded the cost of the Replacement Bond plus accrued  
interest. If Failed Bonds are not replaced, the Sponsor will refund the sales   
charge attributable to the Failed Bonds to all Unitholders of a Trust and       
distribute the principal and accrued interest (at the coupon rate of the Failed 
Bonds to the date of removal from the Trust) attributable to the Failed Bonds   
within 30 days after removal. If Failed Bonds are not replaced, the Estimated   
Net Annual Interest Income per Unit would be reduced and the Estimated Current  
Return and Estimated Long-Term Return might be lowered. Unitholders may not be  
able to reinvest their proceeds in other securities at a yield equal to or in   
excess of the yield of the Failed Bonds.                                        

   Amendment of Trust Agreement. The Sponsor and the Trustee may amend the Trust
Agreement without the consent of Unitholders to correct any provision which may 
be defective or to make other provisions that will not materially adversely     
affect the interest of the Unitholders (as determined in good faith by the      
Sponsor and the Trustee). The Trust Agreement may not be amended to increase the
number of Units or to permit the acquisition of bonds in addition to or in      
substitution for any of the bonds initially deposited in a Trust, except for the
substitution of certain refunding bonds. The Trustee will notify Unitholders of 
any amendment.                                                                  

Termination of Trust Agreement. A Trust will terminate upon the redemption,
sale or other disposition of the last bond held in the Trust. A Trust may also  
be terminated at any time by consent of Unitholders of 75% of the Units then    
outstanding or by the Trustee when the value of the Trust is less than 20% of   
the original principal amount of bonds. A Trust will be liquidated by the       
Trustee in the event that a sufficient number of Units of the Trust not yet sold
are tendered for redemption by the Sponsor, so that the net worth of the Trust  
would be reduced to less than 40% of the value of the Securities at the time    
they were deposited in the Trust. The Trustee will notify each Unitholder of any
termination within a reasonable time and will then liquidate any remaining      
bonds. The sale of bonds upon termination may result in a lower amount than     
might otherwise be realized if the sale was not required at that time. For this 
reason, among others, the amount realized by a Unitholder upon termination may  
be less than the principal amount of bonds per Unit or value at the time of     
purchase. The Trustee will distribute to each Unitholder his share of the       
balance of the Interest and Principal Accounts after deduction of costs,        
expenses or indemnities. The Unitholder will receive a final distribution       
statement with this distribution. When the Trustee in its sole discretion       
determines that any amounts held in reserve are no longer necessary, it will    
distribute these amounts to Unitholders. The Information Supplement contains    
further information regarding termination of a Trust. See "Additional
Information".                                                                   

Limitation on Liabilities. The Sponsor, Supervisor, Evaluator and Trustee 
shall be under no liability to Unitholders for taking any action or for         
refraining from taking any action in good faith pursuant to the Trust Agreement,
or for errors in judgment, but shall be liable only for their own willful       
misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence (negligence in the case of the       
Trustee) in the performance of their duties or by reason of their reckless      
disregard of their obligations and duties hereunder. The Trustee shall not be   
liable for depreciation or loss incurred by reason of the sale by the Trustee of
any of the bonds. In the event of the failure of the Sponsor to act under the   
Trust Agreement, the Trustee may act thereunder and shall not be liable for any 
action taken by it in good faith under the Trust Agreement. The Trustee is not  
liable for any taxes or governmental charges imposed on the bonds, on it as     
Trustee under the Trust Agreement or on a Trust which the Trustee may be        
required to pay under any present or future law of the United States of America 
or of any other taxing authority having jurisdiction. In addition, the Trust    
Agreement contains other customary provisions limiting the liability of the     
Trustee. The Trustee and Sponsor may rely on any evaluation furnished by the    
Evaluator and have no responsibility for the accuracy thereof. Determinations by
the Evaluator shall be made in good faith upon the basis of the best information
available to it; provided, however, that the Evaluator shall be under no        
liability to the Trustee, Sponsor or Unitholders for errors in judgment.        

FEDERAL TAX STATUS 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   This section summarizes some of the main U.S. federal income tax consequences
of owning Units of a Trust. This section is current as of the date of this      
prospectus. Tax laws and interpretations change frequently, and these summaries 
do not describe all of the tax consequences to all taxpayers. For example, these
summaries generally do not describe your situation if you are a corporation, a  
non-U.S. person, a broker/dealer, or other investor with special circumstances. 
In addition, this section does not describe your state, local or foreign tax    
consequences.                                                                   

  This federal income tax summary is based in part on the advice of counsel to
the Sponsor. The Internal Revenue Service could disagree with any conclusions   
set forth in this section. In addition, our counsel was not asked to review, and
has not reached a conclusion with respect to the federal income tax treatment of
the assets to be deposited in the Trust. This may not be sufficient for you to  
use for the purpose of avoiding penalties under federal tax law.                

As with any investment, you should seek advice based on your individual   
circumstances from your own tax advisor.                                        

Trust Status. The Trust intends to qualify as a "regulated investment     
company" under the federal tax laws. If the Trust qualifies as a regulated      
investment company and distributes its income as required by the tax law, the   
Trust generally will not pay federal income taxes.                              

Distributions. Trust distributions are generally taxable. After the end of
each year, you will receive a tax statement that separates your Trust's         
distributions into two categories: ordinary income distributions and capital    
gains dividends.                                                                

  Ordinary income distributions are generally taxed at your ordinary tax rate.
Generally, you will treat all capital gains dividends as long-term capital gains
regardless of how long you have owned your shares. To determine your actual tax 
liability for your capital gains dividends, you must calculate your total net   
capital gain or loss for the tax year after considering all of your other       
taxable transactions, as described below. In addition, the Trust may make       
distributions that represent a return of capital for tax purposes and thus will 
generally not be taxable to you. The tax status of your distributions from your 
Trust is not affected by whether you reinvest your distributions in additional  
shares or receive them in cash. The income from your Trust that you must take   
into account for federal income tax purposes is not reduced by amounts used to  
pay a deferred sales charge, if any. The tax laws may require you to treat      
distributions made to you in January as if you had received them on December 31 
of the previous year.                                                           

Dividends Received Deduction. A corporation that owns Units generally will
not be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to dividends   
received from the Trust because the dividends received deduction is generally   
not available for distributions from regulated investment companies.            

Sale or Redemption of Units. If you sell or redeem your Units, you will   
generally recognize a taxable gain or loss. To determine the amount of this gain
or loss, you must subtract your tax basis in your Units from the amount you     
receive in the transaction. Your tax basis in your Units is generally equal to  
the cost of your Units, generally including sales charges. In some cases,       
however, you may have to adjust your tax basis after you purchase your Units.   

Capital Gains and Losses. If you are an individual, the maximum marginal  
federal tax rate for net capital gain is generally 15% (generally 5% for certain
taxpayers in the 10% and 15% tax brackets). These capital gains rates are       
generally effective for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2011. For     
later periods, if you are an individual, the maximum marginal federal tax rate  
for net capital gain is generally 20% (10% for certain taxpayers in the 10% and 
15% tax brackets). The 20% rate is reduced to 18% and the 10% rate is reduced to
8% for long-term capital gains from most property acquired after December 31,
2000 with a holding period of more than five years.                             

Net capital gain equals net long-term capital gain minus net short-term   
capital loss for the taxable year. Capital gain or loss is long-term if the     
holding period for the asset is more than one year and is short-term if the     
holding period for the asset is one year or less. You must exclude the date you 
purchase your Units to determine your holding period. However, if you receive a 
capital gain dividend from your Trust and sell your Unit at a loss after holding
it for six months or less, the loss will be recharacterized as long-term capital
loss to the extent of the capital gain dividend received. The tax rates for     
capital gains realized from assets held for one year or less are generally the  
same as for ordinary income. The Internal Revenue Code treats certain capital   
gains as ordinary income in special situations.                                 

Exchanges. If you elect to have your proceeds from your Trust rolled over 
into a future series of the Trust, the exchange would generally be considered a 
sale for federal income tax purposes.                                           

In-Kind Distributions. Under certain circumstances, as described in this  
prospectus, you may receive an inkind distribution of Trust Assets when you     
redeem your Units. This distribution will be treated as a sale for federal      
income tax purposes and you will generally recognize gain or loss, generally    
based on the value at that time of the securities and the amount of cash        
received. The Internal Revenue Service could however assert that a loss could   
not be currently deducted.                                                      

   Deductibility of Trust Expenses. Expenses incurred and deducted by your Trust
will generally not be treated as income taxable to you. In some cases, however, 
you may be required to treat your portion of these Trust expenses as income. In 
these cases you may be able to take a deduction for these expenses. However,    
certain miscellaneous itemized deductions, such as investment expenses, may be  
deducted by individuals only to the extent that all of these deductions exceed  
2% of the individual's adjusted gross income.                                   

EXPENSES 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

General. The Trustee will periodically deduct from the Interest Account and,
to the extent funds are not sufficient therein, from the Principal Account,     
amounts necessary to pay the expenses of the Trusts. The Trustee also may       
withdraw from these Accounts such amounts, if any, as it deems necessary to     
establish a reserve for any governmental charges payable out of the Trusts.     
Amounts so withdrawn shall not be considered a part of a Trust's assets until   
such time as the Trustee shall return all or any part of such amounts to the    
appropriate Accounts. All costs and expenses incurred in creating and           
establishing the Trusts, including the cost of the initial preparation, printing
and execution of the Trust Agreement and the certificates, legal and accounting 
expenses, advertising and selling expenses, expenses of the Trustee, initial    
evaluation fees and other out-of-pocket expenses have been borne by the Sponsor 
at no cost to the Trusts.                                                       

 Sponsor, Supervisor, Evaluator and Trustee. The Sponsor and the Supervisor,
which is an affiliate of the Sponsor, will receive the annual fee indicated     
under "Summary of Essential Financial Information" in Prospectus Part I for     
providing bookkeeping and administrative services and for providing portfolio   
supervisory services for the Trusts. These fees may exceed the actual costs of  
providing these services for a Trust but the total amount received for providing
these services to all Van Kampen unit investment trusts will not exceed the     
total cost of providing the services in any calendar year. The Evaluator will   
receive the annual evaluation fee indicated under "Summary of Essential
Financial Information" in Prospectus Part I for evaluating each Trust's         
portfolio. For its services the Trustee will receive the fee indicated under    
"Summary of Essential Financial Information" in Prospectus Part I (which may be 
reduced as described therein). Part of the Trustee's compensation for its       
services is expected to result from the use of the funds being held in the      
Principal and Interest Accounts for future distributions, payment of expenses   
and redemptions since these Accounts are non-interest bearing to Unitholders.   
These fees are based on the outstanding principal amount of bonds and Units on  
the Date of Deposit for the first year and as of the close of business on       
January 1 for each year thereafter.                                             

   Insurance. Premiums for any portfolio insurance are obligations of an Insured
Trust and are payable monthly by the Trustee on behalf of the Trust. As bonds   
covered by a portfolio insurance policy in an Insured Trust are redeemed by     
their respective issuers or are sold by the Trustee, the amount of the premium  
will be reduced in respect of those bonds. If the Trustee exercises the right to
obtain permanent insurance, the premiums payable for such permanent insurance   
will be paid solely from the proceeds of the sale of the related bonds.         

Miscellaneous Expenses. The following additional charges are or may be    
incurred by the Trusts: (a) fees of the Trustee for extraordinary services, (b) 
expenses of the Trustee (including legal and auditing expenses) and of counsel  
designated by the Sponsor, (c) various governmental charges, (d) expenses and   
costs of any action taken by the Trustee to protect the Trusts and the rights   
and interests of Unitholders, (e) indemnification of the Trustee for any loss,  
liability or expenses incurred by it in the administration of the Trusts without
negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on its part, (f) any special        
custodial fees payable in connection with the sale of any of the bonds in a     
Trust, (g) expenditures incurred in contacting Unitholders upon termination of  
the Trusts and (h) costs incurred to reimburse the Trustee for advancing funds  
to the Trusts to meet scheduled distributions (which costs may be adjusted      
periodically in response to fluctuations in short-term interest rates). Each    
Trust will pay the costs associated with updating its registration statement    
each year. The fees and expenses set forth herein are payable out of the Trusts.
When such fees and expenses are paid by or owing to the Trustee, they are       
secured by a lien on the portfolio of the applicable Trust. If the balances in  
the Interest and Principal Accounts are insufficient to provide for amounts     
payable by a Trust, the Trustee has the power to sell bonds to pay such amounts.

Risk Factors

The Trusts include certain types of bonds described below. Accordingly, an
investment in a Trust should be made with an understanding of the               
characteristics of and risks associated with such bonds. Neither the Sponsor nor
the Trustee shall be liable in any way for any default, failure or defect in any
of the bonds.                                                                   

Consumer Product and Retail Issuers. The Trust may invest significantly in
issuers that manufacture or sell consumer products. The profitability of these  
companies will be affected by various factors including the general state of the
economy and consumer spending trends. In the past, there have been major changes
in the retail environment due to the declaration of bankruptcy by some of the   
major corporations involved in the retail industry, particularly the department 
store segment. The continued viability of the retail industry will depend on the
industry's ability to adapt and to compete in changing economic and social      
conditions, to attract and retain capable management, and to finance expansion. 
Weakness in the banking or real estate industry, a recessionary economic climate
with the consequent slowdown in employment growth, less favorable trends in     
unemployment or a marked deceleration in real disposable personal income growth 
could result in significant pressure on both consumer wealth and consumer       
confidence, adversely affecting consumer spending habits. In addition,          
competitiveness of the retail industry will require large capital outlays for   
investment in the installation of automated checkout equipment to control       
inventory, to track the sale of individual items and to gauge the success of    
sales campaigns. Increasing employee and retiree benefit costs may also have an 
adverse effect on the industry. In many sectors of the retail industry,         
competition may be fierce due to market saturation, converging consumer tastes  
and other factors. Because of these factors and the recent increase in trade    
opportunities with other countries, American retailers are now entering global  
markets which entail added risks such as sudden weakening of foreign economies, 
difficulty in adapting to local conditions and constraints and added research   
costs.                                                                          

   Financial Services Companies. The Trust may invest in issuers within the bank
and financial services sector in general.                                       

Banks and their holding companies are especially subject to the adverse   
effects of economic recession, volatile interest rates, portfolio concentrations
in geographic markets and in commercial and residential real estate loans, and  
competition from new entrants in their fields of business. Banks are highly     
dependent on net interest margin. Recently, bank profits have come under        
pressure as net interest margins have contracted, but volume gains have been    
strong in both commercial and consumer products. There is no certainty that such
conditions will continue. Banks had received significant consumer mortgage fee  
income as a result of activity in mortgage and refinance markets. As initial    
home purchasing and refinancing activity subsided as a result of increasing     
interest rates and other factors, this income diminished. Economic conditions in
the real estate markets, which have been weak in the past, can have a           
substantial effect upon banks because they generally have a portion of their    
assets invested in loans secured by real estate. Banks and their holding        
companies are subject to extensive federal regulation and, when such            
institutions are state-chartered, to state regulation as well. Such regulations 
impose strict capital requirements and limitations on the nature and extent of  
business activities that banks may pursue. Furthermore, bank regulators have a  
wide range of discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement   
authority and may substantially restrict the permissible activities of a        
particular institution if deemed to pose significant risks to the soundness of  
such institution or the safety of the federal deposit insurance fund. Regulatory
actions, such as increases in the minimum capital requirements applicable to    
banks and increases in deposit insurance premiums required to be paid by banks  
and thrifts to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC"), can          
negatively impact earnings and the ability of a company to pay dividends.       
Neither federal insurance of deposits nor governmental regulations, however,    
insures the solvency or profitability of banks or their holding companies, or   
insures against any risk of investment in the securities issued by such         
institutions.                                                                   

  The statutory requirements applicable to and regulatory supervision of banks
and their holding companies have increased significantly and have undergone     
substantial change in recent years. To a great extent, these changes are        
embodied in the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act;    
enacted in August 1989, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement   
Act of 1991, and the regulations promulgated under these laws. Many of the      
regulations promulgated pursuant to these laws have only recently been finalized
and their impact on the business, financial condition and prospects of the      
Securities in the Trust's portfolio cannot be predicted with certainty. The     
recently enacted Gramm-Leach-Bliley financial-services overhaul legislation will
allow banks, securities firms and insurance companies to form one-stop financial
conglomerates marketing a wide range of financial service products to investors.
This legislation will likely result in increased merger activity and heightened 
competition among existing and new participants in the field. Legislation to    
liberalize interstate banking has recently been signed into law. Under the      
legislation, banks will be able to purchase or establish subsidiary banks in any
state, one year after the legislation's enactment. Since mid-1997, banks have   
been allowed to turn existing banks into branches. Consolidation is likely to   
continue. The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Financial Accounting   
Standards Board require the expanded use of market value accounting by banks and
have imposed rules requiring market accounting for investment securities held in
trading accounts or available for sale. Adoption of additional such rules may   
result in increased volatility in the reported health of the industry, and      
mandated regulatory intervention to correct such problems. Additional           
legislative and regulatory changes may be forthcoming. For example, the bank    
regulatory authorities have proposed substantial changes to the Community       
Reinvestment Act and fair lending laws, rules and regulations, and there can be 
no certainty as to the effect, if any, that such changes would have on the bonds
in the Trust's portfolio. In addition, from time to time the deposit insurance  
system is reviewed by Congress and federal regulators, and proposed reforms of  
that system could, among other things, further restrict the ways in which       
deposited moneys can be used by banks or reduce the dollar amount or number of  
deposits insured for any depositor. Such reforms could reduce profitability, as 
investment opportunities available to bank institutions become more limited and 
as consumers look for savings vehicles other than bank deposits. Banks face     
significant competition from other financial institutions such as mutual funds, 
credit unions, mortgage banking companies and insurance companies, and increased
competition may result from legislative broadening of regional and national     
interstate banking powers. Among other benefits, such legislation allows banks  
and bank holding companies to acquire across previously prohibited state lines  
and to consolidate their various bank subsidiaries into one unit. Neither the   
Sponsor nor any Underwriter makes any prediction as to what, if any, manner of  
bank regulatory actions might ultimately be adopted or what ultimate effect such
actions might have on the Trust's portfolio.                                    

The Federal Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 generally prohibits a bank   
holding company from (1) acquiring, directly or indirectly, more than 5% of the 
outstanding shares of any class of voting securities of a bank or bank holding  
company, (2) acquiring control of a bank or another bank holding company, (3)   
acquiring all or substantially all the assets of a bank, or (4) merging or      
consolidating with another bank holding company, without first obtaining Federal
Reserve Board ("FRB") approval. In considering an application with respect to   
any such transaction, the FRB is required to consider a variety of factors,     
including the potential anti-competitive effects of the transaction, the        
financial condition and future prospects of the combining and resulting         
institutions, the managerial resources of the resulting institution, the        
convenience and needs of the communities the combined organization would serve, 
the record of performance of each combining organization under the Community    
Reinvestment Act and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, and the prospective      
availability to the FRB of information appropriate to determine ongoing         
regulatory compliance with applicable banking laws. In addition, the federal    
Change In Bank Control Act and various state laws impose limitations on the     
ability of one or more individuals or other entities to acquire control of banks
or bank holding companies.                                                      

The FRB has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by 
bank holding companies. In the policy statement, the FRB expressed its view that
a bank holding company experiencing earnings weaknesses should not pay cash     
dividends which exceed its net income or which could only be funded in ways that
would weaken its financial health, such as by borrowing. The FRB also may impose
limitations on the payment of dividends as a condition to its approval of       
certain applications, including applications for approval of mergers and        
acquisitions. Neither the Sponsor nor any Underwriter makes any prediction as to
the effect, if any, such laws will have on the bonds or whether such approvals, 
if necessary, will be obtained.                                                 

Companies engaged in the investment management industry are subject to the
adverse effects of economic recession, volatile interest rates, and competition 
from new entrants in their fields of business. Adverse changes in the direction 
of the stock market, investor confidence, equity transaction volume, the level  
and direction of interest rates and the outlook of emerging markets could       
adversely affect the financial stability, as well as the stock prices, of these 
companies. Additionally, competitive pressures, including increased competition 
with new and existing competitors, the ongoing commoditization of traditional   
businesses and the need for increased capital expenditures on new technology    
could adversely impact the profit margins of companies in the investment        
management and brokerage industries. Companies involved in the investment       
management industry are also subject to extensive regulation by government      
agencies and self-regulatory organizations, and changes in laws, regulations or 
rules, or in the interpretation of such laws, regulations and rules could       
adversely affect such companies.                                                

   Companies involved in the insurance, reinsurance and risk management industry
underwrite, sell or distribute property, casualty and business insurance. Many  
factors affect insurance, reinsurance and risk management company profits,      
including but not limited to interest rate movements, the imposition of premium 
rate caps, a misapprehension of the risks involved in given underwritings,      
competition and pressure to compete globally, weather catastrophes or other     
disasters and the effects of client mergers. Individual companies may be exposed
to material risks including reserve inadequacy and the inability to collect from
reinsurance carriers. Insurance companies are subject to extensive governmental 
regulation, including the imposition of maximum rate levels, which may not be   
adequate for some lines of business. Proposed or potential tax law changes may  
also adversely affect insurance companies' policy sales, tax obligations and    
profitability. In addition to the foregoing, profit margins of these companies  
continue to shrink due to the commoditization of traditional businesses, new    
competitors, capital expenditures on new technology and the pressure to compete 
globally.                                                                       

In addition to the normal risks of business, companies involved in the    
insurance and risk management industry are subject to significant risk factors, 
including those applicable to regulated insurance companies, such as:           

o    the inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing          
       property-liability loss reserves, and the fact that ultimate losses
         could materially exceed established loss reserves, which could have a
  material adverse effect on results of operations and financial
condition;                                                  

o    the fact that insurance companies have experienced, and can be   
          expected in the future to experience, catastrophic losses, which could
         have a material adverse impact on their financial conditions, results
of operations and cash flow;                                

o    the inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing          
   property-liability loss reserves due to changes in loss payment
patterns caused by new claim settlement practices;          

  o    the need for insurance companies and their subsidiaries to maintain
        appropriate levels of statutory capital and surplus, particularly in
  light of continuing scrutiny by rating organizations and state
         insurance regulatory authorities, and in order to maintain acceptable
financial strength or claims-paying ability ratings;        

    o    the extensive regulation and supervision to which insurance companies
are subject, and various regulatory and other legal actions;

    o    the adverse impact that increases in interest rates could have on the
   value of an insurance company's investment portfolio and on the
attractiveness of certain of its products; and              

     o    the uncertainty involved in estimating the availability of reinsurance
and the collectibility of reinsurance recoverables.         

   The state insurance regulatory framework has, during recent years, come under
increased federal scrutiny, and certain state legislatures have considered or   
enacted laws that alter and, in many cases, increase state authority to regulate
insurance companies and insurance holding company systems. Further, the National
Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC") and state insurance regulators  
are re-examining existing laws and regulations, specifically focusing on        
insurance companies, interpretations of existing laws and the development of new
laws. In addition, Congress and certain federal agencies have investigated the  
condition of the insurance industry in the United States to determine whether to
promulgate additional federal regulation. The Sponsor is unable to predict      
whether any state or federal legislation will be enacted to change the nature or
scope of regulation of the insurance industry, or what effect, if any, such     
legislation would have on the industry.                                         

All insurance companies are subject to state laws and regulations that    
require diversification of their investment portfolios and limit the amount of  
investments in certain investment categories. Failure to comply with these laws 
and regulations would cause non-conforming investments to be treated as         
non-admitted assets for purposes of measuring statutory surplus and, in some    
instances, would require divestiture.                                           

 Telecommunications Issuers. Because your Trust may be concentrated in bonds
issued by telecommunications companies, the value of the Units may be           
susceptible to factors affecting the telecommunications industry. The           
telecommunications industry is subject to governmental regulation, and the      
products and services of telecommunications companies may be subject to rapid   
obsolescence. These factors could affect the value of Units. Telephone companies
in the United States, for example, are subject to both state and federal        
regulations affecting permitted rates of returns and the kinds of services that 
may be offered. Certain types of companies represented in a portfolio are       
engaged in fierce competition for a share of the market of their products. As a 
result, competitive pressures are intense and the stocks are subject to rapid   
price volatility.                                                               

Several recent high-profile bankruptcies of large telecommunications      
companies have illustrated the potentially unstable condition of                
telecommunications companies. High debt loads that were accumulated during the  
industry growth spurt of the 1990s are catching up to the industry, causing debt
and stock prices to trade at distressed levels for many telecommunications      
companies and increasing the cost of capital for needed additional investment.  
At the same time, demand for some telecommunications services has fallen        
sharply, as several key markets have become oversaturated, some local customers 
have switched to substitute providers and technologies, and corporate profits   
and the economy generally remain weak. To meet increasing competition, companies
may have to commit substantial capital, particularly in the formulation of new  
products and services using new technologies. As a result, many companies have  
been compelled to cut costs by reducing their workforce, outsourcing,           
consolidating and/or closing existing facilities and divesting low selling      
product lines. Furthermore, certain companies involved in the industry have also
faced scrutiny for alleged accounting irregularities that may have led to the   
overstatement of their financial results, and other companies in the industry   
may face similar scrutiny. Due to these and other factors, the risk level of    
owning the securities of telecommunications companies has increased             
substantially and may continue to rise.                                         

  While a portfolio may concentrate on the securities of established suppliers
of traditional telecommunication products and services, a Trust may also invest 
in bonds of smaller telecommunications companies which may benefit from the     
development of new products and services. These smaller companies may present   
greater opportunities for capital appreciation, and may also involve greater    
risk than large, established issuers. Such smaller companies may have limited   
product lines, market or financial resources, and their securities may trade    
less frequently and in limited volume than the securities of larger, more       
established companies. As a result, the prices of the securities of such smaller
companies may fluctuate to a greater degree than the prices of securities of    
other issuers.                                                                  

In addition, recent federal legislation governing the United States       
telecommunications industry remains subject to judicial review and additional   
interpretation, which may adversely affect the companies whose securities are   
held by a Trust.                                                                

Taxable Municipal Issues. Certain bonds in a Trust may consist of taxable 
obligations of municipal issuers. Obligations of municipal issuers can be either
general obligations of a government entity that are backed by the taxing power  
of such entity or revenue bonds payable from the income of a specific project or
authority and are not supported by the issuer's power to levy taxes.            

General obligation bonds are backed by the general taxing power of the    
issuer. The issuer secures these bonds by pledging its faith, credit and        
unlimited taxing power for the payment of principal and interest.               

Revenue bonds are payable only from the revenue of a specific project or  
authority. They are not supported by the issuer's general power to levy taxes.  
The risk of default in payment of interest or principal increases if the income 
of the related project falters because that income is the only source of        
payment. All of the following bonds are revenue bonds.                          

 Airport bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate airports. The
ability of the issuer to make payments on these bonds primarily depends on the  
ability of airlines to meet their obligations under use agreements. Due to      
increased competition, deregulation, increased fuel costs and other factors,    
some airlines may have difficulty meeting these obligations.                    

 Bond banks are vehicles that pool various municipal obligations into larger
offerings. This reduces the cost of borrowing for the municipalities. The types 
of financing projects that these obligations support vary.                      

Certificates of participation are generally a type of municipal lease     
obligation. Lease payments of a governmental entity secure payments on these    
bonds. These payments depend on the governmental entity budgeting appropriations
for the lease payments. A governmental body cannot obligate future governments  
to appropriate for or make lease payments, but governments typically promise to 
take action necessary to include lease payments in their budgets. If a          
government fails to budget for or make lease payments, sufficient funds may not 
exist to pay interest or principal on these bonds.                              

Health care bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenue from     
hospitals and hospital systems. The ability of these issuers to make payments on
bonds depends on factors such as facility occupancy levels, demand for services,
competition resulting from hospital mergers and affiliations, the need to reduce
costs, government regulation, costs of malpractice insurance and claims, and    
government financial assistance (such as Medicare and Medicaid).                

 Higher education bonds are obligations of issuers that operate universities
and colleges. These issuers derive revenues from tuition, dormitories, grants   
and endowments. These issuers face problems related to declines in the number of
college-age individuals, possible inability to raise tuitions and fees,         
uncertainty of continued federal grants, state funding or donations, and        
government legislation or regulation.                                           

   Industrial revenue bonds finance the cost of acquiring, building or improving
industrial projects. Private corporations usually operate these projects. The   
ability of the issuer to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as
the creditworthiness of the corporation operating the project, revenues         
generated by the project, expenses of the project and environmental or other    
regulatory restrictions.                                                        

Multi-family housing bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues
from mortgage loans on multiple family residences, retirement housing or housing
projects for low to moderate-income families. These bonds are generally         
pre-payable at any time. It is likely that their life will be less than their   
stated maturity. The ability of these issuers to make payments on bonds depends 
on such factors as rental income, occupancy levels, operating expenses, mortgage
default rates, taxes, government regulations and appropriation of subsidies.    

Other care bonds include obligations of issuers that derive revenue from  
mental health facilities, nursing homes and intermediate care facilities. These 
bonds are similar to health care bonds and the issuers face the same general    
risks.                                                                          

Public building bonds finance the cost of acquiring, leasing, building or 
improving public buildings such as offices, recreation facilities, convention   
centers, police stations, correctional institutions and parking garages. The    
ability of the issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such  
as the government budgeting sufficient funds to make lease or mortgage payments 
on the facility, user fees or rents, costs of maintenance and decreases in use  
of the facility.                                                                

Public education bonds are obligations of issuers that operate primary and
secondary schools. The ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds 
depends primarily on ad valorem taxes. These issuers may also face problems     
related to litigation contesting state constitutionality of public education    
financing.                                                                      

Retail electric/gas/telephone bonds are obligations of issuers that derive
revenues from the retail sale of utilities to customers. The ability of these   
issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the rates and
demand for these utilities, competition, government regulation and rate         
approvals, overhead expenses and the cost of fuels.                             

 Single family housing bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues
from mortgage loans on single family residences. Single family residences       
generally include one to four-family dwellings. These bonds are similar to      
multi-family housing bonds and the issuers face the same general risks.         

 Tax district bonds are obligations secured by a pledge of taxing power by a
municipality, such as tax increment financing or tax allocation bonds. These    
bonds are similar to general obligation bonds. Unlike general obligation bonds, 
however, the municipality does not pledge its unlimited taxing power to pay     
these bonds. Instead, the municipality pledges revenues from a specific tax to  
pay these bonds. If the tax cannot support payment of interest and principal, a 
municipality may need to raise the related tax to pay these bonds. An inability 
to raise the tax could have an adverse affect on these bonds.                   

 Transportation bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate public
transit systems, ports, highways, turnpikes, bridges and other transportation   
systems. The ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on
variations in use, the degree of government subsidization, competition from     
other forms of transportation and increased costs. Port authorities derive      
revenues primarily from fees imposed on ships using the port facilities. These  
fees can fluctuate depending on the local economy and competition from air, rail
and truck transportation. Increased fuel costs, alternative transportation modes
and competition from toll-free bridges and roads will impact revenues of issuers
that operate bridges, roads or tunnels.                                         

Waste disposal bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from 
resource recovery facilities. These facilities process solid waste, generate    
steam and convert steam to electricity. These issuers face problems such as     
costs and delays due to environmental concerns, effects of conservation and     
recycling, destruction or condemnation of a project, void or unenforceable      
contracts, changes in the economic availability of raw materials, operating     
supplies or facilities, and other unavoidable changes that adversely affect     
operation of a project.                                                         

Water and sewer bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from
user fees from the sale of water and sewerage services. These issuers face      
problems such as the ability to obtain rate increases, population declines,     
difficulties in obtaining new fresh water supplies and "no-growth" zoning       
ordinances. These issuers also face many of the same problems of waste disposal 
issuers.                                                                        

   Wholesale electric bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from
selling electricity to other utilities. The ability of these issuers to make    
payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the rates and demand for     
electric utilities, competition, overhead expenses and government regulation and
rate approvals.                                                                 

Zero Coupon Bonds. Certain of the bonds in a Trust may be "zero coupon"   
bonds. Zero coupon bonds are purchased at a deep discount because the buyer     
receives only the right to receive a final payment at the maturity of the bond  
and does not receive any periodic interest payments. The effect of owning deep  
discount bonds which do not make current interest payments (such as the zero    
coupon bonds) is that a fixed yield is earned not only on the original          
investment but also, in effect, on all discount earned during the life of such  
income on the bond at a rate as high as the implicit yield on the discount bond,
but at the same time eliminates the holder's ability to reinvest at higher rates
in the future. For this reason, zero coupon bonds are subject to substantially  
greater price fluctuations during periods of changing market interest rates than
are securities of comparable quality which pay interest.                        

Insurance on the Bonds in an Insured Trust

  Insurance has been obtained by each Insured Trust, by the issuer of bonds in
each Insured Trust, by a prior owner of such bonds, or by the Sponsor prior the 
deposit of such bonds guaranteeing prompt payment of interest and principal,    
when due, in respect of the bonds in such Insured Trust. See "The
Trusts--Objective and Bond Selection" in the prospectus. Each insurance policy  
obtained by an Insured Trust, is non-cancelable and will continue in force so   
long as such Insured Trust is in existence, the respective Portfolio Insurer is 
still in business and the bonds described in such policy continue to be held by 
such Insured Trust (see "Portfolio" for the Trust in the Prospectus Part I).    
Non-payment of premiums on a policy obtained by an Insured Trust will not result
in the cancellation of insurance but will force the insurer to take action      
against the Trustee to recover premium payments due it. The Trustee in turn will
be entitled to recover such payments from such Insured Trust. Premium rates for 
each issue of bonds protected by the policy obtained by an Insured Trust are    
fixed for the life of an Insured Trust. The premium for any insurance policy or 
policies obtained by an issuer of bonds has been paid by such issuer, and any   
such policy or policies are non-cancelable and will continue in force so long as
the bonds so insured are outstanding and the Portfolio Insurer remains in       
business. If the provider of an original issuance insurance policy is unable to 
meet its obligations under such policy or if the rating assigned to the         
claims-paying ability of any such insurer deteriorates, the Portfolio Insurers  
have no obligation to insure any issue adversely affected by either of the above
described events.                                                               

   The aforementioned Trust insurance guarantees the timely payment of principal
and interest on the bonds as they fall due. For the purposes of the Portfolio   
Insurance, "when due" generally means the stated maturity date for the payment  
of principal and interest. However, in the event (a) an issuer of a bond        
defaults in the payment of principal or interest on such bond, (b) such issuer  
enters into a bankruptcy proceeding or (c) the maturity of such bond is         
accelerated, the Portfolio Insurer involved has the option, in its sole         
discretion, for a limited period of time after receiving notice of the earliest 
to occur of such a default, bankruptcy proceeding or acceleration to pay the    
outstanding principal amount of such bond plus accrued interest to the date of  
such payment and thereby retire the bond from an Insured Trust prior to such    
bond's stated maturity date. The insurance does not guarantee the market value  
of the bonds or the value of the Units. Insurance obtained by an Insured Trust  
is only effective as to bonds owned by and held in such Insured Trust. In the   
event of a sale of any such bond by the Trustee, such insurance terminates as to
such bond on the date of sale.                                                  

   Pursuant to an irrevocable commitment of the Portfolio Insurers, the Trustee,
upon the sale of a bond covered under a portfolio insurance policy obtained by  
an Insured Trust, has the right to obtain permanent insurance with respect to   
such bond (i.e., insurance to maturity of the bonds regardless of the identity  
of the holder thereof) (the "Permanent Insurance") upon the payment of a single 
predetermined insurance premium and any expenses related thereto from the       
proceeds of the sale of such bond. Accordingly, any bond in an Insured Trust is 
eligible to be sold on an insured basis. It is expected that the Trustee would  
exercise the right to obtain Permanent Insurance only if upon such exercise an  
Insured Trust would receive net proceeds (sale of bond proceeds less the        
insurance premium and related expenses attributable to the Permanent Insurance) 
from such sale in excess of the sale proceeds if such bonds were sold on an     
uninsured basis.The insurance premium with respect to each bond eligible for    
Permanent Insurance would be determined based upon the insurability of each bond
as of the Date of Deposit and would not be increased or decreased for any change
in the creditworthiness of each bond.                                           

The Sponsor believes that the Permanent Insurance option provides an      
advantage to an Insured Trust in that each bond insured by an Insured Trust     
insurance policy may be sold out of the Insured Trust with the benefits of the  
insurance attaching thereto. Thus, the value of the insurance, if any, at the   
time of sale, can be realized in the market value of the bond so sold (which is 
not the case in connection with any value attributable to such Insured Trust's  
portfolio insurance). See "Public Offering--Offering Price" in the Prospectus   
Part II. Because any such insurance value may be realized in the market value of
the bond upon the sale thereof upon exercise of the Permanent Insurance option, 
the Sponsor anticipates that (a) in the event an Insured Trust were to be       
comprised of a substantial percentage of bonds in default or significant risk of
default, it is much less likely that the Insured Trust would need at some point 
in time to seek a suspension of redemptions of Units than if the Insured Trust  
were to have no such option (see "Rights of Unitholders--Redemption of Units" in
the Prospectus Part II) and (b) at the time of termination of an Insured Trust, 
if the Insured Trust were holding defaulted bonds or bonds in significant risk  
of default, the Insured Trust would not need to hold such bonds until their     
respective maturities in order to realize the benefits of the Insured Trust's   
portfolio insurance. (See "Trust Administration--Termination of Trust Agreement"
in the Prospectus Part II.)                                                     

Except as indicated below, insurance obtained by an Insured Trust has no  
effect on the price or redemption value of Units. It is the present intention of
the Evaluator to attribute a value for such insurance (including the right to   
obtain Permanent Insurance) for the purpose of computing the price or redemption
value of Units if the bonds covered by such insurance are in default in payment 
of principal or interest or in significant risk of such default. The value of   
the insurance will be equal to the difference between (i) the market value of a 
bond which is in default in payment of principal or interest or in significant  
risk of such default assuming the exercise of the right to obtain Permanent     
Insurance (less the insurance premium and related expenses attributable to the  
purchase of Permanent Insurance) and (ii) the market value of such bond not     
covered by Permanent Insurance. See "Public Offering--Offering Price" in the    
Prospectus Part II for a more complete description of an Insured Trust's method 
of valuing defaulted bonds which have a significant risk of default.            

Ambac Assurance Corporation ("Ambac Assurance"). Effective July 14, 1997, 
AMBAC Indemnity Corporation changed its name to Ambac Assurance Corporation. The
Insurance Policy of Ambac Assurance obtained by an Insured Trust is             
noncancelable and will continue in force for so long as the bonds described in  
the Insurance Policy are held by an Insured Trust. A monthly premium is paid by 
an Insured Trust for the Insurance Policy obtained by it. The Trustee will pay, 
when due, successively, the full amount of each installment of the insurance    
premium. Pursuant to a binding agreement with Ambac Assurance, in the event of a
sale of a bond covered by the Ambac Assurance Insurance Policy, the Trustee has 
the right to obtain permanent insurance for such bond upon payment of a single  
predetermined premium from the proceeds of the sale of such bond.               

   Under the terms of the Insurance Policy, Ambac Assurance agrees to pay to the
Trustee that portion of the principal of and interest on the bonds insured by   
Ambac Assurance which shall become due for payment but shall be unpaid by reason
of nonpayment by the issuer of the bonds. The term "due for payment" means, when
referring to the principal of a bond so insured, its stated maturity date or the
date on which it shall have been called for mandatory sinking fund redemption   
and does not refer to any earlier date on which payment is due by reason of call
for redemption (other than by mandatory sinking fund redemption), acceleration  
or other advancement of maturity and means, when referring to interest on a     
bond, the stated date for payment of interest.                                  

 Ambac Assurance will make payment to the Trustee not later than thirty days
after notice from the Trustee is received by Ambac Assurance that a nonpayment  
of principal or of interest on a bond has occurred, but not earlier that the    
date on which the bonds are due for payment. Ambac Assurance will disburse to   
the Trustee the face amount of principal and interest which is then due for     
payment but is unpaid by reason of nonpayment by the issuer in exchange for     
delivery of bonds, not less in face amount than the amount of the payment in    
bearer form, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances and uncancelled. In   
cases where bonds are issuable only in a form whereby principal is payable to   
registered holders or their assigns, Ambac Assurance shall pay principal only   
upon presentation and surrender of the unpaid bonds uncancelled and free of any 
adverse claim, together with an instrument of assignment in satisfactory form,  
so as to permit ownership of such bonds to be registered in the name of Ambac   
Assurance or its nominee. In cases where bonds are issuable only in a form      
whereby interest is payable to registered holders or their assigns, Ambac       
Assurance shall pay interest only upon presentation of proof that the claimant  
is the person entitled to the payment of interest of the bonds and delivery of  
an instrument of assignment, in satisfactory form, transferring to Ambac        
Assurance all right under such bonds to receive the interest of which the       
insurance payment was made.

each financial guaranty insurer, including Financial Guaranty, to financial     
guaranty insurance and certain related lines.

XLCA is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of XL Capital Ltd, a Cayman   
Islands corporation ("XL Capital Ltd"). Through its subsidiaries, XL Capital Ltd
is a leading provider of insurance and reinsurance coverages and financial      
products to industrial, commercial and professional service firms, insurance    
companies and other enterprises on a worldwide basis. The common stock of XL    
Capital Ltd is publicly traded in the United States and listed on the New York  
Stock Exchange (NYSE: XL). XL Capital Ltd is not obligated to pay the debts of  
or claims against XLCA.                                                         

 XLCA was formerly known as The London Assurance of America Inc. ("London"),
which was incorporated on July 25, 1991 under the laws of the State of New York.
On February 22, 2001, XL Reinsurance America Inc. ("XL Re") acquired 100% of the
stock of London. XL Re merged its former financial guaranty subsidiary, known as
XL Capital Assurance Inc. (formed September 13, 1999) with and into London, with
London as the surviving entity. London immediately changed its name to XL       
Capital Assurance Inc. All previous business of London was 100% reinsured to    
Royal Indemnity Company, the previous owner at the time of acquisition.         

   XLCA has entered into a facultative quota share reinsurance agreement with XL
Financial Assurance Ltd ("XLFA"), an insurance company organized under the laws 
of Bermuda, and an affiliate of XLCA. Pursuant to this reinsurance agreement,   
XLCA expects to cede up to 90% of its business to XLFA. XLCA may also cede      
reinsurance to third parties on a transaction-specific basis, which cessions may
be any or a combination of quota share, first loss or excess of loss. Such      
reinsurance is used by XLCA as a risk management device and to comply with      
statutory and rating agency requirements and does not alter or XLCA's           
obligations under any financial guaranty insurance policy. With respect to any  
transaction insured by XLCA, the percentage of risk ceded to XLFA may be less   
than 90% depending on certain factors including, without limitation, whether    
XLCA has obtained third party reinsurance covering the risk. As a result, there 
can be no assurance as to the percentage reinsured by XLFA of any given         
financial guaranty insurance policy issued by XLCA, including the Certificate   
Insurance Policy.

determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the   
United States. XLFA's insurance financial strength is rated "Aaa" by Moody's and
"AAA" by S&P and Fitch Inc. In addition, XLFA has obtained a financial          
enhancement rating of "AAA" from S&P.                                           

The obligations of XLFA to XLCA under the reinsurance agreement described 
above are unconditionally guaranteed by XL Insurance (Bermuda) Ltd ("XLI"), a   
Bermuda company and one of the world's leading excess commercial insurers. XLI

rating is "Aa2" by Moody's, "AA-" by Standard & Poor's and "AA" by Fitch.       

XLCA's insurance financial strength is rated "Aaa" by Moody's and "AAA" by
Standard & Poor's and Fitch, Inc. ("Fitch"). In addition, XLCA has obtained a   
financial enhancement rating of "AAA" from Standard & Poor's. These ratings     
reflect Moody's, Standard & Poor's and Fitch's current assessment of XLCA's     
creditworthiness and claims-paying ability as well as the reinsurance           
arrangement with XLFA described above.

regulations of the other jurisdictions in which it is licensed. As a financial

requirements, establishes contingency, loss and unearned premium reserve

The extent of state insurance regulation and supervision varies by        
jurisdiction, but New York and most other jurisdictions have laws and           
regulations prescribing permitted investments and governing the payment of      
dividends, transactions with affiliates, mergers, consolidations, acquisitions  
or sales of assets and incurrence of liabilities for borrowings.

adequacy of such information, or as to the existence of any adverse changes in

CDC IXIS Financial Guaranty North America, Inc. ("CFIGNA") is a monoline  
financial guaranty insurance company incorporated under the laws of the State of
New York, with its principal place of business in New York City.                

The claims-paying ability (also referred to as its financial strength) of 
CIFGNA is rated "AAA" by Fitch, "Aaa" by Moody's, and "AAA" by Standard and     
Poor's, the highest rating assigned by each such rating agency. Each rating of  
CIFGNA should be evaluated independently. The ratings reflect the respective    
rating agency's current assessment of the creditworthiness of CIFGNA and its    
ability to pay claims on its policies of insurance based upon, among other      
factors, the adequacy of the net worth maintenance and reinsurance agreements   
provided by CIFGNA described below. Any further explanation as to the           
significance of the above ratings may be obtained only from the applicable      
rating agency. The above ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold   
CIFGNA insured bonds, and such ratings may be subject to revision or withdrawal 
at any time by the Rating Agencies. Any downward revision or withdrawal of any  
of the above ratings may have an adverse effect on the market price of the      
CIFGNA insured bonds. CIFGNA does not guarantee the market price of bonds nor   
does it guaranty that the ratings on bonds will not be revised or withdrawn.    

CIFGNA is licensed and subject to regulation as a financial guaranty      
insurance corporation under the laws of the State of New York, its state of     
domicile, and is licensed to do business in over 40 jurisdictions. CIFGNA is    
subject to Article 69 of the New York Insurance Law which, among other things,  
limits the business of such insurers to financial guaranty insurance and related
lines, requires that each such insurer maintain a minimum surplus to            
policyholders, establishes contingency, loss and unearned premium reserve       
requirements for each such insurer, and limits the size of individual           
transactions ("single risks") and the volume of transactions ("aggregate risks")
that may be underwritten by such insurers. Other provisions of the New York     
Insurance Law applicable to non-life insurance companies such as CIFGNA         
regulate, among other things, permitted investments, payment of dividends,      
transactions with affiliates, mergers, consolidations, acquisitions or sales of 
assets and incurrence of liabilities for borrowings. CIFGNA is required to file 
quarterly and annual statutory financial statements with the New York State     
Insurance Department ("NYSID") and is subject to statutory restrictions         
concerning the types and quality of its investments and the filing and use of   
policy forms and premium rates. Additionally, CIFGNA's accounts and operations  
are subject to periodic examination by the NYSID.                               

THE INSURANCE PROVIDED BY CIFGNA IS NOT COVERED BY THE PROPERTY/CASUALTY  
INSURANCE SECURITY FUND SPECIFIED BY THE INSURANCE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW     
YORK.                                                                           

In addition to its capital and surplus as set forth below, CIFGNA is      
supported by a net worth maintenance agreement from its indirect parent, CDC    
IXIS Financial Guaranty, a French reinsurance corporation ("CIFG"). The net     
worth maintenance agreement provides that CIFG will maintain CIFGNA's U.S.      
statutory capital and surplus at no less than $80 million. In addition, through 
a facultative reinsurance agreement, CIFGNA may cede up to 90% of its exposure  
on each transaction to CIFG; however, the facultative reinsurance agreement does
not require that CIFG reinsure its exposure under any transaction. CIFG's       
claims-paying ability is rated "Aaa" by Moodys, "AAA" by Standard & Poor's and  
"AAA" by Fitch, the highest rating assigned by each such Rating Agency.         
Notwithstanding these net worth maintenance and reinsurance agreements, the     
holders of bonds insured by CIFGNA will have direct recourse against CIFGNA     
only, and neither CIFG nor any other affiliate of CIFGNA will be directly liable
to the holders of such bonds.                                                   

 The following table sets forth the capitalization of CIFGNA as of September

The extent of state insurance regulation and supervision varies by        
jurisdiction, but New York and most other jurisdictions have laws and           
regulations prescribing permitted investments and governing the payment of      
dividends, transactions with affiliates, mergers, consolidations, acquisitions  
or sales of assets and incurrence of liabilities for borrowings.                

  In the event of nonpayment of interest or principal, when due, in respect of
a bond, a Portfolio Insurer shall make such payment after the respective insurer
has been notified that such nonpayment has occurred or is threatened (but not   
earlier than the date such payment is due). The insurer, as regards any payment 
it may make, will succeed to the rights of the Trustee in respect thereof. All  
policies issued by the Portfolio Insurers and the Preinsured Bond Insurers are  
substantially identical insofar as obligations to an Insured Trust are          
concerned.                                                                      

   The information relating to each Portfolio Insurer has been furnished by such
companies. The financial information with respect to each Portfolio Insurer     
appears in reports filed with state insurance regulatory authorities and is     
subject to audit and review by such authorities. No representation is made      
herein as to the accuracy or adequacy of such information or as to the absence  
of material adverse changes in such information subsequent to the dates thereof.

Portfolio Administration

   The Trustee is empowered to sell, for the purpose of redeeming Units tendered
by any Unitholder, and for the payment of expenses for which funds may not be   
available, such of the bonds designated by the Supervisor as the Trustee in its 
sole discretion may deem necessary. The Supervisor, in designating such bonds,  
will consider a variety of factors, including (a) interest rates, (b) market    
value and (c) marketability. To the extent that bonds are sold which are current
in payment of principal and interest in order to meet redemption requests and   
defaulted bonds are retained in the portfolio in order to preserve the related  
insurance protection applicable to said bonds, if any, the overall quality of   
the bonds remaining in a Trust's portfolio will tend to diminish. The Sponsor is
empowered, but not obligated, to direct the Trustee to dispose of bonds in the  
event of an advanced refunding.                                                 

 The Sponsor is required to instruct the Trustee to reject any offer made by
an issuer of any of the bonds to issue new bonds in exchange or substitution for
any bond pursuant to a refunding or refinancing plan, except that the Sponsor   
may instruct the Trustee to accept or reject such an offer or to take any other 
action with respect thereto as the Sponsor may deem proper if (1) the issuer is 
in default with respect to such bond or (2) in the written opinion of the       
Sponsor the issuer will probably default with respect to such bond in the       
reasonably foreseeable future. Any bond so received in exchange or substitution 
will be held by the Trustee subject to the terms and conditions of the Trust    
Agreement to the same extent as bonds originally deposited thereunder. Within   
five days after the deposit of obligations in exchange or substitution for      
underlying bonds, the Trustee is required to give notice thereof to each        
Unitholder, identifying the bonds eliminated and the bonds substituted therefor.
Except as stated herein and under "Trust Administration--Replacement Bonds" in  
the Prospectus Part II regarding the substitution of Replacement Bonds for      
Failed Bonds, the acquisition by a Trust of any bonds other than the bonds      
initially deposited is not permitted.                                           

   If any default in the payment of principal or interest on any bond occurs and
no provision for payment is made therefor either pursuant to the portfolio      
insurance, or otherwise, within 30 days, the Trustee is required to notify the  
Sponsor thereof. If the Sponsor fails to instruct the Trustee to sell or to hold
such bonds within 30 days after notification by the Trustee to the Sponsor of   
such default, the Trustee may in its discretion sell the defaulted Bond and not 
be liable for any depreciation or loss thereby incurred.

financial responsibility of the Sponsor and its ability to carry out its

available by the Sponsor upon request.)                                         

  Van Kampen Funds Inc. and your Trust have adopted a code of ethics requiring
Van Kampen's employees who have access to information on Trust transactions to  
report personal securities transactions. The purpose of the code is to avoid    
potential conflicts of interest and to prevent fraud, deception or misconduct   
with respect to your Trust.                                                     

If the Sponsor shall fail to perform any of its duties under the Trust    
Agreement or become incapable of acting or shall become bankrupt or its affairs 
are taken over by public authorities, then the Trustee may (i) appoint a        
successor Sponsor at rates of compensation deemed by the Trustee to be          
reasonable and not exceeding amounts prescribed by the Securities and Exchange  
Commission, (ii) terminate the Trust Agreement and liquidate the Trusts as      
provided therein or (iii) continue to act as Trustee without terminating the    
Trust Agreement.                                                                

Trustee Information

   The Trustee is The Bank of New York, a trust company organized under the laws
of New York. The Bank of New York has its principal unit investment trust       
division offices at 2 Hanson Place, 12th Floor, Brooklyn, New York 11217,       
telephone (800) 221-7668. The Bank of New York is subject to supervision and    
examination by the Superintendent of Banks of the State of New York and the     
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and its deposits are insured  
by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to the extent permitted by law.    

The duties of the Trustee are primarily ministerial in nature. It did not 
participate in the selection of bonds for the portfolios of any of the Trusts.  
In accordance with the Trust Agreement, the Trustee shall keep proper books of  
record and account of all transactions at its office for the Trusts. Such       
records shall include the name and address of, and the certificates issued by   
the Trusts to, every Unitholder of the Trusts. Such books and records shall be  
open to inspection by any Unitholder at all reasonable times during the usual   
business hours. The Trustee shall make such annual or other reports as may from 
time to time be required under any applicable state or Federal statute, rule or 
regulation. The Trustee is required to keep a certified copy or duplicate       
original of the Trust Agreement on file in its office available for inspection  
at all reasonable times during the usual business hours by any Unitholder,      
together with a current list of the bonds held in the Trusts.                   

Under the Trust Agreement, the Trustee or any successor trustee may resign
and be discharged of the trusts created by the Trust Agreement by executing an  
instrument in writing and filing the same with the Sponsor. The Trustee or      
successor trustee must mail a copy of the notice of resignation to all          
Unitholders then of record, not less than 60 days before the date specified in  
such notice when such resignation is to take effect. The Sponsor upon receiving 
notice of such resignation is obligated to appoint a successor trustee promptly.
If, upon such resignation, no successor trustee has been appointed and has      
accepted the appointment within 30 days after notification, the retiring Trustee
may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a         
successor. The Sponsor may remove the Trustee and appoint a successor trustee as
provided in the Trust Agreement at any time with or without cause. Notice of    
such removal and appointment shall be mailed to each Unitholder by the Sponsor. 
Upon execution of a written acceptance of such appointment by such successor    
trustee, all the rights, powers, duties and bonds of the original trustee shall 
vest in the successor. The resignation or removal of a Trustee becomes effective
only when the successor trustee accepts its appointment as such or when a court 
of competent jurisdiction appoints a successor trustee. Any corporation into    
which a Trustee may be merged or with which it may be consolidated, or any      
corporation resulting from any merger or consolidation to which a Trustee shall 
be a party, shall be the successor trustee. The Trustee must be a banking       
corporation organized under the laws of the United States or any state and      
having at all times an aggregate capital, surplus and undivided profits of not  
less than $5,000,000.                                                           

Taxation

The prospectus contains a discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax   
issues concerning your Trust and the purchase, ownership and disposition of     
Trust Units. The discussion below supplements the prospectus discussion and is  
qualified in its entirety by the prospectus discussion. Prospective investors   
should consult their own tax advisors with regard to the federal tax            
consequences of the purchase, ownership, or disposition of Trust Units, as well 
as the tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, locality, non-U.S. 
country, or other taxing jurisdiction.                                          

 The federal income tax summary below and in the prospectus is based in part
on the advice of counsel to your Trust. The Internal Revenue Service could      
disagree with any conclusions set forth in these discussions. In addition, our  
counsel was not asked to review, and has not reached a conclusion with respect  
to the federal income tax treatment of the assets to be held by your Trust. This
may not be sufficient for prospective investors to use for the purpose of       
avoiding penalties under federal tax law.                                       

 Your Trust intends (i) to elect and (ii) to qualify annually as a regulated
investment company under the Code and to comply with applicable distribution    
requirements so that it will not pay federal income tax on income and capital   
gains distributed to its Unitholders.                                           

To qualify for the favorable U.S. federal income tax treatment generally  
accorded to regulated investment companies, your Trust must, among other things,
(a) derive in each taxable year at least 90% of its gross income from dividends,
interest, payments with respect to securities loans and gains from the sale or  
other disposition of stock, securities or foreign currencies or other income    
derived with respect to its business of investing in such stock, securities or  
currencies, and net income from certain publicly traded partnerships; (b)       
diversify its holdings so that, at the end of each quarter of the taxable year, 
(i) at least 50% of the market value of the Trust's assets is represented by    
cash and cash items (including receivables), U.S. government securities, the    
securities of other regulated investment companies and other securities, with   
such other securities of any one issuer generally limited for the purposes of   
this calculation to an amount not greater than 5% of the value of the Trust's   
total assets and not greater than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of   
such issuer, and (ii) not more than 25% of the value of its total assets is     
invested in the securities (other than U.S. government securities or the        
securities of other regulated investment companies) of any one issuer, or two or
more issuers which the Trust controls and are engaged in the same, similar or   
related trades or businesses, or the securities of certain publicly traded      
partnerships; and (c) distribute at least 90% of its investment company taxable 
income (which includes, among other items, dividends, interest and net          
short-term capital gains in excess of net long-term capital losses but excludes 
net capital gain, if any) and at least 90% of its net tax-exempt interest income
each taxable year.                                                              

 As a regulated investment company, your Trust generally will not be subject
to U.S. federal income tax on its investment company taxable income (as that    
term is defined in the Code, but without regard to the deduction for dividends  
paid) and net capital gain (the excess of net long-term capital gain over net   
short-term capital loss), if any, that it distributes to Unitholders. Your Trust
intends to distribute to its Unitholders, at least annually, substantially all  
of its investment company taxable income and net capital gain. If your Trust    
retains any net capital gain or investment company taxable income, it will      
generally be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates on the    
amount retained. In addition, amounts not distributed on a timely basis in      
accordance with a calendar year distribution requirement are subject to a       
nondeductible 4% excise tax unless, generally, your Trust distributes during    
each calendar year an amount equal to the sum of (1) at least 98% of its        
ordinary income (not taking into account any capital gains or losses) for the   
calendar year, (2) at least 98% of its capital gains in excess of its capital   
losses (adjusted for certain ordinary losses) for the one-year period ending    
October 31 of the calendar year, and (3) any ordinary income and capital gains  
for previous years that were not distributed during those years. To prevent     
application of the excise tax, your Trust intends to make its distributions in  
accordance with the calendar year distribution requirement. Further, if your    
Trust retains any net capital gain, the Trust may designate the retained amount 
as undistributed capital gains in a notice to Unitholders who, if subject to    
federal income tax on long-term capital gains (i) will be required to include in
income for federal income tax purposes, as long-term capital gain, their share  
of such undistributed amount, and (ii) will be entitled to credit their         
proportionate share of the tax paid by the Trust against their federal income   
tax liabilities if any, and to claim refunds to the extent the credit exceeds   
such liabilities. A distribution will be treated as paid on December 31 of the  
current calendar year if it is declared by your Trust in October, November or   
December with a record date in such a month and paid by your Trust during       
January of the following calendar year. These distributions will be taxable to  
Unitholders in the calendar year in which the distributions are declared, rather
than the calendar year in which the distributions are received.                 

 If your Trust failed to qualify as a regulated investment company or failed
to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement in any taxable year, the Trust would
be taxed as an ordinary corporation on its taxable income (even if such income  
were distributed to its Unitholders) and all distributions out of earnings and  
profits would be taxed to Unitholders as ordinary dividend income.              

Termination of the Trust Agreement

  A Trust may be terminated at any time by consent of Unitholders representing
75% of the Units of the Trust then outstanding or by the Trustee when the value 
of the Trust, as shown by any semi-annual evaluation, is less than 20% of the   
original principal amount of bonds.                                             

A Trust will be liquidated by the Trustee in the event that a sufficient  
number of Units not yet sold are tendered for redemption by the Underwriters,   
including the Sponsor, so that the net worth of the Trust would be reduced to   
less than 40% of the initial principal amount of the Trust. If a Trust is       
liquidated because of the redemption of unsold Units by the Underwriters, the   
Sponsor will refund to each purchaser of Units the entire sales charge paid by  
such purchaser.                                                                 

The Trust Agreement provides that a Trust shall terminate upon the        
redemption, sale or other disposition of the last bond held in the Trust, but in
no event shall it continue beyond the end of the year preceding the fiftieth    
anniversary of the Trust Agreement in the case of a Long-Term Trust and at the  
end of the calender year prior to the twentieth anniversary of its execution in 
the case of an Intermediate-Term Trust. In the event of termination of a Trust, 
written notice thereof will be sent by the Trustee to each Unitholder at his    
address appearing on the registration books of the Trust maintained by the      
Trustee, such notice specifying the time or times at which the Unitholder may   
surrender his certificate or certificates for cancellation. Within a reasonable 
time thereafter the Trustee shall liquidate any bonds then held in a Trust and  
shall deduct from the funds of the Trust any accrued costs, expenses or         
indemnities provided by the Trust Agreement, including estimated compensation of
the Trustee and costs of liquidation and any amounts required as a reserve to   
provide for payment of any applicable taxes or other governmental charges. The  
sale of bonds in a Trust upon termination may result in a lower amount than     
might otherwise be realized if such sale were not required at such time. For    
this reason, among others, the amount realized by a Unitholder upon termination 
may be less than the principal amount or par amount of bonds represented by the 
Units held by such Unitholder. The Trustee shall then distribute to each        
Unitholder his share of the balance of the Interest and Principal Accounts. With
such distribution the Unitholders shall be furnished a final distribution       
statement of the amount distributable. At such time as the Trustee in its sole  
discretion shall determine that any amounts held in reserve are no longer       
necessary, it shall make distribution thereof to Unitholders in the same manner.

Description of Ratings

Standard & Poor's, A Division of the McGraw-Hill Companies. A Standard &  
Poor's long-term debt obligation credit rating is a current opinion of the      
creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific debt obligation. This 
opinion of creditworthiness may take into consideration the creditworthiness of 
guarantors, insurers or other forms of credit enhancement on the obligation.    

The long-term debt obligation credit ratings are not a recommendation to  
purchase, sell or hold the debt obligation, inasmuch as they do not comment as  
to market price or suitablility for a particular investor.                      

   The long-term debt obligation credit ratings are based on current information
furnished by the obligor or obtained by Standard & Poor's from other sources it 
considers reliable. Standard & Poor's does not perform an audit in connection   
with any credit rating and may, on occasion, rely on unaudited financial        
information. Credit ratings may be changed, suspended or withdrawn as a result  
of changes in, or unavailability of, such information, or based on other        
circumstances.                                                                  

 The long-term debt obligation credit ratings are based, in varying degrees,
on the following considerations:                                                

     I.   Likelihood of payment--capacity and willingness of the obligor to meet
          its financial commitment on an obligation in accordance with the terms
of the obligation.                                          

II.  Nature of and provisions of the obligation.                      

  III. Protection afforded by, and relative position of, the obligation in
          the event of bankruptcy, reorganization or other arrangement under the
  laws of bankruptcy and other laws affecting creditors' rights.

The credit rating definitions are expressed in terms of default risk. As  
such, they pertain to senior obligations of an entity. Junior obligations are   
typically rated lower than senior obligations to reflect the lower priority in  
bankruptcy, as noted above. (Such differentiation applies when an entity has    
both senior and subordinate obligations, secured and unsecured obligations or   
operating company and holding company obligations.) Accordingly, in the case of 
junior debt, the rating may not conform exactly with the category definition.   

  AAA--An obligation rated "AAA" has the highest rating assigned by Standard &
Poor's. The obligor's capacity to meet its financial commitment on the          
obligation is extremely strong.                                                 

  AA--An obligation rated "AA" differs from the highest-rated obligations only
in small degree. The obligor's capacity to meet its financial commitment on the 
obligation is very strong.                                                      

   A--An obligation rated "A" is somewhat more susceptible to adverse effects of
changes in circumstances and economic conditions than obligations in            
higher-rated categories. However, the obligor's capacity to meet its financial  
commitment on the obligation is still strong.                                   

BBB--An obligation rated "BBB" exhibits adequate protection parameters.   
However, adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely  
to lead to a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial commitment  
on the obligation.                                                              

Obligations rated "BB," "B," "CCC," "CC" and "C" are regarded as having   
significant speculative characteristics. "BB" indicates the least degree of     
speculation and "C" the highest. While such obligations will likely have some   
quality and protective characteristics, these may be outweighed by large        
uncertainties or major exposures to adverse conditions.                         

  Plus (+) or Minus (-): The ratings from "AA" to "CCC" may be modified by the
addition of a plus or minus sign to show relative standing within the major     
rating categories.                                                              

r--This symbol is attached to the ratings of instruments with significant 
non-credit risks. It highlights risks to principal or volatility of expected    
returns which are not addressed in the credit rating.                           

N.R.--This indicates that no rating has been requested, that there is     
insufficient information on which to base a rating or that Standard & Poor's    
does not rate a particular obligation as a matter of policy.                    

Moody's Investors Service. Municipal long-term rating scale. Moody's      
municipal ratings are opinions of the investment quality of issuers and issues  
in the US municipal and tax-exempt markets. As such, these ratings incorporate  
Moody's assessment of the default probability and loss severity of these issuers
and issues. The default and loss content for Moody's municipal long-term rating 
scale differs from Moody's general long-term rating scale.                      

Municipal ratings are based upon the analysis of four primary factors     
relating to municipal finance: economy, debt, finances, and                     
administration/management strategies. Each of the factors is evaluated          
individually and for its effect on the other factors in the context of the      
municipality's ability to repay its debt.                                       

 Aaa--Issuers or issues rated Aaa demonstrate the strongest creditworthiness
relative to other US municipal or tax-exempt issuers or issues.                 

Aa--Issuers or issues rated Aa demonstrate very strong creditworthiness   
relative to other US municipal or tax-exempt issuers or issues.                 

  A--Issuers or issues rated A present above-average creditworthiness relative
to other US municipal or tax-exempt issuers or issues.                          

  Baa--Issuers or issues rated Baa represent average creditworthiness relative
to other US municipal or tax- exempt issuers or issues.                         

Obligations rated "Ba," "B," "Caa," Ca" and "C" are regarded as having    
significant speculative characteristics. "Ba" indicates the least degree of     
speculation and "C" the highest. While such obligations will likely have some   
quality and protective characteristics, these may be outweighed by large        
uncertainties or major exposures to adverse conditions.                         

Note: Moody's appends numerical modifiers 1, 2, and 3 to each generic rating    
category from Aa through Caa. The modifier 1 indicates that the issuer or       
obligation ranks in the higher end of its generic rating category; the modifier 
2 indicates a mid-range ranking; and the modifier 3 indicates a ranking in the  
lower end of that generic rating category.                                      

General Long-term rating scale. Moody's long-term obligation ratings are  
opinions of the relative credit risk of fixed-income obligations with an        
original maturity of one year or more. They address the possibility that a      
financial obligation will not be honored as promised. Such ratings reflect both 
the likelihood of default and any financial loss suffered in the event of       
default.                                                                        

Aaa--Obligations rated Aaa are judged to be of the highest quality, with  
minimal credit risk. Aa--Obligations rated Aa are judged to be of high quality  
and are subject to very low credit risk. A--Obligations rated A are considered  
upper-medium grade and are subject to low credit risk. Baa--Obligations rated   
Baa are subject to moderate credit risk. They are considered medium-grade and as
such may possess certain speculative characteristics.                           

Obligations rated "Ba," "B," "Caa," Ca" and "C" are regarded as having    
significant speculative characteristics. "Ba" indicates the least degree of     
speculation and "C" the highest. While such obligations will likely have some   
quality and protective characteristics, these may be outweighed by large        
uncertainties or major exposures to adverse conditions.                         

Note: Moody's appends numerical modifiers 1, 2, and 3 to each generic rating    
category from Aa through Caa. The modifier 1 indicates that the issuer or       
obligation ranks in the higher end of its generic rating category; the modifier 
2 indicates a mid-range ranking; and the modifier 3 indicates a ranking in the  
lower end of that generic rating category.                                      

Estimated Cash Flows to Unitholders

The tables below set forth the per Unit estimated monthly and semi-annual 
distributions of interest and principal to Unitholders. The tables assume no    
changes in expenses, no changes in the current interest rates, no exchanges,    
redemptions, sales or prepayments of the underlying bonds prior to maturity or  
expected retirement date and the receipt of principal upon maturity or expected 
retirement date. To the extent the foregoing assumptions change actual          
distributions will vary.

Unit Trusts
Unit Trusts provide a simple, convenient way to gain exposure to an asset class, market sector or investment discipline. Like a traditional mutual fund, unit trusts hold a pool of securities (such as stocks, bonds or alternative investments) chosen by a professional investment manager and are available with a wide range of objectives and risk levels.

Build America Bonds Income Trust (BABS0037)
	
		





Objective
		  	
		
		Build America Bonds are new taxable municipal bonds created from the $787 billion stimulus package passed in 2009 by Congress. The purpose of the bonds is to build and repair America's roads, bridges, transit and rail systems, schools, ports and inland waterways, and other infrastructure, while stimulating the U.S. economy and job growth. Van Kampen Unit Trusts provide investors with convenient access to a diversified portfolio of taxable municipal bonds with a low minimum investment, consistent monthly income, daily liquidity and transparency.




Investment objective The trust seeks to provide a high level of current income and to preserve capital. The trust invests in a portfolio of long-term taxable municipal bonds, primarily consisting of "Build America Bonds". As of the date of deposit, the trust will invest at least 80% of its assets in Build America Bonds, and may include other taxable municipal bonds for purposes of diversification.

1Estimated current return (ECR) is based on the estimated annual income as a percentage of the current price of the units. Estimated long-term return (ELTR) is calculated using a formula which (1) takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values, yields (which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated retirement of all the bonds in the trust and (2) takes into account the expenses and sales charge associated with each trust unit. There can be no assurance that either the estimated current return or ELTR will be realized in the future and an investor's units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
2The ELTR life represents the estimated life of the bonds in a Trust's portfolio determined for the purposes of calculating Estimated Long-Term Return.
3Estimated Annual Income Per Unit is as of close the most recent business day and is based on the estimated cash flows per unit. This amount will vary with changes in expenses, interest rates and the maturity, call or sale of bonds.
4Estimated Daily Rate of Accrual represents the annual interest from the securities within the portfolio divided by the number of days on which interest is calculated annually.
5Represents the principal amount of the underlying bonds per unit. Bonds may be sold to meet redemptions, to pay expenses, and in other limited circumstances. The sale of bonds will affect the principal amount of bonds included in the trust and as a result the principal amount of bonds per unit. There can be no assurance that a unitholder will receive this par value per unit in the future.


For Fixed-Income trusts, "S.F." indicates a sinking fund is established with respect to an issue of bonds.The trust portfolio is provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell the individual securities shown above.



 Important Information About Benchmarks





About risk



There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust.An investment in the trust should be made with an understanding of the risks associated therewith, such as the inability of the issuer or an insurer to pay the principal of or interest on a bond when due, volatile interest rates, early call provisions and changes to the tax status of the bonds. As interest rates rise, bond prices fall.Investments in this trust may be subject to interest rate risk. If interest rates rise, the value of the bonds in a trust may decline and if interest rates decline the value of the bonds may increase. Also, the longer the period to maturity, the greater the sensitivity to interest rate changes tends to be.In particular, should a Build America Bond's issuer fail to continue to meet the applicable requirements imposed on the bonds as provided by the American Recovery & Reinvestment Act of 2009, it is possible that such issuer may not receive federal cash subsidy payments, impairing the issuer's ability to make scheduled interest payments.The trust may concentrate in bonds of a particular type of issuer. This makes the trust less diversified and subject to a greater risk than a more diversified portfolio.

This opinion of creditworthiness may take into consideration the creditworthiness of guarantors, insurers or other forms of credit enhancement on the obligation.  Moody's municipal ratings are opinions of the investment quality of the issues and issues in the US municipal and tax-exempt markets. As such, these ratings incorporate Moody's assessment of the default probability and loss severity of these issuers and issues.

LIQUIDATION PRICE  Represents the value per unit that a unitholder would receive if the unitholder redeemed or sold units. This price is equal to the net asset value per unit plus any remaining organization costs and creation and development fee. This price reflects any remaining deferred sales charges payable in connection with a liquidation of units.
OFFER PRICE Represents the net asset value per unit plus any applicable organization costs and sales charges. This is the regular public offering price per unit paid to purchase units. This price is often subject to certain sales charge discounts described in a trust prospectus.

About risk



There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust.An investment in the trust should be made with an understanding of the risks associated therewith, such as the inability of the issuer or an insurer to pay the principal of or interest on a bond when due, volatile interest rates, early call provisions and changes to the tax status of the bonds. As interest rates rise, bond prices fall.Investments in this trust may be subject to interest rate risk. If interest rates rise, the value of the bonds in a trust may decline and if interest rates decline the value of the bonds may increase. Also, the longer the period to maturity, the greater the sensitivity to interest rate changes tends to be.In particular, should a Build America Bond's issuer fail to continue to meet the applicable requirements imposed on the bonds as provided by the American Recovery & Reinvestment Act of 2009, it is possible that such issuer may not receive federal cash subsidy payments, impairing the issuer's ability to make scheduled interest payments.The trust may concentrate in bonds of a particular type of issuer. This makes the trust less diversified and subject to a greater risk than a more diversified portfolio.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM




To the Unitholders of Van Kampen Unit Trusts, Taxable Income Series 71:



We have audited the accompanying statement of condition (including the
analysis of net assets and the related portfolio schedule) of Insured Income
Trust, Series 125 (the "Trust," included in Van Kampen Unit Trusts, Taxable
Income Series 71) as of October 31, 2014, and the related statements of
operations and changes in net assets for each of the three years in the period
ended October 31, 2014, and the financial highlights for each of the five years
in the period ended October 31, 2014. These financial statements and financial
highlights are the responsibility of management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights based
on our audits.


We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements and financial highlights are free of material
misstatement. We were not engaged to perform an audit of the Trust's internal
control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal
control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that
are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust's internal control over financial
reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. Our procedures included confirmation of
securities owned at October 31, 2014 by correspondence with The Bank of New
York Mellon, Trustee. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion.


In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Insured Income Trust, Series 125 (included in Van Kampen Unit Trusts, Taxable
Income Series 71) as of October 31, 2014, and the results of its operations and
changes in net assets for each of the three years in the period ended October
31, 2014, and the financial highlights for each of the five years in the period
ended October 31, 2014, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America.

VAN KAMPEN UNIT TRUSTS, TAXABLE INCOME SERIES 71





Notes to Financial Statements

October 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014





NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES



Security Valuation - The securities are stated at the value determined by the
Evaluator, a third party valuation provider. The Evaluator may determine the
value of the securities (1) on the basis of current bid prices of the securities
obtained from dealers or brokers who customarily deal in securities comparable
to those held by the Trust, (2) on the basis of bid prices for comparable
securities, (3) by determining the value of the securities by appraisal or (4)
by any combination of the above.


Security Cost - The original cost to the Trust (Insured Income Trust, Series
125) was based on the determination by the Evaluator of the offering prices of
the securities on the date of deposit (November 2, 2004). Since the valuation is
based upon the bid prices, the Trust (Insured Income Trust, Series 125)
recognized a downward adjustment of $38,055 on the date of deposit resulting
from the difference between the bid and offering prices. This downward
adjustment was included in the aggregate amount of unrealized depreciation
reported in the financial statements for the Trust for the period ended October
31, 2005.


Unit Valuation - The redemption price per Unit is the pro rata share of each
Unit in the Trust based upon (1) the cash on hand in the Trust or monies in the
process of being collected, (2) the securities in the Trust based on the value
determined by the Evaluator and (3) interest accrued thereon, less accrued
expenses of the Trust, if any.


Federal Income Taxes - For a Trust with a Date of Deposit prior to August 2,
2006, such Trust has been structured to be treated as a grantor trust for
federal income tax purposes. Thus, such a Trust will not be treated as a taxable
entity for federal income tax purposes, and each Unitholder will be considered
to be the owner of a pro rata portion of the assets of such Trust. Accordingly,
no provision has been made for federal income taxes. For a Trust with a Date of
Deposit on or after August 2, 2006, each such Trust has elected and intends to
qualify on a continuous basis for special income tax treatment as a "regulated
investment company" ("RIC") under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
If such Trust so qualifies, as expected, it will not be subject to federal
income tax on amounts distributed to Unitholders. Your Trust's Date of Deposit
is listed above in the section entitled "Summary of Essential Financial
Information". For a discussion of the federal tax status of income earned on
Units, see "Federal Tax Status--Grantor Trusts" or "Federal Tax
Status--Regulated Investment Companies", as applicable, in Part II of this
Prospectus.


For each calendar year-end, a RIC trust files an annual tax return, Form
1120-RIC, with the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"). These returns are subject
to IRS examination under a three-year statute of limitations. To date, the Trust
has no IRS examination pending.


Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes - FASB Accounting Standards
Codification ("ASC"), clarifies the appropriate method of accounting for
uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise's financial statements
and provides related guidance. There is no material effect on the net asset
value, financial condition or results of operations of the Trust.


Subsequent Events - Events or transactions that have occurred from the
balance sheet date through the date of issuance are evaluated by the Sponsor.


Other - The financial statements are presented on the accrual basis of
accounting. Any realized gains or losses from securities transactions are
reported on an identified cost basis.



NOTE 2 - PORTFOLIO



Ratings - The source of all ratings, exclusive of those designated NR or *
is Standard & Poor's, A Division of the McGraw-Hill Companies ("S&P"). Ratings
marked * are by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. ("Moody's") as these Bonds are
not rated by S&P. NR indicates that the Bond is not rated by S&P or Moody's.
The ratings shown represent the latest published ratings of the Bonds. For a
brief description of rating symbols and their related meanings, see
"Description of Securities Ratings" in the Information Supplement.


Redemption Feature - There is shown under this heading the year in which
each issue of the securities is initially or currently callable and the call
price for that year. Each issue of securities continues to be callable at
declining prices thereafter (but not below par value) except for original issue
discount securities which are redeemable at prices based on the issue price
plus the amount of original issue discount accreted to redemption date plus, if
applicable, some premium, the amount of which will decline in subsequent years.
In addition, even if no year is shown in the table, the security may have a
"make whole" call option and be redeemable in whole or in part at any time at
the option of the issuer at a redemption price that is generally equal to the
sum of the principal amount of the securities, a "make whole" amount, and any
accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. The "make whole" amount
will generally be equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the aggregate present
value as of the date of redemption of principal being redeemed and the amount
of interest (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption) that
would have been payable if redemption had not been made, determined by
discounting the remaining principal and interest at a specified rate (which
varies from security to security and is generally equal to an average of yields
on U.S. Treasury obligations with maturities corresponding to the remaining
life of the security plus a premium rate) from the dates on which the principal
and interest would have been payable if the redemption had not been made, over

(ii) the aggregate principal amount of the securities being redeemed. In
addition, the securities may also be subject to redemption without premium at
any time pursuant to extraordinary optional or mandatory redemptions if certain
events occur. "S.F." indicates a sinking fund is established with respect to an
issue of securities. "P.R." indicates a security has been prerefunded.






NOTE 2 - PORTFOLIO (continued)



Redemption pursuant to call provisions generally will, and redemption
pursuant to sinking fund provisions may, occur at times when the redeemed
securities have an offering side evaluation which represents a premium over
par. To the extent that the securities were deposited in the Trust at a price
higher than the price at which they are redeemed, this will represent a loss of
capital when compared with the original Public Offering Price of the Units.
Conversely, to the extent that the securities were acquired at a price lower
than the redemption price, this will represent an increase in capital when
compared with the original Public Offering Price of the Units. Distributions
will generally be reduced by the amount of the income which would otherwise
have been paid with respect to redeemed securities and there will be
distributed to Unitholders the principal amount in excess of $1 per Unit
semi-annually for Trusts with a Date of Deposit prior to April 23, 2009, or in
excess of $5 per Unit monthly for Trusts with a Date of Deposit on or after
April 23, 2009, and any premium received on such redemption. However, should
the amount available for distribution in the Principal Account exceed $10.00
per Unit for Trusts with a Date of Deposit prior to April 23, 2009, the Trustee
will make a special distribution from the Principal Account on the next
succeeding monthly Distribution Date to holders of record on the related
monthly Record Date. The estimated current return in this event may be affected
by such redemptions. For the federal tax effect on Unitholders of such
redemptions and resultant distributions, see "Federal Tax Status" in Part II of
this Prospectus.


Insurance - Insurance coverage providing for the timely payment when due of
all principal and interest on certain of the securities in the Trust may have
been obtained by the Trust or by one of the Preinsured Security Insurers (as
indicated in the security name), however, certain other securities may not be
insured. Such insurance does not guarantee the market value of the securities or
the value of the Units. For securities covered under the Trust's insurance
policy the insurance is effective only while securities thus insured are held in
the Trust and the insurance premium, which is a Trust obligation, is paid on a
monthly basis. The premium for insurance which has been obtained from various
insurance companies by the issuer of the security involved is payable by the
issuer.


ASC states that, for financial reporting purposes, insurance coverage of the
type acquired by the Trust does not have any measurable fair value in the
absence of default of the underlying Bonds or of indications of the probability
of such default.


Fair Value Measurements - As described in Note 1, the Trust utilizes various
methods to measure the fair value of its investments. ASC establishes both a
framework for measuring fair value as well as a hierarchy that prioritizes
inputs to valuation methods. The various inputs that may be used to determine
the value of the Trust's investments are summarized in the three levels
presented below. The inputs or methodologies used for valuing securities are
not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in those
securities.


Level 1 -- Quoted prices in active markets for identical securities.


Level 2 -- Prices determined using other significant observable inputs.
Observable inputs are inputs that other market participants would use in pricing
a security, which may include quoted prices for similar securities, interest
rates, prepayment speeds and credit risk.


Level 3 -- Prices determined using significant unobservable inputs. In
certain situations where quoted prices or observable inputs are unavailable,
unobservable inputs may be used. Unobservable inputs reflect the Trust's own
assumptions about the factors market participants would use in pricing an
investment, and would be based on the best information available.


The following table summarizes the Trust's investments as of October 31, 2014
based on the inputs used to value them:








                                                     Investments

                                                    =============








Unrealized Appreciation and Depreciation - An analysis of net unrealized
appreciation (depreciation) at October 31, 2014 is as follows:








Unrealized Appreciation                             $     117,517
Unrealized Depreciation                                   (97,803)
                                                    -------------
                                                    $      19,714
                                                    =============









NOTE 3 - OTHER



Marketability - Although it is not obligated to do so, the Sponsor may
maintain a market for Units and continuously offer to purchase Units at prices,
subject to change at any time, based upon the aggregate bid price of the
securities in the portfolio of the Trust, plus interest accrued to the date of
settlement. If the supply of Units exceeds demand, or for other business
reasons, the Sponsor may discontinue purchases of Units at such prices. In the
event that a market is not maintained for the Units, a Unitholder desiring to
dispose of his Units may be able to do so only by tendering such Units to the
Trustee for redemption at the redemption price.






NOTE 3 - OTHER (continued)



Cost to Investors - The cost to original investors was based on the
Evaluator's determination of the aggregate offering price of the securities per
Unit on the date of an investor's purchase, plus a sales charge of 4.9% of the
Public Offering Price which is equivalent to 5.152% of the aggregate offering
price of the securities for the Trust. The secondary market cost to investors
is based on the Evaluator's determination of the aggregate bid price of the
securities per Unit on the date of an investor's purchase plus a sales charge
based upon the estimated long-term return life of the securities in the Trust.
The sales charge ranges from 1.50% of the Public Offering Price (1.523% of the
aggregate bid price of the securities) for a Trust with an estimated long-term
return life with less than two years to 4.80% of the Public Offering Price
(5.042% of the aggregate bid price of the securities) for a Trust with a
portfolio with an estimated long-term return life of fifteen or more years.


Compensation of Evaluator and Supervisor - The Supervisor receives a fee for
providing portfolio supervisory services for the Trust ($.25 per Unit, not to
exceed the aggregate cost of the Supervisor for providing such services to the
Trust). In addition, the Evaluator receives an annual fee for regularly
evaluating the Trust's portfolio. Both fees may be adjusted for increases under
the category "Services Less Rent of Shelter" in the Consumer Price Index for
All Urban Consumers.






NOTE 4 - REDEMPTION OF UNITS



During each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2014, 131
Units, 485 Units and 199 Units, respectively, were presented for redemption.

THE TRUSTS





General. Each Trust is a unit investment trust issued under the name Invesco
Unit Trust, Taxable Income Series Van Kampen Unit Trusts, Taxable Income Series,
Van Kampen Focus Portfolios, Taxable Income Series, Van Kampen Merritt Insured
Income Trust, Van Kampen American Capital Insured Income Trust, Van Kampen
Insured Income Trust or Van Kampen Focus Portfolios Insured Income Trust. Your
Trust was created under the laws of the State of New York pursuant to a Trust
Indenture and Agreement (the "Trust Agreement"), dated the Date of Deposit among
Invesco Capital Markets, Inc., as Sponsor, Standard & Poor's Securities
Evaluations, Inc., as Evaluator, Invesco Investment Advisers LLC, as Supervisor,
and The Bank of New York Mellon, as Trustee, or their predecessors.


Your Trust may be an appropriate medium for investors who desire to
participate in a portfolio of taxable fixed income securities, corporate bonds,
or mortgage-backed securities if investing in Units of a GNMA Income Portfolio,
with greater diversification than they might be able to acquire individually.
Diversification of a Trust's assets will not eliminate the risk of loss always
inherent in the ownership of bonds (as used herein, the term "bonds" shall also
include mortgage-backed securities, as applicable to Unitholders of a GNMA
Income Portfolio). In addition, bonds of the type initially deposited in the
portfolio of a Trust are often not available in small amounts and may, in the
case of any privately placed bonds, be available only to institutional
investors.


On the Date of Deposit, the Sponsor deposited the bonds with the Trustee. The
bonds initially consisted of delivery statements relating to contracts for their
purchase and cash, cash equivalents and/or irrevocable letters of credit issued
by a financial institution. Thereafter, the Trustee, in exchange for the bonds,
delivered to the Sponsor evidence of ownership of the Units. A Trust that holds
primarily long-term bonds, as described on the cover of Prospectus Part I, is
referred to herein as a "Long-Term Trust". A Trust that holds primarily
intermediate-term bonds, as described on the cover of Prospectus Part I, is
referred to herein as an "Intermediate-Term Trust". A Trust that holds a
portfolio of bonds with "laddered" maturities, as described on the cover of
Prospectus Part I, is referred to herein as a "Laddered Trust". A Trust that
holds only insured bonds is referred to herein as an "Insured Trust". A Trust
that holds primarily short-term Floating and Fixed rate corporate bonds, as
described on the cover of Prospectus Part I, is referred to herein as a
"Variable Rate Trust". Trusts that primarily hold Build America Bonds, as
described on the cover of Prospectus Part I, are referred to herein as "Build
America Bond Trusts". A Trust that holds bonds within the 10-20 year maturity
range, as described in Prospectus Part I, is referred to herein as a "10-20 Year
Trust". Unless otherwise terminated as provided herein, the Trust Agreement will
terminate at the end of the calendar year prior to the fiftieth anniversary of
its execution in the case of a Long-Term Trust, a Laddered Trust or a 10-20 Year
Trust and at the end of the calendar year prior to the twentieth anniversary of
its execution in the case of an Intermediate-Term Trust or a Variable Rate
Trust.


Each Unit initially offered represents a fractional undivided interest in the
principal and net income of a Trust. To the extent that any Units are redeemed
by the Trustee, or additional Units are issued as a result of additional
Securities being deposited by the Sponsor only with respect to a GNMA Income
Portfolio, the fractional undivided interest in a Trust represented by each Unit
will increase or decrease accordingly, although the actual in a Trust will
remain unchanged. Units will remain outstanding until redeemed by Unitholders or
until the termination of the Trust Agreement.


With respect only to a GNMA Income Portfolio, additional Units of your Trust
may be issued at any time by depositing in the Trust (i) additional securities,

(ii) contracts to purchase securities together with cash or irrevocable letters
of credit or (iii) cash (or a letter of credit or the equivalent) with
instructions to purchase additional securities. As additional Units are issued
by the Trust, the aggregate value of the securities will be increased and the
fractional undivided interest represented by each Unit will be decreased. The
Sponsor may continue to make additional deposits into the Trust following the
Initial Date of Deposit provided that the additional deposits will be in amounts
which will maintain, as nearly as practicable, the original percentage
relationship among the principal amounts of securities of specified interest
rates and ranges of maturities that existed on the Initial Date of Deposit.
Investors may experience a dilution of their investments and a reduction in
their anticipated income because of fluctuations in the prices of the securities
between the time of the deposit and the purchase of the securities and because
the Trust will pay the associated brokerage and acquisition costs. Purchases and
sales of Securities by the Trust may impact the value of the Securities. This
may especially be the case upon Trust termination or in the course of satisfying
large Unit redemptions.


Objectives and Bond Selection. The objective of a Long-Term Trust is to
provide income and conservation of capital by investing in a professionally
selected portfolio primarily consisting of long-term bonds. The objective of an
Intermediate-Term Trust is to provide income and conservation of capital by
investing in a professionally selected portfolio primarily consisting of
intermediate-term bonds. The objective of a 10-20 Year Trust is to provide a
high level of current income and to preserve capital by investing in a portfolio
of bonds maturing approximately 10 to 20 years from the Date of Deposit. The
objective of a Laddered Trust is to provide income and conservation of capital
by investing in a professionally selected portfolio consisting of bonds with
laddered maturities of approximately 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 years from the Date
of Deposit. The objective of a Van Kampen BlackRock Corporate Opportunity Trust
("BlackRock Trust") is to provide a high level of current income and to preserve
capital by investing in a portfolio primarily consisting of intermediate-term
corporate bonds. The objective of a GNMA Income Portfolio is to provide an
attractive level of monthly income by investing in a portfolio consisting of
fixed-rate mortgage-backed securities representing pools of mortgages on 1- to
4- family dwellings guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association.
The objective of a Variable Rate Trust is to provide an attractive level of
income and to preserve capital by investing in a portfolio primarily consisting
of short-term floating and fixed rate corporate bonds. There is, of course, no
guarantee that a Trust will achieve its objective. Your Trust may be an
appropriate medium for investors who desire to participate in a portfolio of
taxable fixed income securities, corporate bonds, or mortgage-backed securities
if investing in Units of a GNMA Income Portfolio, with greater diversification
than they might be able to acquire individually. Diversification of a Trust's
assets will not eliminate the risk of loss always inherent in the ownership of
bonds.


In selecting bonds for each Trust, the Sponsor considered the following
factors, among others: (a) as of the Date of Deposit, with respect to Insured
Trusts, the bonds must have a Standard & Poor's Ratings Services ("S&P") rating
of AAA or a Moody's Investors Service, Inc. ("Moody's") rating of Aaa, with
respect to Build America Bond Trusts consisting of long-term bonds, the bonds
must have an S&P rating of at least "A-", a Moody's rating of at least "A3" or,
if not rated, credit characteristics sufficiently similar to those of comparable
bonds that were so rated as to be acceptable for acquisition by a Trust in the
opinion of the Sponsor and with respect to all other trusts, the bonds must have
an S&P rating of at least "BBB-", a Moody's rating of at least "Baa3" or, if not
rated, credit characteristics sufficiently similar to those of comparable bonds
that were so rated as to be acceptable for acquisition by a Trust in the opinion
of the Sponsor, (b) the prices and liquidity of the bonds relative to other
bonds of comparable quality and maturity, (c) the current income provided by the
bonds; (d) the diversification of bonds as to purpose of issue and location of
issuer; (e) the probability of early return of principal or high legal or event
risk. After the Date of Deposit, a bond may cease to be rated or its rating may
be reduced below the minimum required as of the Date of Deposit. Neither event
requires elimination of a bond from a Trust but may be considered in the
Sponsor's determination as to whether or not to direct the Trustee to dispose of
the bond (see "Trust Administration--Portfolio Administration"). In particular,
the ratings of the bonds in a BlackRock Trust, Income Opportunities Trust,
Investment Grade Trust, Long-Term Investment Grade Trust, Long-Term Corporate
Investment Grade Trust, Intermediate Corporate Investment Grade Trust,
Investment Grade Income Trust or Variable Rate Trust could fall below
"investment grade" (i.e., below "BBB-" or "Baa3") during the Trust's life and
the Trust could continue to hold the bonds. The portfolio for a BlackRock Trust
was selected by the Sponsor from a list of corporate bonds researched and
selected by the BlackRock fixed income team. With respect to the selection of
securities for a GNMA Income Portfolio, the Sponsor considered factors including
the following: (i) the types of GNMA securities available, (ii) the prices and
yields of the securities relative to other comparable securities, including the
extent to which the securities were trading at a premium or discount from their
principal value, and (iii) the maturities of the securities. See "The
Trusts--Risk Factors".


Insurance guaranteeing the timely payment, when due, of all principal and
interest on the bonds in certain Trusts has been obtained from a bond insurance
company. For information relating to insurance on the bonds, see "Insurance on
the Bonds in an Insured Trust". Neither the Public Offering Price nor any
evaluation of Units for purposes of repurchases or redemptions reflects any
element of value for the insurance obtained by an Insured Trust unless bonds
are in default in payment of principal or interest or in significant risk of
such default. See "Public Offering--Offering Price".


In order for bonds to be eligible for insurance, they must have credit
characteristics which would qualify them for at least the S&P rating of "BBB-"
or at least the Moody's rating of "Baa3", which in brief represent the lowest
ratings for securities of investment grade (see "Description of Ratings" in the
Information Supplement). Insurance is not a substitute for the basic credit of
an issuer, but supplements the existing credit and provides additional
security. If an issue is accepted for insurance, a non-cancelable policy for
the prompt payment of interest and principal on the bonds, when due, is issued
by the insurer. A monthly premium is paid by a Trust for the insurance obtained
by it. The Trustee has the right to obtain permanent insurance from a Portfolio
Insurer in connection with the sale of a bond insured under the insurance
policy obtained from the respective Portfolio Insurer by a Trust upon the
payment of a single predetermined insurance premium from the proceeds of the
sale of such bond. Accordingly, any bond in an Insured Trust is eligible to be
sold on an insured basis. All bonds insured by a Portfolio Insurer or by a
Preinsured Bond Insurer receive a "AAA" rating by S&P. S&P describes securities
it rates "AAA" as having "the highest rating assigned by S&P to a debt
obligation. Capacity to pay interest and repay principal is extremely strong."
See "Insurance on the Bonds in an Insured Trust".


Risk Factors. All investments involve risk. This section describes the main
risks that can impact the value of bonds in your Trust. You should understand
these risks before you invest. If the value of the bonds falls, the value of
your Units will also fall. You can lose money by investing in a Trust. No one
can guarantee that your Trust will achieve its objective or that your investment
return will be positive over any period. The Information Supplement contains a
more detailed discussion of risks related to your investment.


Current economic conditions. The economic recession in the United States
which began in 2007 technically came to an end in June of 2009, however the U.S.
and global economies continue to feel the effects of this recessionary period,
including increased unemployment and below-average levels of economic activity.
The U.S. and other foreign governments have taken extraordinary steps to combat
the effects of the economic crisis, however the ultimate impact of these
measures is unknown and cannot be predicted. In December of 2013, the U.S.
Federal Reserve announced it would begin tapering its quantitative easing
program, however, there continues to be uncertainty concerning potential future
changes to the federal funds rate following a period of near zero interest rates
over the previous five years. On August 5, 2011, Standard & Poor's Rating
Services downgraded the long-term sovereign credit rating of the United States
of America to AA+ from AAA, citing the prolonged controversy over raising the
statutory debt ceiling and the related fiscal policy debate. Any substantial
change in general market conditions may result in sudden and significant
valuation increases or declines in your Trust's holdings.


Market risk is the risk that the value of the bonds in your Trust will
fluctuate. This could cause the value of your Units to fall below your original
purchase price or below the par value. Market value fluctuates in response to
various factors. These can include changes in interest rates, inflation, the
financial condition of a bond's issuer or insurer, perceptions of the issuer or
insurer, or ratings on a bond. Even though the Supervisor supervises your
portfolio, you should remember that no one manages your portfolio. Your Trust
will not sell a bond solely because the market value falls, or the credit rating
on a bond included in a BlackRock Trust or a Variable Rate Trust is downgraded,
as is possible in a managed fund.


Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of bonds will fall if interest
rates increase. Bonds typically fall in value when interest rates rise and rise
in value when interest rates fall. Bonds with longer periods before maturity are
often more sensitive to interest rate changes. Interest rates in the United
States are at or near historic lows, which may increase your Trust's exposure to
risks associated with rising interest rates. With respect only to a Variable
Rate Trust, because the interest rates on floating rate bonds adjust
periodically to reflect current market rates, falling short-term interest rates
should tend to decrease the income payable to a Variable Rate Trust on its
floating rate investments and rising rates should tend to increase that income.
However, investments in floating rate obligations should also mitigate the
fluctuations in a Variable Rate Trust's net asset values during periods of
changing interest rates, compared to changes in values of fixed-rate debt
securities. Nevertheless, changes in interest rates can affect the value of a
Variable Rate Trust's floating rate investments, especially if rates change
sharply in a short period, because the resets of the interest rates on the
investments occur periodically and will not all happen simultaneously with
changes in prevailing rates.


Credit risk is the risk that a security's issuer is unable to meet its
obligation to pay principal or interest on the security. While interest and
principal payments on Ginnie Mae securities are backed by the full faith and
credit of the U.S. government, a GNMA Income Portfolio and the Units thereof
are not guaranteed or insured by the U.S. government or any government agency.
In addition, neither the U.S. government nor Ginnie Mae guarantees the market
value or yield on Ginnie Mae securities.


Prepayment risk is the chance that borrowers prepay their mortgage loans
earlier than expected and in particular, may affect the Units of a GNMA Income
Portfolio. This reduces the Trust's life and future interest income. Any
payment of mortgage debt before it is due is called "prepayment". Most mortgage
loans may be prepaid at any time by the borrower without penalty. Each
mortgage-backed security payment includes a return of principal as well as
interest. Prepayments of the entire mortgage occur when borrowers refinance or
sell their homes. They may refinance to consolidate debts or take advantage of
lower interest rate mortgages. As interest rates decrease, the rate of
refinancings may increase significantly, thereby increasing the prepayment risk
of mortgage-backed securities. Extra monthly principal payments made near the
Trust's inception may significantly reduce the interest amount paid by the
borrower to the lender and, therefore, the future amount received by the Trust.


Your Trust will distribute prepayments of principal to you but your future
interest distributions will fall as a result of the prepaid principal. You also
might not be able to reinvest this principal at as high a yield. This means
that you could receive less than the amount you paid for your Units. If enough
principal is prepaid on the securities in your Trust, your Trust could
terminate significantly earlier than expected.


Call risk is the risk that the issuer prepays or "calls" a bond before its
stated maturity. An issuer might call a bond if interest rates fall and the bond
pays a higher interest rate or if it no longer needs the money for the original
purpose. If an issuer calls a bond, your Trust will distribute the principal to
you but your future interest distributions will fall. You might not be able to
reinvest this principal at as high a yield. A bond's call price could be less
than the price your Trust paid for the bond and could be below the bond's par
value. This means that you could receive less than the amount you paid for your
units. If enough bonds in your Trust are called, your Trust could terminate
early. Some or all of the bonds may also be subject to extraordinary optional or
mandatory redemptions if certain events occur, such as certain changes in tax
laws, the substantial damage or destruction by fire or other casualty of the
project for which the proceeds of the bonds were used, and various other events.
Build America Bonds, Qualified School Construction Bonds, Qualified Energy
Conservation Bonds and Clean Renewable Energy Bonds, in particular, are often
subject various to extraordinary or mandatory redemption provisions. See
"Taxable Municipal Bonds--Build America Bonds" and "Taxable Municipal
Bonds--Qualified School Construction Bonds, Qualified Energy Conservation Bonds
and Clean Renewable Energy Bonds" below. The call provisions are described in
general terms in the "Redemption Feature" column of the "Portfolio" section, and
the notes thereof in Prospectus Part I.


Bond quality risk is the risk that a bond will fall in value if a rating
agency decreases the bond's rating.


Concentration risk is the risk that your Trust is less diversified because
it concentrates in a particular type of bond. When a certain type of bond makes
up 25% or more of a Trust, the Trust is considered to be "concentrated" in that
bond type. The different bond types are described in the following sections.


A GNMA Income Portfolio concentrates in mortgage-backed securities. You
should understand these securities before you invest. These securities are
described in detail in the section titled "Ginnie Mae Securities."


Extension risk is the chance that an increase in interest rates or lack of
refinancing opportunities can cause a corresponding increase in the Trust's
life due to a drop in expected prepayments of mortgage-backed securities. As a
result, the securities in your Trust, and in particular, any mortgage-backed
securities in a GNMA Income Portfolio, may become more sensitive to rising
interest rates and may decrease in value.


Foreign securities risk. Investing in foreign securities typically involves
more risks than investing in securities of United States issuers. These risks
can increase the potential for losses in the Trust and affect its Unit price.
These risks may include risks such as losses due to political, economic and
social developments, international trade conditions, foreign taxes (including
withholding taxes), restrictions on foreign investments or exchange of
securities, foreign currency fluctuations or restriction on exchange or
repatriation of currencies.


The political, economic and social structures of some foreign countries may
be less stable and more volatile than those in the U.S., and investments in
these countries may be subject to the risks of internal and external conflicts,
currency devaluations, foreign ownership limitations and tax increases. It is
possible that a government may take over the assets or operations of a company
or impose restrictions on the exchange or export of currency or other assets.
Some countries also may have different legal systems that may make it difficult
for the Trust to exercise investor rights, and pursue legal remedies with
respect to its foreign investments. Diplomatic and political developments,
including rapid and adverse political changes, social instability, regional
conflicts, terrorism and war, could affect the economies, industries, and
securities and currency markets, and the value of the Trust's investments, in
non-U.S. countries. No one can predict the impact that these factors could have
on the Trust's portfolio securities.


Foreign companies may not be subject to the same disclosure, accounting,
auditing and financial reporting standards and practices as U.S. companies.
Thus, there may be less information publicly available about foreign companies
than about most U.S. companies.


Certain foreign securities may be less liquid (harder to sell) and more
volatile than many U.S. securities. This means the Trust may at times be unable
to sell foreign securities in a timely manner or at favorable prices.


Reduced diversification risk is the risk that your Trust will become smaller
and less diversified as bonds are sold, are called or mature. This could
increase your risk of loss and increase your share of Trust expenses.


Liquidity risk is the risk that the value of a bond will fall if trading in
the bond is limited or absent, thereby adversely affecting the Trust's net
asset value. No one can guarantee that a liquid trading market will exist for
any bond because these bonds generally trade in the over-the-counter market
(they are not listed on a securities exchange). Because of the difficulties
currently being experienced by many companies in the financial services
industry, many markets are experiencing substantially reduced liquidity. As a
result of such illiquidity, the Trustee may have to sell other or additional
bonds if necessary to satisfy redemption requests.


Certain Trusts may hold bonds that are "Rule 144A" restricted securities
pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended ("1933 Act"), and may be
subject to enhanced liquidity risk. Rule 144A securities are restricted
securities that may only be resold in accordance with the applicable provisions
of the 1933 Act. Rule 144A establishes a "safe harbor" from the registration
requirements of the 1933 Act for resale of certain securities to qualified
institutional buyers.


Restricted securities may be sold only in privately negotiated transactions
or in a public offering with respect to a registration statement which is in
effect under the 1933 Act. A restricted security in a Trust may not be readily
marketable at the time such a Trust may be seeking to sell such securities, such
as for a request for redemption. An insufficient number of qualified
institutional buyers interested in purchasing restricted securities held by a
Trust may adversely affect the marketability of such securities, and the Trustee
might be unable to dispose of such Trust securities promptly or at reasonable
prices. Where registration is required for the resale of a restricted security,
a Trust may be obligated to pay all or part of the registration expenses and a
considerable period may elapse from the time the Trustee attempts to sell such
restricted Trust securities and the time the Trustee may be permitted to sell
the restricted Trust securities under an effective registration statement. Due
to the potential for delays on resale and uncertainty in valuation associated
with restricted securities, the Trustee may experience difficulty satisfying
redemptions within three business days.


Insurer default risk is the risk that an investor of an insured trust could
lose income and/or principal if the issuer and the insurer of a municipal bond
both default in making their payment obligations.


Litigation and legislation risk is the risk that future litigation or
legislation could affect the value of your Trust. Litigation could challenge an
issuer's authority to issue or make payments on bonds.


Taxable Municipal Bonds. Your Trust may invest significantly or exclusively
in taxable municipal bonds. States, municipalities and public authorities issue
these bonds to raise money for a variety of purposes. In selecting bonds, the
Sponsor seeks to diversify your portfolio by bond purpose. This section briefly
describes different bond types to help you better understand your investment.
The types of bonds in your Trust are listed in Prospectus Part I. These bonds
are also described in greater detail in the Information Supplement.


General obligation bonds are backed by the general taxing power of the
issuer. The issuer secures these bonds by pledging its faith, credit and
unlimited taxing power for the payment of principal and interest.


Revenue bonds are payable only from the revenue of a specific project or
authority. They are not supported by the issuer's general power to levy taxes.
The risk of default in payment of interest or principal increases if the income
of the related project falters because that income is the only source of
payment. All of the following bonds are revenue bonds.


Airport bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate airports. The
ability of the issuer to make payments on these bonds primarily depends on the
ability of airlines to meet their obligations under use agreements. Due to
increased competition, deregulation, increased fuel costs and other factors,
some airlines may have difficulty meeting these obligations.


Bond banks are vehicles that pool various municipal obligations into larger
offerings. This reduces the cost of borrowing for the municipalities. The types
of financing projects that these obligations support vary.


Build America Bonds were issued pursuant to The American Recovery and
Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the "Recovery Act"), authorizing states and local
governments to issue taxable bonds and to elect to receive a federal subsidy for
a portion of their borrowing costs through a refundable tax credit paid by the
United States Treasury Department ("Treasury") and the Internal Revenue Service
("IRS"), in an amount equal to 35 percent of the total coupon interest payable
to investors (45 percent for those Build America Bonds that qualify and are
designated as Recovery Zone Economic Development Bonds).


The Recovery Act adds a new section to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended, (the "Code") which authorizes Build America Bonds that meet the
definition of "qualified bonds", as described below, to receive the refundable
credit. The Code section defines the term "qualified bond" to mean a Build
America Bond (a) issued before January 1, 2011, (b) with 100 percent of the
excess of (i) the available project proceeds (as defined to mean sale proceeds
of such issue less not more than two percent of such proceeds used to pay
issuance costs plus investment proceeds thereon), over (ii) the amounts in a
reasonably required reserve fund with respect to such issue, are to be used for
capital expenditures, and (c) where the issuer makes an irrevocable election to
have this subsection of the Code apply.


Should a Build America Bond's issuer fail to continue to meet the applicable
requirements as imposed on the bonds by the Code, it is possible that such
issuer may not receive federal cash subsidy payments, impairing the issuer's
ability to make scheduled interest payments. In addition, Build America Bonds
are often subject to extraordinary redemption in the event that changes to
Sections 54AA or 6431 of the Code (as added by the Recovery Act) or other
federal legislation causes to reduce or eliminate the federal cash subsidy
payment for a portion of a Build America Bond issuer's borrowing costs.


Qualified School Construction Bonds, Qualified Energy Conservation Bonds and
Clean Renewable Energy Bonds (collectively, "Qualified Bonds") are taxable bonds
that are similar to certain Build America Bonds, in that state and municipal
Qualified Bond issuers may elect to receive direct interest-subsidy payments
from the U.S. Treasury if certain conditions are met. The Hiring Incentives to
Restore Employment Act, enacted into federal law on March 18, 2010, permits
issuers of Qualified Bonds to seek applicable subsidies on bond interest
payments.


Qualified School Construction Bonds, issued pursuant to provisions in the
Recovery Act, are issued to finance the construction, rehabilitation, or repair
of a public school facility or for the acquisition of land on which such a
bond-financed facility will be constructed. Qualified Energy Conservation Bonds
and Clean Renewable Energy Bonds are both issued pursuant to the "Energy
Improvement and Extension Act of 2008", and like Qualified School Construction
Bonds, are governed by Section 54A of the Code. Qualified Energy Conservation
Bonds are issued for qualified energy conservation purposes, and Clean Renewable
Energy Bonds are issued to finance qualified renewable energy facilities that
produce electricity. Although the year of issuance is not restricted for
Qualified Bonds, federal law provides for limits on the dollar amounts that may
be issued for these bond types.


Federal legislation has amended the Code in recent years to provide for
certain qualifications and restrictions on the issuance of Qualified Bonds, and
to include such bonds under the definition of "qualified tax credit bond" as
found in Section 54A of the Code. Eligible issuers of Qualified School
Construction Bonds may receive subsidy payments equal to 100% of the lesser of
the actual interest rate of the bonds or the tax credit rate for municipal
tax-credit bonds, set daily by the U.S. Treasury. Eligible issuers of Qualified
Energy Conservation Bonds and Clean Renewable Energy Bonds may receive subsidy
payments equal to 70% of the lesser of the actual interest rate of the bonds or
the tax credit rate for municipal tax-credit bonds, set daily by the U.S.
Treasury.


Should the issuer of a Qualified Bond fail to continue to meet the applicable
requirements as imposed on any such bond by the Code or other federal laws, it
is possible that such issuer may not receive federal cash subsidy payments,
impairing the issuer's ability to make scheduled interest payments or even
causing mandatory redemption of a portion of the bonds. As provided in Section
54A of the Code, Qualified Bonds are also subject to mandatory redemption of any
portion of available project proceeds that remain unexpended by the issuer after
three years from the date of issuance. This mandatory redemption must be
completed within 90 days after such three-year period, unless an extension is
granted by the Treasury. Additionally, Qualified Bonds may be subject to
extraordinary redemption in the event that changes to applicable sections of the
Code or other federal legislation causes to reduce or eliminate the federal cash
subsidy payment for any Qualified Bond issuer's borrowing costs.


Certificates of participation are generally a type of municipal lease
obligation. Lease payments of a governmental entity secure payments on these
bonds. These payments depend on the governmental entity budgeting
appropriations for the lease payments. A governmental body cannot obligate
future governments to appropriate for or make lease payments, but governments
typically promise to take action necessary to include lease payments in their
budgets. If a government fails to budget for or make lease payments, sufficient
funds may not exist to pay interest or principal on these bonds.


Health care bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenue from
hospitals and hospital systems. The ability of these issuers to make payments
on bonds depends on factors such as facility occupancy levels, demand for
services, competition resulting from hospital mergers and affiliations, the
need to reduce costs, government regulation, cost of malpractice insurance and
claims, and government financial assistance (such as Medicare and Medicaid).


Higher education bonds are obligations of issuers that operate universities
and colleges. These issuers derive revenues from tuition, dormitories, grants
and endowments. These issuers face problems related to declines in the number
of college-age individuals, possible inability to raise tuitions and fees,
uncertainty of continued federal grants, state funding or donations, and
government legislation or regulation.


Industrial revenue bonds finance the cost of acquiring, building or
improving industrial projects. Private corporations usually operate these
projects. The ability of the issuer to make payments on these bonds depends on
factors such as the creditworthiness of the corporation operating the project,
revenues generated by the project, expenses of the project and environmental or
other regulatory restrictions.


Multi-family housing bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues
from mortgage loans on multiple family residences, retirement housing or
housing projects for low to moderate-income families. These bonds are generally
pre-payable at any time. It is likely that their life will be less than their
stated maturity. The ability of these issuers to make payments on bonds depends
on such factors as rental income, occupancy levels, operating expenses,
mortgage default rates, taxes, government regulations and appropriation of
subsidies.


Other care bonds include obligations of issuers that derive revenue from
mental health facilities, nursing homes and intermediate care facilities. These
bonds are similar to health care bonds and the issuers face the same general
risks.


Public building bonds finance the cost of acquiring, leasing, building or
improving public buildings such as offices, recreation facilities, convention
centers, police stations, correctional institutions and parking garages. The
ability of the issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such
as the government budgeting sufficient funds to make lease or mortgage payments
on the facility, user fees or rents, costs of maintenance and decreases in use
of the facility.


Public education bonds are obligations of issuers that operate primary and
secondary schools. The ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds
depends primarily on ad valorem taxes. These issuers may also face problems
related to litigation contesting state constitutionality of public education
financing.


Retail electric/gas/telephone bonds are obligations of issuers that derive
revenues from the retail sale of utilities to customers. The ability of these
issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the rates
and demand for these utilities, competition, government regulation and rate
approvals, overhead expenses and the cost of fuels.


Single family housing bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues
from mortgage loans on single family residences. Single family residences
generally include one to four-family dwellings. These bonds are similar to
multi-family housing bonds and the issuers face the same general risks.


Tax district bonds are obligations secured by a pledge of taxing power by a
municipality, such as tax increment financing or tax allocation bonds. These
bonds are similar to general obligation bonds. Unlike general obligation bonds,
however, the municipality does not pledge its unlimited taxing power to pay
these bonds. Instead, the municipality pledges revenues from a specific tax to
pay these bonds. If the tax cannot support payment of interest and principal, a
municipality may need to raise the related tax to pay these bonds. An inability
to raise the tax could have an adverse effect on these bonds.


Transportation bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate public
transit systems, ports, highways, turnpikes, bridges and other transportation
systems. The ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds depends
on variations in use, the degree of government subsidization, competition from
other forms of transportation and increased costs. Port authorities derive
revenues primarily from fees imposed on ships using the port facilities. These
fees can fluctuate depending on the local economy and competition from air,
rail and truck transportation. Increased fuel costs, alternative transportation
modes and competition from toll-free bridges and roads will impact revenues of
issuers that operate bridges, roads or tunnels.


Waste disposal bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from
resource recovery facilities. These facilities process solid waste, generate
steam and convert steam to electricity. These issuers face problems such as
costs and delays due to environmental concerns, effects of conservation and
recycling, destruction or condemnation of a project, void or unenforceable
contracts, changes in the economic availability of raw materials, operating
supplies or facilities, and other unavoidable changes that adversely affect
operation of a project.


Water and sewer bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from
user fees from the sale of water and sewerage services. These issuers face
problems such as the ability to obtain rate increases, population declines,
difficulties in obtaining new fresh water supplies and "no-growth" zoning
ordinances. These issuers also face many of the same problems of waste disposal
issuers.


Wholesale electric bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues
from selling electricity to other utilities. The ability of these issuers to
make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the rates and demand
for electric utilities, competition, overhead expenses and government
regulation and rate approvals.


Ginnie Mae Securities. GNMA Income Portfolios invest exclusively in Ginnie
Mae securities. These securities are backed by mortgage loans. These securities
represent an ownership interest in mortgage loans made by banks and other
financial institutions to finance purchases of homes. Individual loans are
pooled together by Ginnie Mae-approved issuers for sale to investors. Commonly
referred to as "pass-through" certificates, these securities entitle an
investor to an undivided interest in the underlying mortgage loan pool. The
investor receives a proportionate share of the interest (reduced by servicing
and guaranty fees) and principal on the underlying mortgage loans.


Payments on Ginnie Mae securities to investors occur monthly. These payments
are called "modified pass-through" payments because, through Ginnie Mae's
mortgage-backed securities program, money is passed from the borrower through
to the investors in the Ginnie Mae securities. It is "modified" because if the
amount collected from the borrowers is less than the amount due, the issuer
modifies the pass-through to add on an amount from its corporate funds to make
the payment complete.


Each group of Ginnie Mae securities shown in the "Portfolio" section of
Prospectus Part I under a specified range of maturities includes individual
mortgage-backed securities which may have varying maturities within each range.
If there is no difference in price among the individual Ginnie Mae securities
within each group on the basis of the difference in the maturity dates of each
security, a purchase of Ginnie Mae securities with the same coupon rate and a
maturity date within the related range will be considered an acquisition of the
same security. In the future, however, the difference in maturity ranges could
affect the market value of the individual Ginnie Mae securities. If this
happens, any additional purchases by your Trust will take into account the
maturities of the individual securities.


The Government National Mortgage Association, known as Ginnie Mae, was
created in 1968 as a wholly owned corporation within the Department of Housing
and Urban Development. Through its mortgage-backed securities program, Ginnie
Mae seeks to increase the liquidity and efficiency of mortgage loan funding,
making more capital available to low and moderate-income homeowners at
competitive interest rates.


The primary function of Ginnie Mae is to operate its mortgage-backed
securities (MBS) program. Ginnie Mae helps to ensure mortgage funds are
available throughout the United States including in rural and urban areas in
which it has been harder to borrow money to buy a home. Ginnie Mae securities
are issued by Ginnie Mae-approved private institutions. The mortgages are
insured by the Federal Housing Administration, or by the Rural Housing Service,
or they are guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs.


Because of the Ginnie Mae guaranty, investors in Ginnie Mae securities are
assured timely payments of scheduled principal and interest due on the pooled
mortgages that back their securities. The payments also include any prepayments
and early recoveries of principal on the pooled mortgages. These payments are
guaranteed even if borrowers or issuers default on their obligation. If the
issuer fails to make the payment, Ginnie Mae will make the payment to the
investor. Neither Ginnie Mae nor the U.S. government guarantees or insures (1)
the market value or yields of Ginnie Mae securities, (2) the Trust or (3) the
Units of the Trust in any way.


State Risk Factors. Your Trust may invest significantly in taxable municipal
bonds of issuers from a particular state. The financial condition of a state
may be affected by various national, economic, social and environmental
policies and conditions. Additionally, limitations imposed by constitutional
amendments, legislative measures, or voter initiatives on a state and its local
governments concerning taxes, bond indebtedness and other matters may constrain
the revenue-generating capacity of the state and its local governments and,
therefore, the ability of the issuers of the bonds to satisfy their
obligations.


The economic vitality of a state and its various regions and, therefore, the
ability of the state and its local governments to satisfy the bonds, are
affected by numerous factors, such as natural disasters, complications with
exports and industry deregulation.


A state may be a party to numerous lawsuits in which an adverse final
decision could materially affect the state's governmental operations and
consequently its ability to pay debt service on its obligations.


Corporate Bond Industry Risks. Your Trust may invest significantly in
certain industries. Any negative impact on the related industry will have a
greater impact on the value of Units than on a portfolio diversified over
several industries. You should understand the risks of these industries before
you invest.


Consumer Discretionary and Consumer Staples Issuers. Your Trust may invest
significantly in bonds issued by companies that manufacture or sell various
consumer products. General risks of these companies include the general state
of the economy, intense competition and consumer spending trends. A decline in
the economy which results in a reduction of consumers' disposable income can
negatively impact spending habits. Competitiveness in the retail industry will
require large capital outlays for the installation of automated checkout
equipment to control inventory, track the sale of items and gauge the success
of sales campaigns. Retailers who sell their products over the Internet have
the potential to access more consumers, but will require sophisticated
technology to remain competitive. Changes in demographics and consumer tastes
can also affect the demand for, and the success of, consumer products and
services in the marketplace.


Financial Services Issuers. Your Trust may invest significantly in bonds
issued by financial services companies. Companies in the financial services
industry include, but are not limited to, companies involved in activities such
as banking, mortgage finance, consumer finance, specialized finance, industrial
finance and leasing, investment banking and brokerage, asset management and
custody, corporate lending, insurance, and financial investment and real estate,
including real estate investment trusts. In general, financial services issuers
are substantially affected by changes in economic and market conditions,
including: the liquidity and volatility levels in the global financial markets;
interest rates, as well as currency and commodities prices; investor sentiment;
the rate of corporate and consumer defaults; inflation and unemployment; the
availability and cost of capital and credit; exposure to various geographic
markets or in commercial and residential real estate; competition from new
entrants in their fields of business; extensive government regulation; and the
overall health of the U.S. and international economies.


The financial services sector continues to be adversely affected by global
developments over the last several years stemming from the financial crisis
including recessionary conditions, deterioration in the credit markets and
recurring concerns over sovereign debt. A substantial amount of assets have been
written down by financial institutions, with the impact of these losses forcing
a number of large traditional banks, investment banks, broker-dealers and
insurers into liquidation, combination or other restructuring. This also has
significantly increased the credit risk, and possibility of default, of bonds
issued by such institutions faced with these problems. Many of the institutions
may continue to experience difficulty in accessing credit markets to finance
their operations and in maintaining appropriate levels of equity capital. In
addition, the liquidity of certain debt instruments has been reduced or
eliminated due to the lack of available market makers. While the U.S. and
foreign governments, and their respective government agencies, have taken steps
to address problems in the financial markets and with financial institutions,
there can be no assurance that the risks associated with investment in financial
services issuers will decrease as a result of these steps.


Most financial services companies are subject to extensive governmental
regulation, which limits their activities and may affect their ability to earn a
profit from a given line of business. Challenging economic and political
conditions, along with increased public scrutiny during the past several years,
have led to new legislation and increased regulation in the U.S. and abroad,
creating additional difficulties for financial institutions. Regulatory
initiatives and requirements that are being proposed around the world may be
inconsistent or may conflict with regulations to which financial services
issuers are currently subject, thereby resulting in higher compliance and legal
costs, as well as the potential for higher operational, capital and liquidity
costs. Proposed or enacted regulations may further limit the amounts and types
of loans and other financial commitments certain financial services issuers can
make, and further, may limit the interest rates and fees they can charge, the
prices they can charge and the amount of capital they must maintain. These laws
and regulations may affect the manner in which a particular financial
institution does business and the products and services it may provide.
Increased regulation may restrict a company's ability to compete in its current
businesses or to enter into or acquire new businesses. New regulations may
reduce or limit a company's revenue or impose additional fees, limit the scope
of their activities, increase assessments or taxes on those companies and
intensify regulatory supervision, adversely affecting business operations or
leading to other negative consequences.


Among the most prominent pieces of legislation following the financial crisis
has been the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the
"Dodd- Frank Act"), enacted into federal law on July 21, 2010. The Dodd-Frank
Act includes reforms and refinements to modernize existing laws to address
emerging risks and issues in the nation's evolving financial system. It also
establishes entirely new regulatory regimes, including in areas such as systemic
risk regulation, over-the-counter derivatives market oversight, and federal
consumer protection. The Dodd-Frank Act is intended to cover virtually all
participants in the financial services industry for years to come, including
banks, thrifts, depository institution holding companies, mortgage lenders,
insurance companies, industrial loan companies, broker-dealers and other
securities and investment advisory firms, private equity and hedge funds,
consumers, numerous federal agencies and the federal regulatory structure. In
particular, certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act increase the capital
requirements of certain financial services companies supervised by the Federal
Reserve, resulting in such companies incurring generally higher deposit
premiums. These types of regulatory changes may have adverse effects on certain
issuers in your Trust, and could lead to decreases in such issuers' profits or
revenues. In many cases the full impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on a financial
institution's business remains uncertain because of the extensive rule-making
still to be completed. The Sponsor is unable to predict the ultimate impact of
the Dodd-Frank Act, and any resulting regulation, on the securities in your
Trust or on the financial services industry in general.


Financial services companies in foreign countries are also subject to
regulatory and interest rate concerns. In particular, government regulation in
certain foreign countries may include controls on interest rates, credit
availability, prices and currency transfers. Negative developments regarding
Eurozone sovereign debt, including the potential for further downgrades of
sovereign credit ratings, as well as downgrades to the ratings of the U.S.
government's sovereign credit rating, could adversely affect financial services
issuers. In addition, the departure of any Eurozone country from use of the Euro
could lead to serious disruptions to foreign exchanges, operations and
settlements, which may have an adverse effect on financial services issuers.


The financial condition of customers, clients and counterparties, including
other financial institutions, could adversely affect financial services issuers.
Financial services issuers are interrelated as a result of market making,
trading, clearing or other counterparty relationships. Many of these
transactions expose financial services issuers to credit risk as a result of the
actions of, or deterioration in, the commercial soundness of other counterparty
financial institutions. Economic and market conditions may increase credit
exposures due to the increased risk of customer, client or counterparty default.
Downgrades to the credit ratings of financial services issuers could have a
negative effect on liquidity, cash flows, competitive position, financial
condition and results of operations by significantly limiting access to funding
or capital markets, increasing borrowing costs or triggering increased
collateral requirements. Financial services issuers face significant legal risk,
both from regulatory investigations and proceedings, as well as private actions.
Profit margins of these companies continue to shrink due to the commoditization
of traditional businesses, new competitors, capital expenditures on new
technology and the pressure to compete globally.


Banks face competition from nontraditional lending sources as regulatory
changes have permitted new entrants to offer various financial products.
Technological advances allow these nontraditional lending sources to cut
overhead and permit the more efficient use of customer data. Banks continue to
face tremendous pressure from mutual funds, brokerage firms and other financial
service providers in the competition to furnish services that were traditionally
offered by banks. Bank profitability is largely dependent on the availability
and cost of capital funds, and may fluctuate significantly when interest rates
change or due to increased competition. Further, economic conditions in the real
estate market may have a particularly strong effect on certain banks and savings
associations. Declining real estate values could adversely affect financial
institutions engaged in mortgage finance or other lending or investing
activities directly or indirectly connected to the value of real estate.


Companies engaged in investment management and broker-dealer activities are
subject to volatility in their earnings and share prices that often exceed the
volatility of the equity market in general. Adverse changes in the direction of
the stock market, investor confidence, equity transaction volume, the level and
direction of interest rates and the outlook of emerging markets could adversely
affect the financial stability, as well as the stock prices, of these companies.


Companies involved in the insurance, reinsurance and risk management industry
underwrite, sell or distribute property, casualty and business insurance. Many
factors affect insurance, reinsurance and risk management company profits,
including interest rate movements, the imposition of premium rate caps, a
misapprehension of the risks involved in given underwritings, competition and
pressure to compete globally, terrorism, weather catastrophes or other disasters
and the effects of client mergers. Individual companies may be exposed to risks
including reserve inadequacy and the inability to collect from reinsurance
carriers. Life and health insurance companies may be affected by mortality and
morbidity rates, including the effect of epidemics. Insurance companies are
subject to extensive governmental regulation, including the imposition of
maximum rate levels, which may not be adequate for some lines of business.
Insurance companies may be subject to severe price competition. Proposed or
potential tax law changes may also adversely affect insurance companies' policy
sales, tax obligations and profitability.


Health Care Issuers. Your Trust may invest significantly in bonds issued by
health care companies. These issuers include companies involved in advanced
medical devices and instruments, drugs and biotechnology, managed care, hospital
management/health services and medical supplies. These companies face
substantial government regulation and approval procedures. General risks of
health care companies include extensive competition, product liability
litigation and evolving government regulation.


On March 30, 2010, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010
(incorporating the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, collectively the
"Act") was enacted into law. The Act continues to have a significant impact on
the health care sector through the implementation of a number of reforms in a
complex and ongoing process, with varying effective dates. Significant
provisions of the Act include the introduction of required health care coverage
for most Americans, significant expansion in the number of Americans eligible
for Medicaid, modification of taxes and tax credits in the health care sector,
and subsidized insurance for low to middle income families. The Act also
provides for more thorough regulation of private health insurance providers,
including a prohibition on the denial of coverage due to pre-existing
conditions. Although the entirety of the Act will not come into effect until
2018, in the interim, health care companies will face continuing and significant
changes that may cause a decrease in profitability due to increased costs and
changes in the health care market. The Sponsor is unable to predict the full
impact of the Act on the Securities in your Trust.


As illustrated by the Act, Congress may from time to time propose legislative
action that will impact the health care sector. The proposals may span a wide
range of topics, including cost and price controls (which may include a freeze
on the prices of prescription drugs), incentives for competition in the
provision of health care services, promotion of pre-paid health care plans and
additional tax incentives and penalties aimed at the health care sector. The
government could also reduce funding for health care related research.


Drug and medical products companies also face the risk of increasing
competition from new products or services, generic drug sales, product
obsolescence, increased government regulation, termination of patent protection
for drug or medical supply products and the risk that a product will never come
to market. The research and development costs of bringing a new drug or medical
product to market are substantial. This process involves lengthy government
review with no guarantee of approval. These companies may have losses and may
not offer proposed products for several years, if at all. The failure to gain
approval for a new drug or product can have a substantial negative effect on a
company and its stock. The goods and services of health care issuers are also
subject to risks of malpractice claims, product liability claims or other
litigation.


Health care facility operators face risks related to demand for services, the
ability of the facility to provide required services, an increased emphasis on
outpatient services, confidence in the facility, management capabilities,
competitive forces that may result in price discounting, efforts by insurers and
government agencies to limit rates, expenses, the cost and possible
unavailability of malpractice insurance, and termination or restriction of
government financial assistance (such as Medicare, Medicaid or similar
programs).


Industrials Issuers. Your Trust may invest significantly in bonds issued by
industrials companies. General risks of industrials companies include the
general state of the economy, intense competition, consolidation, domestic and
international politics, excess capacity and consumer spending trends. Capital
goods companies may also be significantly affected by overall capital spending
and leverage levels, economic cycles, technical obsolescence, delays in
modernization, limitations on supply of key materials, labor relations,
government regulations, government contracts and e-commerce initiatives.
Industrials companies may also be affected by factors more specific to their
individual industries. Industrial machinery manufacturers may be subject to
declines in commercial and consumer demand and the need for modernization.
Aerospace and defense companies may be influenced by decreased demand for new
equipment, aircraft order cancellations, disputes over or ability to obtain or
retain government contracts, labor disputes, changes in government budget
priorities, changes in aircraft-leasing contracts and cutbacks in profitable
business travel. The number of housing starts, levels of public and
non-residential construction including weakening demand for new office and
retail space, and overall construction spending may adversely affect
construction materials and equipment manufacturers.


Technology Issuers. Your Trust may invest significantly in bonds issued by
companies in the technology sector which includes information technology
companies. These companies include those involved in computer and business
services, enterprise software/technical software, Internet and computer
software, Internet-related services, networking and telecommunications
equipment, telecommunications services, electronics products, server hardware,
computer hardware and peripherals, semiconductor capital equipment and
semiconductors. These companies face risks related to rapidly changing
technology, rapid product obsolescence, cyclical market patterns, evolving
industry standards and frequent new product introductions.


Companies in this sector face risks from rapid changes in technology,
competition, dependence on certain suppliers and supplies, rapid obsolescence of
products or services, patent termination, frequent new products and government
regulation. These companies can also be adversely affected by interruption or
reduction in supply of components or loss of key customers and failure to comply
with certain industry standards.


An unexpected change in technology can have a significant negative impact on
a company. The failure of a company to introduce new products or technologies or
keep pace with rapidly changing technology can have a negative impact on the
company's results. Technology companies may also be smaller and/or less
experienced companies with limited product lines, markets or resources. Stocks
of some Internet companies have high price-to-earnings ratios with little or no
earnings histories. Technology stocks tend to experience substantial price
volatility and speculative trading. Announcements about new products,
technologies, operating results or marketing alliances can cause stock prices to
fluctuate dramatically. At times, however, extreme price and volume fluctuations
are unrelated to the operating performance of a company. This can impact your
ability to redeem your Units at a price equal to or greater than what you paid.


Telecommunications Issuers. Your Trust may invest significantly in bonds
issued by telecommunications companies. These companies are subject to
substantial governmental regulation. For example, the United States government
and state governments regulate permitted rates of return and the kinds of
services that a company may offer. This industry has experienced substantial
deregulation in recent years. Deregulation may lead to fierce competition for
market share and can have a negative impact on certain companies. Recent federal
legislation governing the United States telecommunications industry remains
subject to judicial review and additional interpretation, which may adversely
affect the companies whose securities are held by your Trust. Competitive
pressures are intense and values of telecommunications company securities can
experience rapid volatility. Certain telecommunications products may become
outdated very rapidly. A company's performance can be hurt if the company fails
to keep pace with technological advances.


Several high-profile bankruptcies of large telecommunications companies have
illustrated the potentially unstable condition of telecommunications companies.
High debt loads that were accumulated during the industry growth spurt of the
1990s are catching up to the industry, causing debt and stock prices to trade
at distressed levels for many telecommunications companies and increasing the
cost of capital for needed additional investment. At the same time, demand for
some telecommunications services has fallen sharply, as several key markets
have become oversaturated, some local customers have switched to substitute
providers and technologies, and corporate profits and the economy generally
remain weak. To meet increasing competition, companies may have to commit
substantial capital, particularly in the formulation of new products and
services using new technologies. As a result, many companies have been
compelled to cut costs by reducing their workforce, outsourcing, consolidating
and/or closing existing facilities and divesting low selling product lines.
Furthermore, certain companies involved in the industry have also faced
scrutiny for alleged accounting irregularities that may have led to the
overstatement of their financial results, and other companies in the industry
may face similar scrutiny. Due to these and other factors, the risk level of
owning the securities of telecommunications companies has increased
substantially and may continue to rise.


Certain smaller companies in the portfolio may involve greater risk than
larger, established issuers. Smaller companies may have limited product lines,
markets or financial resources. Their securities may trade in lower volumes
than larger companies. As a result, the prices of these securities may
fluctuate more than the prices of securities of other issuers.


Utility and Energy Issuers. Your Trust may invest significantly in bonds
issued by utility and energy companies or in companies related to the utility
or energy industries. Many utility and energy companies, especially electric
and gas and other energy related utility companies, are subject to various
uncertainties, including:


o    risks of increases in fuel and other operating costs;


o    restrictions on operations and increased costs and delays as a result
of environmental, nuclear safety and other regulations;


o    regulatory restrictions on the ability to pass increasing wholesale
costs along to the retail and business customer;


o    coping with the general effects of energy conservation;


o    technological innovations which may render existing plants, equipment
or products obsolete;


o    the effects of local weather, maturing markets and difficulty in
expanding to new markets due to regulatory and other factors;


o    the potential impact of natural or man-made disasters;


o    difficulty obtaining adequate returns on invested capital, even if
frequent rate increases are approved by public service commissions;


o    the high cost of obtaining financing during periods of inflation;


o    difficulties of the capital markets in absorbing utility debt and
equity securities; and


o    increased competition.


Any of these factors, or a combination of these factors, could affect the
supply of or demand for electricity, natural gas, water or other energy, which
could adversely affect the profitability of utility and energy company bond
issuers and the performance of the your Trust.


Utility and energy companies are subject to extensive regulation at the
federal and state levels in the United States. At the federal level, the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission (the "FERC"), the Federal Trade Commission (the
"FTC"), the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), and the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission (the "NRC") have authority to oversee electric and
combination electric and gas utilities. The value of utility and energy company
stocks may decline because governmental regulation controlling these industries
can change. This regulation may prevent or delay the company from passing along
cost increases to its customers which could hinder the company's ability to meet
its obligations to its suppliers and could lead to the taking of measures,
including the acceleration of obligations or the institution of involuntary
bankruptcy proceedings, by its creditors against such company. Furthermore,
regulatory authorities, which may be subject to political and other pressures,
may not grant future rate increases, or may impose accounting or operational
policies, any of which could adversely affect a company's profitability and its
stock price. Certain utility companies have experienced full or partial
deregulation in recent years. These utility companies are frequently more
similar to industrial companies in that they are subject to greater competition
and have been permitted by regulators to diversify outside of their original
geographic regions and their traditional lines of business. These opportunities
may permit certain utility companies to earn more than their traditional
regulated rates of return. Some companies, however, may be forced to defend
their core business and may be less profitable. Mergers in the these industries
may require approval from several federal and state regulatory agencies,
including FERC, the FTC, and the SEC. These regulatory authorities could, as a
matter of policy, reverse the trend toward deregulation and make consolidation
more difficult, or cause delay in the merger process, any of which could cause
the prices of these stocks to fall.


More About the Bonds. In addition to describing the purpose of the bonds,
other information about the bonds is also included in the "Portfolio" in
Prospectus Part I and notes thereto. This information relates to other
characteristics of the bonds. This section briefly describes some of these
characteristics.


Floating Rate Bonds. A Variable Rate Trust invests in corporate bonds that
have variable or floating interest rates. A floating rate bond is one whose
terms provide for the readjustment of its interest rate whenever a specified
interest rate changes and which, at any time, can reasonably be expected to have
a market value that approximates its par value. The interest rate on a floating
rate bond may be adjusted automatically according to a stated prevailing market
rate, such as a bank's prime rate, the 91-day U.S. Treasury Bill rate, London
Interbank offered rate ("LIBOR") or some other standard. The instrument's rate
is adjusted automatically each time the base rate is adjusted. For floating rate
bonds, the coupon rate is usually reset each time interest is paid. A reset date
is any date on which the reset takes place based on the value of the index on
that date. The coupon rate is calculated as the reference rate plus a fixed
spread, which depends upon the issuer's credit quality and specifics of how the
instrument is structured. Floating rate bonds are frequently not rated by credit
rating agencies and must satisfy the same quality standards as commercial paper
investments. Floating rate bonds may be secured by bank letters of credit.
Generally, the changes in the interest rate on floating rate obligations reduce
the fluctuation in their market value. As interest rates decrease or increase,
the potential for capital appreciation or depreciation is less than that for
fixed-rate obligations of the same maturity.


Some floating rate obligations have a demand feature that allows a Variable
Rate Trust to tender the obligation to the issuer or a third party prior to its
maturity. The tender may be at par value plus accrued interest, according to the
terms of the obligations. Floating rate demand bonds that have a stated maturity
in excess of one year may have features that permit the holder to recover the
principal amount of the underlying security at specified intervals not exceeding
one year and upon no more than 30 days' notice. The issuer of that type of bond
normally has a corresponding right in its discretion, after a given period, to
prepay the outstanding principal amount of the bond plus accrued interest.
Generally the issuer must provide a specified number of days' notice to the
holder.


Original issue discount bonds were initially issued at a price below their
face (or par) value. These bonds typically pay a lower interest rate than
comparable bonds that were issued at or above their par value. In a stable
interest rate environment, the market value of these bonds tends to increase
more slowly in early years and in greater increments as the bonds approach
maturity. The issuers of these bonds may be able to call or redeem a bond
before its stated maturity date and at a price less than the bond's par value.


Zero coupon bonds are a type of original issue discount bond. These bonds do
not pay any current interest during their life. If an investor owns this type
of bond, the investor has the right to receive a final payment of the bond's
par value at maturity. The price of these bonds often fluctuates greatly during
periods of changing market interest rates compared to bonds that make current
interest payments. The issuers of these bonds may be able to call or redeem a
bond before its stated maturity date and at a price less than the bond's par
value.


No FDIC Guarantee. An investment in your Trust is not a deposit of any bank
and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
or any other government agency.



ESTIMATED CURRENT AND LONG-TERM RETURNS





Except for a variable rate trust, the Estimated Current Return and the
Estimated Long-Term Return are set forth in the Prospectus Part I. Estimated
Current Return is calculated by dividing the estimated net annual interest
income per Unit by the Public Offering Price. The estimated net annual interest
income per Unit will vary with changes in fees and expenses of your Trust and
with the principal prepayment, default (if any), redemption, maturity, exchange
or sale of bonds. The Public Offering Price will vary with changes in the price
of the bonds. Accordingly, there is no assurance that the present Estimated
Current Return will be realized in the future. Estimated Long-Term Return is
calculated using a formula which (1) takes into consideration, and determines
and factors in the relative weightings of, the market values, yields (which
takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts)
and estimated retirements of the bonds and (2) takes into account the expenses
and sales charge associated with Units. Since the value and estimated
retirements of the bonds and the expenses of a Trust will change, and there may
be corporate developments with respect to bonds held by a BlackRock Trust, there
is no assurance that the present Estimated Long-Term Return will be realized in
the future. The Estimated Current Return and Estimated Long-Term Return are
expected to differ because the calculation of Estimated Long-Term Return
reflects the estimated dates and amounts of principal returned on the bonds
while the Estimated Current Return calculation includes only net annual interest
income and Public Offering Price.


In order to calculate estimated returns of a GNMA Income Portfolio and the
estimated average life of the securities, an estimated prepayment rate for the
remaining term of the Trust's mortgage pool must be determined. Each of the
primary market makers in Ginnie Mae securities uses sophisticated computer
models to determine the estimated prepayment rate. These computer models take
into account a number of factors and assumptions including: actual prepayment
data reported by Ginnie Mae for recent periods on a particular pool, the impact
of aging on the prepayment of mortgage pools, the current interest rate
environment, the coupon, the housing environment, historical trends on Ginnie
Mae securities as a group, geographical factors and general economic trends. In
determining the estimated average life of the securities in your Trust, the
Sponsor has relied upon the median of the estimated prepayment rates determined
by primary market makers. No one can be certain that this estimate will prove
accurate or whether the estimated prepayment rates determined by other primary
market makers would have provided a better estimate. Any difference between the
estimate used and the actual prepayment rate will affect the Estimated Long-Term
Return of your Trust.



PUBLIC OFFERING





General. Units are offered at the Public Offering Price. The secondary
market Public Offering Price is based on the bid prices of the bonds, the sales
charge described below, cash, if any, in the Principal Account plus accrued
interest, if any. The actual sales charge that may be paid by an investor may
differ slightly from the sales charges shown herein due to rounding that occurs
in the calculation of the Public Offering Price and in the number of Units
purchased. The minimum purchase is one Unit. Certain broker-dealers or selling
firms may charge an order handling fee for processing Unit purchases.


The maximum secondary market sales charge is computed as described in the
following table based upon the estimated long-term return life in years ("ELTR
Life") of your Trust's portfolio:








ELTR Life (Years)             Sales Charge
------------------------------------------
Less than 2 ..................    1.50%
2 but less than 4 ............    2.00
4 but less than 6 ............    3.00
6 but less than 8 ............    3.50
8 but less than 11 ...........    4.00
11 but less than 15 ..........    4.50
15 and over ..................    4.80








The ELTR Life represents the estimated life of the bonds in a Trust's
portfolio as determined for purposes of calculating Estimated Long-Term Return.
See "Estimated Current and Long-Term Returns". The sales charges in the above
table are expressed as a percentage of the secondary market Public Offering
Price per Unit. For example, the maximum secondary market sales charge for a
Trust with an ELTR Life of "6 but less than 8" years would be 3.50% of the
Public Offering Price per Unit (3.630% of the aggregate bid price of the bonds).


Reducing Your Sales Charge. Employees, officers and directors (including
their spouses (or the equivalent if recognized under local law) and children or
step-children under 21 living in the same household, parents or step-parents and
trustees, custodians or fiduciaries for the benefit of such persons) of Invesco
Capital Markets, Inc. and its affiliates and dealers and their affiliates may
purchase Units at the Public Offering Price less the applicable dealer
concession. All employee discounts are subject to the policies of the related
selling firm. Only employees, officers and directors of companies that allow
their employees to participate in this employee discount program are eligible
for the discounts.


Offering Price. The Public Offering Price of Units will vary from the amounts
stated under "Summary of Essential Financial Information" in Prospectus Part I
in accordance with fluctuations in the prices of the bonds. The "Evaluation
Time" is the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange on each day that
the Exchange is open for regular trading or earlier on days where the Bond
Market Association recommends an early bond market close. Orders received by the
Trustee or Sponsor for purchases, sales or redemptions after that time, or on a
day when the New York Stock Exchange is closed, will be held until the next
determination of price. The secondary market Public Offering Price per Unit will
be equal to the aggregate bid price of the bonds plus the applicable secondary
market sales charge and dividing the sum by the number of Units outstanding. For
secondary market purposes, this computation will be made by the Evaluator as of
the Evaluation Time for each day on which any Unit is tendered for redemption
and as necessary. The offering price of bonds may be expected to range
approximately from 0.125% to 1.375% more than the bid price.


The aggregate price of the bonds is determined on the basis of the
appropriate bid prices or offering prices, as described herein, (a) on the
basis of current market prices obtained from dealers or brokers who customarily
deal in bonds comparable to those held by your Trust; (b) if these prices are
not available, on the basis of current market prices for comparable bonds; (c)
by causing the value of the bonds to be determined by others engaged in the
practice of evaluation, quoting or appraising comparable bonds; or (d) by any
combination of the above. Market prices of the bonds will generally fluctuate
with changes in market interest rates. Unless bonds are in default in payment
of principal or interest or in significant risk of default, the Evaluator will
not attribute any value to the insurance obtained by your Trust.


The Evaluator will consider in its evaluation of bonds which are in default
in payment of principal or interest or, in the Sponsor's opinion, in
significant risk of default (the "Defaulted Bonds") the value of any insurance
guaranteeing interest and principal payments. The value of the insurance will
be equal to the difference between (i) the market value of Defaulted Bonds
assuming the exercise of the right to obtain Permanent Insurance (less the
insurance premiums and related expenses attributable to the purchase of
Permanent Insurance) and (ii) the market value of Defaulted Bonds not covered
by Permanent Insurance. In addition, the Evaluator will consider the ability of
a Portfolio Insurer to meet its commitments under any insurance policy,
including commitments to issue Permanent Insurance. No value has been ascribed
to insurance obtained by an Insured Trust, if any, as of the date of this
prospectus.


A person will become the owner of Units on the date of settlement provided
payment has been received. Cash, if any, made available to the Sponsor prior to
the date of settlement for the purchase of Units may be used in the Sponsor's
business and may be deemed to be a benefit to the Sponsor, subject to the
limitations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.


Accrued Interest. Accrued interest is an accumulation of unpaid interest on
securities which generally is paid by the bonds semi-annually, although your
Trust accrues interest daily. Because of this, your Trust always has an amount
of interest earned but not yet collected by the Trustee. For this reason, with
respect to purchases of Units in the secondary market, the proportionate share
of accrued interest to the settlement date is added to the Public Offering
Price of Units of Series other than those described in the following two
sections. You will receive the amount of accrued interest paid on your Units on
the next distribution date. Because of the varying interest payment dates of
the bonds, accrued interest at any point in time will be greater than the
amount of interest actually received by your Trust and distributed to
Unitholders. If a you sell or redeem all or a portion of your Units, you will
be entitled to receive your proportionate share of the accrued interest from
the purchaser of your Units.


Unit Distribution. Units will be distributed to the public by broker-dealers
and others at the Public Offering Price, plus accrued interest. The Sponsor
intends to qualify Units for sale in a number of states. Broker-dealers or
others will be allowed a concession or agency commission in connection with the
distribution of Units equal to 80% of the sales charge applicable to the
transaction provided that the Units are acquired from the Sponsor. Certain
commercial banks may be making Units available to their customers on an agency
basis. A portion of the sales charge paid by these customers (equal to the
agency commission referred to above) is retained by or remitted to the banks.
Any discount provided to investors will be borne by the selling dealer or
agent. The Sponsor reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any order
for the purchase of Units and to change the amount of the concession or agency
commission to dealers and others up to the entire amount of the sales charge.


Sponsor Compensation. Broker-dealers will receive a gross sales commission
equal to the sales charge applicable to the transaction involved. See "Public
Offering--General". The Sponsor will receive from the broker-dealers the excess
of this gross sales commission over the amounts set forth in the previous
section.


In addition, the Sponsor may have realized a profit or loss, as a result of
the difference between the price paid for the bonds by the Sponsor and the cost
of the bonds to a Trust. The Sponsor or its affiliates may also have realized
profits or losses with respect to bonds which were acquired by the Sponsor from
underwriting syndicates of which they were members. The Sponsor has not
participated as sole underwriter or as manager or as a member of the
underwriting syndicates from which the bonds in a Trust were acquired. The
Sponsor may further realize profit or loss as a result of possible fluctuations
in the market value of the bonds since all proceeds received from purchasers of
Units (excluding dealer concessions or agency commissions allowed, if any) will
be retained by the Sponsor. The Sponsor will also realize profits or losses in
the amount of any difference between the price at which Units are purchased and
the price at which Units are resold in connection with maintaining a secondary
market for Units and will also realize profits or losses resulting from a
redemption of repurchased Units at a price above or below the purchase price.


We may provide, at our own expense and out of our own profits, additional
compensation and benefits to broker-dealers who sell Units of a Trust and our
other products. This compensation is intended to result in additional sales of
our products and/or compensate broker-dealers and financial advisors for past
sales. We may make these payments for marketing, promotional or related
expenses, including, but not limited to, expenses of entertaining retail
customers and financial advisors, advertising, sponsorship of events or
seminars, obtaining shelf space in broker-dealer firms and similar activities
designed to promote the sale of a Trust and our other products. Fees may
include payment for travel expenses, including lodging, incurred in connection
with trips taken by invited registered representatives for meetings or seminars
of a business nature. These arrangements will not change the price you pay for
your Units.


Market for Units. Although not obligated to do so, the Sponsor intends to
maintain a market for Units and offer to purchase Units at prices, subject to
change at any time, based upon the aggregate bid prices of the bonds plus
accrued interest and any principal cash on hand, less any amounts representing
taxes or other governmental charges payable out of your Trust and less any
accrued Trust expenses. If the supply of Units exceeds demand or if some other
business reason warrants it, the Sponsor may either discontinue all purchases
of Units or discontinue purchases of Units at these prices. If a market is not
maintained and the Unitholder cannot find another purchaser, a Unitholder will
be able to dispose of Units by tendering them to the Trustee for redemption at
the Redemption Price. See "Rights of Unitholders--Redemption of Units". A
Unitholder who wishes to dispose of his Units should inquire of his broker as
to current market prices in order to determine whether there is in any price in
excess of the Redemption Price and, if so, the amount thereof. The Trustee will
notify the Sponsor of any tender of Units for redemption. If the Sponsor's bid
in the secondary market at that time equals or exceeds the Redemption Price per
Unit, it may purchase the Units not later than the day on which the Units would
otherwise have been redeemed by the Trustee.



RIGHTS OF UNITHOLDERS





Distributions of Interest and Principal. Unitholders who purchase Units in
the secondary market will receive distributions in accordance with the election,
if any, of the prior owner. Interest received by a Trust, pro rated on an annual
basis, will be distributed monthly unless the prior owner of your Units elected
to receive quarterly or semi-annual distributions. Certain Trusts offer only
monthly distribution options while others offer only monthly and semi-annual
distribution options. A Trust that has elected to be structured as a "regulated
investment company" for federal tax purposes may make additional distributions
at the end of each year.


Interest received by a Trust, including that part of the proceeds of any
disposition of bonds which represents accrued interest, is credited by the
Trustee to the Interest Account. Other receipts are credited to the Principal
Account. After deduction of amounts sufficient to reimburse the Trustee,
without interest, for any amounts advanced and paid to the Sponsor as the
Unitholder of record as of the First Settlement Date, interest received will be
distributed on each distribution date to Unitholders of record as of the
preceding record date. All distributions will be net of estimated expenses. The
Trustee is not required to pay interest on funds held in the Principal or
Interest Account (but may itself earn interest thereon and therefore benefits
from the use of these funds).


For a Trust with a Date of Deposit prior to April 23, 2009, funds in the
Principal Account will be distributed on each semi-annual distribution date to
Unitholders of record as of the preceding semi-annual record date. The Trustee
is not required to make a distribution from the Principal Account unless the
amount available for distribution therein shall equal at least $1.00 per Unit.
However, should the amount available for distribution in the Principal Account
equal or exceed $10.00 per Unit, the Trustee will make a special distribution
from the Principal Account on the next monthly distribution date to Unitholders
of record on the related monthly record date.


For a Trust with a Date of Deposit on or after April 23, 2009, should the
amount available for distribution in the Principal Account equal or exceed
$5.00 per Unit, the Trustee will make a distribution from the Principal Account
on the next monthly distribution date to Unitholders of record on the related
monthly record date. However, funds in the Principal Account will be
distributed on the last distribution date of each calendar year to Unitholders
of record as of the preceding record date if the amount available for
distribution shall equal at least $1.00 per Unit.


Because interest payments are not received by a Trust at a constant rate
throughout the year, and, with respect only to a Variable Rate Trust, because
the floating rate bonds in a Variable Rate Trust will have varying interest
payment amounts over the life of a Variable Rate Trust, interest distributions
may be more or less than the amount credited to the Interest Account as of the
record date. For the purpose of minimizing fluctuations in interest
distributions, the Trustee is authorized to advance amounts necessary to provide
interest distributions of approximately equal amounts. The Trustee is reimbursed
for these advances from funds in the Interest Account on the next record date.
Persons who purchase Units between a record date and a distribution date will
receive their first distribution on the second distribution date after the
purchase, under the applicable plan of distribution.


Redemption of Units. All or a portion of your Units may be tendered to The
Bank of New York Mellon, the Trustee, for redemption at Unit Investment Trust
Division, 111 Sanders Creek Parkway, East Syracuse, New York 13057, on any day
the New York Stock Exchange is open. No redemption fee will be charged by the
Sponsor or the Trustee, but you are responsible for applicable governmental
charges, if any. Units redeemed by the Trustee will be canceled. You may redeem
all or a portion of your Units by sending a request for redemption to your bank
or broker-dealer through which you hold your Units. No later than three business
days following satisfactory tender, the Unitholder will receive an amount for
each Unit equal to the Redemption Price per Unit next computed after receipt by
the Trustee of the tender of Units. The "date of tender" is deemed to be the
date on which Units are received by the Trustee, except that as regards Units
received after the Evaluation Time on days of trading on the New York Stock
Exchange, the date of tender is the next day on which that Exchange is open and
the Units will be deemed to have been tendered to the Trustee on that day for
redemption at the Redemption Price. Redemption requests received by the Trustee
after the Evaluation Time, and redemption requests received by authorized
financial professionals after the Evaluation Time or redemption requests
received by such persons that are not transmitted to the Trustee until after the
time designated by the Trustee, are priced based on the date of the next
determined redemption price provided they are received timely by the Trustee on
such date. It is the responsibility of authorized financial professionals to
transmit redemption requests received by them to the Trustee so they will be
received in a timely manner. Certain broker-dealers or selling firms may charge
an order handling fee for processing redemption requests. Units redeemed
directly through the Trustee are not subject to such fees.


Under IRS regulations, the Trustee is required to withhold a specified
percentage of a Unit redemption if the Trustee has not received the Unitholder's
tax identification number as required by such regulations. Any amount withheld
is transmitted to the IRS and may be recovered by the Unitholder only when
filing a return. Under normal circumstances the Trustee obtains the Unitholder's
tax identification number from the selling broker. However, at any time a
Unitholder elects to tender Units for redemption, the Unitholder should provide
a tax identification number to the Trustee in order to avoid this possible
"backup withholding".


The Redemption Price per Unit (as well as the secondary market Public
Offering Price) will be determined on the basis of the bid price of the bonds as
of the Evaluation Time on days of trading on the New York Stock Exchange on the
date any such determination is made. The Evaluator determines the Redemption
Price per Unit on days Units are tendered for redemption. The Redemption Price
per Unit is the pro rata share of each Unit on the basis of (i) the cash on hand
in a Trust or moneys in the process of being collected, (ii) the value of the
bonds based on the bid prices of the bonds, except for cases in which the value
of insurance has been included, (iii) accrued interest, less (a) amounts
representing taxes or other governmental charges and (b) the accrued Trust
expenses. The Evaluator may determine the value of the bonds by employing any of
the methods set forth in "Public Offering--Offering Price". In determining the
Redemption Price per Unit no value will be assigned to the portfolio insurance
maintained on the bonds in a Trust unless the bonds are in default in payment of
principal or interest or in significant risk of default. For a description of
the situations in which the Evaluator may value the insurance obtained by a
Trust, see "Public Offering--Offering Price". Accrued interest paid on
redemption shall be withdrawn from the Interest Account or, if the balance
therein is insufficient, from the Principal Account. All other amounts will be
withdrawn from the Principal Account. Units so redeemed shall be cancelled.


The price at which Units may be redeemed could be less than the price paid
by the Unitholder and may be less than the par value of the bonds represented
by the Units redeemed. The Trustee may sell bonds to cover redemptions. When
bonds are sold, the size and diversity of your Trust will be reduced. Sales may
be required at a time when bonds would not otherwise be sold and might result
in lower prices than might otherwise be realized.


The right of redemption may be suspended and payment postponed for any
period during which the New York Stock Exchange is closed, other than for
customary weekend and holiday closings, or during which the SEC determines that
trading on that Exchange is restricted or an emergency exists, as a result of
which disposal or evaluation of the bonds is not reasonably practicable, or for
other periods as the SEC may by order permit. Under certain extreme
circumstances the Sponsor may apply to the SEC for an order permitting a full
or partial suspension of the right of Unitholders to redeem their Units.


In addition, with respect to Van Kampen Unit Trusts, Taxable Income Series
119 and subsequent series, the Trustee reserves the right to satisfy any
redemption of 1,000 or more Units with an aggregate redemption price of
$1,000,000 or more in an in kind distribution of bonds. An in kind distribution
of bonds will be made by the Trustee through the distribution of each of the
bonds in the Trust in book-entry form to the account of the Unitholder's
broker-dealer at Depository Trust Company. Amounts representing fractional
portions of a bond will be distributed in cash. The Trustee may adjust the
bonds included in a Unitholder's in kind distribution to facilitate the
distribution of whole bonds. Special tax consequences will result if a
Unitholder receives an in kind distribution. See "Tax Status".


Exchange Option. When you redeem Units of your Trust or when your Trust
terminates, you may be able to exchange your Units for units of other Invesco
unit trusts at a reduced sales charge. You should contact your financial
professional for more information about trusts currently available for
exchanges. Before you exchange Units, you should read the prospectus of the new
trust carefully and understand the risks and fees. You should then discuss this
option with your financial professional to determine whether your investment
goals have changed, whether current trusts suit you and to discuss tax
consequences. We may discontinue this option at any time. The exchange will
generally be treated as a sale and a taxable transaction for federal and state
income tax purposes.


Units. Ownership of Units is evidenced in book-entry form only and will not
be evidenced by certificates. Units purchased or held through your bank or
broker-dealer will be recorded in book-entry form and credited to the account
of your bank or broker-dealer at the Depository Trust Company ("DTC"). Units
are transferable by contacting your bank or broker-dealer through which you
hold your Units. Transfer, and the requirements therefore, will be governed by
the applicable procedures of DTC and your agreement with the DTC participant in
whose name your Units are registered on the transfer records of DTC.


Reports Provided. Unitholders will receive a statement of interest and other
receipts received for each distribution. For as long as the Sponsor deems it to
be in the best interest of Unitholders, the accounts of your Trust will be
audited annually by an independent registered public accounting firm and the
report of the accountants will be furnished to Unitholders upon request. Within
a reasonable period of time after the end of each year, the Trustee will
furnish to each person who was a registered Unitholder during that year a
statement describing the interest and principal received on the bonds, actual
Trust distributions, Trust expenses, a list of the bonds and other Trust
information. Unitholders will be furnished the Evaluator's evaluations of the
bonds upon request to the Trustee. If you have any questions regarding your
account or your Trust, please contact your financial adviser or the Trustee.
The Sponsor does not have access to individual account information.



INSURANCE ON THE BONDS IN AN INSURED TRUST





Insurance has been obtained guaranteeing prompt payment of interest and
principal, when due, in respect of the bonds in an Insured Trust. An insurance
policy obtained by an Insured Trust is non-cancelable and will continue in force
so long as the Trust is in existence, the respective Portfolio Insurer is still
in business and the bonds described in the policy continue to be held by the
Trust. Any portfolio insurance premium for an Insured Trust is paid by the Trust
on a monthly basis. The premium for any Preinsured Bond insurance has been paid
by the issuer, by a prior owner of the bonds or the Sponsor and any policy is
non-cancelable and will continue in force so long as the bonds so insured are
outstanding and the Preinsured Bond Insurer remains in business. The Portfolio
Insurers and the Preinsured Bond Insurers, if any, are described in "Portfolio"
in Prospectus Part I and the notes thereto. More detailed information regarding
insurance on the bonds and the Preinsured Bond and Portfolio Insurers is
included in the Information Supplement. See "Additional Information".


The portfolio insurance obtained by an Insured Trust guarantees the timely
payment of principal and interest on the bonds when they fall due. For this
purpose, "when due" generally means the stated maturity date for the payment of
principal and interest. However, in the event (a) an issuer defaults in the
payment of principal or interest, (b) an issuer enters into a bankruptcy
proceeding or (c) the maturity of the bond is accelerated, the affected
Portfolio Insurer has the option to pay the outstanding principal amount of the
bond plus accrued interest to the date of payment and thereby retire the bond
from an Insured Trust prior to the bond's stated maturity date. The insurance
does not guarantee the market value of the bonds or the value of the Units. The
Trustee, upon the sale of a bond covered under a portfolio insurance policy has
the right to obtain permanent insurance with respect to the bond (i.e.,
insurance to maturity of the bond regardless of the identity of the holder)
(the "Permanent Insurance") upon the payment of a single predetermined
insurance premium and expenses from the proceeds of the sale of the bond. It is
expected that the Trustee would exercise the right to obtain Permanent
Insurance only if upon exercise the Trust would receive net proceeds in excess
of the sale proceeds if the bonds were sold on an uninsured basis.


Each Portfolio Insurer is subject to regulation by the department of
insurance in the state in which it is qualified to do business. Such
regulation, however, is no guarantee that each Portfolio Insurer will be able
to perform on its contract of insurance in the event a claim should be made. At
the date hereof, it is reported that no claims have been submitted or are
expected to be submitted to any of the Portfolio Insurers which would
materially impair the ability of any such company to meet its commitment
pursuant to any contract of insurance. The information relating to each
Portfolio Insurer has been furnished by such companies. The financial
information with respect to each Portfolio Insurer appears in reports filed
with state insurance regulatory authorities and is subject to audit and review
by such authorities. No representation is made herein as to the accuracy or
adequacy of such information or as to the absence of material adverse changes
in such information subsequent to the dates thereof.

Sponsor. Invesco Capital Markets, Inc. is the Sponsor of your Trust. The
Sponsor is a wholly owned subsidiary of Invesco Advisers, Inc. ("Invesco
Advisers"). Invesco Advisers is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Invesco
Ltd., a leading independent global investment manager that provides a wide range
of investment strategies and vehicles to its retail, institutional and high net
worth clients around the globe. The Sponsor's principal office is located at 11
Greenway Plaza, Houston, Texas 77046-1173. As of December 31, 2014, the total

conflicts of interest and to prevent fraud, deception or misconduct with respect
to your Trust. The Information Supplement contains additional information about
the Sponsor.


If the Sponsor shall fail to perform any of its duties under the Trust
Agreement or become incapable of acting or shall become bankrupt or its affairs
are taken over by public authorities, then the Trustee may (i) appoint a
successor Sponsor at rates of compensation deemed by the Trustee to be
reasonable and not exceeding amounts prescribed by the Securities and Exchange
Commission, (ii) terminate the Trust Agreement and liquidate the Trusts as
provided therein or (iii) continue to act as Trustee without terminating the
Trust Agreement.


Trustee. The Trustee is The Bank of New York Mellon, a trust company
organized under the laws of New York. The Bank of New York Mellon has its
principal unit investment trust division offices at 2 Hanson Place, 12th Floor,
Brooklyn, New York 11217, telephone (800) 856-8487. If you have questions
regarding your account or your Trust, please contact the Trustee at its

Portfolio Administration. Your Trust is not a managed fund and, except as
provided in the Trust Agreement, bonds generally will not be sold or replaced.
The Sponsor may, however, direct that bonds be sold in certain limited
situations to protect your Trust based on advice from the Supervisor. These
situations may include default in interest or principal payments on the bonds or
other obligations of an issuer, an advanced refunding or institution of certain
legal proceedings. In addition, the Trustee may sell bonds designated by the
Supervisor for purposes of redeeming Units or payment of expenses. The
Supervisor will consider a variety of factors in designating bonds to be sold
including interest rates, market value and marketability. Except in limited
circumstances, the Trustee will generally reject (and must reject with respect
to any Trust with a date of deposit on or before August 2, 2006) any offer by an
issuer to issue bonds in exchange or substitution for the bonds (such as a
refunding or refinancing plan). The Trustee will promptly notify Unitholders of
any exchange or substitution. The Information Supplement contains a more
detailed description of circumstances in which bonds may be sold or replaced.
See "Additional Information".


If a Trust is structured as a "regulated investment company" for federal tax
purposes, the Sponsor may direct the reinvestment of proceeds of the sale of
bonds if the sale is the direct result of serious adverse credit factors which,
in the opinion of the Sponsor, would make retention of the bonds detrimental to
the Trust. In such a case, the Sponsor may, but is not obligated to, direct the
reinvestment of sale proceeds in any other securities that meet the criteria
for inclusion in the trust on the Date of Deposit. The Sponsor may also
instruct the Trustee to take action necessary to ensure that such a Trust
continues to satisfy the qualifications of a regulated investment company and
to avoid imposition of tax on undistributed income of the Trust.


Replacement Bonds. No assurance can be given that a Trust will retain its
present size or composition because bonds may be sold, redeemed or mature from
time to time and the proceeds will be distributed to Unitholders and will not be
reinvested. In the event of a failure to deliver any bond that has been
purchased under a contract ("Failed Bonds"), the Sponsor is authorized under the
Trust Agreement to direct the Trustee to acquire other bonds ("Replacement
Bonds") to make up the original portfolio of a Trust. Replacement Bonds must be
purchased within 20 days after delivery of the notice of the failed contract and
the purchase price (exclusive of accrued interest) may not exceed the amount of
funds reserved for the purchase of the Failed Bonds. The Replacement Bonds must

(i) be long-term, within a 10 to 20 year maturity range, intermediate term or
short-term (as applicable) corporate or taxable municipal bonds, debentures,
notes or other straight debt obligations (whether secured or unsecured and
whether senior or subordinated) without equity or other conversion features,
with fixed maturity dates substantially the same as those of the Failed Bonds
having no warrants or subscription privileges attached; (ii) be payable in
United States currency; (iii) not be when, as and if issued obligations or
restricted securities; (iv) be issued after July 18, 1984 if the interest is
United States source income; (v) be issued or guaranteed by an issuer subject to
or exempt from the reporting requirements under Section 13 or 15(d) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (or similar provisions of law) or guaranteed,
directly or indirectly, by means of a lease agreement, agreement to buy
securities, services or products, or other similar commitment of the credit of
such an issuer to the payment of the substitute bonds; (vi) maintain the S&P AAA
rating for an Insured Trust and an A rating for a Build America Bonds Trust
consisting of long-term bonds; and (vii) be eligible for (and when acquired be
insured under) the insurance obtained by an Insured Trust. With respect to a
GNMA Income Portfolio, the Replacement Securities must (i) be mortgage-backed
securities of the modified pass-through type issued by the Government National
Mortgage Association which maintain as far as practicable the original
percentage relationship between the principal amounts of Securities of specified
interest rates and ranges of maturity in the Trust, and (ii) not be "when, as
and if issued" obligations or restricted securities. The Trustee shall notify
all Unitholders of a Trust within five days after the acquisition of a
Replacement Bond and shall make a pro rata distribution of the amount, if any,
by which the cost of the Failed Bond exceeded the cost of the Replacement Bond
plus accrued interest. If Failed Bonds are not replaced, the Sponsor will refund
the sales charge attributable to the Failed Bonds to all Unitholders of the
Trust and distribute the principal and accrued interest (at the coupon rate of
the Failed Bonds to the date of removal from the Trust) attributable to the
Failed Bonds within 30 days after removal. If Failed Bonds are not replaced, the
Estimated Net Annual Interest Income per Unit would be reduced and the Estimated
Current Return and Estimated Long-Term Return (if applicable) might be lowered.
Unitholders may not be able to reinvest their proceeds in other securities at a
yield equal to or in excess of the yield of the Failed Bonds.


Amendment of Trust Agreement. The Sponsor and the Trustee may amend the Trust
Agreement without the consent of Unitholders to correct any provision which may
be defective or to make other provisions that will not materially adversely
affect the interest of the Unitholders (as determined in good faith by the
Sponsor and the Trustee) or maintain the tax status of a Trust. The Trust
Agreement may not be amended to increase the number of Units or to permit the
acquisition of bonds in addition to or in substitution for any of the bonds
initially deposited in a Trust, except for the substitution of certain refunding
bonds. The Trustee will notify Unitholders of any amendment.


Termination of Trust Agreement. A Trust will terminate upon the redemption,
maturity, prepayment, sale or other disposition of the last bond held in the
Trust. A Trust may also be terminated at any time by consent of Unitholders of
51% of the Units then outstanding (or with respect to Van Kampen Unit Trusts,
Taxable Income Series 119 and subsequent series, by consent of Unitholders of
75% of the Units then outstanding, and with respect to a GNMA Income Portfolio,
by consent of Unitholders of 66 2 / 3% of the Units then outstanding) or by the
Trustee when the value of the Trust is less than 20% (or with respect to a GNMA
Income Portfolio less than 40%) of the original principal amount of bonds. A
Trust will be liquidated by the Trustee in the event that a sufficient number
of Units of the Trust not yet sold are tendered for redemption by the
Underwriters, including the Sponsor, so that the net worth of the Trust would
be reduced to less than 40% of the value of the Securities at the time they
were deposited in the Trust. The Trustee will notify each Unitholder of any
termination within a reasonable time and will then liquidate any remaining
bonds. The sale of bonds upon termination may result in a lower amount than
might otherwise be realized if the sale was not required at that time. For this
reason, among others, the amount realized by a Unitholder upon termination may
be less than the principal amount of bonds per Unit or value at the time of
purchase. The Trustee will distribute to each Unitholder his share of the
balance of the Interest and Principal Accounts after deduction of costs,
expenses or indemnities. The Unitholder will receive a final distribution
statement with this distribution. When the Trustee in its sole discretion
determines that any amounts held in reserve are no longer necessary, it will
distribute these amounts to Unitholders. The Information Supplement contains
further information regarding termination of a Trust. See "Additional
Information".


Limitation on Liabilities. The Sponsor, Evaluator, Supervisor and Trustee
shall be under no liability to Unitholders for taking any action or for
refraining from taking any action in good faith pursuant to the Trust
Agreement, or for errors in judgment, but shall be liable only for their own
willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence (negligence in the case of
the Trustee) in the performance of their duties or by reason of their reckless
disregard of their obligations and duties hereunder. The Trustee shall not be
liable for depreciation or loss incurred by reason of the sale by the Trustee
of any of the bonds. In the event of the failure of the Sponsor to act under
the Trust Agreement, the Trustee may act thereunder and shall not be liable for
any action taken by it in good faith under the Trust Agreement. The Trustee is
not liable for any taxes or governmental charges imposed on the bonds, on it as
Trustee under the Trust Agreement or on a Trust which the Trustee may be
required to pay under any present or future law of the United States of America
or of any other taxing authority having jurisdiction. In addition, the Trust
Agreement contains other customary provisions limiting the liability of the
Trustee. The Trustee and Sponsor may rely on any evaluation furnished by the
Evaluator and have no responsibility for the accuracy thereof. Determinations
by the Evaluator shall be made in good faith upon the basis of the best
information available to it; provided, however, that the Evaluator shall be
under no liability to the Trustee, Sponsor, Supervisor or Unitholders for
errors in judgment.



FEDERAL TAX STATUS






Grantor Trusts



This section summarizes some of the principal U.S. federal income tax
consequences of owning Units of a Trust which has been structured to be taxed as
a grantor trust for federal tax purposes. Please see "Notes to Financial
Statements" in Prospectus Part I. Tax laws and interpretations change
frequently, and these summaries do not describe all of the tax consequences to
all taxpayers. For example, these summaries generally do not describe your
situation if you are a corporation, a non-U.S. person, a broker/dealer, a
tax-exempt entity, or other investor with special circumstances. In addition,
this section does not describe your state, local or foreign tax consequences.


This federal income tax summary is based in part on the advice of counsel to
the Sponsor. The Internal Revenue Service could disagree with any conclusions
set forth in this section. In addition, our counsel was not asked to review the
federal income tax treatment of the assets to be deposited in the Trust. The
Trust may be subject to penalties under federal tax law with respect to its
compliance and reporting obligations.


As with any investment, you should seek advice based on your individual
circumstances from your own tax advisor.


Assets of the Trust. Each Trust is expected to hold various debt obligations
(the "Debt Obligations") that are treated as debt for federal income tax
purposes. It is possible that the Trust will also hold other assets, including
assets that are treated differently for federal income tax purposes from those
described above, in which case you will have federal income tax consequences
different from or in addition to those described in this section. All of the
assets held by the Trust constitute the "Trust Assets." Neither our counsel nor
we have analyzed the proper federal income tax treatment of the Trust Assets.


Trust Status. If the Trust is at all times operated in accordance with the
documents establishing the Trust and certain requirements of federal income tax
law are met, the Trust will not be taxed as a corporation for federal income
tax purposes. As a Unit owner, you will be treated as the owner of a pro rata
portion of each of the Trust Assets, and as such you will be considered to have
received a pro rata share of income (e.g., interest, accruals of original issue
discount and market discount, and capital gains, if any) from each Trust Asset
when such income would be considered to be received by you if you directly
owned the Trust Assets. This is true even if you elect to have your
distributions reinvested into additional Units. In addition, the income from
Trust Assets that you must take into account for federal income tax purposes is
not reduced by amounts used to pay sales charges or Trust expenses.


Your Tax Basis and Income or Loss Upon Disposition. If your Trust disposes
of Trust Assets, you will generally recognize gain or loss. If you dispose of
your Units or redeem your Units for cash, you will also generally recognize
gain or loss. To determine the amount of this gain or loss, you must subtract
your adjusted tax basis in the related Trust Assets from your share of the
total amount received in the transaction. You can generally determine your
initial tax basis in each Trust Asset by apportioning the cost of your Units,
including sales charges, among the Trust Assets ratably according to their
values on the date you acquire your Units. In certain circumstances, however,
you may have to adjust your tax basis after you acquire your Units (for
example, in the case of accruals of original issue discount, market discount,
premium and accrued interest, as discussed below).


If you are an individual, the maximum marginal federal tax rate for net
capital gain currently is generally 20%. Dividends and net capital gains also
are subject to a 3.8% Medicare contribution tax on net investment income for
taxpayers at higher income levels.


Net capital gain equals net long-term capital gain minus net short-term
capital loss for the taxable year. Capital gain or loss is long-term if the
holding period for the asset is more than one year and is short-term if the
holding period for the asset is one year or less. You must exclude the date you
purchase your Units to determine your holding period. The tax rates for capital
gains realized from assets held for one year or less are generally the same as
for ordinary income.


Dividends Received Deduction. Because the Debt Obligations are treated as
debt (not equity) for federal income tax purposes, distributions from the Debt
Obligations are not eligible for the dividends received deduction.


Discount, Accrued Interest and Premium on Debt Obligations. Some Debt
Obligations may have been issued with original issue discount. This generally
means that the Debt Obligations were originally issued at a price below their
face (or par) value. Original issue discount accrues on a daily basis and
generally is treated as interest income for federal income tax purposes. Your
basis of each Debt Obligation that was issued with original issue discount must
be increased as original issue discount accrues.


Some of the Debt Obligations may give their issuers a right to defer
payments on the Debt Obligations. Such Debt Obligations are subject to special
treatment under the original issue discount rules. Among other things, this
treatment may result in you being required to recognize income for federal
income tax purposes in a particular year with respect to a Debt Obligation even
though the actual cash payments on the Debt Obligation have been deferred to a
later year.


Some Debt Obligations may have been purchased by you or your Trust at a
market discount. Market discount is generally the excess of the stated
redemption price at maturity for the Debt Obligation over the purchase price of
the Debt Obligation. Market discount can arise based on the price your Trust
pays for a Debt Obligation or based on the price you pay for your Units. Market
discount is taxed as ordinary income. You will recognize this income when your
Trust receives principal payments on the Debt Obligation, when the Debt
Obligation is disposed of or redeemed, or when you sell or redeem your Units.
Alternatively, you may elect to include market discount in taxable income as it
accrues. Whether or not you make this election will affect how you calculate
your basis and the timing of certain interest expense deductions.


Some Debt Obligations may have been purchased by you or your Trust at a
premium. Generally, if the tax basis of your pro rata portion of any Debt
Obligation, generally including sales charges, exceeds the amount payable at
maturity, such excess is considered premium. You may elect to amortize premium.
If you make this election, you may reduce your interest income received on the
Debt Obligation by the amount of the premium that is amortized and your tax
basis will be reduced.


If the price of your Units includes accrued interest on a Debt Obligation,
you must include the accrued interest in your tax basis in that Debt
Obligation. When your Trust receives this accrued interest, you must treat it
as a return of capital and reduce your tax basis in the Debt Obligation.


This discussion provides only the general rules with respect to the tax
treatment of original issue discount, market discount and premium. The rules,
however, are complex and special rules apply in certain circumstances. For
example, the accrual of market discount or premium may differ from the
discussion set forth above in the case of Debt Obligations that were issued
with original issue discount.


Exchanges. If you elect to have your proceeds from your Trust rolled over
into a future Invesco-sponsored unit investment trust, it is considered a sale
for federal income tax purposes and any gain on the sale will be treated as
capital gain and, in general, any loss will be treated as capital loss. However,
any loss you incur in connection with the exchange of your Units of your Trust
for units of the next series will generally be disallowed with respect to this
deemed sale and subsequent deemed repurchase, to the extent the two trusts have
substantially identical Trust Assets under the wash sale provisions of the Code.


In Kind Distributions. Under certain circumstances as described in this
prospectus, you may receive an in kind distribution of Trust Assets when you
redeem your Units. For an in kind distribution, you will receive Trust Assets
plus, possibly, cash. You will not recognize gain or loss if you only receive
whole Trust Assets in exchange for the identical amount of your pro rata
portion of the same Trust Assets held by your Trust. However, if you also
receive cash in exchange for a Trust Asset or a fractional portion of a Trust
Asset, you will generally recognize gain or loss based on the difference
between the amount of cash you receive and your tax basis in such Trust Asset
or fractional portion.


Limitations on the Deductibility of Trust Expenses. Generally, for federal
income tax purposes, you must take into account your full pro rata share of
your Trust's income, even if some of that income is used to pay Trust expenses.
You may deduct your pro rata share of each expense paid by your Trust to the
same extent as if you directly paid the expense. You may be required to treat
some or all of the expenses of your Trust as miscellaneous itemized deductions.
Individuals may only deduct certain miscellaneous itemized deductions to the
extent they exceed 2% of adjusted gross income.


Foreign Investors. If you are a foreign investor (i.e., an investor other
than a U.S. citizen or resident or a U.S. corporation, partnership, estate or
trust), you may not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes, including
withholding taxes, on some of the income from your Trust or gain from the sale
or redemption of your Units, provided that certain conditions are met. You
should consult your tax advisor with respect to the conditions you must meet in
order to be exempt for U.S. tax purposes. You should also consult your tax
advisor with respect to other U.S. tax withholding and reporting requirements.


Foreign Taxes. Some distributions by your Trust may be subject to foreign
withholding taxes. Any income withheld will still be treated as income to you.
Under the grantor trust rules, you are considered to have paid directly your
share of any foreign taxes that are paid. Therefore, for U.S. tax purposes, you
may be entitled to a foreign tax credit or deduction for those foreign taxes.


The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act ("FATCA"). A 30% withholding tax on
your Trust's distributions, including capital gains distributions, and on gross
proceeds from the sale or other disposition of Units generally applies if paid
to a foreign entity unless: (i) if the foreign entity is a "foreign financial
institution" as defined under FATCA, the foreign entity undertakes certain due
diligence, reporting, withholding, and certification obligations, (ii) if the
foreign entity is not a "foreign financial institution," it identifies certain
of its U.S. investors or (iii) the foreign entity is otherwise excepted under
FATCA. Pursuant to the rules above and the applicability of any
intergovernmental agreements between the United States and the relevant foreign
country, withholding under FATCA is required: (i) with respect to distributions
from your Trust and (ii) with respect to certain capital gains distributions and
gross proceeds from a sale or disposition of Units that occur on or after
January 1, 2017. If withholding is required under FATCA on a payment related to
your Units, investors that otherwise would not be subject to withholding (or
that otherwise would be entitled to a reduced rate of withholding) on such
payment generally will be required to seek a refund or credit from the IRS to
obtain the benefit of such exemption or reduction. Your Trust will not pay any
additional amounts in respect of amounts withheld under FATCA. You should
consult your tax advisor regarding the effect of FATCA based on your individual
circumstances.


New York Tax Status. Under the existing income tax laws of the State and
City of New York, your Trust will not be taxed as a corporation, subject to the
New York State franchise tax and the New York City general corporation tax, and
the income of your Trust will pass through to the Unitholders in the same
manner as for federal income tax purposes. You should consult your tax advisor
regarding potential federal, foreign, state or local taxation with respect to
your Units based on your individual circumstances.


Investors in the Trust may be subject to federal, state, local, or foreign
taxes in connection with their investment in the Trust. Investors are
encouraged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the specific federal,
state, local, and foreign tax consequences that may affect them as a result of
an investment in the Trust.



Regulated Investment Companies



This section summarizes some of the principal U.S. federal income tax
consequences of owning Units of a Trust that has elected to be taxed as a
regulated investment company for federal tax purposes. Please see "Notes to
Financial Statements" in Prospectus Part I. This section is current as of the
date of this prospectus. Tax laws and interpretations change frequently, and
these summaries do not describe all of the tax consequences to all taxpayers.
For example, these summaries generally do not describe your situation if you
are a corporation, a non-U.S. person, a broker/dealer, a tax-exempt entity, or
other investor with special circumstances. In addition, this section does not
describe your state, local or foreign tax consequences.


This federal income tax summary is based in part on the advice of counsel to
the Sponsor. The Internal Revenue Service could disagree with any conclusions
set forth in this section. In addition, our counsel was not asked to review the
federal income tax treatment of the assets to be deposited in the Trust. The
Trust may be subject to penalties under federal tax law with respect to its
compliance and reporting obligations.


As with any investment, you should seek advice based on your individual
circumstances from your own tax advisor.


Trust Status. Certain Trusts intend to elect and to qualify annually as
"regulated investment companies" under the federal tax laws. If a Trust
qualifies as a regulated investment company and distributes its income as
provided in the tax law, the Trust generally will not pay federal income taxes.


Distributions. After the end of each year, you will receive a tax statement
that specifies your amount of exempt-interest dividends, ordinary income
distributions and capital gains dividends. Exempt-interest dividends generally
are excluded from your gross income for federal income tax purposes. Some or all
of the exempt-interest dividends, however, may be taken into account in
determining your alternative minimum tax and may have other tax consequences
(e.g., they may affect the amount of your social security benefits that are
taxed). Ordinary income distributions are generally taxed at your tax rate for
ordinary income. Generally, you will treat all capital gains dividends as
long-term capital gains regardless of how long you have owned your shares. In
addition, the Trust may make distributions that represent a return of capital
for tax purposes and thus will generally not be taxable to you. The tax status
of your distributions from your Trust is not affected by whether you reinvest
your distributions in additional shares or receive them in cash. The income from
your Trust that you must take into account for federal income tax purposes is
not reduced by amounts used to pay a deferred sales charge, if any. The tax laws
may require you to treat distributions made to you in January as if you had
received them on December 31 of the previous year.


A distribution paid by your Trust reduces the Trust's net asset value per
Unit on the date paid by the amount of the distribution. Accordingly, a
distribution paid shortly after a purchase of Units by a Unitholder would be
subject to income tax even though it may be viewed, in substance, as a partial
return on capital.


Dividends Received Deduction and Qualified Dividend Income. A corporation
that owns Units generally will not be entitled to the dividends received
deduction with respect to dividends received from the Trust because the
dividends received deduction is generally not available for distributions from
regulated investment companies that do not invest in stock. An individual who
owns Units generally will not be entitled to treat Trust distributions as
qualified dividend income currently taxed at long-term capital gains rates as it
is not expected that Trust distributions will be attributable to qualified
dividend income received by the Trust.


Sale or Redemption of Units. If you sell or redeem your Units, you will
generally recognize a taxable gain or loss. To determine the amount of this
gain or loss, you must subtract your adjusted tax basis in your Units from the
amount you receive in the transaction. Your initial tax basis in your Units is
generally equal to the cost of your Units, generally including sales charges.
In some cases, however, you may have to adjust your tax basis after you
purchase your Units. Further, if you hold your Units for six months or less,
any loss incurred by you related to the disposition of such a Unit will be
disallowed to the extent of the exempt-interest dividends you received, if
any.


Capital Gains and Losses. If you are an individual, the maximum marginal
federal tax rate for net capital gain under current law is generally 20%. State
and local taxes may also apply.


Net capital gain equals net long-term capital gain minus net short-term
capital loss for the taxable year. Capital gain or loss is long-term if the
holding period for the asset is more than one year and is short-term if the
holding period for the asset is one year or less. You must exclude the date you
purchase your Units to determine your holding period. However, if you receive a
capital gain dividend from your Trust and sell your Unit at a loss after
holding it for six months or less, the loss will be disallowed to the extent of
the exempt-interest dividends you received. To the extent, if any, it is not
disallowed, it will be recharacterized as long-term capital loss to the extent
of the capital gain dividend received. The tax rates for capital gains realized
from assets held for one year or less are generally the same as for ordinary
income.


There is no requirement that tax consequences be taken into account in
administering your Trust.


Exchanges. If you elect to have your proceeds from your Trust rolled over
into a future invesco-sponsored unit investment trust, the exchange would
generally be considered a sale and a taxable transaction for federal income tax
purposes. In general, any gain on the sale will be treated as capital gain and
any loss will be treated as capital loss. However, any loss realized on a sale
or exchange will be disallowed to the extent that Units disposed of are replaced
(including through reinvestment of dividends) within a period of 61 days
beginning 30 days before and ending 30 days after the disposition of Units or to
the extent that the Unitholder, during such period, acquires or enters into an
option or contract to acquire substantially identical stock or securities. In
such a case, the basis of the Units acquired will be adjusted to reflect the
disallowed loss.


In Kind Distributions. Under certain circumstances, as described in this
prospectus, you may receive an in kind distribution of Trust Assets when you
redeem your Units. This distribution will be treated as a sale for federal
income tax purposes and you will generally recognize gain or loss, generally
based on the value at that time of the securities and the amount of cash
received, and subject to certain limitations on the deductibility of losses
under the tax rules.


Foreign Tax Credit. If your Trust invests in any foreign securities, the tax
statement that you receive may include an item showing foreign taxes your Trust
paid to other countries. In this case, dividends taxed to you will include your
share of the taxes your Trust paid to other countries. However, it is not
expected that any such Trust investing in foreign securities will be eligible
to pass through to investors any credits or deductions against U.S. federal
income tax with respect to such foreign taxes paid.


Foreign Investors. If you are a foreign investor (i.e., an investor other
than a U.S. citizen or resident or a U.S. corporation, partnership, estate or
trust), you should be aware that, generally, subject to applicable tax treaties,
distributions from the Trust will be characterized as dividends for federal
income tax purposes (other than dividends which the Trust reports as capital
gain dividends) and will generally be subject to U.S. income taxes, including
withholding taxes, subject to certain exceptions. However distributions received
by a foreign investor from the Trust that are properly reported by the Trust as
capital gain dividends may not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes,
including withholding taxes, provided that the Trust makes certain elections and
certain other conditions are met. The amount of distributions that may be
reported as interest-related dividends will be limited to the amount of
qualified net interest income, which is generally the Trust's U.S.-source
interest income less allocable expenses.


Backup Withholding. By law, your Trust must withhold as backup withholding a
percentage of your taxable distributions and redemption proceeds if you do not
provide your correct social security or taxpayer identification number and
certify that you are not subject to backup withholding, or if the IRS instructs
your Trust to do so.


Deductibility of Trust Expenses. Generally, expenses incurred by your Trust
will be deducted from the gross income received by your Trust and only your
share of the Trust's net taxable income, if any, will be paid to you and
reported as taxable income to you. However, if the Units of your Trust are held
by fewer than 500 Unitholders at any time during a taxable year, your Trust will
generally not be able to deduct certain expenses from income, thus resulting in
your reported share of your Trust's taxable income being increased by your share
of those expenses, even though you do not receive a corresponding cash
distribution. In this case you may be able to take a deduction for these
expenses; however, certain miscellaneous itemized deductions, such as investment
expenses, may be deducted by individuals only to the extent that all of these
deductions exceed 2% of the individual's adjusted gross income. Such deductions
may be subject to limitation for taxpayers whose income exceeds certain levels.


Investors in the Trust may be subject to federal, state, local, or foreign
taxes in connection with their investment in the Trust. Investors are
encouraged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the specific federal,
state, local, and foreign tax consequences that may affect them as a result of
an investment in the Trust.


The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act ("FATCA"). A 30% withholding tax on
your Trust's distributions, including capital gains distributions, and on gross
proceeds from the sale or other disposition of Units generally applies if paid
to a foreign entity unless: (i) if the foreign entity is a "foreign financial
institution" as defined under FATCA, the foreign entity undertakes certain due
diligence, reporting, withholding, and certification obligations, (ii) if the
foreign entity is not a "foreign financial institution," it identifies certain
of its U.S. investors or (iii) the foreign entity is otherwise excepted under
FATCA. Withholding under FATCA is required: (i) with respect to certain
distributions from your Trust beginning on July 1, 2014; and (ii) with respect
to certain capital gains distributions and gross proceeds from a sale or
disposition of Units that occur on or after January 1, 2017. If withholding is
required under FATCA on a payment related to your Units, investors that
otherwise would not be subject to withholding (or that otherwise would be
entitled to a reduced rate of withholding) on such payment generally will be
required to seek a refund or credit from the IRS to obtain the benefit of such
exemption or reduction. Your Trust will not pay any additional amounts in
respect of amounts withheld under FATCA. You should consult your tax advisor
regarding the effect of FATCA based on your individual circumstances.





EXPENSES





General. The Trustee will periodically deduct from the Interest Account and,
to the extent funds are not sufficient therein, from the Principal Account,
amounts necessary to pay the expenses of the Trusts. The Trustee also may
withdraw from these Accounts such amounts, if any, as it deems necessary to
establish a reserve for any governmental charges payable out of the Trusts.
Amounts so withdrawn shall not be considered a part of a Trust's assets until
such time as the Trustee shall return all or any part of such amounts to the
appropriate Accounts. All costs and expenses incurred in creating and
establishing the Trusts, including the cost of the initial preparation,
printing and execution of the Trust Agreement, legal and accounting expenses,
advertising and selling expenses, expenses of the Trustee, initial evaluation
fees and other out-of-pocket expenses have been borne by the Sponsor at no cost
to the Trusts.


Sponsor, Supervisor, Evaluator and Trustee. The Sponsor and the Supervisor,
which is an affiliate of the Sponsor, will receive the annual fee indicated
under "Summary of Essential Financial Information" in Prospectus Part I for
providing bookkeeping and administrative services and for providing portfolio
supervisory services for the Trusts. These fees may exceed the actual costs of
providing these services for a Trust but the total amount received for providing
these services to all Invesco unit investment trusts will not exceed the total
cost of providing the services in any calendar year. The Evaluator will receive
the annual evaluation fee indicated under "Summary of Essential Financial
Information" in Prospectus Part I for evaluating each Trust's portfolio. For its
services the Trustee will receive the fee indicated under "Summary of Essential
Financial Information" in Prospectus Part I (which may be reduced as described
therein). Part of the Trustee's compensation for its services is expected to
result from the use of the funds being held in the Principal and Interest
Accounts for future distributions, payment of expenses and redemptions since
these Accounts are non-interest bearing to Unitholders. These fees are based on
the outstanding principal amount of bonds and Units on the Date of Deposit for
the first year and as of the close of business on January 1 for each year
thereafter. The Sponsor's, Supervisor's, Evaluator's and Trustee's fees may be
increased without approval of the Unitholders by amounts not exceeding
proportionate increases under the category "Services Less Rent of Shelter" in
the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers or, if this category is not
published, in a comparable category.


Insurance. Premiums for any portfolio insurance are obligations of an
Insured Trust and are payable monthly by the Trustee on behalf of the Trust. As
bonds covered by a portfolio insurance policy in an Insured Trust are redeemed
by their respective issuers or are sold by the Trustee, the amount of the
premium will be reduced in respect of those bonds. If the Trustee exercises the
right to obtain permanent insurance, the premiums payable for such permanent
insurance will be paid solely from the proceeds of the sale of the related
bonds.


Miscellaneous Expenses. The following additional charges are or may be
incurred by the Trusts: (a) fees of the Trustee for extraordinary services, (b)
expenses of the Trustee (including legal and auditing expenses) and of counsel
designated by the Sponsor, (c) various governmental charges, (d) expenses and
costs of any action taken by the Trustee to protect the Trusts and the rights
and interests of Unitholders, (e) indemnification of the Trustee for any loss,
liability or expenses incurred by it in the administration of the Trusts
without negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on its part, (f) any
special custodial fees payable in connection with the sale of any of the bonds
in a Trust, (g) expenditures incurred in contacting Unitholders upon
termination of the Trusts and (h) costs incurred to reimburse the Trustee for
advancing funds to the Trusts to meet scheduled distributions (which costs may
be adjusted periodically in response to fluctuations in short-term interest
rates). A BlackRock Trust will pay a license fee to BlackRock Financial
Management, Inc. for use of certain trademarks and other property. Each Trust
will pay the costs associated with updating its registration statement each
year. The fees and expenses set forth herein are payable out of the Trusts.
When such fees and expenses are paid by or owing to the Trustee, they are
secured by a lien on the portfolio of the applicable Trust. If the balances in
the Interest and Principal Accounts are insufficient to provide for amounts
payable by a Trust, the Trustee has the power to sell bonds to pay such
amounts.

Risk Factors



The Trusts include certain types of bonds described below. Accordingly, an
investment in a Trust should be made with an understanding of the
characteristics of and risks associated with such bonds. Neither the Sponsor
nor the Trustee shall be liable in any way for any default, failure or defect
in any of the bonds.


Consumer Discretionary and Consumer Staples Issuers. Certain Trusts may
invest significantly in bonds issued by companies that manufacture or sell
consumer products. The profitability of these companies will be affected by
various factors including the general state of the economy and consumer
spending trends. In the past, there have been major changes in the retail
environment due to the declaration of bankruptcy by some of the major
corporations involved in the retail industry, particularly the department store
segment. The continued viability of the retail industry will depend on the
industry's ability to adapt and to compete in changing economic and social
conditions, to attract and retain capable management, and to finance expansion.
Weakness in the banking or real estate industry, a recessionary economic
climate with the consequent slowdown in employment growth, less favorable
trends in unemployment or a marked deceleration in real disposable personal
income growth could result in significant pressure on both consumer wealth and
consumer confidence, adversely affecting consumer spending habits. In addition,
competitiveness of the retail industry will require large capital outlays for
investment in the installation of automated checkout equipment to control
inventory, to track the sale of individual items and to gauge the success of
sales campaigns. Changes in demographics and consumer tastes can also affect
the demand for, and the success of, consumer products and services in the
marketplace. Increasing employee and retiree benefit costs may also have an
adverse effect on the industry. In many sectors of the retail industry,
competition may be fierce due to market saturation, converging consumer tastes
and other factors. Because of these factors and the recent increase in trade
opportunities with other countries, American retailers are now entering global
markets which entail added risks such as sudden weakening of foreign economies,
difficulty in adapting to local conditions and constraints and added research
costs.


Financial Services Issuers. The Trust may invest significantly in bonds
issued by companies within the bank and financial services sector.


The effects of the sub-prime mortgage crisis that began to unfold in 2007
continue to manifest in nearly all the sub-divisions of the financial services
industry. Sub-prime mortgage related losses and write downs among investment
banks and similar institutions reached significant levels in 2008. The impact
of these losses among traditional banks, investment banks, broker/dealers and
insurers has forced a number of large such institutions into either liquidation
or combination, while drastically increasing the credit risk, and possibility
of default, of bonds issued by such institutions faced with these troubles.
Many of the institutions are having difficulty in accessing credit markets to
finance their operations and in maintaining appropriate levels of equity
capital. In some cases, the U.S. government has acted to bail out or provide
support to select institutions, however the risk of default by such issuers has
nonetheless increased substantially.


While the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Federal Reserve Board and
Congress have taken steps to address problems in the financial markets and with
financial institutions, there can be no assurance that the risks associated
with investment in financial services company issuers will decrease as a result
of these steps.


Banks and their holding companies are especially subject to the adverse
effects of economic recession, volatile interest rates, portfolio concentrations
in geographic markets and in commercial and residential real estate loans, and
competition from new entrants in their fields of business. Banks are highly
dependent on net interest margin. Bank profitability is largely dependent on the
availability and cost of capital funds, and can fluctuate significantly when
interest rates change or due to increased competition. As initial home
purchasing and refinancing activity subsided as a result of increasing interest
rates and other factors, this income diminished. Economic conditions in the real
estate markets have deteriorated and have had a substantial negative effect upon
banks because they generally have a portion of their assets invested in loans
secured by real estate. Banks and their holding companies are subject to
extensive federal regulation and, when such institutions are state-chartered, to
state regulation as well. Such regulations impose strict capital requirements
and limitations on the nature and extent of business activities that banks may
pursue. Furthermore, bank regulators have a wide range of discretion in
connection with their supervisory and enforcement authority and may
substantially restrict the permissible activities of a particular institution if
deemed to pose significant risks to the soundness of such institution or the
safety of the federal deposit insurance fund. Regulatory actions, such as
increases in the minimum capital requirements applicable to banks and increases
in deposit insurance premiums required to be paid by banks and thrifts to the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC"), can negatively impact earnings
and the ability of a company to pay dividends. Neither federal insurance of
deposits nor governmental regulations, however, insures the solvency or
profitability of banks or their holding companies, or insures against any risk
of investment in the securities issued by such institutions.


The statutory requirements applicable to and regulatory supervision of banks
and their holding companies have increased significantly and have undergone
substantial change in recent years. To a great extent, these changes are
embodied in the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act;
enacted in August 1989, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement
Act of 1991, and the regulations promulgated under these laws. Many of the
regulations promulgated pursuant to these laws have only recently been
finalized and their impact on the business, financial condition and prospects
of the securities in the Trust's portfolio cannot be predicted with certainty.
The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act financial-services overhaul legislation allows
banks, securities firms and insurance companies to form one-stop financial
conglomerates marketing a wide range of financial service products to
investors. This legislation has resulted in increased merger activity and
heightened competition among existing and new participants in the field.
Legislation to liberalize interstate banking has been signed into law in recent
years, allowing banks to be able to purchase or establish subsidiary banks in
any state. Since mid-1997, banks have been allowed to turn existing banks into
branches. Consolidation is likely to continue. The Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "SEC") and the Financial Accounting Standards Board require the
expanded use of market value accounting by banks and have imposed rules
requiring market accounting for investment securities held in trading accounts
or available for sale. Adoption of additional such rules may result in
increased volatility in the reported health of the industry, and mandated
regulatory intervention to correct such problems. Additional legislative and
regulatory changes may be forthcoming. For example, the bank regulatory
authorities have proposed substantial changes to the Community Reinvestment Act
and fair lending laws, rules and regulations, and there can be no certainty as
to the effect, if any, that such changes would have on the bonds in the Trust's
portfolio. In addition, from time to time the deposit insurance system is
reviewed by Congress and federal regulators, and proposed reforms of that
system could, among other things, further restrict the ways in which deposited
moneys can be used by banks or reduce the dollar amount or number of deposits
insured for any depositor. Such reforms could reduce profitability, as
investment opportunities available to bank institutions become more limited and
as consumers look for savings vehicles other than bank deposits. Banks face
significant competition from other financial institutions such as mutual funds,
credit unions, mortgage banking companies and insurance companies, and
increased competition may result from legislative broadening of regional and
national interstate banking powers. Among other benefits, such legislation
allows banks and bank holding companies to acquire across previously prohibited
state lines and to consolidate their various bank subsidiaries into one unit.
Neither the Sponsor nor any Underwriter makes any prediction as to what, if
any, manner of bank regulatory actions might ultimately be adopted or what
ultimate effect such actions might have on the Trust's portfolio.


The Federal Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 generally prohibits a bank
holding company from (1) acquiring, directly or indirectly, more than 5% of the
outstanding shares of any class of voting securities of a bank or bank holding
company, (2) acquiring control of a bank or another bank holding company, (3)
acquiring all or substantially all the assets of a bank, or (4) merging or
consolidating with another bank holding company, without first obtaining Federal
Reserve Board ("FRB") approval. In considering an application with respect to
any such transaction, the FRB is required to consider a variety of factors,
including the potential anti-competitive effects of the transaction, the
financial condition and future prospects of the combining and resulting
institutions, the managerial resources of the resulting institution, the
convenience and needs of the communities the combined organization would serve,
the record of performance of each combining organization under the Community
Reinvestment Act and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, and the prospective
availability to the FRB of information appropriate to determine ongoing
regulatory compliance with applicable banking laws. In addition, the federal
Change In Bank Control Act and various state laws impose limitations on the
ability of one or more individuals or other entities to acquire control of banks
or bank holding companies.


The FRB has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by
bank holding companies. In the policy statement, the FRB expressed its view
that a bank holding company experiencing earnings weaknesses should not pay
cash dividends which exceed its net income or which could only be funded in
ways that would weaken its financial health, such as by borrowing. The FRB also
may impose limitations on the payment of dividends as a condition to its
approval of certain applications, including applications for approval of
mergers and acquisitions. Neither the Sponsor nor any Underwriter makes any
prediction as to the effect, if any, such laws will have on the bonds or
whether such approvals, if necessary, will be obtained.


Companies engaged in the investment management industry are subject to the
adverse effects of economic recession, volatile interest rates, and competition
from new entrants in their fields of business. Adverse changes in the direction
of the stock market, investor confidence, equity transaction volume, the level
and direction of interest rates and the outlook of emerging markets could
adversely affect the financial stability, as well as the prices of the
securities, of these companies. Additionally, competitive pressures, including
increased competition with new and existing competitors, the ongoing
commoditization of traditional businesses and the need for increased capital
expenditures on new technology could adversely impact the profit margins of
companies in the investment management and brokerage industries. Companies
involved in the investment management industry are also subject to extensive
regulation by government agencies and self-regulatory organizations, and
changes in laws, regulations or rules, or in the interpretation of such laws,
regulations and rules could adversely affect such companies.


Companies involved in the insurance, reinsurance and risk management
industry underwrite, sell or distribute property, casualty and business
insurance. Many factors affect insurance, reinsurance and risk management
company profits, including but not limited to interest rate movements, the
imposition of premium rate caps, a misapprehension of the risks involved in
given underwritings, competition and pressure to compete globally, weather
catastrophes or other disasters and the effects of client mergers. Individual
companies may be exposed to material risks including reserve inadequacy and the
inability to collect from reinsurance carriers. Insurance companies are subject
to extensive governmental regulation, including the imposition of maximum rate
levels, which may not be adequate for some lines of business. Proposed or
potential tax law changes may also adversely affect insurance companies' policy
sales, tax obligations and profitability. In addition to the foregoing, profit
margins of these companies continue to shrink due to the commoditization of
traditional businesses, new competitors, capital expenditures on new technology
and the pressure to compete globally.


In addition to the normal risks of business, companies involved in the
insurance and risk management industry are subject to significant risk factors,
including those applicable to regulated insurance companies, such as:


o    the inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing
property-liability loss reserves, and the fact that ultimate losses
could materially exceed established loss reserves, which could have a
material adverse effect on results of operations and financial
condition;


o    the fact that insurance companies have experienced, and can be
expected in the future to experience, catastrophic losses, which could
have a material adverse impact on their financial conditions, results
of operations and cash flow;


o    the inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing
property-liability loss reserves due to changes in loss payment
patterns caused by new claim settlement practices;


o    the need for insurance companies and their subsidiaries to maintain
appropriate levels of statutory capital and surplus, particularly in
light of continuing scrutiny by rating organizations and state
insurance regulatory authorities, and in order to maintain acceptable
financial strength or claims-paying ability ratings;


o    the extensive regulation and supervision to which insurance companies
are subject, and various regulatory and other legal actions;


o    the adverse impact that increases in interest rates could have on the
value of an insurance company's investment portfolio and on the
attractiveness of certain of its products; and


o    the uncertainty involved in estimating the availability of reinsurance
and the collectability of reinsurance recoverables.


The state insurance regulatory framework has, during recent years, come
under increased federal scrutiny, and certain state legislatures have
considered or enacted laws that alter and, in many cases, increase state
authority to regulate insurance companies and insurance holding company
systems. Further, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC")
and state insurance regulators are re-examining existing laws and regulations,
specifically focusing on insurance companies, interpretations of existing laws
and the development of new laws. In addition, Congress and certain federal
agencies have investigated the condition of the insurance industry in the
United States to determine whether to promulgate additional federal regulation.
The Sponsor is unable to predict whether any state or federal legislation will
be enacted to change the nature or scope of regulation of the insurance
industry, or what effect, if any, such legislation would have on the industry.


All insurance companies are subject to state laws and regulations that
require diversification of their investment portfolios and limit the amount of
investments in certain investment categories. Failure to comply with these laws
and regulations would cause non-conforming investments to be treated as
non-admitted assets for purposes of measuring statutory surplus and, in some
instances, would require divestiture.


Health Care Issuers. The Trust may invest significantly in bonds issued by
companies within the health care sector. Health care companies involved in
advanced medical devices and instruments, drugs and biotech, managed care,
hospital management/health services and medical supplies have potential risks
unique to their sector of the health care field. These companies are subject to
governmental regulation of their products and services, a factor which could
have a significant and possibly unfavorable effect on the price and
availability of such products or services. Furthermore, such companies face the
risk of increasing competition from new products or services, generic drug
sales, termination of patent protection for drug or medical supply products and
the risk that technological advances will render their products obsolete. The
research and development costs of bringing a drug to market are substantial,
and include lengthy governmental review processes with no guarantee that the
product will ever come to market. Many of these companies may have losses and
not offer certain products for several years. Such companies may also have
persistent losses during a new product's transition from development to
production, and revenue patterns may be erratic. The goods and services of
health care issuers are also subject to risks of product liability litigation.


Health care facility operators may be affected by events and conditions
including, among other things, demand for services, the ability of the facility
to provide the services required, physicians' confidence in the facility,
management capabilities, competition with other hospitals, efforts by insurers
and governmental agencies to limit rates, legislation establishing state
rate-setting agencies, expenses, government regulation, the cost and possible
unavailability of malpractice insurance and the termination or restriction of
governmental financial assistance, including that associated with Medicare,
Medicaid and other similar third-party payor programs.


Legislative proposals concerning health care are proposed in Congress from
time to time. These proposals span a wide range of topics, including cost and
price controls (which might include a freeze on the prices of prescription
drugs), national health insurance, incentives for competition in the provision
of health care services, tax incentives and penalties related to health care
insurance premiums and promotion of pre-paid health care plans. The government
could also reduce funding for health care related research. The Sponsor is
unable to predict the effect of any of these proposals, if enacted, on the
issuers of Securities in your Trust.


Industrials Issuers. The Trust may invest significantly in bonds issued by
industrials companies. General risks of industrials companies include the
general state of the economy, intense competition, consolidation, domestic and
international politics, excess capacity and consumer spending trends. In
addition, capital goods companies may also be significantly affected by overall
capital spending levels, economic cycles, technical obsolescence, delays in
modernization, limitations on supply of key materials, labor relations,
government regulations, government contracts and ecommerce initiatives.
Industrials companies may also be affected by factors more specific to their
individual industries. Industrial machinery manufacturers may be subject to
declines in commercial and consumer demand and the need for modernization.
Aerospace and defense companies may be influenced by decreased demand for new
equipment, aircraft order cancellations, disputes over or ability to obtain or
retain government contracts, labor disputes or changes in government budget
priorities, changes in aircraft-leasing contracts and cutbacks in profitable
business travel. The number of housing starts, levels of public and
non-residential construction including weakening demand for new office and
retail space, and overall construction spending may adversely affect
construction equipment manufacturers.


Technology Issuers. The Trust may invest significantly in bonds issued by
issuers within the technology industry which includes information technology
companies. Your Trust, and therefore Unitholders, may be particularly
susceptible to a negative impact resulting from adverse market conditions or
other factors affecting technology issuers because any negative impact on the
technology industry will not be diversified among issuers within other unrelated
industries. Accordingly, an investment in Units should be made with an
understanding of the characteristics of the information technology industry and
the risks which such an investment may entail.


Technology companies generally include companies involved in the development,
design, manufacture and sale of computers, computer related equipment, computer
networks, communications systems, telecommunications products, electronic
products, and other related products, systems and services. The market for
technology products and services, especially those specifically related to the
Internet, is characterized by rapidly changing technology, rapid product
obsolescence, cyclical market patterns, evolving industry standards and frequent
new product introductions. The success of the issuers of the Securities depends
in substantial part on the timely and successful introduction of new products.
An unexpected change in one or more of the technologies affecting an issuer's
products or in the market for products based on a particular technology could
have a material adverse affect on an issuer's operating results. Furthermore,
there can be no assurance that the issuers of the Securities will be able to
respond timely to compete in the rapidly developing marketplace.


The market for certain technology products and services may have only
recently begun to develop, is rapidly evolving and is characterized by an
increasing number of market entrants. Additionally, certain technology companies
may have only recently commenced operations or offered securities to the public.
Such companies are in the early stage of development and have a limited
operating history on which to analyze future operating results. It is important
to note that following its initial public offering a security is likely to
experience substantial price volatility and speculative trading. Accordingly,
there can be no assurance that upon redemption of Units or termination of a
Trust a Unitholder will receive an amount greater than or equal to the
Unitholder's initial investment.


Based on trading history, factors such as announcements of new products or
development of new technologies and general conditions of the industry have
caused and are likely to cause the market price of technology common stocks to
fluctuate substantially. Market volatility may adversely affect the market price
of the Securities and therefore the ability of a Unitholder to redeem units, or
roll over Units into a new trust, at a price equal to or greater than the
original price paid for such Units.


Some key components of certain products of technology issuers are currently
available only from single sources. There can be no assurance that in the future
suppliers will be able to meet the demand for components in a timely and cost
effective manner. Accordingly, an issuer's operating results and customer
relationships could be adversely affected by either an increase in price for, or
and interruption or reduction in supply of, any key components. Additionally,
many technology issuers are characterized by a highly concentrated customer base
consisting of a limited number of large customers who may require product
vendors to comply with rigorous and constantly developing industry standards.
Any failure to comply with such standards may result in a significant loss or
reduction of sales. Because many products and technologies are incorporated into
other related products, certain companies are often highly dependent on the
performance of other computer, electronics and communications companies. There
can be no assurance that these customers will place additional orders, or that
an issuer of Securities will obtain orders of similar magnitude as past orders
form other customers. Similarly, the success of certain companies is tied to a
relatively small concentration of products or technologies with intense
competition between companies. Accordingly, a decline in demand of such
products, technologies or from such customers could have a material adverse
impact on issuers of the Securities.


Telecommunications Issuers. The Trust may invest significantly in bonds
issued by telecommunications companies. The telecommunications industry is
subject to governmental regulation, and the products and services of
telecommunications companies may be subject to rapid obsolescence. These
factors could affect the value of Units. Telephone companies in the United
States, for example, are subject to both state and federal regulations
affecting permitted rates of returns and the kinds of services that may be
offered. Certain types of companies represented in a portfolio are engaged in
fierce competition for a share of the market of their products. As a result,
competitive pressures are intense and the values of telecommunications company
securities are subject to rapid price volatility.


Several high-profile bankruptcies of large telecommunications companies have
illustrated the potentially unstable condition of telecommunications companies.
High debt loads that were accumulated during the industry growth spurt of the
1990s are catching up to the industry, causing debt and stock prices to trade
at distressed levels for many telecommunications companies and increasing the
cost of capital for needed additional investment. At the same time, demand for
some telecommunications services has fallen sharply, as several key markets
have become oversaturated, some local customers have switched to substitute
providers and technologies, and corporate profits and the economy generally
remain weak. To meet increasing competition, companies may have to commit
substantial capital, particularly in the formulation of new products and
services using new technologies. As a result, many companies have been
compelled to cut costs by reducing their workforce, outsourcing, consolidating
and/or closing existing facilities and divesting low selling product lines.
Furthermore, certain companies involved in the industry have also faced
scrutiny for alleged accounting irregularities that may have led to the
overstatement of their financial results, and other companies in the industry
may face similar scrutiny. Due to these and other factors, the risk level of
owning the securities of telecommunications companies has increased
substantially and may continue to rise.


While a portfolio may concentrate on the securities of established suppliers
of traditional telecommunication products and services, a Trust may also invest
in bonds of smaller telecommunications companies which may benefit from the
development of new products and services. These smaller companies may present
greater opportunities for capital appreciation, and may also involve greater
risk than large, established issuers. Such smaller companies may have limited
product lines, market or financial resources, and their securities may trade
less frequently and in limited volume than the securities of larger, more
established companies. As a result, the prices of the securities of such
smaller companies may fluctuate to a greater degree than the prices of
securities of other issuers.


In addition, recent federal legislation governing the United States
telecommunications industry remains subject to judicial review and additional
interpretation, which may adversely affect the companies whose securities are
held by a Trust.


Utility and Energy Issuers. Because certain Trusts may invest significantly
in bonds issued by public utility and energy companies, an investment in Units
of certain Trusts should be made with an understanding of the characteristics
of the public utility and energy industries and the risks which such an
investment may entail. General problems of the public utility and energy
industries include the difficulty in obtaining an adequate return on invested
capital despite frequent increases in rates which have been granted by the
public service commissions having jurisdiction, the difficulty in financing
large construction programs during an inflationary period, the restrictions on
operations and increased cost and delays attributable to environmental, nuclear
safety and other regulatory considerations, the difficulty of the capital
markets absorbing utility debt and equity securities, the difficulty in
obtaining fuel for electric generation at reasonable prices, regulatory
restrictions on the ability to pass increasing wholesale costs along to the
retail and business customer, and the effects of energy conservation. There is
no assurance that public service commissions will grant rate increases in the
future or that any such increases will be timely or adequate to cover operating
and other expenses and debt service requirements. All of the public utilities
which are issuers of securities in certain Trusts have been experiencing many
of these problems in varying degrees. Furthermore, utility and energy stocks
are particularly susceptible to interest rate risk, generally exhibiting an
inverse relationship to interest rates. As a result, electric utility stock
prices may be adversely affected as interest rates rise. Similarly, the success
of certain companies is tied to a relatively small concentration of products or
technologies with intense competition between companies. There can be no
assurance that these customers will place additional orders, or that an issuer
of Securities will obtain orders of similar magnitude as past orders from other
customers. Accordingly, a decline in demand of such products, technologies or
from such customers could have a material adverse impact on issuers of
securities in certain Trusts.


Utilities are generally subject to extensive regulation by state utility
commissions which, for example, establish the rates which may be charged and
the appropriate rate of return on an approved asset base, which must be
approved by the state commissions. Certain utilities have had difficulty from
time to time in persuading regulators, who are subject to political pressures,
to grant rate increases necessary to maintain an adequate return on investment.
Any unexpected limitations could negatively affect the profitability of
utilities whose budgets are planned far in advance. In addition, gas pipeline
and distribution companies have had difficulties in adjusting to short and
surplus energy supplies, enforcing or being required to comply with long-term
contracts and avoiding litigation with their customers, on the one hand, or
suppliers, on the other.


Certain utility companies have experienced full or partial deregulation in
recent years. These utility companies are frequently more similar to industrial
companies in that they are subject to greater competition and have been
permitted by regulators to diversify outside of their original geographic
regions and their traditional lines of business. These opportunities may permit
certain utility companies to earn more than their traditional regulated rates
of return. Some companies, however, may be forced to defend their core business
and may be less profitable.


Certain of the issuers of securities in certain Trusts may own or operate
nuclear generating facilities. Governmental authorities may from time to time
review existing, and impose additional, requirements governing the licensing,
construction and operation of nuclear power plants. Nuclear generating projects
in the electric utility industry have experienced substantial cost increases,
construction delays and licensing difficulties. These have been caused by
various factors, including inflation, high financing costs, required design
changes and rework, allegedly faulty construction, objections by groups and
governmental officials, limits on the ability to finance, reduced forecasts of
energy requirements and economic conditions. This experience indicates that the
risk of significant cost increases, delays and licensing difficulties remain
present until completion and achievement of commercial operation of any nuclear
project. Also, nuclear generating units in service have experienced unplanned
outages or extensions of scheduled outages due to equipment problems or new
regulatory requirements sometimes followed by a significant delay in obtaining
regulatory approval to return to service. A major accident at a nuclear plant
anywhere could cause the imposition of limits or prohibitions on the operation,
construction or licensing of nuclear units.


In view of the uncertainties discussed above, there can be no assurance that
any utility company's share of the full cost of nuclear units under
construction ultimately will be recovered in rates or the extent to which a
company could earn an adequate return on its investment in such units. The
likelihood of a significantly adverse event occurring in any of the areas of
concern described above varies, as does the potential severity of any adverse
impact. It should be recognized, however, that one or more of such adverse
events could occur and individually or collectively could have a material
adverse impact on a company's financial condition, the results of its
operations, its ability to make interest and principal payments on its
outstanding debt or to pay dividends.


Other general problems of the electric, gas and water utility industries
(including state and local joint action power agencies) include rising costs of
rail transportation to transport fossil fuels, the uncertainty of transmission
service costs for both interstate and intrastate transactions, changes in tax
laws which adversely affect a utility's ability to operate profitably,
increased competition in service costs, recent reductions in estimates of
future demand for electricity and gas in certain areas of the country,
restrictions on operations and increased cost and delays attributable to
environmental considerations, uncertain availability and increased cost of
capital, unavailability of fuel for electric generation at reasonable prices,
including the steady rise in fuel costs and the costs associated with
conversion to alternate fuel sources such as coal, availability and cost of
natural gas for resale, technical and cost factors and other problems
associated with construction, licensing, regulation and operation of nuclear
facilities for electric generation, including, among other considerations, the
problems associated with the use of radioactive materials and the disposal of
radioactive wastes, and the effects of energy and environmental conservation
efforts. Each of the problems referred to could adversely affect the ability of
the issuers of any utility and energy bonds to make dividend payments and the
value of such issues on redemption of your Units.


Taxable Municipal Issues. Certain bonds in a Trust may consist of taxable
obligations of municipal issuers. Obligations of municipal issuers can be
either general obligations of a government entity that are backed by the taxing
power of such entity or revenue bonds payable from the income of a specific
project or authority and are not supported by the issuer's power to levy
taxes.


General obligation bonds are backed by the general taxing power of the
issuer. The issuer secures these bonds by pledging its faith, credit and
unlimited taxing power for the payment of principal and interest.


Revenue bonds are payable only from the revenue of a specific project or
authority. They are not supported by the issuer's general power to levy taxes.
The risk of default in payment of interest or principal increases if the income
of the related project falters because that income is the only source of
payment. All of the following bonds are revenue bonds.


Airport bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate airports. The
ability of the issuer to make payments on these bonds primarily depends on the
ability of airlines to meet their obligations under use agreements. Due to
increased competition, deregulation, increased fuel costs and other factors,
some airlines may have difficulty meeting these obligations.


Bond banks are vehicles that pool various municipal obligations into larger
offerings. This reduces the cost of borrowing for the municipalities. The types
of financing projects that these obligations support vary.


Build America Bonds were issued pursuant to The American Recovery and
Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the "Recovery Act"), authorizing states and local
governments to issue taxable bonds and to elect to receive a federal subsidy for
a portion of their borrowing costs through a refundable tax credit paid by the
Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") in an amount equal
to 35 percent of the total coupon interest payable to investors (45 percent for
those Build America Bonds that qualify and are designated as Recovery Zone
Economic Development Bonds).


The Recovery Act adds a new section to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended, (the "Code") which authorizes Build America Bonds that meet the
definition of "qualified bonds", as described below, to receive the refundable
credit. The Code section defines the term "qualified bond" to mean a Build
America Bond (a) issued before January 1, 2011, (b) with 100 percent of the
excess of (i) the available project proceeds (as defined to mean sale proceeds
of such issue less not more than two percent of such proceeds used to pay
issuance costs plus investment proceeds thereon), over (ii) the amounts in a
reasonably required reserve fund with respect to such issue, are to be used for
capital expenditures, and (c) where the issuer makes an irrevocable election to
have this subsection of the Code apply.


Should a Build America Bond issuer fail to continue to meet the applicable
requirements as imposed by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, it is
possible that such issuer may not receive federal cash subsidy payments,
impairing the issuer's ability to make scheduled interest payments. In addition,
Build America Bonds are often subject to extraordinary redemption in the event
that changes to Sections 54AA or 6431 of the Code (as added by the Recovery Act)
or other federal legislation causes to reduce or eliminate the federal cash
subsidy payment for a portion of a Build America Bond issuer's borrowing costs.


Qualified School Construction Bonds, Qualified Energy Conservation Bonds and
Clean Renewable Energy Bonds (collectively, "Qualified Bonds") are taxable bonds
that are similar to certain Build America Bonds, in that state and municipal
Qualified Bond issuers may elect to receive direct interest-subsidy payments
from the U.S. Treasury if certain conditions are met. The Hiring Incentives to
Restore Employment Act, enacted into federal law on March 18, 2010, permits
issuers of Qualified Bonds to seek applicable subsidies on bond interest
payments.


Qualified School Construction Bonds, issued pursuant to provisions in the
Recovery Act, are issued to finance the construction, rehabilitation, or repair
of a public school facility or for the acquisition of land on which such a
bond-financed facility will be constructed. Qualified Energy Conservation Bonds
and Clean Renewable Energy Bonds are both issued pursuant to the "Energy
Improvement and Extension Act of 2008", and like Qualified School Construction
Bonds, are governed by Section 54A of the Code. Qualified Energy Conservation
Bonds are issued for qualified energy conservation purposes, and Clean Renewable
Energy Bonds are issued to finance qualified renewable energy facilities that
produce electricity. Although the year of issuance is not restricted for
Qualified Bonds, federal law provides for limits on the dollar amounts that may
be issued for these bond types.


Federal legislation has amended the Code in recent years to provide for
certain qualifications and restrictions on the issuance of Qualified Bonds, and
to include such bonds under the definition of "qualified tax credit bond" as
found in Section 54A of the Code. Eligible issuers of Qualified School
Construction Bonds may receive subsidy payments equal to 100% of the lesser of
the actual interest rate of the bonds or the tax credit rate for municipal
tax-credit bonds, set daily by the U.S. Treasury. Eligible issuers of Qualified
Energy Conservation Bonds and Clean Renewable Energy Bonds may receive subsidy
payments equal to 70% of the lesser of the actual interest rate of the bonds or
the tax credit rate for municipal tax-credit bonds, set daily by the U.S.
Treasury.


Should the issuer of a Qualified Bond fail continue to meet the applicable
requirements as imposed on any such bond by the Code or other federal laws, it
is possible that such issuer may not receive federal cash subsidy payments,
impairing the issuer's ability to make scheduled interest payments or even
causing mandatory redemption of a portion of the bonds. As provided in Section
54A of the Code, Qualified Bonds are also subject to mandatory redemption of any
portion of available project proceeds that remain unexpended by the issuer after
three years from the date of issuance. This mandatory redemption must be
completed within 90 days after such three-year period, unless an extension is
granted by the Treasury. Additionally, Qualified Bonds may be subject to
extraordinary redemption in the event that changes to applicable sections of the
Code or other federal legislation causes to reduce or eliminate the federal cash
subsidy payment for any Qualified Bond issuer's borrowing costs.


Certificates of participation are generally a type of municipal lease
obligation. Lease payments of a governmental entity secure payments on these
bonds. These payments depend on the governmental entity budgeting appropriations
for the lease payments. A governmental body cannot obligate future governments
to appropriate for or make lease payments, but governments typically promise to
take action necessary to include lease payments in their budgets. If a
government fails to budget for or make lease payments, sufficient funds may not
exist to pay interest or principal on these bonds.


Health care bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenue from
hospitals and hospital systems. The ability of these issuers to make payments
on bonds depends on factors such as facility occupancy levels, demand for
services, competition resulting from hospital mergers and affiliations, the
need to reduce costs, government regulation, costs of malpractice insurance and
claims, and government financial assistance (such as Medicare and Medicaid).


Higher education bonds are obligations of issuers that operate universities
and colleges. These issuers derive revenues from tuition, dormitories, grants
and endowments. These issuers face problems related to declines in the number
of college-age individuals, possible inability to raise tuitions and fees,
uncertainty of continued federal grants, state funding or donations, and
government legislation or regulation.


Industrial revenue bonds finance the cost of acquiring, building or
improving industrial projects. Private corporations usually operate these
projects. The ability of the issuer to make payments on these bonds depends on
factors such as the creditworthiness of the corporation operating the project,
revenues generated by the project, expenses of the project and environmental or
other regulatory restrictions.


Multi-family housing bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues
from mortgage loans on multiple family residences, retirement housing or
housing projects for low to moderate-income families. These bonds are generally
pre-payable at any time. It is likely that their life will be less than their
stated maturity. The ability of these issuers to make payments on bonds depends
on such factors as rental income, occupancy levels, operating expenses,
mortgage default rates, taxes, government regulations and appropriation of
subsidies.


Other care bonds include obligations of issuers that derive revenue from
mental health facilities, nursing homes and intermediate care facilities. These
bonds are similar to health care bonds and the issuers face the same general
risks.


Public building bonds finance the cost of acquiring, leasing, building or
improving public buildings such as offices, recreation facilities, convention
centers, police stations, correctional institutions and parking garages. The
ability of the issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such
as the government budgeting sufficient funds to make lease or mortgage payments
on the facility, user fees or rents, costs of maintenance and decreases in use
of the facility.


Public education bonds are obligations of issuers that operate primary and
secondary schools. The ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds
depends primarily on ad valorem taxes. These issuers may also face problems
related to litigation contesting state constitutionality of public education
financing.


Retail electric/gas/telephone bonds are obligations of issuers that derive
revenues from the retail sale of utilities to customers. The ability of these
issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the rates
and demand for these utilities, competition, government regulation and rate
approvals, overhead expenses and the cost of fuels.


Single family housing bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues
from mortgage loans on single family residences. Single family residences
generally include one to four-family dwellings. These bonds are similar to
multi-family housing bonds and the issuers face the same general risks.


Tax district bonds are obligations secured by a pledge of taxing power by a
municipality, such as tax increment financing or tax allocation bonds. These
bonds are similar to general obligation bonds. Unlike general obligation bonds,
however, the municipality does not pledge its unlimited taxing power to pay
these bonds. Instead, the municipality pledges revenues from a specific tax to
pay these bonds. If the tax cannot support payment of interest and principal, a
municipality may need to raise the related tax to pay these bonds. An inability
to raise the tax could have an adverse affect on these bonds.


Transportation bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate public
transit systems, ports, highways, turnpikes, bridges and other transportation
systems. The ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds depends
on variations in use, the degree of government subsidization, competition from
other forms of transportation and increased costs. Port authorities derive
revenues primarily from fees imposed on ships using the port facilities. These
fees can fluctuate depending on the local economy and competition from air,
rail and truck transportation. Increased fuel costs, alternative transportation
modes and competition from toll-free bridges and roads will impact revenues of
issuers that operate bridges, roads or tunnels.


Waste disposal bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from
resource recovery facilities. These facilities process solid waste, generate
steam and convert steam to electricity. These issuers face problems such as
costs and delays due to environmental concerns, effects of conservation and
recycling, destruction or condemnation of a project, void or unenforceable
contracts, changes in the economic availability of raw materials, operating
supplies or facilities, and other unavoidable changes that adversely affect
operation of a project.


Water and sewer bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from
user fees from the sale of water and sewerage services. These issuers face
problems such as the ability to obtain rate increases, population declines,
difficulties in obtaining new fresh water supplies and "no-growth" zoning
ordinances. These issuers also face many of the same problems of waste disposal
issuers.


Wholesale electric bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues
from selling electricity to other utilities. The ability of these issuers to
make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the rates and demand
for electric utilities, competition, overhead expenses and government
regulation and rate approvals.


Zero Coupon Bonds. Certain of the bonds in a Trust may be "zero coupon"
bonds. Zero coupon bonds are purchased at a deep discount because the buyer
receives only the right to receive a final payment at the maturity of the bond
and does not receive any periodic interest payments. The effect of owning deep
discount bonds which do not make current interest payments (such as the zero
coupon bonds) is that a fixed yield is earned not only on the original
investment but also, in effect, on all discount earned during the life of such
income on the bond at a rate as high as the implicit yield on the discount
bond, but at the same time eliminates the holder's ability to reinvest at
higher rates in the future. For this reason, zero coupon bonds are subject to
substantially greater price fluctuations during periods of changing market
interest rates than are securities of comparable quality which pay interest.


Ginnie Mae Securities. The Ginnie Mae securities included in a GNMA Income
Portfolio are backed by the indebtedness secured by underlying mortgage pools
of up to 30 year mortgages on 1- to 4-family dwellings. The securities are
often referred to simply as "Ginnie Maes." The pool of mortgages which is to
underlie a particular new issue of Ginnie Mae securities is assembled by the
proposed issuer of such Ginnie Mae securities. The issuer is typically a
mortgage banking firm, and in every instance must be a mortgagee approved by
and in good standing with the Federal Housing Administration ("FHA"). In
addition, Ginnie Mae imposes its own criteria on the eligibility of issuers,
including a net worth requirement.


The mortgages which are to comprise a new Ginnie Mae pool may have been
originated by the issuer itself in its capacity as a mortgage lender or may be
acquired by the issuer from a third party, such as another mortgage banker, a
banking institution, the Veterans Administration ("VA") (which in certain
instances acts as a direct lender and thus originates its own mortgages) or one
of several other governmental agencies. All mortgages in any given pool will be
insured under the National Housing Act, as amended ("FHA-insured"), or Title V
of the Housing Act of 1949 ("FMHA Insured") or guaranteed under the Servicemen's
Readjustment Act of 1944, as amended, or Chapter 37 of Title 38, U.S.C.
("VA-guaranteed"). Such mortgages will have a date for the first scheduled
monthly payment of principal that is not more than one year prior to the date on
which Ginnie Mae issues its guaranty commitment as described below, will have
comparable interest rates and maturity dates, and will meet additional criteria
of Ginnie Mae. All mortgages in the pools backing the Ginnie Mae securities
contained in the Trust are mortgages on 1- to 4-family dwellings (having a
stated maturity of up to 30 years for securities in the Trust but an estimated
average life of considerably less. In general, the mortgages in these pools
provide for equal monthly payments over the life of the mortgage (aside from
prepayments) designed to repay the principal of the mortgage over such period,
together with interest at the fixed rate on the unpaid balance.


To obtain Ginnie Mae approval of a new pool of mortgages, the issuer will
file with Ginnie Mae an application containing information concerning itself,
describing generally the pooled mortgages, and requesting that Ginnie Mae
approve the issue and issue its commitment (subject to Ginnie Mae's
satisfaction with the mortgage documents and other relevant documentation) to
guarantee the timely payment of principal of and interest on the Ginnie Mae
securities to be issued by the issuer. If the application is in order, Ginnie
Mae will issue its commitment and will assign a Ginnie Mae pool number to the
pool. Upon completion of the required documentation (including detailed
information as to the underlying mortgages, a custodial agreement with a
Federal or state regulated financial institution satisfactory to Ginnie Mae
pursuant to which the underlying mortgages will be held in safekeeping, and a
detailed guaranty agreement between Ginnie Mae and the issuer), the issuance of
the Ginnie Mae securities is permitted. When the Ginnie Mae securities are
issued, Ginnie Mae will endorse its guarantee thereon. The aggregate principal
amount of Ginnie Mae securities issued will be equal to the then aggregate
unpaid principal balances of the pooled mortgages. The interest rate borne by
the Ginnie Mae securities is currently fixed at 1/2 of 1% below the interest
rate of the pooled 1- to 4-family mortgages, the differential being applied to
the payment of servicing and custodial charges as well as Ginnie Mae's guaranty
fee.


Ginnie Mae IIs consist of jumbo pools of mortgages from more than one
issuer. By allowing pools to consist of multiple issuers, it allows for larger
and more geographically diverse pools. Unlike Ginnie Mae Is, which have a
minimum pool size of $1 million, Ginnie Mae IIs have a minimum pool size of $7
million. In addition, the interest rates on the mortgages within the Ginnie Mae
II pools will vary unlike the mortgages within pools in Ginnie Mae Is which all
have the same rate. The rates on the mortgages will vary from 1/2 of 1% to
1.50% above the coupon rate on the Ginnie Mae security, which is allowed for
servicing and custodial fees as well as the Ginnie Mae's guaranty fee. The
major advantage of Ginnie Mae IIs lies in the fact that a central paying agent
sends one check to the holder on the required payment date. This greatly
simplifies the current procedure of collecting distributions from each issuer
of a Ginnie Mae, since such distributions are often received late.


All of the Ginnie Mae securities in the Trust, including the Ginnie Mae IIs,
are of the "fully modified pass-through" type, i.e., they provide for timely
monthly payments to the registered holders thereof (including the Trust) of
their pro rata share of the scheduled principal payments on the underlying
mortgages, whether or not collected by the issuers, including, on a pro rata
basis, any prepayments of principal of such mortgages received and interest
(net of the servicing and other charges described above) on the aggregate
unpaid principal balance of such Ginnie Mae securities, whether or not the
interest on the underlying mortgages has been collected by the issuers.


The Ginnie Mae securities in the Trust are guaranteed as to timely payment of
principal and interest by Ginnie Mae. Funds received by the issuers on account
of the mortgages backing the Ginnie Mae securities in the Trust are intended to
be sufficient to make the required payments of principal of and interest on such
Ginnie Mae securities but, if such funds are insufficient for that purpose, the
guaranty agreements between the issuers and Ginnie Mae require the issuers to
make advances sufficient for such payments. If the issuers fail to make such
payments, Ginnie Mae will do so.


Ginnie Mae is authorized by Section 306(g) of Title III of the National
Housing Act to guarantee the timely payment of and interest on securities which
are based on or backed by a Trust or pool composed of mortgages insured by FHA,
the Farmers' Home Administration ("FMHA") or guaranteed by the VA. Section
306(g) provides further that the full faith and credit of the United States is
pledged to the payment of all amounts which may be required to be paid under
any guaranty under such subsection. An opinion of an Assistant Attorney General
of the United States, dated December 9, 1969, states that such guaranties
"constitute general obligations of the United States backed by its full faith
and credit." Any statement that a particular security is backed by the full
faith and credit of the United States is based upon the opinion of an assistant
attorney general of the United States and should be so construed. Ginnie Mae is
empowered to borrow from the United States Treasury to the extent necessary to
make any payments of principal and interest required under such guaranties.


Ginnie Mae securities are backed by the aggregate indebtedness secured by
the underlying FHA-insured, FMHA-insured or VA-guaranteed mortgages and, except
to the extent of funds received by the issuers on account of such mortgages,
Ginnie Mae securities do not constitute a liability of nor evidence any
recourse against such issuers, but recourse thereon is solely against Ginnie
Mae. Holders of Ginnie Mae securities (such as the Trust) have no security
interest in or lien on the underlying mortgages.


The Ginnie Mae guaranties referred to herein relate only to payment of
principal of and interest on the Ginnie Mae securities in the Trust and not to
the Units offered hereby.


Monthly payments of principal will be made, and additional prepayments of
principal may be made, to each Trust in respect of the mortgages underlying the
Ginnie Mae securities in the Trust. All of the mortgages in the pools relating
to the Ginnie Mae securities in the Trust are subject to prepayment without any
significant premium or penalty at the option of the mortgagors. While the
mortgages on 1- to 4-family dwellings underlying the Ginnie Mae securities have
a stated maturity of up to 30 years for the Trust, it has been the experience
of the mortgage industry that the average life of comparable mortgages, owing
to prepayments, refinancings and payments from foreclosures, is considerably
less.


In the mid-1970's, published yield tables for Ginnie Mae securities utilized
a 12- year average life assumption for Ginnie Mae pools of 26-30 year mortgages
on 1- to 4-family dwellings. This assumption was derived from the FHA
experience relating to prepayments on such mortgages during the period from the
mid-1950's to the mid-1970s. This 12-year average life assumption was
calculated in respect of a period during which mortgage lending rates were
fairly stable. The assumption is no longer an accurate measure of the average
life of Ginnie Mae Securities or their underlying single family mortgage pools.
Recently it has been observed that mortgages issued at high interest rates have
experienced accelerated prepayment rates which would indicate a significantly
shorter average life than 12 years. Today, research analysts use complex
formulae to scrutinize the prepayments of mortgage pools in an attempt to
predict more accurately the average life of Ginnie Mae Securities.


A number of factors, including homeowner's mobility, change in family size
and mortgage market interest rates will affect the average life of the Ginnie
Mae securities in the Trust. For example, Ginnie Mae securities issued during a
period of high interest rates will be backed by a pool of mortgage loans bearing
similarly high rates. In general, during a period of declining interest rates,
new mortgage loans with interest rates lower than those charged during periods
of high rates will become available. To the extent a homeowner has an
outstanding mortgage with a high rate, he may refinance his mortgage at a lower
interest rate or he may rapidly repay his old mortgage. Should this happen, a
Ginnie Mae issued with a high interest rate may experience a rapid prepayment of
principal as the underlying mortgage loans prepay in whole or in part.
Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the prepayment levels which will be
actually realized will conform to the estimates or experience of the FHA, other
mortgage lenders, dealers or market makers or other Ginnie Mae investors. It is
not possible to meaningfully predict prepayment levels regarding the Ginnie Mae
securities in the Trust. The termination of the Trust might be accelerated as a
result of prepayments made as described herein.



Insurance on the Bonds



Insurance has been obtained by each Insured Trust, by the issuer of bonds in
certain Trusts, by a prior owner of such bonds, or by the Sponsor prior to the
deposit of such bonds in a Trust guaranteeing prompt payment of interest and
principal, when due, in respect of the bonds in such Insured Trust. See "The
Trusts--Objective and Bond Selection" in the prospectus. Each insurance policy
obtained by an Insured Trust, if any, is non-cancelable and will continue in
force so long as such Insured Trust is in existence, the respective Portfolio
Insurer is still in business and the bonds described in such policy continue to
be held by such Insured Trust (see "Portfolio" for the Trust in the Prospectus
Part I). Non-payment of premiums on a policy obtained by an Insured Trust will
not result in the cancellation of insurance but will force the insurer to take
action against the Trustee to recover premium payments due it. The Trustee in
turn will be entitled to recover such payments from such Insured Trust. Premium
rates for each issue of bonds protected by the policy obtained by an Insured
Trust are fixed for the life of an Insured Trust. The premium for any insurance
policy or policies obtained by an issuer of bonds has been paid by such issuer,
and any such policy or policies are non-cancelable and will continue in force
so long as the bonds so insured are outstanding and the Portfolio Insurer
remains in business. If the provider of an original issuance insurance policy
is unable to meet its obligations under such policy or if the rating assigned
to the claims-paying ability of any such insurer deteriorates, the Portfolio
Insurers have no obligation to insure any issue adversely affected by either of
the above described events.


The aforementioned Trust insurance guarantees the timely payment of
principal and interest on the bonds as they fall due. For the purposes of the
Portfolio Insurance, "when due" generally means the stated maturity date for
the payment of principal and interest. However, in the event (a) an issuer of a
bond defaults in the payment of principal or interest on such bond, (b) such
issuer enters into a bankruptcy proceeding or (c) the maturity of such bond is
accelerated, the Portfolio Insurer involved has the option, in its sole
discretion, for a limited period of time after receiving notice of the earliest
to occur of such a default, bankruptcy proceeding or acceleration to pay the
outstanding principal amount of such bond plus accrued interest to the date of
such payment and thereby retire the bond from an Insured Trust prior to such
bond's stated maturity date. The insurance does not guarantee the market value
of the bonds or the value of the Units. Insurance obtained by an Insured Trust
is only effective as to bonds owned by and held in such Insured Trust. In the
event of a sale of any such bond by the Trustee, such insurance terminates as
to such bond on the date of sale.


Pursuant to an irrevocable commitment of the Portfolio Insurers, the
Trustee, upon the sale of a bond covered under a portfolio insurance policy
obtained by an Insured Trust, has the right to obtain permanent insurance with
respect to such bond (i.e., insurance to maturity of the bonds regardless of
the identity of the holder thereof) (the "Permanent Insurance") upon the
payment of a single predetermined insurance premium and any expenses related
thereto from the proceeds of the sale of such bond. Accordingly, any bond in an
Insured Trust is eligible to be sold on an insured basis. It is expected that
the Trustee would exercise the right to obtain Permanent Insurance only if upon
such exercise an Insured Trust would receive net proceeds (sale of bond
proceeds less the insurance premium and related expenses attributable to the
Permanent Insurance) from such sale in excess of the sale proceeds if such
bonds were sold on an uninsured basis. The insurance premium with respect to
each bond eligible for Permanent Insurance would be determined based upon the
insurability of each bond as of the Date of Deposit and would not be increased
or decreased for any change in the creditworthiness of each bond.


The Sponsor believes that the Permanent Insurance option provides an
advantage to an Insured Trust in that each bond insured by an Insured Trust
insurance policy may be sold out of the Insured Trust with the benefits of the
insurance attaching thereto. Thus, the value of the insurance, if any, at the
time of sale, can be realized in the market value of the bond so sold (which is
not the case in connection with any value attributable to such Insured Trust's
portfolio insurance). See "Public Offering--Offering Price" in the Prospectus
Part II. Because any such insurance value may be realized in the market value of
the bond upon the sale thereof upon exercise of the Permanent Insurance option,
the Sponsor anticipates that (a) in the event an Insured Trust were to be
comprised of a substantial percentage of bonds in default or significant risk of
default, it is much less likely that the Insured Trust would need at some point
in time to seek a suspension of redemptions of Units than if the Insured Trust
were to have no such option (see "Rights of Unitholders--Redemption of Units" in
the Prospectus Part II) and (b) at the time of termination of an Insured Trust,
if the Insured Trust were holding defaulted bonds or bonds in significant risk
of default, the Insured Trust would not need to hold such bonds until their
respective maturities in order to realize the benefits of the Insured Trust's
portfolio insurance. (See "Trust Administration--Termination of Trust Agreement"
in the Prospectus Part II.)


Except as indicated below, insurance obtained by an Insured Trust has no
effect on the price or redemption value of Units. It is the present intention of
the Evaluator to attribute a value for such insurance (including the right to
obtain Permanent Insurance) for the purpose of computing the price or redemption
value of Units if the bonds covered by such insurance are in default in payment
of principal or interest or in significant risk of such default. The value of
the insurance will be equal to the difference between (i) the market value of a
bond which is in default in payment of principal or interest or in significant
risk of such default assuming the exercise of the right to obtain Permanent
Insurance (less the insurance premium and related expenses attributable to the
purchase of Permanent Insurance) and (ii) the market value of such bond not
covered by Permanent Insurance. See "Public Offering--Offering Price" in the
Prospectus Part II for a more complete description of an Insured Trust's method
of valuing defaulted bonds which have a significant risk of default.


ACA Financial Guaranty Corporation ("ACA Financial Guaranty"). ACA Financial
Guaranty is organized and domiciled in the State of Maryland. Since December
2007, ACA Financial Guaranty has not issued any new financial guaranty insurance
policies and is currently operating as a runoff insurance company.


On August 8, 2008, ACA Financial Guaranty and counterparties to its
structured finance products reached an agreement on a restructuring plan for ACA
Financial Guaranty. The plan, approved by the Maryland Insurance Administration,
provided for settlement of the structured finance obligations and protection for
ACA Financial Guaranty's municipal policyholders. The settlement required that
ACA Financial Guaranty make a $209 million cash payment and a distribution of
surplus notes. The surplus notes provide the former collateralized debt
obligation ("CDO") counterparties and certain other counterparties with
approximately a 95% economic interest in ACA Financial Guaranty. ACA Financial
Guaranty continues to operate as a runoff insurance company and focus on
actively monitoring its remaining insured municipal obligations.


As of September 30, 2012, ACA Financial Guaranty had total admitted assets of
$436.3 million and total liabilities of $328.7 million, resulting in a surplus
as regards policyholders of $107.6 million.


On December 15, 2008, S&P raised the financial strength, financial
enhancement, and issuer credit ratings on ACA Financial Guaranty to B from CCC,
with a developing outlook. The upgrade reflected the positive effects of the
restructuring transaction completed in August 2008 that settled all outstanding
CDO and reinsurance exposures of the company, including the significantly
deteriorated CDO of asset-backed securities ("ABS") transactions, eliminating a
requirement to post a significant amount of collateral to the CDO of ABS
counterparties. At the same time, S&P also withdrew the ratings at ACA Financial
Guaranty's request.


The information relating to ACA Financial Guaranty contained above has been

Ambac Assurance Corporation ("Ambac Assurance"). Ambac Financial Group, Inc.
("Ambac"), headquartered in New York City, is a holding company incorporated in
the state of Delaware on April 29, 1991. Ambac's activities are divided into two
business segments: (i) financial guarantee and (ii) financial services. Ambac
provides financial guarantee insurance for public and structured finance
obligations through its principal operating subsidiary, Ambac Assurance. As a
holding company, Ambac is largely dependent on dividends from Ambac Assurance to
pay principal and interest on its indebtedness and to pay its operating
expenses.


On June 5, 2008, S&P downgraded Ambac Assurance's insurance financial
strength rating to AA from AAA, with negative implications. On June 19, 2008,
Moody's downgraded Ambac Assurance's insurance financial strength rating from
Aaa to Aa3, with a negative outlook. Moody's June 19, 2008 downgrade of Ambac
Assurance's insurance financial strength rating reflects Ambac Assurance's
overall credit profile in the current environment, including its significantly
constrained new business prospects, its impaired financial flexibility and
increased expected and stress loss projections among its mortgage-related risk
exposures relative to previous estimates. On November 5, 2008, Moody's
downgraded the insurance financial strength rating of Ambac Assurance from Aa3
to Baa1, with a developing outlook, as a result of greater than expected
mortgage-related losses in the third quarter. On November 19, 2008, S&P lowered
its insurance financial strength rating of Ambac Assurance to A from AA, with a
negative outlook. The November 19, 2008 rating action on Ambac Assurance
reflects S&P's view that Ambac Assurance's exposures in the U.S. residential
mortgage sector and particularly the related collateralized debt obligation
structures have been a source of significant and comparatively
greater-than-competitor losses and will continue to expose the company to the
potential for further adverse loss development. On April 13, 2009, Moody's
downgraded the insurance financial strength rating of Ambac Assurance from Baa1
to Ba3, with a developing outlook, reflecting Ambac Assurance's weakened
business position and very constrained financial flexibility, as well as its
weakened risk adjusted capitalization, as Moody's loss estimates on residential
mortgage-backed securities ("RMBS") have increased significantly. In Moody's
view, these higher loss estimates increase the estimated capital required to
support Ambac Assurance's sizable direct RMBS portfolio (including securities
owned as well as securities guaranteed) and also the insurer's large portfolio
of ABS CDO risks. On June 24, 2009, S&P lowered the counterparty credit,
financial strength, and financial enhancement ratings of Ambac Assurance to BBB
from A with negative implications. The June 24, 2009 rating action on Ambac
Assurance reflects S&P's view that Ambac Assurance is effectively in runoff and
the likelihood of the company continuing as an operating entity capable of
writing new business has decreased significantly. On July 28, 2009, S&P lowered
the counterparty credit, financial strength, and financial enhancement ratings
of Ambac Assurance to CC from BBB, with a developing outlook. The July 28, 2009
rating action on Ambac Assurance reflects S&P's view of the significant
deterioration in the Ambac Assurance's insured portfolio of nonprime RMBS and
related CDOs, which has required the company to strengthen reserves to account
for higher projected claims. In S&P's view, the additional reserves will have a
significant negative effect on operating results, which will likely cause
surplus to decline to below regulator required minimums. On July 29, 2009,
Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength rating of Ambac Assurance
from Ba3 to Caa2, with a developing outlook, reflecting Moody's belief that, as
a result of Ambac Assurance's recently announced large loss reserve increase and
credit impairment charge estimated for the second quarter of 2009 which would
reduce Ambac Assurance's regulatory capital to levels below the required minimum
threshold, there will be increased pressure on Ambac Assurance's counterparties
to commute outstanding exposures on terms that could imply a distressed
exchange. On March 25, 2010, S&P revised the counterparty credit, financial
strength, and financial enhancement ratings of Ambac Assurance to R from CC (an
issuer rated "R" by S&P is under regulatory supervision because of its financial
condition). S&P's March 25, 2010 rating action resulted following a directive by
the Commissioner of Insurance of the State of Wisconsin to Ambac Assurance to
establish a segregated account for certain insured exposure, primarily policies
related to credit derivatives, RMBS, and other structured finance transactions.
On March 26, 2010, Moody's placed the Caa2 insurance financial strength rating
of Ambac Assurance on review for possible upgrade. On November 23, 2010, Moody's
affirmed Ambac's Caa2 insurance financial strength rating, with a developing
outlook. On November 30, 2010, S&P withdrew the counterparty credit, financial
strength, and financial enhancement ratings of Ambac at the company's request.
The November 30, 2010 rating action followed a directive by the Commissioner of
Insurance of the State of Wisconsin to Ambac to establish a segregated account
for certain insured exposure, primarily policies related to credit derivatives,
residential mortgage-backed securities, and other structured finance
transactions. On April 7, 2011, Moody's withdrew the insurance financial
strength rating of Ambac Assurance.


There have been a number of developments with respect to ratings actions by
the rating agencies. As a result of these rating agency actions, as well as
investor concern with respect to these actions, Ambac Assurance and its
operating subsidiaries have been able to originate only a de minimis amount of
new financial guarantee business since November 2007, and no new business in
2009. As a result, Ambac is no longer competing for new business.


On March 25, 2010, Ambac announced that, at the direction of the Office of
the Commissioner of Insurance of the State of Wisconsin ("OCI"), Ambac Assurance
had established a segregated account for certain of its liabilities, primarily
policies related to credit derivatives, RMBS and other structured finance
transactions. This action derives from the OCI's view that immediate action is
necessary to address Ambac Assurance's financial position. In conjunction with
the establishment of the segregated account, the OCI has commenced
rehabilitation proceedings with respect to liabilities contained in the
segregated account in order to facilitate an orderly run-off and/or settlement
of those specific liabilities. On June 7, 2010 Ambac announced that it had
commuted all of its remaining CDOs of ABS and that certain other non-CDO of ABS
exposures would be commuted within the next twelve months.


On November 8, 2010, Ambac announced that it has filed for a voluntary
petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the
"Bankruptcy Code") in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern
District of New York (the "Bankruptcy Court"). Ambac will continue to operate in
the ordinary course of business as "debtor-in-possession" under the jurisdiction
of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the
Bankruptcy Code and the orders of the Bankruptcy Court. Ambac Assurance is
subject to insurance regulatory requirements of the States of Wisconsin and New
York, and the other jurisdictions in which it is licensed to conduct business.


Ambac Assurance's statutory policyholder surplus and qualified statutory
capital were $100.0 million and $628.3 million at September 30, 2012,
respectively as compared to $495.3 million and $684.6 million as of December 31,
2011, respectively. As of September 30, 2012, total stockholders' deficit was
$3.49 billion; at December 31, 2011, total stockholders' deficit was $3.15
billion. This increased deficit was primarily caused by the net loss for the
nine months ended September 30, 2012, partially offset by unrealized gains on
investment securities during the period.

Assured Guaranty Corp. ("Assured Guaranty") and Assured Guaranty Municipal
Corp. ("Assured Municipal") (formerly Financial Security Assurance Inc.
("FSA")). Assured Guaranty, a subsidiary of Assured Guaranty Ltd. ("Assured"),
is organized in the State of Maryland and provides financial guaranty insurance
to both the municipal and structured finance sectors. Assured Municipal, also a
subsidiary of Assured, is a separately capitalized company organized in the
State of New York and provides municipal bond insurance.


In January 2009, Assured Guaranty finalized an agreement with CIFG Assurance
North America, Inc. to assume a diversified portfolio of financial guaranty
contracts totaling approximately $13.3 billion of net par outstanding. Assured
Guaranty received $75.6 million, which included $85.7 million of upfront
premiums net of ceding commissions and approximately $12.2 million of future
installments related to this transaction.


On July 1, 2009, Assured completed the purchase of Financial Security
Assurance Holdings Ltd., the parent of financial guaranty insurance company,
FSA, from Dexia Holdings Inc. Effective November 9, 2009, FSA was renamed
Assured Guaranty Municipal Corp. In certain states, Assured Guaranty Municipal
Corp. may operate under its prior name, Financial Security Assurance Inc.


On June 24, 2010, S&P published a Full Analysis in which it affirmed its
"AAA" financial strength ratings of Assured Guaranty and Assured Municipal,
reflecting S&P's view of the companies' dominant market position in the bond
insurance industry and their strong combined capital position. On October 25,
2010, S&P lowered the counterparty credit and financial strength ratings of both
Assured Guaranty and Assured Municipal to AA+ from AAA, with a stable outlook.
The downgrades reflect S&P's view of a struggling financial guarantee market,
each company's weak statutory operating performance, and also the quality of
each company's capital within S&P's capital adequacy analysis. On November 30,
2011 S&P lowered the counterparty credit and financial strength ratings of both
Assured Guaranty and Assured Municipal to AA- from AA+, with a stable outlook.
The November 30, 2011 downgrades reflect S&P's view that Assured Guaranty and
Assured Municipal do not maintain enough capital to mitigate the largest obligor
concentrations for a higher rating.


On November 21, 2008, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength
rating of Assured Guaranty from Aaa to Aa2, primarily reflecting Moody's updated
view on Assured Guaranty's exposure to weakness inherent in the financial
guaranty business model. Also on November 21, 2008, Moody's downgraded the
insurance financial strength rating of FSA from Aaa to Aa3, reflecting Moody's
view of FSA's diminished business and financial profile resulting from its
exposure to losses on U.S. mortgage risks and disruption in the financial
guaranty business more broadly. On November 12, 2009, Moody's downgraded the
insurance financial strength rating of Assured Guaranty from Aa2 to Aa3, with a
negative outlook. Moody's November 12, 2009 downgrade results from Moody's
review of the performance of Assured's RMBS exposures. Moody's said that adverse
trends in RMBS loss estimates have had varying effects on Assured's main
insurance subsidiaries. On March 5, 2010, Moody's confirmed the insurance
financial strength ratings of both Assured Guaranty and Assured Municipal at
Aa3, with a negative outlook. On January 17, 2013, Moody's downgraded the
insurance financial strength ratings of Assured Guaranty to A3 from Aa3 and of
Assured Municipal to A2 from Aa3, both with a stable outlook. The January 17,
2013 downgrade reflects Moody's reassessment of the business franchise, expected
future profitability and financial flexibility of Assured Guaranty and Assured
Municipal.


Assured's third quarter 2012 net income declined to $142 million from $761
million in third quarter 2011 due primarily to the effects of changes in credit
spreads on the fair value of credit derivatives, offset in part by a decline in
loss expense, which was significantly higher in the prior year due mainly to the
effects of declining discount rates in the third quarter of 2011. Non-GAAP
operating income in third quarter 2012 was $166 million, an increase from
operating income in third quarter 2011, due primarily to higher net earned
premiums due to refundings, accelerations and terminations, lower loss expense,
and a lower effective tax rate on operating income. As of September 30, 2012,
Assured Guaranty had total assets of $5.28 billion and total liabilities of
$4.13 billion, resulting in total shareholder equity of $1.15 billion. As of
September 30, 2012, Assured Municipal had total assets of $10.74 billion and
total liabilities of $7.64 billion, resulting in total shareholder equity of
$3.10 billion.


The information contained above relating to Assured Guaranty and Assured
Municipal and their parent company, Assured, is based upon publicly available
information, or upon information that has been provided by the ratings agencies.

subsequent to the date hereof.


Berkshire Hathaway Assurance Corp ("BHAC"). BHAC is a bond insurance company
created by Berkshire Hathaway, Inc. ("Berkshire") in December 2007 and is
licensed to write financial guarantee insurance in 49 states.


On April 11, 2008, S&P assigned an initial rating of AAA to BHAC's insurance
financial strength, with a stable outlook. On April 25, 2008, Moody's assigned
an initial rating of Aaa to BHAC's insurance financial strength, with a stable
outlook. On April 8, 2009, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength
rating of BHAC from Aaa to Aa1, with a stable outlook. This downgrade reflects
Moody's view concerning "the impact on Berkshire's key businesses of the severe
decline in equity markets over the past year as well as the protracted economic
recession." Moody's noted that Berkshire is also exposed to heightened
volatility in its earnings and capital base related to market value fluctuations
within its large portfolio of equity derivatives. On February 4, 2010, S&P
lowered the financial strength rating of BHAC from AAA to AA+, with a stable
outlook. The February 4, 2010 rating action was taken in anticipation of
Berkshire's acquisition of Northern Santa Fe Corporation reflecting S&P's
expectation that a significant part of the internal cash for the acquisition
will come from Berkshire's core insurance operations and that Berkshire's
overall capital adequacy has weakened to levels no longer consistent with a AAA
rating and is not expected to return to extremely strong levels in the near
term.


As of September 30, 2012, Berkshire had total assets of $424.1 billion and
total liabilities of $235.0 billion, resulting in total shareholder equity of
$189.1 billion.

Build America Mutual Assurance Company ("BAM"). BAM is a New York domiciled
mutual insurance company owned by the issuers of municipal bonds who use BAM to
insure their debt obligations. BAM officially launched on July 23, 2012 and
began writing policies in September of 2012.


On July 23, 2012, S&P assigned an initial rating of AA to BAM's financial
strength and counterparty credit ratings, with a stable outlook. These ratings
based upon S&P's view that BAM holds a very strong competitive position with low
industry risk, along with extremely strong capital adequacy and strong operating
performance.


As of September 30, 2012 BAM had total net admitted assets of $518.9 million
and total liabilities of $27.9 million, resulting in a surplus as regards
policyholders of $491.0 million.


The information relating to BAM contained above has been furnished by BAM or

CIFG Assurance North America, Inc. ("CIFG"). CIFG Holding, Inc. is the
holding company for the CIFG group of financial guaranty insurance and
reinsurance companies ("CIFG Group"), including CIFG Assurance North America,
Inc., a New York corporation and its subsidiaries. The CIFG Group is actively
managing the runoff of a portfolio of insured structured finance, municipal and
infrastructure risks. On September 29, 2010, CIFG and CIFG Guaranty entered into
a merger agreement which resulted in CIFG Guaranty merging into CIFG (together
with related transactions, the "CIFG Merger").


On March 6, 2008, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength ratings
of CIFG from Aaa to A1, with a stable outlook. This rating action reflected
Moody's assessment of CIFG's weakened capitalization, impaired business
opportunities, and uncertain strategic direction, as a result, in part, of its
exposures to the U.S. residential mortgage market. Moody's believed that CIFG's
significant exposure to the mortgage sector, especially ABS CDOs is indicative
of a risk posture far greater than would be consistent with a Aaa rating going
forward. On May 20, 2008, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength
ratings of CIFG to Ba2 from A1, with direction uncertain, reflecting the high
likelihood that, absent material developments, the company would fail minimum
regulatory capital requirements in New York and Bermuda due to expected
significant increases in modeled loss reserves on ABS CDOs. In Moody's view, the
breach of such regulatory capital requirements would put the company in a
precarious position, especially in light of the solvency provisions embedded in
its CDS exposures. On October 28, 2008, Moody's downgraded the insurance
financial strength rating of CIFG from Ba2 to B3, with direction uncertain,
reflecting Moody's expectation of substantially higher mortgage-related losses
arising from CIFG's insured portfolio, as well as the possibility that certain
troubled exposures could be commuted. On January 22, 2009, Moody's upgraded the
insurance financial strength rating of CIFG from B3 to Ba3, with a developing
outlook, reflecting the strengthened capital adequacy profile of CIFG following
its restructuring and the commutation of substantially all of its ABS CDO risks.
Also on January 22, 2009, S&P raised the insurance financial strength rating of
CIFG to BB from B, with a developing outlook. S&P's January 22, 2009 upgrade
results from the completion of CIFG's restructuring plan involving key
policyholders, creditors, and equity owners (counterparties) who had hedged
their ABS CDO and commercial real estate CDO exposures with CIFG and which were
significantly affected by defaults and downgrades of the underlying collateral.
On June 15, 2009, S&P lowered the counterparty credit, financial strength, and
financial enhancement ratings of CIFG to CC from BB, with a negative outlook,
reflecting S&P's view of the significant deterioration in the company's insured
portfolio of nonprime RMBS which has necessitated that CIFG strengthen reserves
to account for the higher projected claims. On August 20, 2009, Moody's
downgraded the insurance financial strength ratings of CIFG from Ba3to Caa2,
resulting from significant deterioration in the company's remaining insured
portfolio since January, 2009 when CIFG initiated a broad restructuring. On
November 11, 2009, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength ratings
of CIFG from Caa2 to Ca. Also on November 11, 2009, Moody's announced that it
will withdraw the insurance financial strength rating of CIFG. The November 11,
2009 rating actions reflect Moody's view that material deterioration in CIFG's
insured portfolio adversely affected the guarantor's capital adequacy profile
and Moody's believes that CIFG may no longer have sufficient financial resources
to pay all insurance claims. On February 16, 2010, S&P withdrew the counterparty
credit, financial strength, and financial enhancement ratings of CIFG.


As of September 30, 2012, CIFG had net admitted assets of $742.3 million and
total liabilities of $385.5 million. CIFG's statutory surplus as of September
30, 2012 is approximately $356.7 million, a decrease of approximately $227.8
million from approximately $584.5 million at December 31, 2011. This decrease is
primarily attributable to unpaid losses and loss adjustment expense reserves
established for student loans of approximately $252.3 million, which is
partially offset by other income statement balances resulting in a net loss of
approximately $227.0 million and an increase in contingency reserves of
approximately $3.5 million.


The information relating to CIFG and its affiliates contained above has been

the accuracy or adequacy of such information, or as to the existence of any
adverse changes in such information subsequent to the date hereof.


Financial Guaranty Insurance Company ("FGIC"). FGIC is a wholly owned
subsidiary of FGIC Corporation. The company was engaged in the business of
providing financial guaranty insurance and other forms of credit enhancement for
public finance and structured finance obligations. In January 2008, FGIC
voluntarily ceased writing financial guaranty policies concerning new or
additional risks.


The deterioration in the U.S. housing and mortgage markets and the global
credit markets, which accelerated in the fourth quarter of 2007 and continued
through the fourth quarter of 2009, has adversely affected the company's
business, results of operations and financial condition. Specifically, the
company incurred significant losses related to its exposure to certain ABS CDOs,
which are backed primarily by subprime RMBS, and to certain RMBS, primarily
backed by first-lien or second-lien mortgages. These losses have resulted in a
substantial reduction of FGIC's statutory policyholders' surplus over time. On
November 24, 2009, the New York State Insurance Department, the predecessor to
the New York State Department of Financial Services, issued an order pursuant to

Section 1310 of the New York Insurance Law requiring FGIC to, among other
things, suspend paying any and all claims. FGIC was subsequently unable to
eliminate the impairment of its policyholders' surplus through an out-of-court
Surplus Restoration Plan. On June 11, 2012, Benjamin M. Lawsky, Superintendent
of Financial Services of the State of New York (the "Superintendent") filed a
verified petition with the Supreme Court of the State of New York for an order
of rehabilitation (i) appointing the Superintendent as rehabilitator
("Rehabilitator") of FGIC, (ii) directing the Rehabilitator to take possession
of the property and assets of FGIC and to conduct the business thereof, and

(iii) directing the Rehabilitator to take steps towards the removal of the
causes and conditions which have made FGIC's rehabilitation proceeding (the
"Rehabilitation Proceeding") necessary. FGIC consented to the commencement of
the Rehabilitation Proceeding.


Prior to the fourth quarter of 2007, FGIC's financial strength was rated
"Aaa" by Moody's "AAA" by S&P, and "AAA" by Fitch Ratings, Inc. ("Fitch").
Moody's, S&P and Fitch have since completed several assessments of FGIC's
capital adequacy in relation to the company's exposure to ABS CDOs which are
backed primarily by subprime RMBS, and its exposure to first-lien and
second-lien RMBS. As a result of these assessments, Moody's, S&P and Fitch
downgraded the financial strength ratings of FGIC. As of March 31, 2008, Fitch
had downgraded FGIC from AA to BBB with Rating Watch Negative; Moody's had
downgraded FGIC from A3 to Baa3; and S&P had downgraded FGIC from A to BB. On
June 20, 2008, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength rating of
FGIC from Baa3 to B1, reflecting FGIC's severely impaired financial flexibility
and proximity to minimum regulatory capital requirements relative to Moody's
estimates of expected case losses. On November 24, 2008, S&P lowered its
insurance financial strength rating of FGIC to CCC from BB, with a negative
outlook. S&P's November 24, 2008 downgrade results from FGIC's exposure to
nonprime and second-lien mortgages and related CDO of ABS. On December 19, 2008,
Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength rating of FGIC from B1 to
Caa1, with a negative outlook, reflecting Moody's expectation of higher
mortgage-related losses arising from FGIC's insured portfolio and the
constrained liquidity and financial flexibility of the holding company. On March
24, 2009, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength rating of FGIC
from Caa1 to Caa3, with a negative outlook, reflecting Moody's expectation of
higher mortgage-related losses arising from FGIC's insured portfolio,
insufficient claims paying resources to cover Moody's estimate of expected loss,
and the constrained liquidity and financial flexibility of FGIC's holding
company. Also on March 24, 2009, Moody's withdrew the insurance financial
strength rating of FGIC. On April 22, 2009, S&P lowered the counterparty credit,
financial strength, and financial enhancement ratings of FGIC to CC from CCC,
with a negative outlook. Also on April 22, 2009, S&P withdrew the ratings on
FGIC and the counterparty credit rating on the holding company, FGIC
Corporation, because of S&P's expectation that timely and comprehensive
financial information will no longer be available.


As of September 30, 2012, FGIC had net admitted assets of approximately $2.1
billion and total liabilities of approximately $5.8 billion.


On August 4, 2010, FGIC Corporation announced that it had filed a voluntary
petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the
Southern District of New York. None of FGIC Corporation's subsidiaries or
affiliates, including FGIC, are part of the Chapter 11 filing.

Municipal Assurance Corporation ("MAC"). MAC is a New York domiciled
corporation providing municipal bond insurance for municipal and infrastructure
bonds. MAC currently guarantees only public finance transactions. MAC is an
Assured Guaranty company owned jointly by its affiliates Assured Guaranty
Municipal Corp. and Assured Guaranty Corp. MAC is part of the Assured Guaranty
Group.


On July 17, 2013, S&P assigned MAC a long-term financial strength and
counterparty credit rating of AA- to MAC with a stable outlook. On March 18,
2014, S&P raised its financial strength and enhancement rating on MAC from AA-
to AA. The rating action reflects S&P's view that MAC's competitive position
remains strong relative to its peers' in the bond industry. S&P continues to
view MAC as having a stable outlook.


As of June 30, 2014, MAC had a total net admitted assets of $1,519,869,768
and total liabilities of $999,277,625 resulting in a surplus as regards
policyholders of $520,592,143.

National Public Finance Guarantee Corporation ("National Guarantee")
(formerly MBIA Insurance Corp. of Illinois ("MBIA Illinois")). MBIA, Inc., a
Connecticut corporation, conducts its financial guarantee business through
though its wholly-owned subsidiaries MBIA Insurance Corporation ("MBIA Corp."),
which writes global structured finance and non-U.S. public finance financial
guarantee insurance, and National Guarantee, which writes U.S. public finance
guarantees.


On February 18, 2009, MBIA, Inc., the parent company of MBIA Corp., announced
the restructuring of its financial guaranty insurance operations following the
approval of the New York and Illinois insurance regulators. The restructuring
involved the segregation of its financial guaranty insurance operations into two
separately capitalized sister companies, with National Guarantee assuming the
risk associated with its U.S. municipal exposures, and with MBIA Corp. insuring
the remainder of the portfolio, including all international and structured
finance exposures. Business ceded to MBIA Corp. from FGIC in 2008 has been
assigned to National Guarantee. To provide additional protection for its
municipal bond policyholders, National Guarantee has also issued second-to-pay
policies for the benefit of the policyholders covered by the reinsurance and
assignment. The second-to-pay policies, which are a direct obligation of
National Guarantee, will be held by The Bank of New York Mellon as insurance
trustee. These policies provide that if MBIA Corp. or FGIC, as applicable, do
not pay valid claims of their policyholders, the policyholders will then be able
to make a claim directly against National Guarantee under the second-to-pay
policies. On March 19, 2009, MBIA Illinois formally changed its name to National
Public Finance Guarantee Corporation. Effective December 1, 2009, National
Guarantee was redomesticated to the State of New York and is subject to
insurance regulations and supervision of the State of New York. National
Guarantee is a wholly owned subsidiary of MBIA, Inc. and independently
capitalized with $5.6 billion in claims-paying resources as of December 31,
2010. In certain states, National Public Finance Guarantee Corporation may
operate under its prior name, MBIA Insurance Corp. of Illinois.


On June 5, 2008, S&P downgraded MBIA Corp.'s insurance financial strength
rating to AA from AAA. On June 19, 2008, Moody's downgraded the insurance
financial strength ratings of MBIA Corp. and its insurance affiliates from Aaa
to A2. Moody's June 19, 2008 downgrade of MBIA Corp. and its insurance
affiliates reflects MBIA Corp.'s limited financial flexibility and impaired
franchise, as well as the substantial risk within its portfolio of insured
exposures and a movement toward more aggressive capital management within the
group. On November 7, 2008, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength
rating of MBIA Corp. and its insurance affiliates from A2 to Baa1, with a
developing outlook. Moody's November 7, 2008 downgrade of MBIA Corp. and its
insurance affiliates reflects MBIA Corp.'s diminished business and financial
profile resulting from its exposure to losses from U.S. mortgage risks and
disruption in the financial guaranty business more broadly. On February 18,
2009, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength rating of MBIA Corp.
from Baa1 to B3, with a developing outlook, reflecting MBIA Corp.'s substantial
reduction in claims-paying resources relative to the remaining higher-risk
exposures in its insured portfolio, given the removal of capital, and the
transfer of unearned premium reserves associated with the ceding of its
municipal portfolio to MBIA Illinois, as well as the continued deterioration of
MBIA Corp.'s insured portfolio of largely structured credits, with stress
reaching sectors beyond residential mortgage-related securities. Also on
February 18, 2009, S&P lowered the counterparty credit, financial strength, and
financial enhancement ratings of MBIA Corp. to BBB+ from AA, with a negative
outlook. The February 18, 2009 rating action on MBIA Corp. reflects S&P's view
that MBIA Corp.'s retained insured portfolio lacks sufficient sector diversity
and with time could become more concentrated, and that MBIA Corp.'s 2005-2007
vintage direct RMBS, CDO of ABS, and other structured exposures are subject to
continued adverse loss development that could erode capital adequacy. At the
same time, S&P lowered the counterparty credit and financial strength ratings of
MBIA Illinois to AA- from AA, reflecting MBIA Illinois's uncertain business
prospects and capital. On June 5, 2009, S&P lowered the counterparty credit,
financial strength, and financial enhancement ratings of MBIA Corp. to BBB from
BBB+, with a negative outlook, resulting from MBIA Corp.'s increased loss
assumptions on its 2005-2007 vintage direct RMBS and CDO of ABS and a change in
the assumed tax benefit of tax-loss carryforwards. Also on June 5, 2009, S&P
lowered the counterparty credit, financial strength, and financial enhancement
ratings of National Guarantee to A from AA-, with a negative outlook, reflecting
S&P's view of National Guarantee's uncertain business and capital-raising
prospects. On September 28, 2009, S&P lowered the counterparty credit, financial
strength, and financial enhancement ratings of MBIA Corp. to BB+ from BBB, with
a negative outlook, reflecting S&P's view that macroeconomic conditions continue
to contribute to losses on the group's structured finance products. On December
22, 2010 S&P lowered the counterparty credit, financial strength, and financial
enhancement ratings of MBIA Corp. to B from BB+, with a negative outlook,
reflecting increased stress case loss projections. Also on December 22, 2010 S&P
lowered the counterparty credit, financial strength, and financial enhancement
ratings of National Guarantee to BBB from A, with a developing outlook. On
December 19, 2011 Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength rating of
National Guarantee from Baa1 to Baa2, with a negative outlook, based upon
weakening of the overall MBIA group's market standing as losses grow at National
Guarantee's affiliated companies and the risk that resources at National
Guarantee could be drawn away to support losses elsewhere within the group. On
May 10, 2013 S&P raised the counterparty credit, financial strength, and
financial enhancement ratings of National Guarantee to A from BB, with a stable
outlook. The May 10, 2013 rating action reflects S&P's view that MBIA Corp. no
longer acts as an anchor on the National Guarantee rating following the
settlement with Societe Generale that ends litigation challenging National
Guarantee's split from MBIA Corp. in 2009. On May 21, 2013 Moody's upgraded the
insurance financial strength rating of MBIA Corp. to B3 from Caa2, with a
positive outlook, citing MBIA Corp.'s improved capital and liquidity profile
following settlements of putback receivables and insured claims with major
counterparties. Also on May 21, 2013 Moody's upgraded the insurance financial
strength rating of National Guarantee to Baa1 from Baa2, with a positive
outlook. The May 21, 2013 rating action reflects National Guarantee's improved
credit profile following the repayment of the loan from its weaker affiliate,
MBIA Corp., and the termination of the litigation related to the 2009
restructuring.


As of September 30, 2012, National Guarantee had total net admitted assets of
$5.9 billion and total liabilities of $4.1 billion, resulting in a surplus as
regard policyholders of $1.8 billion.


As of September 30, 2012, MBIA, Inc. and its subsidiaries had total assets of
$22.1 billion and total liabilities of $19.6 billion. MBIA, Inc.'s total
shareholders' equity as of September 30, 2012 was $2.6 billion, increasing from
$1.7 billion as of December 31, 2011.


The information relating to MBIA and its affiliates contained above has been

Radian Asset Assurance, Inc. ("Radian"). Radian Group Inc. ("Radian Group"),
headquartered in Philadelphia, provides private mortgage insurance and related
risk mitigation products and services to mortgage lenders nationwide through its
principal operating subsidiary, Radian Guaranty Inc. ("Radian Guaranty").
Radian, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Radian Guaranty, is domiciled and licensed
in New York as a financial guaranty insurer. In the third quarter of 2008,
Radian discontinued writing any new financial guaranty business, including
accepting reinsurance.


On March 12, 2009, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength rating
of Radian, as well as the ratings of its operational affiliates, from A3 to Ba1,
with a stable outlook, reflecting the substantial deterioration in the credit
profile of Radian Guaranty, coupled with increased loss estimates on Radian's
pooled corporate exposures. On November 24, 2009, S&P lowered the financial
strength, financial enhancement, and corporate credit ratings of Radian to BB
from BBB- and left the ratings on CreditWatch with negative implications,
reflecting S&P's view that adverse loss development in Radian's insured
portfolio has resulted in higher capital charges and could result in further
losses. On December 22, 2009, S&P lowered the financial strength, financial
enhancement, and corporate credit ratings of Radian to BB- from BB, with a
negative outlook.


As of September 30, 2012, Radian Group had total assets of $6.45 billion and
total liabilities of $5.43 billion. As of September 30, 2012, Radian had a
statutory policyholders' surplus of $1.02 billion and a contingency reserve of
$290.9 million.


The information relating to Radian and its affiliates contained above has
been furnished by Radian or the rating agencies. No representation is made
herein as to the accuracy or adequacy of such information, or as to the
existence of any adverse changes in such information subsequent to the date
hereof.


Syncora Guarantee Inc. ("Syncora Guarantee") (formerly XL Capital Assurance
Inc. ("XLCA")). Syncora Guarantee, a wholly owned subsidiary of Syncora Holdings
Ltd. ("Syncora Holdings"), is a New York domiciled financial guarantee insurance
company which provides credit enhancement and protection products to the public
finance and structured finance markets throughout the United States and
internationally.


In February 2008, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength ratings
of XLCA to A3 from Aaa. On June 20, 2008, Moody's downgraded the insurance
financial strength rating of XLCA from A3 to B2, reflecting XLCA's severely
impaired financial flexibility and proximity to minimum regulatory capital
requirements relative to Moody's estimates of expected case losses. On October
24, 2008, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength rating of Syncora
Guarantee from B2 to Caa1. On November 18, 2008, S&P lowered its insurance
financial strength rating of Syncora Guarantee to B from BBB- with developing
expectations. S&P's November 18, 2008 downgrade resulted from the Syncora
Guarantee's delay in implementing its restructuring plan and slow progress in
its negotiations with counterparties of its CDO of ABS exposure. On January 29,
2009, S&P lowered the issuer credit and financial strength ratings of Syncora
Guarantee to CC from B, with a negative outlook. S&P's January 29, 2009
downgrade resulted from S&P's recent update to its distressed exchange criteria.
On March 9, 2009, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength rating of
Syncora Guarantee from Caa1 to Ca, with a developing outlook, as a result of the
large loss reserve and credit impairment charges taken by Syncora Guarantee on
its mortgage-related exposures during the fourth quarter, which have resulted in
a $2.4 billion statutory deficit at Syncora Guarantee as of December 31, 2008.
On April 27, 2009, S&P revised the financial strength and financial enhancement
ratings of Syncora Guarantee to R from CC (an issuer rated "R" by S&P is under
regulatory supervision because of its financial condition). Also on April 27,
2009, S&P revised the counterparty credit rating of Syncora Guarantee to D from
CC (an issuer rated "D" by S&P has failed to pay one or more of its financial
obligation when it became due). S&P's April 27, 2009 rating actions resulted
from Syncora Guarantee's announcement that pursuant to an order of the New York
Insurance Department ("NYID"), the company must suspend any and all claims
payments until it has restored its policyholders' surplus to a level greater
than or equal to $65 million, the minimum the state requires. On July 28, 2010,
S&P withdrew the D counterparty credit rating and the R financial strength and
financial enhancement ratings of Syncora Guarantee. S&P's July 28, 2010 ratings
actions resulted from S&P's belief that there is not sufficient information to
judge Syncora Guarantee's claims paying ability.


As of September 30, 2012, Syncora Guarantee had total assets of $1.17 billion
and total liabilities of $639 million, resulting in a policyholders' surplus of
$504.2 million.


On July 20, 2010, Syncora Holdings announced that Syncora Guarantee has
completed its remediation plan sufficient to meet its minimum statutory
policyholder surplus requirements and address previously announced short and
medium term liquidity issues. Also on July 20, 2010, Syncora Holdings announced
that the NYID had approved Syncora Guarantee's plan for the payment of accrued
and unpaid claims and for the payment of new claims as they become due in the
ordinary course of business, resulting in the recommencement of claim payments
by Syncora Guaranty on regularly scheduled payment dates occurring on or after
July 21, 2010.

The extent of state insurance regulation and supervision varies by
jurisdiction, but New York and most other jurisdictions have laws and
regulations prescribing permitted investments and governing the payment of
dividends, transactions with affiliates, mergers, consolidations, acquisitions
or sales of assets and incurrence of liabilities for borrowings.


In order to be in an Insured Trust, bonds must be insured by one of the
Preinsured Bond Insurers or be eligible for the insurance being obtained by
such Trust, if any. In determining eligibility for insurance, the Preinsured
Bond Insurers and the Portfolio Insurers have applied their own standards which
correspond generally to the standards they normally use in establishing the
insurability of new issues of municipal bonds and which are not necessarily the
criteria used in the selection of bonds by the Sponsor. To the extent the
standards of the Preinsured Bond Insurers and the Portfolio Insurers are more
restrictive than those of the Sponsor, the previously stated Trust investment
criteria have been limited with respect to the bonds. This decision is made
prior to the Date of Deposit, as debt obligations not eligible for insurance
are not deposited in an Insured Trust. Thus, all of the bonds in the portfolios
of the Insured Trusts are insured either by the respective Trust or by the
issuer of the bonds, by a prior owner of such bonds or by the Sponsor prior to
the deposit of such bonds in a Trust.


An objective of portfolio insurance obtained by an Insured Trust is to
obtain a higher yield on the portfolio of such Trust than would be available if
all the bonds in such portfolio had S&P "AAA" rating and yet at the same time
to have the protection of insurance of prompt payment of interest and
principal, when due, on the bonds. There is, of course, no certainty that this
result will be achieved. Preinsured Bonds in an Insured Trust (all of which are
rated "AAA" by S&P) may or may not have a higher yield than uninsured bonds
rated "AAA" by S&P. In selecting such bonds for an Insured Trust, the Sponsor
has applied the criteria hereinbefore described.


In the event of nonpayment of interest or principal, when due, in respect of
a bond, a Portfolio Insurer shall make such payment after the respective
insurer has been notified that such nonpayment has occurred or is threatened
(but not earlier than the date such payment is due). The insurer, as regards
any payment it may make, will succeed to the rights of the Trustee in respect
thereof. All policies issued by the Portfolio Insurers, if any, and the
Preinsured Bond Insurers are substantially identical insofar as obligations to
an Insured Trust are concerned.


The Internal Revenue Service has issued a letter ruling which holds in effect
that insurance proceeds representing maturing interest on defaulted municipal
obligations paid to holders of insured bonds, under policy provisions
substantially identical to the policies described herein, will be excludable
from federal gross income under Section 103(a)(1) of the Code to the same extent
as if such payments were made by the issuer of the municipal obligations.
Holders of Units in an Insured Trust should discuss with their tax advisers the
degree of reliance which they may place on this letter ruling. However, counsel
for the Sponsor at the time of the closing of the Insured Trust, had given an
opinion to the effect such payment of proceeds would be excludable from federal
gross income to the extent described under "Federal Tax Status" in Prospectus


Part II.


Each Portfolio Insurer is subject to regulation by the department of
insurance in the state in which it is qualified to do business. Such
regulation, however, is no guarantee that each Portfolio Insurer will be able
to perform on its contract of insurance in the event a claim should be made
thereunder at some time in the future. At the date hereof, it is reported that
no claims have been submitted or are expected to be submitted to any of the
Portfolio Insurers which would materially impair the ability of any such
company to meet its commitment pursuant to any contract of bond or portfolio
insurance.


The information relating to each Portfolio Insurer has been furnished by such
companies. The financial information with respect to each Portfolio Insurer
appears in reports filed with state insurance regulatory authorities and is
subject to audit and review by such authorities. No representation is made
herein as to the accuracy or adequacy of such information or as to the absence
of material adverse changes in such information subsequent to the dates thereof.



Portfolio Administration



The Trustee is empowered to sell, for the purpose of redeeming Units
tendered by any Unitholder, and for the payment of expenses for which funds may
not be available, such of the bonds designated by the Evaluator as the Trustee
in its sole discretion may deem necessary. The Evaluator, in designating such
bonds, will consider a variety of factors, including (a) interest rates, (b)
market value and (c) marketability. To the extent that bonds are sold which are
current in payment of principal and interest in order to meet redemption
requests and defaulted bonds are retained in the portfolio in order to preserve
the related insurance protection applicable to said bonds, the overall quality
of the bonds remaining in the Trust's portfolio will tend to diminish. The
Sponsor is empowered, but not obligated, to direct the Trustee to dispose of
bonds in the event of an advanced refunding.


The Sponsor is required to instruct the Trustee to reject any offer made by
an issuer of any of the bonds to issue new bonds in exchange or substitution
for any bond pursuant to a refunding or refinancing plan, except that the
Sponsor may instruct the Trustee to accept or reject such an offer or to take
any other action with respect thereto as the Sponsor may deem proper if (1) the
issuer is in default with respect to such bond or (2) in the written opinion of
the Sponsor the issuer will probably default with respect to such bond in the
reasonably foreseeable future. Any bond so received in exchange or substitution
will be held by the Trustee subject to the terms and conditions of the Trust
Agreement to the same extent as bonds originally deposited thereunder. Within
five days after the deposit of obligations in exchange or substitution for
underlying bonds, the Trustee is required to give notice thereof to each
Unitholder, identifying the bonds eliminated and the bonds substituted
therefor. Except as stated herein and under "Trust Administration--Replacement
Bonds" in Prospectus Part II regarding the substitution of Replacement Bonds
for Failed Bonds, the acquisition by the Trust of any bonds other than the
bonds initially deposited is not permitted.


If any default in the payment of principal or interest on any bond occurs
and no provision for payment is made therefor either pursuant to the portfolio
insurance, or otherwise, within 30 days, the Trustee is required to notify the
Sponsor thereof. If the Sponsor fails to instruct the Trustee to sell or to
hold such bonds within 30 days after notification by the Trustee to the Sponsor
of such default, the Trustee may in its discretion sell the defaulted bond and
not be liable for any depreciation or loss thereby incurred.

Trustee Information



The Trustee is The Bank of New York Mellon, a trust company organized under
the laws of New York. The Bank of New York Mellon has its principal unit
investment trust division offices at 2 Hanson Place, 12th Floor, Brooklyn, New
York 11217, telephone (800) 856-8487. The Bank of New York Mellon is subject to
supervision and examination by the Superintendent of Banks of the State of New
York and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and its deposits
are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to the extent
permitted by law.


The duties of the Trustee are primarily ministerial in nature. It did not
participate in the selection of bonds for the portfolios of any of the Trusts.
In accordance with the Trust Agreement, the Trustee shall keep proper books of
record and account of all transactions at its office for the Trusts. Such
records shall include the name and address of every Unitholder of the Trusts.
Such books and records shall be open to inspection by any Unitholder at all
reasonable times during the usual business hours. The Trustee shall make such
annual or other reports as may from time to time be required under any
applicable state or Federal statute, rule or regulation. The Trustee is
required to keep a certified copy or duplicate original of the Trust Agreement
on file in its office available for inspection at all reasonable times during
the usual business hours by any Unitholder, together with a current list of the
bonds held in the Trusts.


Under the Trust Agreement, the Trustee or any successor trustee may resign
and be discharged of the trusts created by the Trust Agreement by executing an
instrument in writing and filing the same with the Sponsor. The Trustee or
successor trustee must mail a copy of the notice of resignation to all
Unitholders then of record, not less than 60 days before the date specified in
such notice when such resignation is to take effect. The Sponsor upon receiving
notice of such resignation is obligated to appoint a successor trustee
promptly. If, upon such resignation, no successor trustee has been appointed
and has accepted the appointment within 30 days after notification, the
retiring Trustee may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for the
appointment of a successor. The Sponsor may remove the Trustee and appoint a
successor trustee as provided in the Trust Agreement at any time with or
without cause. Notice of such removal and appointment shall be mailed to each
Unitholder by the Sponsor. Upon execution of a written acceptance of such
appointment by such successor trustee, all the rights, powers, duties and
obligations of the original trustee shall vest in the successor. The
resignation or removal of a Trustee becomes effective only when the successor
trustee accepts its appointment as such or when a court of competent
jurisdiction appoints a successor trustee. Any corporation into which a Trustee
may be merged or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation
resulting from any merger or consolidation to which a Trustee shall be a party,
shall be the successor trustee. The Trustee must be a banking corporation
organized under the laws of the United States or any state and having at all
times an aggregate capital, surplus and undivided profits of not less than
$5,000,000.



Termination of the Trust Agreement



A Trust may be terminated at any time by consent of Unitholders representing
51% of the Units of the Trust then outstanding (or, with respect to Van Kampen
Unit Trusts, Taxable Income Series 119 and subsequent series, by consent of
Unitholders representing 75% of the Units of the Trust then outstanding, and
with respect to a GNMA Income Portfolio, by consent of Unitholders of 66 2/3% of
the Units then outstanding) or by the Trustee when the value of the Trust, as
shown by any semi-annual evaluation, is less than 20% (40% in the case of a GNMA
Income Portfolio) of the original principal amount of bonds.


A Trust will be liquidated by the Trustee in the event that a sufficient
number of Units not yet sold are tendered for redemption by the Underwriters,
including the Sponsor, so that the net worth of the Trust would be reduced to
less than 40% of the initial principal amount of the Trust. If the Trust is
liquidated because of the redemption of unsold Units by the Underwriters, the
Sponsor will refund to each purchaser of Units the entire sales charge paid by
such purchaser.


The Trust Agreement provides that the Trust shall terminate upon the
redemption, sale or other disposition of the last bond held in the Trust, but in
no event shall it continue beyond the end of the year preceding the fiftieth
anniversary of the Trust Agreement (twentieth anniversary for Intermediate Term
Trusts and Variable Rate Trusts). In the event of termination of the Trust,
written notice thereof will be sent by the Trustee to each Unitholder of the
Trust at his address appearing on the registration books of the Trust maintained
by the Trustee. Within a reasonable time thereafter the Trustee shall liquidate
any bonds then held in the Trust and shall deduct from the funds of the Trust
any accrued costs, expenses or indemnities provided by the Trust Agreement,
including estimated compensation of the Trustee and costs of liquidation and any
amounts required as a reserve to provide for payment of any applicable taxes or
other governmental charges. The sale of bonds in the Trust upon termination may
result in a lower amount than might otherwise be realized if such sale were not
required at such time. For this reason, among others, the amount realized by a
Unitholder upon termination may be less than the principal amount or par amount
of bonds represented by the Units held by such Unitholder. The Trustee shall
then distribute to each Unitholder his share of the balance of the Interest and
Principal Accounts. With such distribution the Unitholders shall be furnished a
final distribution statement of the amount distributable. At such time as the
Trustee in its sole discretion shall determine that any amounts held in reserve
are no longer necessary, it shall make distribution thereof to Unitholders in
the same manner.



Description of Ratings



Standard & Poor's, A Division of the McGraw-Hill Companies. A Standard &
Poor's long-term debt obligation credit rating is a current opinion of the
creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific debt obligation. This
opinion of creditworthiness may take into consideration the creditworthiness of
guarantors, insurers or other forms of credit enhancement on the obligation.


The long-term debt obligation credit ratings are not a recommendation to
purchase, sell or hold the debt obligation, inasmuch as they do not comment as
to market price or suitability for a particular investor.


The long-term debt obligation credit ratings are based on current
information furnished by the obligor or obtained by Standard & Poor's from
other sources it considers reliable. Standard & Poor's does not perform an
audit in connection with any credit rating and may, on occasion, rely on
unaudited financial information. Credit ratings may be changed, suspended or
withdrawn as a result of changes in, or unavailability of, such information, or
based on other circumstances.


The long-term debt obligation credit ratings are based, in varying degrees,
on the following considerations:


I.   Likelihood of payment--capacity and willingness of the obligor to meet
its financial commitment on an obligation in accordance with the terms
of the obligation.


II.  Nature of and provisions of the obligation.


III. Protection afforded by, and relative position of, the obligation in
the event of bankruptcy, reorganization or other arrangement under the
laws of bankruptcy and other laws affecting creditors' rights.


The credit rating definitions are expressed in terms of default risk. As
such, they pertain to senior obligations of an entity. Junior obligations are
typically rated lower than senior obligations to reflect the lower priority in
bankruptcy, as noted above. (Such differentiation applies when an entity has
both senior and subordinate obligations, secured and unsecured obligations or
operating company and holding company obligations.) Accordingly, in the case of
junior debt, the rating may not conform exactly with the category definition.


AAA--An obligation rated "AAA" has the highest rating assigned by Standard &
Poor's. The obligor's capacity to meet its financial commitment on the
obligation is extremely strong.


AA--An obligation rated "AA" differs from the highest-rated obligations only
in small degree. The obligor's capacity to meet its financial commitment on the
obligation is very strong.


A--An obligation rated "A" is somewhat more susceptible to adverse effects
of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than obligations in
higher-rated categories. However, the obligor's capacity to meet its financial
commitment on the obligation is still strong.


BBB--An obligation rated "BBB" exhibits adequate protection parameters.
However, adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely
to lead to a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial commitment
on the obligation.


Obligations rated "BB," "B," "CCC," "CC" and "C" are regarded as having
significant speculative characteristics. "BB" indicates the least degree of
speculation and "C" the highest. While such obligations will likely have some
quality and protective characteristics, these may be outweighed by large
uncertainties or major exposures to adverse conditions.


Plus (+) or Minus (-): The ratings from "AA" to "CCC" may be modified by the
addition of a plus or minus sign to show relative standing within the major
rating categories. r--This symbol is attached to the ratings of instruments
with significant non-credit risks. It highlights risks to principal or
volatility of expected returns which are not addressed in the credit rating.


NR--This indicates that no rating has been requested, that there is
insufficient information on which to base a rating or that Standard & Poor's
does not rate a particular obligation as a matter of policy.


Moody's Investors Service. Municipal long-term rating scale. Moody's
municipal ratings are opinions of the investment quality of issuers and issues
in the US municipal and tax-exempt markets. As such, these ratings incorporate
Moody's assessment of the default probability and loss severity of these
issuers and issues. The default and loss content for Moody's municipal
long-term rating scale differs from Moody's general long-term rating scale.


Municipal ratings are based upon the analysis of five primary factors
relating to municipal finance: market position, financial position, debt
levels, governance, and covenants. Each of the factors is evaluated
individually and for its effect on the other factors in the context of the
municipality's ability to repay its debt.


Aaa--Issuers or issues rated Aaa demonstrate the strongest creditworthiness
relative to other US municipal or tax-exempt issuers or issues.


Aa--Issuers or issues rated Aa demonstrate very strong creditworthiness
relative to other US municipal or tax-exempt issuers or issues.


A--Issuers or issues rated A present above-average creditworthiness relative
to other US municipal or tax-exempt issuers or issues.


Baa--Issuers or issues rated Baa represent average creditworthiness relative
to other US municipal or tax-exempt issuers or issues.


Obligations rated "Ba," "B," "Caa," "Ca" and "C" are regarded as having
significant speculative characteristics. "Ba" indicates the least degree of
speculation and "C" the highest. While such obligations will likely have some
quality and protective characteristics, these may be outweighed by large
uncertainties or major exposures to adverse conditions.


Note: Moody's appends numerical modifiers 1, 2, and 3 to each generic rating
category from Aa through Caa. The modifier 1 indicates that the issuer or
obligation ranks in the higher end of its generic rating category; the modifier
2 indicates a mid-range ranking; and the modifier 3 indicates a ranking in the
lower end of that generic rating category.


General long-term rating scale. Moody's long-term obligation ratings are
opinions of the relative credit risk of fixed-income obligations with an
original maturity of one year or more. They address the possibility that a
financial obligation will not be honored as promised. Such ratings reflect both
the likelihood of default and any financial loss suffered in the event of
default.


Aaa--Obligations rated Aaa are judged to be of the highest quality, with
minimal credit risk.


Aa--Obligations rated Aa are judged to be of high quality and are subject to
very low credit risk.


A--Obligations rated A are considered upper-medium grade and are subject to
low credit risk.


Baa--Obligations rated Baa are subject to moderate credit risk. They are
considered medium-grade and as such may possess certain speculative
characteristics.


Obligations rated "Ba," "B," "Caa," "Ca" and "C" are regarded as having
significant speculative characteristics. "Ba" indicates the least degree of
speculation and "C" the highest. While such obligations will likely have some
quality and protective characteristics, these may be outweighed by large
uncertainties or major exposures to adverse conditions.


Note: Moody's appends numerical modifiers 1, 2, and 3 to each generic rating
category from Aa through Caa. The modifier 1 indicates that the issuer or
obligation ranks in the higher end of its generic rating category; the modifier
2 indicates a mid-range ranking; and the modifier 3 indicates a ranking in the
lower end of that generic rating category.
