Net interest income was $25,232,000 compared to $23,950,000 for the same period a year ago. The increase reflected ongoing growth in the company's loan portfolio and higher interest rates on earning assets, net of the impact of a recent rise in funding costs, primarily in the form of higher deposit rates. Net income before income tax expense was $14,961,000 compared to $13,785,000 for the same period a year ago. Net income was $10,602,000 compared to $10,109,000 for the same period a year ago.

Annualized return on average equity was 13.12% compared to 13.53% for the same period a year ago. The company's performance for the second quarter of 2017 reflected several positive factors, including: The continued positive effect of solid loan growth over the past 12 months, which has increased the company's loan portfolio more than 6% year over year; credit quality that remains at historically strong levels; significant growth in fee income, driven by the Wealth Management and Trust Group; and solid returns on average assets and equity. 

For the six months, the company's total interest income was $53,646,000 compared to $49,862,000 for the same period a year ago. Net interest income was $50,416,000 compared to $47,419,000 for the same period a year ago.
