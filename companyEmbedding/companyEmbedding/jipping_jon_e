How the BuildZoom Score works








Follow this contractor

















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Michigan:













Does Jipping, Jon E carry a valid contracting license?



Michigan requires contractors performing any work on residential properties to be licensed with the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs. 
Jipping, Jon E currently holds license 6201039147 (Professional Engineer), which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Michigan?



Contractors in Michigan must complete a 60 hour approved prelicensure education class prior to taking a buisness and law exam. Contractors are required to take continuing education upon renewal of an active license. 











Your liability risk when hiring Jipping, Jon E



Michigan requires licensed contractors to carry an active workers' compensation policy. Although general liability insurance is not required under Michigan state law, it is always advisable to hire contractors who carry it. Request copies of the certificates for both forms of insurance for your records. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Michigan, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner, choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.

7.

hereunder may be terminated by either party at any time and for any
reason, subject to the applicable provisions of this Section 7;

further , that the Employer will be required to give
Executive at least ten (10) business days advance notice of a

Employer provides Executive with a payment equal to the Base Salary
that would otherwise be payable in respect of any portion of the
Employer Notice Period which the Employer elects to waive. 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement (and except
as may otherwise be provided in the Equity Documents), the
provisions of this Section 7 shall exclusively govern
Executive’s rights upon termination of employment with the
Employer.

resignation without Good Reason.

continued failure substantially to perform Executive’s duties
hereunder (other than as a result of total or partial incapacity
due to physical or mental illness) for a period of 10 days
following written notice by the Employer to Executive of such
failure, (B) dishonesty in the performance of Executive’s
duties hereunder, (C) Executive’s conviction of, or plea of
nolo contendere to a crime constituting (x) a felony

willful malfeasance or willful misconduct in connection with
Executive’s duties hereunder or any act or omission which is

Employer or affiliates or (E) Executive’s breach of the
provisions of Sections 8 or 9 of this Agreement.

 

(iii)       
If Executive’s employment is
terminated by the Employer for Cause or if Executive resigns
without Good Reason (other than due to a Disability, as such term
is defined below), Executive shall be entitled to
receive:

 

(A)                               
any Base Salary earned through the
date of termination,
 
3 






 

payable at such time(s) as the Base
Salary would otherwise be payable in accordance with the normal
payroll practices of the Employer;
 

(B)                               
any Annual Bonus earned but unpaid
as of the date of termination for any previously completed fiscal
year, payable in a lump sum at such time as such Annual Bonus would
normally be paid under the Incentive Plan as provided in Section 4
hereof;

 

(C)                               
reimbursement for any unreimbursed
business expenses properly incurred by Executive through the date
of termination, payable at such time(s) and in accordance with the
Employer’s policy prior to the date of Executive’s
termination; provided that such reimbursement shall in any event
occur no later than ninety (90) days after the date on which an
eligible business expense is incurred; and

 

(D)                               
such Employee Benefits, if any, as
to which Executive may be entitled under the applicable ITC Plans
upon termination of employment hereunder.

 

The payments and benefits described
in clauses (A) through (D) hereof are referred to, collectively, as
the “ Accrued Rights ”.

 
Following such termination of Executive’s
employment by the Employer for Cause or resignation by Executive
without Good Reason, except as set forth in this Section 7(a)(iii),
Executive shall have no further rights to any compensation or any
other benefits under this Agreement.
 

b.                                      
Disability or Death
.

 

(i)             
Executive’s employment
hereunder shall terminate upon Executive’s death, and may be
terminated by the Employer if Executive experiences a “
Disability ” (as such term shall be defined from time
to time under Code Section 409A).  Any question as to the
existence of the Disability of Executive as to which Executive and
the Employer cannot agree shall be determined in writing by a
qualified independent physician mutually acceptable to Executive
and the Employer.  If Executive and the Employer cannot agree
as to a qualified independent physician, each shall appoint such a
physician and those two physicians shall select a third who shall
make such determination in writing.  The determination of
Disability made in writing to the Employer and Executive shall be
final and conclusive for all purposes of the Agreement.

 

(ii)          
Upon termination of
Executive’s employment hereunder for Disability or death,
Executive, Executive’s then spouse, or Executive’s
estate (as the case may be), shall be entitled to

the Accrued Rights; and

 

(B)                               
a pro rata portion of the Target
Bonus (calculated based on the number of days Executive was
employed hereunder during the calendar
 
4 






 

year in which the date of such
termination of employment occurs, relative to the applicable full
calendar year), payable in a lump sum within fifteen (15) business
days after the date of such termination of employment.
 
Following Executive’s termination of
employment due to death or Disability, except as set forth in this
Section 7(b)(ii), Executive shall have no further rights to any
compensation or any other benefits under this Agreement.
 

c.                                       
By the Employer Without Cause or
by Executive Resignation for Good Reason .

 

(i)             
Executive’s employment
hereunder may be terminated (A) by the Employer without Cause
(which shall not include Executive’s termination of
employment due to death or Disability), or (B) or by Executive for
Good Reason (as defined below).

 

(ii)          
For purposes of this Agreement,
“ Good Reason ” shall mean (A) a greater than
10% reduction in the total value of Executive’s Base Salary,
Target Bonus, and Employee Benefits, or (B) Executive’s job
responsibility and authority are substantially diminished; and
provided, further, that “ Good Reason ” shall
cease to exist for an event unless:

 

(C)                         
no later than the 60
th  day following the initial existence of
such Good Reason condition, Executive has given the Employer
written notice thereof ;

 

(D)                         
the Employer is afforded a period of
thirty (30) days to remedy the condition; and

 

(E)                          
in the absence of any such remedy,
the Executive terminates employment within one hundred eighty (180)
days following the end of the cure period described in (D)
above.

 

(iii)  If Executive’s
employment is terminated by the Employer without Cause (other than
by reason of Executive’s death or Disability) or by Executive
for Good Reason, subject to Executive’s execution of a
release of all claims against Employer as provided in Section
7(e)(ii), Executive shall be entitled to receive:

 

(A)                               
the Accrued Rights;

 

(B)                               
a pro rata portion of the Target
Bonus (calculated based on the number of days Executive was
employed hereunder during the calendar year in which the date of
such termination of employment occurs, relative to the applicable
full calendar year), payable based upon the Employer’s actual
achievement of the performance targets for such year as determined
under and at the time that such an Annual Bonus (if any) would
normally be paid as set forth in Section 4 hereof;

 

(C)                               
one or both of the following series
of payments:
 
5 






 

(I) continued payment in
substantially equal installments and in accordance with the normal
payroll practices of Employer, for a period of two (2) years
following the date of termination of Executive’s employment
hereunder (the “ Severance Period ”), of
Executive’s annual rate of Base Salary as in effect
immediately prior to such termination; and

 

(II) in the event that
Executive’s employment is terminated hereunder within a
period beginning six (6) months before and ending two (2) years
after a Change in Control occurs, Executive shall receive the
following additional amount: an amount equal to two (2) times the
average of each of the Annual Bonuses that were payable to
Executive (including any portion of any such Annual Bonus the
receipt of which Executive elected to defer) for the three fiscal
years immediately preceding the fiscal year in which
Executive’s employment terminates, payable in substantially
equal installments and in accordance with the normal payroll
practices of Employer, over the period during which the
Executive’s Base Salary will continue to be paid pursuant to
the foregoing provisions of this Section 7(c)(iii)(C) (or, if
applicable, over the remaining period during which such Base Salary
payments will be made, in the event the Executive’s
termination occurs within the six (6) month period before any such
Change in Control occurs, beginning with the first payment due
thirty (30) days after the Change in Control occurs);

 

(D)                                         
continued provision of those
applicable Employee Benefits that are medical, dental and vision
benefits which are required to be made available by the Employer
pursuant to the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act
(“ COBRA ”); provided that all applicable COBRA
coverage rules must be followed by Executive in order to continue
such coverage(s) (including Executive’s timely payment of the
entire applicable COBRA premium to the Plan Administrator), or the
coverage(s) will be terminated.  The Employer agrees to
reimburse Executive for a portion of his applicable COBRA premium
costs during that period ending on the earlier of (I) the date
Executive is eligible (even if he does not enroll) for coverage
under another employer-sponsored group health plan in connection
with other employment obtained after Executive’s termination
hereunder; or (II) eighteen (18) months after the date of
termination of Executive’s employment hereunder.  The
Employer’s COBRA reimbursement amount shall be paid to
Executive each payroll period (in accordance with the normal
payroll practices of Employer, but subject to any applicable
limitations on payments to a “specified employee”
within the meaning of Code Section 409A, as set forth below) as a
taxable amount equal to the sum of (III) the Employer’s
portion of the premium payments due with
 
6 






 

respect to other executives with the
same coverage(s) for such payroll period, plus (IV) such additional
amount as is required to pay any income and/or payroll taxes due on
the sum of the premium payment and the additional tax gross-up
payment (as determined by the Employer’s independent
accountants, assuming that the Executive pays income taxes at the
highest applicable marginal rates for the calendar year in which
such payments are to be made);

 

(E)                                          
outplacement services of a duration
of up to two (2) years from the date of termination (or until such
earlier date on which Executive obtains other employment), and at a
level commensurate with Executive’s former position with the
Employer, and by a provider as determined by the Employer in good
faith; and

 

(F)                                           
in addition to the benefits provided
under subsection (D) above, in the event that, if Executive had
remained employed with the Employer through the end of the
Severance Period, Executive would have satisfied the age and
service requirements for benefit eligibility under the
International Transmission Company Postretirement Welfare Plan (as
in effect from time to time), at the end of the Severance Period
Executive shall be deemed to have satisfied such requirements, and
shall, at such time be entitled to receive benefits under such plan
on the same terms and conditions as all other plan participants who
actually satisfy such requirements.

 

Notwithstanding anything set forth
in the preceding paragraph, if the Company terminates the
International Transmission Company Postretirement Welfare Plan (and
does not replace it with any successor plan that provides retiree
welfare benefits that are non-taxable and comparable to those
provided under the International Transmission Company
Postretirement Welfare Plan (“ Retiree Benefits
”)) either (x) prior to an event giving rise to the
Employer’s obligations under the preceding paragraph or (y)
at any time after such event and, at such time, by operation of the
preceding paragraph Executive would otherwise be eligible to
receive the benefits provided therein (the “ Plan
Termination Date ”), then , in satisfaction of all
obligations the Employer would otherwise have under the preceding
paragraph, the Employer shall at the earliest time on or after the
Plan Termination Date that the Executive is eligible to receive the
Retiree Benefits (the “ Benefit Eligibility Date
”), either (I) establish and maintain a plan for the purpose
of providing Executive with non-taxable Retiree Benefits or
otherwise purchase individual insurance policies to provide the
Retiree Benefits, for so long as the Employer would otherwise be
required to provide benefits under the preceding paragraph, or (II)
if, and to the extent, the Employer is not permitted by applicable
regulations to establish such a plan for Executive or cannot
otherwise purchase individual insurance policies to provide such
coverage for Executive, pay Executive in cash a lump sum amount
equal to the Employer’s cost of otherwise providing the
Retiree Benefits that cannot be so provided, the amount of which
shall be determined by an enrolled actuary retained by the Employer
for such purpose.  If a lump sum payment is due to Executive
pursuant to clause (II) of the preceding sentence, such
 
7 






 

payment will be made within two and
a half (2-1/2) months after the Executive’s Benefit
Eligibility Date (or, if later, on such other earliest date on
which amounts can be paid as may be required so as not to incur any
penalties under Code Section 409A).
 
The foregoing notwithstanding, in the event
Executive is a “specified employee” within the meaning
of Code Section 409A and in accordance with the involuntary
“separation pay plan” exception under the Code Section
409A regulations, the total of all amounts paid to Executive
pursuant to Sections 7(c)(iii)(C) and (D) hereof (and any other
amount payable pursuant to this Section 7(c)(iii) that constitutes
a payment under a “nonqualified deferred compensation
plan” within the meaning of Code Section 409A) within the
first six (6) months following such termination pursuant to this
subsection shall not exceed two times the lesser of (I) the sum of
the Executive’s annualized compensation based upon the annual
rate of pay for services provided to the Employer for the calendar
year preceding the calendar year in which the termination occurs
(adjusted for any increase during that year that was expected to
continue indefinitely, if the Executive had not terminated), or
(II) the Code Section 401(a)(17) limit on compensation for the
calendar year in which the Executive terminates.  To the
extent a portion of any such amount exceeds such limitation, the
payment shall not commence until the first business day following
the date that is six months after the date of termination of
Executive’s employment hereunder (the period during which
such payments may be limited under Code Section 409A, the “
409A Period ”), at which time Employer shall (III) pay
to Executive, in one lump sum, an amount equal to all such amounts
that would otherwise have been payable during the 409A Period, and
(IV) thereafter continue to pay the remaining unpaid portion of any
such amounts in accordance with the normal payroll practices of
Employer, at the time or through the end of the period(s) otherwise
provided above in this subsection.
 
Following Executive’s termination of
employment by the Employer without Cause (other than by reason of
Executive’s death or Disability) or by Executive for Good
Reason, except as set forth in this Section 7(c)(iii), Executive
shall have no further rights to any compensation or any other
benefits under this Agreement.
 

d.                                      
Notice of Termination
.  Any purported termination of
employment by the Employer or by Executive (other than due to
Executive’s death) shall be communicated by written Notice of
Termination to the other party hereto in accordance with Section
12(h) hereof.  For purposes of this Agreement, a “
Notice of Termination ” shall mean a notice which
shall indicate the specific termination provision in this Agreement
relied upon and shall set forth in reasonable detail the facts and
circumstances claimed to provide a basis for termination of
employment under the provision so indicated.

 

e.                                       
Board/Committee Resignation;
Execution of Release of all Claims .

 

(i)             
Upon termination of
Executive’s employment for any reason, Executive agrees to
resign, as of the date of such termination and to the extent
applicable, from the Board (and any committees thereof) and the
board of directors (and any committees thereof) of any of the
Company’s affiliates.

 

(ii)          
Upon termination of
Executive’s employment for any reason, Executive agrees to
execute a release (the “ Release ”) of all
claims against the Company, its subsidiaries,
 
8 





 
affiliates, shareholders, directors, officers,
employees, and agents, substantially in a form to be provided to
Executive by Employer at such time.  Notwithstanding anything
set forth in this Agreement to the contrary, upon termination of
Executive’s employment for any reason, Executive shall not
receive any payme

An employment agreement is a document which delineates the terms of the relationship between an employer and employee. If you are hiring a new employee, this document can help form a solid foundation for your business relationship. The document will specify expectations for both parties and may include items such as terms of conduct, employee benefits, vacation time, medical leave, hours, and other issues that may be up for consideration, depending on the business' needs.

An employment agreement might also incorporate arbitration conditions, confidentiality terms and non-compete clauses, provided that separate documents do not address these issues. Some employers may include a progressive disciplinary policy section in the agreement, wherein conditions and repercussions for employee misconduct are explained.

Once signed, an employment agreement is a legally binding contract that can be enforced in a court of law. Often an employer or company makes their offer of employment contingent on an employee signing the agreement.
