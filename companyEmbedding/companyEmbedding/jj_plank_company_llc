	JJ Plank - News Details -> J.J. Plank Corporation Strengthened by Xerium Acquisition, Advances Strategy In High-Growth Market Segments
































 Xerium has acquired J.J. Plank, maker of Spencer Johnston Spreader Rolls.














































« RETURN TO NEWSSHAREMay13J.J. Plank Corporation Strengthened by Xerium Acquisition, Advances Strategy In High-Growth Market SegmentsPosted on May 13th, 2016NEENAH, WI – J.J. Plank Corporation, its Spencer Johnston brand spreader roll line, and related family of product lines has been acquired by Xerium Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:XRM), a leading global provider of industrial consumable products and services, for $18 million, comprised of $16.25 million in cash at closing, and the rest in future obligations. Xerium proudly serves a multitude of diverse industries including fiber and stock processing, nonwoven fabrics, and building products, as well as pulp, paper, paperboard, and tissue. The addition of J.J. Plank’s product lines will add strength and diversity to Xerium’s products, customers, and markets served. The combined company now has the broadest set of capabilities in the world with respect to spreader rolls, dandy rolls, and tissue embossing rolls.The transaction furthers strategic plans to expand into product categories with the strongest growth opportunities. Through the acquisition, Xerium and J.J. Plank are expanding current product offerings and service capabilities and markets served, while strengthening financial profiles and growing their customer base.    Harold Bevis, President and CEO of Xerium Technologies, Inc., said, “Incorporating Spencer Johnston’s and the other divisions' strengths in spreader rolls, dandy rolls, and tissue embossing rolls with our existing portfolio of products is a strategically and financially compelling advancement opportunity. J.J. Plank product lines will strengthen our product and service offerings, add new customers to our roster, and accelerate revenue diversification. Importantly, this acquisition furthers the company’s strategy of realigning our market presence and future sales opportunities by onboarding existing customer references and special-purpose manufacturing assets.”  Bevis continued, “The acquisition is expected to produce post-synergy Adjusted EBITDA of $6 million, which will bolster the company’s de-leveraging efforts and immediately improve Xerium’s leverage ratios on a pro-forma basis.”   Spencer Johnston and the other J.J. Plank divisions generated 2015 revenue of $18.5 million, and are expected to be immediately accretive. Including integration and synergies, Xerium expects the acquisition to provide an Adjusted EBITDA contribution in 2016 of $2 to $3 million, excluding transaction-related costs. When fully integrated, EBITDA contribution is expected to be $6 million annually, assuming no unexpected changes to market conditions.

Moonstone Click to Close Click to OpenSPEC - Moonstone Epoxy/Teflon Roll Covering Compound is a superior compound of a finely woven mat impregnated with a unique composition of epoxy and Teflon.  The material is applied directly to your roll core under heat and high tension without the need for any bonding agent or adhesive.  The material is then thermally cured at temperatures up to 350° F (177° C).  This combination of the wrapping process and the curing cycle results in a hard, durable, corrosion-free covering which is stiff, but lightweight and long-wearing.  As machine speeds and wire/fabric tensions increase, many papermakers have discovered that traditional rubber covers deteriorate resulting in reduced forming fabric life.  MOONSTONE’s special formulation, combining epoxy and Teflon, results in a bone-hard cover exhibiting exceptional “non-stick” characteristics even in the harsh wet end atmosphere.Reel Tuff Click to Close Click to OpenSPEC- Reel Tuff Anti-Static Roll Covering Compound has the same outstanding properties as our Jadestone™ Roll Covering Compound, which is used throughout the Paper Machine – wet end or dry end.  The unique difference is that our REEL TUFF Roll Cover performs as an electrical conductor.  The REEL TUFF Covering Compound is a unique composition, combining extremely high tensile and compressive strengths with a superior bonding capability.  These covers are applied directly to your reel spools and roll cores without the need for a bonding agent and the problems associated with them.  The covering cannot separate from the core, crack, break, fray or expose jagged edges on the surface of the roll.  SPEC - REEL TUFF will eliminate all safety problems related to the discharge of static electricity due to high speeds in dry environments.JadeStone Click to Close Click to OpenSPEC - Jadestone™ epoxy composite material is a superior composition of a finely woven mat impregnated with epoxy resin.  Our curing process incorporates temperatures above 350°F.  This combination provides a hard, durable, corrosion-free roll covering, which is lightweight and long wearing.  Jadestone™ is one-half as light as aluminum, nearly as hard as chilled iron, three times as durable as hard rubber and will polish to a 15 RMS micro finish.  Jadestone™ epoxy composite has a finer finish than ‘fiberglass’ roll coverings and will not break, fray or separate and it helps increase the stiffness of the roll body, thus reducing deflection.Sheraton Click to Close Click to OpenThe papermaker has long recognized that a 4-5 Hz shake applied throughout the forming section of slow speed paper machines (i.e., less than 200 FPM or 60 m/min) is perhaps the most favorable environment available for producing uniform, quality papers.  This situation exists because such a shake creates an almost continuous oscillating CD shear or fine-scale turbulence throughout the forming zone.

However, few paper machines run this slow any longer.  When a comparable shake is applied to a high speed machine, like one running at 2000 FPM, it introduces a fresh CD pulse into the stock only once every 3-4 feet of travel down the machine, thereby losing most of its effectiveness.

So few machines today running over 1000 FPM employ a shake.  Instead, they depend on a number of other devices, primarily free-draining and vacuum-augmented foils to maintain stock dispersed throughout the forming zone.  These devices have never been as effective as a 5 Hz shake on a 200 FPM machine.Manufacturing Click to Close Click to OpenBadger Roll & Machine is committed to helping you, along with our many years of experience, with all types of roll manufacturing.  This includes bearing diameter repairs, re-journaling, manufacturing new complete and machining capabilities, associated to breakdown situations related to the paper, textile, converting and other heavy industries, makes us your number one choice.  Our friendly experienced staff is always ready to help serve your needs.Balancing Click to Close Click to OpenWe are proud to announce the final installation of our new American Hofmann Balancing Machine.  The following is for your review of the machine capacities.
