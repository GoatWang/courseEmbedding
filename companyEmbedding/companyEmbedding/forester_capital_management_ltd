Thomas H. Forester (born December 15, 1958)[1] is an American mutual fund manager. He was the only long-focused United States stock mutual fund manager to make a profit in 2008.[2][3][4] He had previously been the highest return mutual fund manager of the 6000 tracked by Morningstar and one of only two managers to turn a profit for the third quarter of 2002.[5] He had also previously been number one in his asset class year to date through November 1, 2004, although controversially.[6]
Forester is a value investor who makes financial decisions based on financial statistics such as price/earnings ratio.[4] His fund focuses on large cap stocks.[7] He has been a contrarian investor for many years.[8] Like many value investors, he is a more of a portfolio investor than a short-term trader.[9]

Background[edit]
Forester grew up in Illinois,[3] where he helped his father manage an investment portfolio through the turbulent 1970s.[10] He started his career as a money manager in 1992 assisting in the management of a US$50 million fund for Sir John Templeton. He later worked for Wells Fargo & Co. in Minneapolis, Minnesota and Scudder Investments in New York City. In 1998, he experienced a losing investment in sub-prime lenders.[3] Forester moved to Libertyville, Illinois, a northern suburb of Chicago, in 1998 when he purchased a home in the town.[11] In 1999, he started his own large cap value fund with $100,000 of his own money.[3][7] Although he was in cash during the dot-com bubble, which proved to be profitable for a while, he trailed the S&P 500 by 28% in 2003. He also trailed the market from 2005–2007.[3]
His wife, Kaye, with whom he is raising two children, had been encouraging him to close his business prior to 2008. In October 2007, they agreed that he would close the business if he was not beating the S&P 500 by 10% by March. Although he only led the market by 9.5% his wife agreed to allow him to keep the business going. After his fund took first place for year-to-date returns in the summer, he put 30% in cash. Although, he is not repeating his success in 2009, his fund is receiving large cash contributions.[3]
Forester has been involved in civic duties in Libertyville and national political efforts. As of 2004, he was a trustee of the Cook Memorial Library District.[12] In 2004, he attempted to run on a Republican slate of delegates for United States President George W. Bush.[12] However, due to an insufficient number of signatures on the slate's petition, they were removed from the ballot.[13] He was unsuccessful in his election to the Cook Memorial Library District Board in during the 2005 municipal elections.[14][15]
Forester Value Fund[edit]
In 2004, the fund was subject of controversy when Morningstar attempted to reclassify it into the conservative-allocation fund category. Mutual fund managers, including Forester, believed that the fund belonged in another classification such as a large-cap value fund, which is how Lipper had it classified. Value Line Inc. classified it as an income fund at the time. The move bumped Alpha Hedged Strategies Fund out of first place for its classification year to date as of November 1, 2004. The controversy not only led to complaints directly to Morningstar, but also to the Securities Exchange Commission.[6]
In 2008, there were 8200 diversified United States stock mutual funds, and they averaged a negative 39% rate of return.[3] 1,700 of these funds have been in existence for over three years and have assets of at least $50 million.[7] Forester's Forester Value Fund (FVALX), which is Morningstar five-star-rated,[16] gained .4% in 2008 although one year it lagged the Standard & Poor's 500 (S&P 500) by 30%.[3] The fund, which had been up 7% through June 30 by avoiding the housing crisis and the credit crisis,[17] was down 4.3% on the year through December 15 and 0.82% on the year entering the last day of trading.[16][18] In 2008, the second best of the 1,700 funds was Mario Gabelli's Gabelli ABC Fund, which lost only 2.6%.[7] Morningstar tracks a total of 9,918 mutual funds that averaged a 39.1% loss in 2008.[19] Much of Forester's success was attributable to large cash positions.[3] However, he also benefited from several timely trades in the banking sector, health care.[3][4] His fund held positions in countercyclical stocks that perform well in recessions. He had also held large cash positions during the dot-com bubble.[3] In the third quarter of 2002, his fund was one of two out of 6000 that turned a profit.[5] One of the most important financial ratios for Forest was the ratio of home prices to incomes, which helped him foresee trouble in the housing market.[20]
He has had very inconsistent returns managing his fund. During the last seven years, his fund has been in the top 20% of its peer group three times and in the bottom 10% four times. Over the past three years, the fund has nearly broken even.[18] Forester's fund has a 1.35 expense ratio.[21] Through 2008, the fund had a five-year total return of 25%.[22] His fund's three-year and five-year averages are 9% and 7.5% ahead of the market.[23] He is a low P/E investor who buys with full market cycle investing in mind.[24]
Forester in the media[edit]
Suddenly, during and after his 2008 market success, Forester, who runs his fund from Libertyville,[25] became a celebrity. He made his first television appearance in December and newspapers from as far away as Chile's El Mercurio have requested interviews with him.[3] In an interview with The Wall Street Journal Forester conceded that because his fund is smaller than many of his peers, he is able to get in and out of portfolio positions faster than others and that his returns would have been much lower if he had been managing a larger portfolio.[7] However, he said his success at beating the market was more attributable to his financial market assessments than his fund's size.[20] Because of the publicity his fund has been receiving in the down market its assets under management grew fivefold during 2008.[16]
Due to Forester's investing style of buying low P/E stocks with good earnings prospects, he is compared to Warren Buffett.[26] Forester loosely quotes Buffett at times such as in Barron's Magazine when he said: "It's When The Tide Goes out that you find out who's swimming without a bathing suit. I have mine on."[19] Although he is now likened to Buffett, Forester maintains Templeton as his role model. He invests by the philosophy credo that "I buy undervalued stocks, and if there are none, I go to cash."[5]

Thomas H. Forester (born December 15, 1958)[1] is an American mutual fund manager. He was the only long-focused United States stock mutual fund manager to make a profit in 2008.[2][3][4] He had previously been the highest return mutual fund manager of the 6000 tracked by Morningstar and one of only two managers to turn a profit for the third quarter of 2002.[5] He had also previously been number one in his asset class year to date through November 1, 2004, although controversially.[6]
Forester is a value investor who makes financial decisions based on financial statistics such as price/earnings ratio.[4] His fund focuses on large cap stocks.[7] He has been a contrarian investor for many years.[8] Like many value investors, he is a more of a portfolio investor than a short-term trader.[9]

Background[edit]
Forester grew up in Illinois,[3] where he helped his father manage an investment portfolio through the turbulent 1970s.[10] He started his career as a money manager in 1992 assisting in the management of a US$50 million fund for Sir John Templeton. He later worked for Wells Fargo & Co. in Minneapolis, Minnesota and Scudder Investments in New York City. In 1998, he experienced a losing investment in sub-prime lenders.[3] Forester moved to Libertyville, Illinois, a northern suburb of Chicago, in 1998 when he purchased a home in the town.[11] In 1999, he started his own large cap value fund with $100,000 of his own money.[3][7] Although he was in cash during the dot-com bubble, which proved to be profitable for a while, he trailed the S&P 500 by 28% in 2003. He also trailed the market from 2005–2007.[3]
His wife, Kaye, with whom he is raising two children, had been encouraging him to close his business prior to 2008. In October 2007, they agreed that he would close the business if he was not beating the S&P 500 by 10% by March. Although he only led the market by 9.5% his wife agreed to allow him to keep the business going. After his fund took first place for year-to-date returns in the summer, he put 30% in cash. Although, he is not repeating his success in 2009, his fund is receiving large cash contributions.[3]
Forester has been involved in civic duties in Libertyville and national political efforts. As of 2004, he was a trustee of the Cook Memorial Library District.[12] In 2004, he attempted to run on a Republican slate of delegates for United States President George W. Bush.[12] However, due to an insufficient number of signatures on the slate's petition, they were removed from the ballot.[13] He was unsuccessful in his election to the Cook Memorial Library District Board in during the 2005 municipal elections.[14][15]
Forester Value Fund[edit]
In 2004, the fund was subject of controversy when Morningstar attempted to reclassify it into the conservative-allocation fund category. Mutual fund managers, including Forester, believed that the fund belonged in another classification such as a large-cap value fund, which is how Lipper had it classified. Value Line Inc. classified it as an income fund at the time. The move bumped Alpha Hedged Strategies Fund out of first place for its classification year to date as of November 1, 2004. The controversy not only led to complaints directly to Morningstar, but also to the Securities Exchange Commission.[6]
In 2008, there were 8200 diversified United States stock mutual funds, and they averaged a negative 39% rate of return.[3] 1,700 of these funds have been in existence for over three years and have assets of at least $50 million.[7] Forester's Forester Value Fund (FVALX), which is Morningstar five-star-rated,[16] gained .4% in 2008 although one year it lagged the Standard & Poor's 500 (S&P 500) by 30%.[3] The fund, which had been up 7% through June 30 by avoiding the housing crisis and the credit crisis,[17] was down 4.3% on the year through December 15 and 0.82% on the year entering the last day of trading.[16][18] In 2008, the second best of the 1,700 funds was Mario Gabelli's Gabelli ABC Fund, which lost only 2.6%.[7] Morningstar tracks a total of 9,918 mutual funds that averaged a 39.1% loss in 2008.[19] Much of Forester's success was attributable to large cash positions.[3] However, he also benefited from several timely trades in the banking sector, health care.[3][4] His fund held positions in countercyclical stocks that perform well in recessions. He had also held large cash positions during the dot-com bubble.[3] In the third quarter of 2002, his fund was one of two out of 6000 that turned a profit.[5] One of the most important financial ratios for Forest was the ratio of home prices to incomes, which helped him foresee trouble in the housing market.[20]
He has had very inconsistent returns managing his fund. During the last seven years, his fund has been in the top 20% of its peer group three times and in the bottom 10% four times. Over the past three years, the fund has nearly broken even.[18] Forester's fund has a 1.35 expense ratio.[21] Through 2008, the fund had a five-year total return of 25%.[22] His fund's three-year and five-year averages are 9% and 7.5% ahead of the market.[23] He is a low P/E investor who buys with full market cycle investing in mind.[24]
Forester in the media[edit]
Suddenly, during and after his 2008 market success, Forester, who runs his fund from Libertyville,[25] became a celebrity. He made his first television appearance in December and newspapers from as far away as Chile's El Mercurio have requested interviews with him.[3] In an interview with The Wall Street Journal Forester conceded that because his fund is smaller than many of his peers, he is able to get in and out of portfolio positions faster than others and that his returns would have been much lower if he had been managing a larger portfolio.[7] However, he said his success at beating the market was more attributable to his financial market assessments than his fund's size.[20] Because of the publicity his fund has been receiving in the down market its assets under management grew fivefold during 2008.[16]
Due to Forester's investing style of buying low P/E stocks with good earnings prospects, he is compared to Warren Buffett.[26] Forester loosely quotes Buffett at times such as in Barron's Magazine when he said: "It's When The Tide Goes out that you find out who's swimming without a bathing suit. I have mine on."[19] Although he is now likened to Buffett, Forester maintains Templeton as his role model. He invests by the philosophy credo that "I buy undervalued stocks, and if there are none, I go to cash."[5]

Consensus Ratings for Diageo plc (Diageo - NYSE:DEO) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: No ratings tracked in the last 12 months.Consensus Rating:N/A (Score: NaN)Consensus Price Target: N/A

Our Process
The Forester Value Fund is a diversified, no-load mutual fund for investors  seeking long-term investment returns, with added emphasis on capital protection  in unfavorable market conditions.

                 
Stock Selection

The Fund generally buys stocks with exceptional appreciation potential, due to  the stock's price being significantly below the intrinsic value of the company  – Forester Capital’s estimate of the amount a buyer would pay to own the entire  company. Forester Capital performs its own fundamental analysis of the company. 

                  Forester Capital believes that if it buys more earnings, assets and dividends  with each investment dollar than its benchmark, it should perform well. Thus  the Fund places special focus on companies whose current market prices are low  in relation to: 
                   
Price-to-earnings ratio
Book-to-market value
Price-to-cash flow ratio
Price-to-sales ratio
Earnings estimates for the next 12 months
Five-year return on equity

                      Securities may be undervalued as a result of overreaction by investors to  unfavorable news about a company, industry or the stock markets in general or  as a result of a market decline, poor economic conditions, or actual or  anticipated unfavorable developments affecting the company. This undervaluation  may lead to great appreciation potential for the security.

                      The Fund may sell a stock when Forester Capital thinks the stock is too  expensive compared to Forester Capital’s estimate of the company’s intrinsic  value, changing circumstances affect the original reasons for a company’s  purchase, a company exhibits deteriorating fundamentals or more attractive  alternatives exist.

                      Under normal market conditions, the fund invests at least 65% of its net assets  (at market value at the time of purchase) in the common stocks of large  companies that have market capitalizations greater than $8.0 billion. The Fund  may also invest in preferred stocks, convertible securities, warrants and  foreign securities. The Fund may also invest in stock and stock index futures,  options to buy and sell such futures, mutual funds and exchange traded funds.
                         
Capital Protection

We use risk control to preserve capital and enhance returns by avoiding  over-valued markets. This can be done by buying options, futures or other  instruments, or going to cash to adjust market exposure. The Fund avoided the  down equity market by taking a defensive position, using bonds and cash to  eliminate market exposure from inception through June, 2002. It was in a  similar defensive position from October, 2002 through April, 2004.  The  Fund has also used various levels of cash and index puts to limit downside risk  from 2005 through 2008.

Thomas H. Forester (born December 15, 1958)[1] is an American mutual fund manager. He was the only long-focused United States stock mutual fund manager to make a profit in 2008.[2][3][4] He had previously been the highest return mutual fund manager of the 6000 tracked by Morningstar and one of only two managers to turn a profit for the third quarter of 2002.[5] He had also previously been number one in his asset class year to date through November 1, 2004, although controversially.[6]
Forester is a value investor who makes financial decisions based on financial statistics such as price/earnings ratio.[4] His fund focuses on large cap stocks.[7] He has been a contrarian investor for many years.[8] Like many value investors, he is a more of a portfolio investor than a short-term trader.[9]

Background[edit]
Forester grew up in Illinois,[3] where he helped his father manage an investment portfolio through the turbulent 1970s.[10] He started his career as a money manager in 1992 assisting in the management of a US$50 million fund for Sir John Templeton. He later worked for Wells Fargo & Co. in Minneapolis, Minnesota and Scudder Investments in New York City. In 1998, he experienced a losing investment in sub-prime lenders.[3] Forester moved to Libertyville, Illinois, a northern suburb of Chicago, in 1998 when he purchased a home in the town.[11] In 1999, he started his own large cap value fund with $100,000 of his own money.[3][7] Although he was in cash during the dot-com bubble, which proved to be profitable for a while, he trailed the S&P 500 by 28% in 2003. He also trailed the market from 2005–2007.[3]
His wife, Kaye, with whom he is raising two children, had been encouraging him to close his business prior to 2008. In October 2007, they agreed that he would close the business if he was not beating the S&P 500 by 10% by March. Although he only led the market by 9.5% his wife agreed to allow him to keep the business going. After his fund took first place for year-to-date returns in the summer, he put 30% in cash. Although, he is not repeating his success in 2009, his fund is receiving large cash contributions.[3]
Forester has been involved in civic duties in Libertyville and national political efforts. As of 2004, he was a trustee of the Cook Memorial Library District.[12] In 2004, he attempted to run on a Republican slate of delegates for United States President George W. Bush.[12] However, due to an insufficient number of signatures on the slate's petition, they were removed from the ballot.[13] He was unsuccessful in his election to the Cook Memorial Library District Board in during the 2005 municipal elections.[14][15]
Forester Value Fund[edit]
In 2004, the fund was subject of controversy when Morningstar attempted to reclassify it into the conservative-allocation fund category. Mutual fund managers, including Forester, believed that the fund belonged in another classification such as a large-cap value fund, which is how Lipper had it classified. Value Line Inc. classified it as an income fund at the time. The move bumped Alpha Hedged Strategies Fund out of first place for its classification year to date as of November 1, 2004. The controversy not only led to complaints directly to Morningstar, but also to the Securities Exchange Commission.[6]
In 2008, there were 8200 diversified United States stock mutual funds, and they averaged a negative 39% rate of return.[3] 1,700 of these funds have been in existence for over three years and have assets of at least $50 million.[7] Forester's Forester Value Fund (FVALX), which is Morningstar five-star-rated,[16] gained .4% in 2008 although one year it lagged the Standard & Poor's 500 (S&P 500) by 30%.[3] The fund, which had been up 7% through June 30 by avoiding the housing crisis and the credit crisis,[17] was down 4.3% on the year through December 15 and 0.82% on the year entering the last day of trading.[16][18] In 2008, the second best of the 1,700 funds was Mario Gabelli's Gabelli ABC Fund, which lost only 2.6%.[7] Morningstar tracks a total of 9,918 mutual funds that averaged a 39.1% loss in 2008.[19] Much of Forester's success was attributable to large cash positions.[3] However, he also benefited from several timely trades in the banking sector, health care.[3][4] His fund held positions in countercyclical stocks that perform well in recessions. He had also held large cash positions during the dot-com bubble.[3] In the third quarter of 2002, his fund was one of two out of 6000 that turned a profit.[5] One of the most important financial ratios for Forest was the ratio of home prices to incomes, which helped him foresee trouble in the housing market.[20]
He has had very inconsistent returns managing his fund. During the last seven years, his fund has been in the top 20% of its peer group three times and in the bottom 10% four times. Over the past three years, the fund has nearly broken even.[18] Forester's fund has a 1.35 expense ratio.[21] Through 2008, the fund had a five-year total return of 25%.[22] His fund's three-year and five-year averages are 9% and 7.5% ahead of the market.[23] He is a low P/E investor who buys with full market cycle investing in mind.[24]
Forester in the media[edit]
Suddenly, during and after his 2008 market success, Forester, who runs his fund from Libertyville,[25] became a celebrity. He made his first television appearance in December and newspapers from as far away as Chile's El Mercurio have requested interviews with him.[3] In an interview with The Wall Street Journal Forester conceded that because his fund is smaller than many of his peers, he is able to get in and out of portfolio positions faster than others and that his returns would have been much lower if he had been managing a larger portfolio.[7] However, he said his success at beating the market was more attributable to his financial market assessments than his fund's size.[20] Because of the publicity his fund has been receiving in the down market its assets under management grew fivefold during 2008.[16]
Due to Forester's investing style of buying low P/E stocks with good earnings prospects, he is compared to Warren Buffett.[26] Forester loosely quotes Buffett at times such as in Barron's Magazine when he said: "It's When The Tide Goes out that you find out who's swimming without a bathing suit. I have mine on."[19] Although he is now likened to Buffett, Forester maintains Templeton as his role model. He invests by the philosophy credo that "I buy undervalued stocks, and if there are none, I go to cash."[5]

Forester Capital Management














 

 
















 








 
 
 
 
























Why Hedged Equity Investing?
At Forester, our main objective is long term capital growth.  We believe long term performance is enhanced by focusing on downside protection during unfavorable market conditions or times of increased volatility. The fund invests in undervalued stocks and also uses put options and cash to vary exposure to the market when the portfolio manager feels a defensive position is warranted.   Over the long term we believe our hedged equity strategy has been successful. In the last four down markets in 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2008 the fund has reported positive returns.
 

Performance data quoted represents past performance and does not guarantee future results. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate, and when sold, your investment may be worth more or less than its original cost. 
        Performance current to the most recent month-end may be lower or higher than performance quoted and can be obtained by calling 800-388-0365. Performance for periods less than one year is not annualized.

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 1 Sell Rating, 4 Hold Ratings, 12 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 2.65)Consensus Price Target: $96.27 (9.23% downside)

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
