Revenue Recognition Issues in a Digital Economy 
By DeMark, Eugene F.

Article excerpt

Many traditional business models have been modified or discarded in the face of technological advances. New business models also raise significant accounting questions concerning revenue recognition, or determining the proper time to book a sale and its related expenses.
Many cases are simple: Revenue is recognized when the goods are delivered or the services are performed. But the issue often gets more complicated, particularly in the high-tech sector, because of a practice called "bundling," which occurs when a company packages a principal product (e.g., a cellphone or satellite dish) with ancillary products or ongoing services (e.g., providing the wireless service or maintaining a signal to the dish receiver).
Bundling not only augments revenues but also extends the contract between the company and its customers beyond the traditional point of sale. This leads to an accounting issue: If a business bundles multiple revenue-generating activities into a single transaction, when is it appropriate to account for the entire arrangement as a single transaction (and recognize the revenue in the period of the initial sale), and when is it necessary to unbundle the transaction into individual elements (the delivery of a product, service, or other right to use assets) for revenue recognition purposes, possibly deferring all or a portion of the revenue (and associated expenses) to future periods?
Identifying individual products or services in multiple-element arrangements can be complicated. For example, some Internet portal companies provide electronic storefronts for their customers on a network of websites in exchange for a monthly fee. This appears to be a single element but such companies often deliver a variety of services to their customers over an extended period of time, including designing and setting up the original website, managing data and content, and performing fulfillment and order processing.
The facts and circumstances of each arrangement must be analyzed to determine if these ancillary services constitute separate elements that may call for separate accounting. This subject is being considered by FASB's Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF). In the absence of a FASB pronouncement, the SEC has indicated that it would not object to an accounting treatment for multiple-element arrangements that includes the following conditions:
* To be considered a separate element, the deliverable must represent a separate earnings process. …

Companies Must Adapt to the Internet to Survive 
By DeMark, Eugene F.; Harcourt, Robert R.

Read preview




Article excerpt

In a short time span, the Internet has rendered many business models obsolete. Despite highly publicized setbacks for many Internet-related companies, the broad category of web-enabled business models continues to advance.
The success or failure of local and global businesses may be determined by how well they adapt to the new electronic business paradigm. Factors such as timeto-market, customer retention, and operational efficiency will define the chances for survival, and customers will control the value chain for just about every product and service.
The emergence of electronic commerce will lead to the convergence of technology and products, less-predictable customer demand, shortened product life cycles, and price transparency. To meet these challenges, businesses must improve operational efficiency, report channel activity on a real-time basis, and build strategic partnerships and alliances.
The process by which a company implements these changes and acquires e-business capability is often called a digital transformation. On one level, digital transformation encompasses the conversion of all information-text, images, audio, and video-into digital formats that can be exchanged, stored, and indexed. Digital transformation also means profound changes in the very structure of business operations.
The transformation process involves the four Cs:
Commerce: how businesses conduct transactions;
Content: the information businesses use;
Community: the people that businesses interact with; and
Collaboration: how a business interacts with those communities.
The process also encompasses two small Cs: cost and culture.
To fully realize the benefits of speed and efficiency that Internet-enabled operations offer, companies must integrate their value-added partners and suppliers into an e-business system (community and collaboration), while the customersupport system moves information (content) online. As this happens, the enterprise should expect to sell more goods and services via the Internet.
Embracing Technology
Many companies are concerned that a transformation into an e-business means having to replace their entire employee base. In fact, if employees are willing to embrace change, they may be trained to handle the new operating modes, and management can decide how to implement that changeover. …
