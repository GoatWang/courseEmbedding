History[edit]
Starz Inc. (initially Encore Movie Group) started as a wholly owned television programming subsidiary and a joint venture of Liberty Media. Liberty Media split the company (then Liberty Starz) into a separate tracking stock on November 19, 2009. This tracking stock was not a separate company. Liberty Starz was wholly owned by Liberty Media, until January 4, 2011 when The Weinstein Company acquired 25% of one of the operating units.[5] The arrangement included a five-year distribution deal under which Liberty Starz's Anchor Bay Entertainment would release new Weinstein Co. films on DVD and Starz Distribution (formerly Starz Digital Media) would handle online downloads and streaming.[6]
On August 8, 2012, Liberty Media announced that it would spin-off Liberty Starz into a separate public company; the transaction includes about $1.5 billion of debt. The spin-off of the subsidiary was expected to be completed by the end of 2012,[7] but was actually completed on January 11, 2013. As a result of the spin-off, Liberty Starz changed its name to "Starz Inc."[8] Starz Inc.'s businesses and assets consist of Starz Networks, Starz Distribution, and its minority stake in Arc Productions.
On June 30, 2016, Lionsgate agreed to acquire Starz Inc. for $4.4 billion in cash and stock.[9] As part of the acquisition by Lionsgate, Starz Inc.'s home entertainment business have been subsumed into Lionsgate's Worldwide Home Entertainment division, as well as Starz Inc.'s Worldwide TV distribution group being similarly combined.[10] On December 8, 2016, the deal was finalized thus making Starz a subsidiary of Lionsgate.[4]
Starz Networks[edit]
Starz Networks currently consists of 17 American cable TV channels. As of December 31, 2012, Starz and Starz Encore serve a combined 56 million subscribers, including 21 million at STARZ, and 35 million at Starz Encore. Starz, Starz Encore, and MoviePlex air over 1,000 movies monthly across 17 linear networks, On Demand, and online offerings through Starz Encore Play and MoviePlex Play.[11]

Customer Questions & Answers








            Is there a larger quantity package for these hinges, i.e.a 10 pack?
        


Asked by: jarhead

            Actually yes they have a 10 pack here http://www.homedepot.com/p/Liberty-35-mm-105-Degree-1-1-4-in-Overlay-Hinge-10-Pack-840304/203274050

            ARE THERE LEFT SIDE AND RIGHT SIDE ? OR JUST TURNED IT AROUND FOR THE RIGHT SIDE ? ARE THEY COME IN PACKAGE OF TWO? GERM
        


Asked by: GBT74

            Two per pack and yes, you'd just turn it around for right or left cabinet.

            To use the self closing cabinet hinge do I need to replace all 3 hinges
        


Asked by: Anonymous

            I never tried that but I think you could do just one of the 3. maybe give it a try and see if that works.

Easy to install especially when using the template for making, drilling holes (template is additional purchase) on new cabinet doors.  These will NOT directly replace non-softclose hinges-gaps may differ and not be correctable without additional cabinet retrofitting

        Very quiet.
I'd previously installed a cabinet on the wall above our Master Bathroom toilet. A Guest Bedroom is on the other side of the wall and shutting a cabinet door at night was alarming. Rather than expensive supplemental wall soundproofing, I replaced one of each door's two hinges with a soft-close - an extremely inexpensive and easy installation.

I simultaneously installed a soft-close toilet seat and lid. A beautifully quiet combination. Don't do one without the other.

        Easy to Install
Easy to install replacement for my old overlay hinges that were not soft close units. Need to ensure your hinges are 1-1/4 units. The measuring, fit up display at the store is difficult to read and does not clearly delineate what fits. Bring an old hinge with you to compare to this hinge.

        Good replacement for builders grade Grass hinges
When the original hinge broke, I tried to find the original manufacturer, and was hard pressed identifying the correct fitting. Part numbers had changed, and eventually other things became more important. One year later I was looking at the open space and said, "today is the day". Went to HD and saw that they had hinges, and then remembered I had to do a measurement. Head slap, back home I went. Got online, figured out the overhang, and head back to the Depot. Found the soft closing model in a two pack, pulled it out, and wouldn't you know, taped to the security tag, it says "Grass". Installed them, no adjustment necessary. Kitchen no longer looks redneck.

        No More Slamming Cabinets!
I love having these soft close hinges on the cabinet doors. We are doing a kitchen remodel and these are a great modern update and upgrade from the old brass hinges. They close very softly and seem very sturdy and well-made to last for years to come. They are straightforward to install once you figure out the placement. A couple of things could make this product better. First, a paper template for marking the screw holes would be helpful. You may purchase a metal template from the store but it would be more convenient and easy to include a paper template along with the package. I ended up making my own out of cardboard from the installation instructions on the manufacturer website. Secondly, the screws included to fasten the hinges to the door frame could be better. I drilled pilot holes as directed, but when I tried to use the included screws, I couldn't get them to go all the way into the cabinet frame. I ended up using some self-drilling constructions screws I had on hand instead of messing with the included ones. They're too easy to strip, even with pre-drilling. Also note that you'll need to have a 35 mm forstner drill bit (another $15-$20) if you are converting to these European hinges. Other than those issues, I'm very happy with the hardware and will enjoy the quiet closing cabinet doors.

        Easy to install but not as adjustable as I would like
They installed easily and work but the 3 settings they have to adjust how fast the doors close are not working for me. Two of the settings do not slow the door closing and the other one takes too long for the door to close.
