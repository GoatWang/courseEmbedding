Fund Manager

NWQ seeks to provide consistent, long-term performance through an investment philosophy focused on attractive absolute valuations, downside protection and understanding change such as market catalysts and inflection points. The philosophy is employed through a bottom-up, disciplined, opportunistic and research-driven approach. The firm applies this philosophy and approach to a variety of products including equity strategies of all capitalizations, core and preferred fixed income strategies and balanced portfolios.Founded in 1994 by a team of industry veterans known for their pioneering work in quantitative analysis, Symphony Asset Management LLC is an institutional market leader in alternative and traditional investment strategies. Fundamental to Symphony’s investment philosophy is the concept that both quantitative and qualitative methods have value. The ability to blend these values into a unified, risk-controlled investment process is a skill that sets Symphony apart as an institutional money manager. Prior to implementation, each of our strategies has been thoroughly tested in one of the industry’s most sophisticated research environments. The resulting process is intellectually robust and independent of any one person’s influence or abilities.

Your liability risk when hiring Stephenson, James T



Contractors in Tennessee must carry both general liability and workers compensation insurance. Request a copy of current insurance certificates before any work begins.











Financial recourse when hiring Stephenson, James T



Licensed contractors in Tennessee must obtain a surety bond before performing construction work on residential properties. A home owner may file a claim against this bond to recoup losses or damages incurred during the construction project.











What else should I know before hiring Stephenson, James T



In order to become licensed in Tennessee, contractors must submit a reviewed or audited financial statement prepared by a licensed independent accounting firm. To obtain an unlimited license, the contractor must show $300,000 in working capital.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Tennessee, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner, choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.
