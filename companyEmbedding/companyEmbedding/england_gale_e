E-Cigarettes: A Blessing Or A Curse?


08/03/2017 15:05


























Stuart Gale




Third generation pharmacist committed to delivering patient centric care.










There have been a number of conflicting reports on the health implications of smoking e-cigarettes. In spite of a Public Health England review finding that they are 95% safer than traditional cigarettes and are an effective quitting aid, the wider health implications for smokers and non-smokers alike, are unknown. 
As a result, although licensed e-cigarettes have kept their rightful place, as a tool in the stop smoking arsenal of local pharmacies, the category as a whole has become much more recreational in nature, with the products becoming widely available in shops or vape cafes, where sadly, health is the least of their considerations. 
As the popularity of the e-cigarette continues to rise, fuelled in no small part by 'Vapers' themselves, who welcome it as a healthier alternative to tobacco, additions such as designer flavours and atomisers are fuelling the desirability of the trend - making it cool among the very audiences that anti smoking campaigners have fought so hard to target.
The key concern is around younger people who, while acutely aware of the dangers of smoking, are bypassing traditional smoking altogether and jumping on the vaping bandwagon, seemingly oblivious to the health implications.
E-cigarettes contain nicotine and that is what makes them so effective for smokers wanting to quit. However, it is also this nicotine content that makes them addictive. This fact, combined with ingredients contained in the vaping liquid, which have been shown to have their own negative impact on health, suggest that the rising trend towards recreational vaping, could be at risk of undermining the benefits of the tool as a stop smoking device.
Furthermore, one study has suggested that the emergence of a trend among teens in 'dripping' in which the e-cigarette liquid is dropped directly onto the hot coils of the device to produce thicker, more flavourful smoke, may expose users to higher levels of nicotine and other known carcinogens including formaldehyde and acetaldehyde.
The lack of long term research has led the British Medical Association to call for a ban in public places, due to concerns that widespread use of e-cigarettes will normalise the consumption of nicotine, undoing all the good work which has contributed to making smoking socially unacceptable. 
And yet, the benefits of the device cannot and should not be ignored. I have seen life-long smokers use licensed e-cigarettes, through the in-pharmacy stop smoking service, to successfully quit their 40-a-day habit. Having worked with hundreds of patients over the years, seeing such life changing success it's hard to underestimate the potential that this innovative smoking cessation tool could have on the health of the nation.  
It feels like we're waking a tightrope, on the one hand we have this technology which, when used as an aid to stop smoking has the potential to eradicate smoking and smoking related disease and on the other hand we have young, non smokers taking up vaping and becoming addicted to the nicotine content while putting their health at risk from the added ingredients, the full health implications of which are still unclear.

What we do know is that, according to research, teens who vape are four times more likely to take up tobacco within a year - evidence that the device is fuelling the very habit that it was invented to stop. 
I would argue that, had e-cigarettes been confined to the clinical setting of a pharmacy, rather than being sold, sweet-like in newsagents or given the 'Amsterdam Cool' of a vaping cafe, their allure may not have been quite so strong.
Larger and more comprehensive studies, from which we can draw definitive conclusions about the long-term safety of e-cigarettes, are essential.
Five smoking facts:
•	Approximately 80,000 people a year die of a smoking related illness 
•	Smoking costs the NHS £2 billion a year
•	2.6 million people use e-cigarettes in the UK 
•	There are around eight million smokers in Britain
•	E-cigarettes are the most popular quitting aid

About

Overview

The early settlers of New England are the ancestors of over 30 million people living today. Fortunately, from their very beginnings, New England towns and cities maintained vital records and church records. These records form the basis of hundreds of genealogies.  Among the many useful books in this bundle are the landmark publications on Massachusetts and Connecticut marriages by Frederic W. Bailey. Following the appearance of this important body of source records, the benchmark for region-wide collections of family histories was set with the publication of Donald Lines Jacobus's Families of Ancient New Haven, a legendary work which complements other Connecticut compendia such as Susan Abbott's Families of Early Milford, Lucius Barbour's Families of Early Hartford, and Alvan Talcott's Families of Early Guilford, all of which are featured in Gale Genealogy Connect: New England collection.  Additional highlights of Gale Genealogy Connect: New England includes several works which have become standards, among them Susan Roser's books on Mayflower passengers and their descendants, including Mayflower Increasings, Mayflower Marriages, Mayflower Births & Deaths, and Mayflower Deeds & Probates.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/28/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.
