Overview+



What is an annuity? 
An annuity is an insurance product that pays you periodic income payments in exchange for your premium payment. It can be used as part of your overall retirement strategy. Depending on the type of annuity, it may help you grow your retirement savings, protect your savings from loss, and offer death benefits to protect your beneficiaries. 




How to choose an annuity
Make your choice based on how your needs match up to the features of the annuity. Do you need to grow your retirement savings or are you concerned with losing principal? Or both? Do you need income that starts now or in the future? Do you want to leave a legacy to your heirs? These are some of the questions to ask yourself to determine which annuity might work for you. 




Why Voya?
Voya Financial is ready to help Americans build a secure financial future—one person, one family, one institution at a time. We are ready to make a difference—to deliver financial solutions to help all Americans become retirement ready.

As a component of benefits offered to employees, 401k plans are a very popular way to accumulate tax-deferred income and earnings for retirement. 
Employers offer 401k plans as a way to help their employees save for retirement. You choose how much pre-tax income you wish to contribute and that amount is automatically deducted from your paycheck and placed into your account within the 401k plan. Your retirement savings can continue to grow tax-deferred until you make a withdrawal. You do not pay taxes on your salary deferrals or earnings until you take a withdrawal from the plan. Generally, if you take the distribution after age 59½ there is no tax penalty.  
One difference from an IRA is that 401k plans permit higher contribution limits and are only available through your employer.     




Key Features

Because your employer sponsors the 401k plan, there may be other valuable benefits offered in addition to salary deferrals. Check your plan carefully. The following are key features provide a brief overview to assist you:

Optional Participation: Although some plan sponsors automatically enroll employees to promote plan participations, 401k plan participation is still optional. Check with your employer to determine how you can enroll. 
Contribution Rate: You can choose the amount you want to contribute each payroll up to established IRS limits. You will also be permitted to change your contribution rate once you are in the plan.
Your 401k plan contribution comes out of your paycheck on a pre-tax basis which lowers your taxable income for that pay period. (That’s a good thing!) 
Available Investments: You can choose from a variety of investment choices selected by your employer.
Deferred Taxes: Not only do your pre-tax contributions help lower your taxable income each pay period, but all earnings on your contributions grow tax deferred. Note: Some plans offer a Roth 401k, which permit savings on an after tax basis.  
You will not be taxed on either the contributions or earnings until you make a withdrawal. 
Optional Employer Match: To provide an extra boost to retirement savings, many employers match a percentage of an employee’s contribution which will be given to the employee once she is vested. 
Accessing Funds During Employment: Loans—As an optional feature your employer may permit you to borrow against your plan account up to specified IRS limits. Hardship Withdrawals—Understanding that certain hardships arise, the IRS permits plans to allow distributions for certain hardship reasons. 
Portability: If you leave your job, you can remain in the plan or rollover your 401k funds into an IRA or another 401k.
Support: Your 401k plan provider typically offers many free tools and resources to help you establish savings goals, measure your progress, and to see how financially close you are to meeting your retirement goals.
The 457 and 403b plans are similar to 401k plans, but are typically offered by other types of organizations. The 457 plan is offered to employees of state and local governments. The 403b plan is offered only to the employees of public schools and qualified tax-exempt organizations such as higher-education, churches, tax-exempt hospitals, and charities.
Roth accounts: May also be offered by a plan sponsor under 401k, 403b, or governmental 457b plans. Roth contributions are made after you’ve paid taxes on the income, but qualified distributions may be taken tax-free in retirement.1  



Suitable For




The 401k is a key financial tool for almost anyone trying to save as much as possible for their retirement.  








Eligibility
 



You must be employed by a plan sponsor offering a 401k plan to participate. 
If you leave employment, you will no longer be able to contribute to the plan. 
Some employers will let you keep your savings in their plan after you leave. 
You can always combine all of your old plans into one rollover IRA or in most cases, into the 401k plan offered by your new employer.
Contributions are deducted from your paycheck up to certain IRS-defined annual limits. Contributions can be designated as a specific dollar amount or percentage of your pay. The contributions are taken before taxes, lowering your current income tax bill. You will owe income taxes when you make a withdrawal from the plan. Withdrawals prior to age 59½ are also subject to a 10% IRS early withdrawal penalty, unless an IRS exception applies.

1A qualified distribution of designated Roth contributions is excludable from gross income. A qualified distribution is one that occurs at least five years after the year of the participant’s first designated Roth contribution (counting such first year as part of the five) and is made: - On or after the participant’s attainment of age 59½, - On account of the participant’s disability, or - On or after the participant’s death. 
If the distribution is not a qualified distribution, then the accumulated Roth 401k earnings will be subject to tax, and additional taxes may apply. Roth 401k amounts are subject to the same required minimum distribution rules as other contributions made to the 401k plan.

Benefits



Investment Options+

Your clients can choose from over 100 mutual funds offered by more than 30 well-known fund companies – including American Funds, T. Rowe Price, JP Morgan, BlackRock, PIMCO, Ivy Funds, and Oppenheimer, to name a few – all available within one retirement account. We have well-known funds and over 30 funds with an Overall Morningstar Rating of 4 and 5 stars. Your clients can see the progress of their investments on their quarterly statements or by going online. View Fund Information 

Investable Assets+

Designed to accept initial contributions of $5,000 or more, rollovers or transfers from a qualified plan, including a 401(k), 403(b) and governmental 457(b) plan, as well as from other IRAs. SIMPLE IRAs can only accept rollovers from other SIMPLE IRAs. Will accept direct transfers. Rolling a 457(b) to an IRA before age 59½ should be carefully considered. Any amount rolled from a 457(b) to an IRA will become subject to the IRS 10% premature distribution penalty tax. 

Account Types+

Traditional IRA, Roth IRA, SEP IRA, SIMPLE IRA, Traditional Beneficiary Available IRA and Roth Beneficiary IRA. (Beneficiary IRAs are also known as Stretch IRAs or Inherited IRAs.) 

Additional Features+

Dollar Cost Averaging*
Dollar cost averaging (DCA) can help level out the effect of market fluctuation on the cost of an investment when contributions are made to an account on a regular basis. It is a fixed dollar amount that is invested in regular intervals, regardless of price. Available as a 6, 12, or 24-month schedule. DCA does not ensure a profit nor guarantee against loss. Investors should consider their financial ability to continue their purchases through periods of low price levels.
Automatic Asset Rebalancing*
Automatic Asset Rebalancing rebalances your clients’ portfolios back to their original allocation to help them stay in line with their risk tolerance. While rebalancing helps manage your investment allocation, it does not assure a profit or protect against loss in a declining market. Available quarterly, semi-annually, annually.*Dollar Cost Averaging and Automatic Rebalancing cannot be elected simultaneously.

Additional Details+

Clients should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses of the mutual funds offered through a retirement plan carefully before investing. The prospectus(es) contain(s) this and other information which clients should be able to obtain by contacting their local representative.

If withdrawals are taken prior to age 59½, an IRS 10% premature distribution penalty tax will apply unless an exception applies. Money distributed from the program will be taxed as ordinary income in the year the money is received. The mutual fund values fluctuate with market conditions, and when surrendered, the principal may be worth more or less than its original amount invested.
