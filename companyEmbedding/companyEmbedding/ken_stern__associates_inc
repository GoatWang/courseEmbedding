								Your success is our success							



 

								Your life, your legacy							



 

								Passionate about performance							









It will be quickly apparent how different Ken Stern & Associates is when it comes to investment philosophy and personal financial management. Your success is our success.












 


									Never compromise on your investments								
Investment management should be transparent, low cost, give you access to deal flow and focus on building customizable investment strategies that are results driven.




 


									Build a better team								
Receive access to a team of financial strategists to assist you in portfolio allocation and theory, as well as help to grow, maximize and protect your personal finances.




 


									Beyond investment management								
Creating, protecting and passing on a legacy starts with a plan. A plan that reflects your wishes, desires and involves the multi-disciplined approach of integrating asset allocation, with estate and tax planning. Our tool-kits, board meetings, and team are deeply involved in keeping you and your legacy well planned, funded and two steps ahead.








We look forward to creating a plan designed to help you make more money, pay less taxes and preserve your legacy.

Financial advisors use their knowledge of investments, 
tax laws, and insurance to recommend financial options to individuals.
The SEC typically regulates investment advisers that have assets under management in excess of $25,000,000. Investment advisers that do not meet this threshold generally are regulated by the states. The SEC registers IA firms but does not separately register individual representatives of IA firms. The states register IA firms, and many separately register individual investment adviser representatives.

Currently, you can only search for IA firms on this website. In the future, this website also will provide the ability to search for individual investment adviser representatives.

In 1996 Congress amended the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to require that the SEC establish a readily accessible electronic process to respond to public inquiries about investment advisers and their disciplinary information. The SEC created this website to satisfy Congress? mandate.

Capital One® Secured Mastercard®


                                            I never had played in credit before, and someone suggested this card to me to build credit for the first time. I've been really satisfied for the most part. They report quickly and accurately, remind me when my bill is due, and the customer service has been kind and thorough....show more

Stage Stores Credit Card


                                            I was charged fees then late fees then fees. So $28.22 balance appeared out of thin air without any purchase. I moved while opening the credit card account so I did not receive statements on time (or maybe they did not send it to me). Called and got $17 back. As for the rest, I...show more

                                            IF I COULD GIVE IT A ZERO I WOULD! Amazon/Synchrony Bank will cut your limit out of no where, even when making monthly payments. I've spent almost a year trying to pay off a card THEY maxed out and now they have sent to collections AS IM PAYING IT! DO NOT APPLY FOR THIS CARD!
