We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of the shares of our
common stock being offered for sale by the selling stockholders. We will incur
all costs associated with this registration statement and prospectus.


The market for cloud-based virtual data rooms to ease the complexity of the real
estate transaction process is split between a number of direct and indirect
competitors: (1) diversified, (2) focused, and (3) social-based. Diversified
competitors are those that expanded their mergers and acquisitions cloud-based
virtual data room business to include Real Estate. The ‘focused’ competition,
such as Real Workspaces, focuses largely on delivering virtual data room to the
commercial real estate market. The ‘social-based’ competitors, such as Dot Loop,
focus primarily on adding secure file sharing to internal social networks
instead of real estate transactions.

Most of these businesses have longer operating histories and significantly
greater financial, technical, marketing and managerial resources than we do. We
expect that we will continue to face additional competition from new entrants
into the market.


Company Description
Lockbox Link, Inc is a development stage company that intends to specialize in
providing real estate agents in the United States the opportunity to increase
customer satisfaction, improve productivity, and ensure business continuity by
offering the agents' clients a simplified, secure, and


 predictable home buying
process. The company’s intended product is a cloud based software solution
(SaaS) that is being developed to provide guidance and security to all the
parties who participate in the home buying/selling process via limited control
access and innovative user interface. Our proposed solution "Lockbox Link", will
be designed to take advantage of the structured flow and repeatability of
existing real estate transaction processes. The Company has been doing business
since April 10, 2014, when it was formed in the State of Nevada.

We intend to provide a customizable virtual Data Room specifically designed to
simplify and automate real estate transactions. We expect our software will
offer its users modifiable transaction templates, allowing seamless integration
into brokerages’ workflow. This service will be designed to be made available
through a cloud-based software-based platform we have named “Lockbox Link”. We
expect Lockbox Link to have a subscription fee of $10/month. Our initial focus
will be on servicing the California market. As and when the business grows, we
intend to broaden our market area to other States and eventually the entire
United States. However there can be no assurance that Lockbox Link will be
successfully developed, or even if developed, that the Company will be
successful in marketing it.
---

We were incorporated in Nevada on April 10, 2014, as Lockbox Link, Inc. Our
principal executive offices are located at 13708 Ruette Le Parc #C, Del Mar, CA

 Lockbox





Zoom 



The safest and most secure way to hide your door key to allow unforced entry in case of an emergency is a lockbox. Our lockbox can be hung on pipes, metal gates, or even a door handle and will ensure Emergency Services can get to you quickly and easily without breaking a door. These boxes open easily using a combination you choose and set yourself. You can change your combination as often as you wish for added security. When you change it, we need to be notified of the new combination for your own safety. Our monitoring center will keep the information on file and will only give the combination to emergency personnel when they require it for unforced entry. You can also specify if you would like us to give the information to your responders but that is not part of protocol unless specifically requested by the client.

Lockbox
Link, Inc. 

Footnotes
to the Condensed Financial Statements

For the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015

 

1.

Organization
and basis of presentation

 

LockBox
Link, Inc . (the
“Company”) is engaged in developing, producing,
marketing and selling internet software applications to better
facilitate transactions for the real estate industry. The Company
was incorporated in the State of Nevada on April 10, 2014 with a
principal office in Carson City. The Company is in the development
stage and is presently undertaking research and development in what
will become its core line of products. The Company’s
activities are subject to significant risks and uncertainties,
including failing to secure additional funding to operationalize
the Company’s current technology and resources.

 

Basis of
presentation

 

The
accompanying interim condensed financial statements are unaudited,
but in the opinion of management of Lockbox Link, Inc. (the
Company), contain all adjustments, which include normal recurring
adjustments, necessary to present fairly the financial position at
September 30, 2016, and the results of operations and cash flows
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  The balance
sheet as of December 31, 2015 is derived from the Company’s
audited financial statements.

 

Certain
information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial
statements that have been prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted
pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and
Exchange Commission, although management of the Company believes
that the disclosures contained in these financial statements are
adequate to make the information presented therein not misleading.
For further information, refer to the financial statements and the
notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form
10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, as filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.

 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the
reported amounts of revenues and expense during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

 

The
results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations to be
expected for the full fiscal year ending December 31,
2016.

Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies

 

Development
Stage Operations

 

The
Company has operated as a development stage enterprise since its
inception by devoting substantially all of its efforts to
scientific research and business development.

 

Election
to be treated as an emerging growth company

 

In 2014,
we elected to use the extended transition period now available for
complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section
102(b) (1).  This election allows us to delay the adoption of
new or revised accounting standards that have different effective
dates for public and private companies until those standards apply
to private companies.  As a result of this election, our
financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply
with public company effective dates.

 

Going
Concern

 

The
financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will
continue as a going concern. In this its first year, the Company
has incurred a net loss and negative operating cash flow. To the
extent the Company may have negative cash flows in the future; it
will continue to require additional capital to fund operations. The
Company obtained additional capital investments under various debt
and common stock issues. Although management continues to pursue
its financing plans, there is no assurance that the Company will be
successful in obtaining sufficient revenues to generate positive
cash flow. The financial statements do not include any adjustments
that might result from the outcome of these
uncertainties.

Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

 

Use of
Estimates

 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

 

Cash and
cash equivalents

 

For
financial statement presentation purposes, the Company considers
all short term investments with a maturity date of three months or
less to be cash equivalents.

 

Accounts
receivable

 

We
estimate credit loss reserves for accounts receivable on an
individual receivable basis. A specific impairment allowance
reserve is established based on expected future cash flows and the
financial condition of the debtor. We charge off customer balances
in part or in full when it is more likely than not that we will not
collect that amount of the balance due. We consider any balance
unpaid after the contract payment period to be past due. There are
no Accounts receivable at September 30, 2016, or December 31,
2015.

 

Recognition
of Revenues

 

The
Company applies paragraph 605-10-S99-1 of the FASB Accounting
Standards and Codification for revenue recognition. The Company
recognizes revenue services are realized or realizable and earned
less estimated future doubtful accounts. The Company considers
revenue realized or realizable and earned when all of the following
criteria are met:

 

(1)

Pervasive
evidence of an arrangement exists;

(2)

The
services have been rendered and all required milestones
achieved;

(3)

The sale
price is fixed or determinable; and

(4)

Collectability
is reasonably assured.

 

Related
party transactions

 

The
Company follows subtopic 850-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards
Codification for the identification of related parties and
disclosure of related party transactions. Pursuant to Section
850-10-20 the related parties include:

 

a.

Affiliates
of the Company;

b.

Entities
for which investments in their equity securities would be required,
absent the election of the fair value option under the  Fair
Value Option Subsection of Section 825-10-15, to be accounted for
by the equity method by the investing entity;

c.

Trusts for
the benefit of employees, such as pension and profit sharing trusts
that are managed by or under the trusteeship of
management;

d.

Principal
owners of the Company;

e.

Management
of the Company;

f.

Other
parties with which the Company may deal if one party controls or
can significantly influence the management or operating policies of
the other to an extent that one of the transacting parties might be
prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests;
and

g.

Other
parties that can significantly influence the management or
operating policies of the transacting parties or that have an
ownership interest in one of the transacting parties and can
significantly influence the other to an extent that one or more of
the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its
own separate interests.

2.

Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

 

The
financial statements shall include disclosures of material related
party transactions, other than compensation arrangements, expense
allowances and other similar items in the ordinary course of
business. However, disclosure of transactions that are eliminated
in the preparation of financial statements is not required in those
statements. The disclosures shall include:

 

a.

The nature
of the relationship involved;

b.

A
description of the transactions, including transactions to which no
amounts or nominal amounts were ascribed for each of the periods
for which income statements are presented, and such other
information deemed necessary to an understanding of the effects of
the transactions on the financial statements;

c.

The dollar
amount of transactions for each of the periods for which income
statements are presented and the effects of any change in the
method of establishing the terms from that used in the preceding
period; and

d.

Amounts
due from or to related parties as of the date of each balance sheet
presented and, if not otherwise apparent, the terms and manner of
settlement.

 

Basic and
Diluted Net Income (Loss) Per Share

 

The
Company computes net income (loss) per share in accordance with ASC
260 "Earnings Per Share" which codified SFAS No. 128. "Earnings per
Share." ASC 260 requires presentation of both basic and diluted
earnings per Share (EPS) on the face of the income statement. Basic
EPS is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common
shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of shares
dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period
using the treasury stock method and convertible preferred stock
using the if-converted method. In computing diluted EPS, the
average stock price for the period is used in determining the
number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock
options or warrants. Diluted EPS excludes all dilutive potential
shares if their effect is anti dilutive.

 

Income
Tax

 

The
Company accounts for income taxes under ASC 740 "Income Taxes"
which codified SFAS 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." under the
asset and liability method of ASC 740, deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statements
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their
respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable
income in the years in which those temporary differences are
expected to be recovered or settled. Under ASC 740, the effect on
deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is
recognized in income in the period the enactment occurs. A
valuation allowance is provided for certain deferred tax assets if
it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize tax
assets through future operations.

 

Commitments
and Contingencies.

 

The
Company follows subtopic 450-20 of the FASB Accounting Standards
Codification to report accounting for contingencies. Certain
conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are
issued, which may result in a loss to the Company but which will
only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to
occur. The Company assesses such contingent liabilities, and such
assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment. In
assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are
pending against the Company or unasserted claims that may result in
such proceedings, the Company evaluates the perceived merits of any
legal proceedings or unasserted claims as well as the perceived
merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought
therein.

 

If the
assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a
material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can
be estimated, then the estimated liability would be accrued in the
Company’s financial statements. If the assessment indicates
that a potentially material loss contingency is not probable but is
reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then
the nature of the contingent liability, and an estimate of the
range of possible losses, if determinable and material, would be
disclosed. Loss contingencies considered remote are generally not
disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case the
guarantees would be disclosed. Management does not believe, based
upon information available at this time that these matters will
have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial
position, results of operations or cash flows. However, there is no
assurance that such matters will not materially and adversely
affect the Company’s business, financial position, and
results of operations or cash flows.

Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

 

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments

 

The
Company follows paragraph 825-10-50-10 of the FASB Accounting
Standards Codification for disclosures about fair value of its
financial instruments and paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB
Accounting Standards Codification (“Paragraph
820-10-35-37”) to measure the fair value of its financial
instruments. Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a framework for
measuring fair value in accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), and expands disclosures
about fair value measurements. To increase consistency and
comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures,
Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a fair value hierarchy which
prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair
value into three broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the
highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets
for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to
unobservable inputs.  The three levels of fair value hierarchy
defined by Paragraph 820-10-35-37 are described below:

  




 



 





Level
1



Quoted
market prices available in active markets for identical assets or
liabilities as of the reporting date.





 



 





Level
2



Pricing
inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level
1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the
reporting date.





 



 





Level
3



Pricing
inputs that are generally observable inputs and not corroborated by
market data.




 

The
carrying amounts of the Company’s financial assets and
liabilities, such as cash and accounts payable approximate their
fair values because of the short maturity of these
instruments.

 

Risk and
Uncertainties

 

The
Company is subject to risks common to companies in the service
industry, including but not limited to litigation, development of
new technological innovations and dependence on key
personnel.

 

Off
Balance Sheet Arrangements.

 

The
Company has no off balance sheet arrangements.

 

Uncertain
Tax Positions

 

The
Company did not take any uncertain tax positions and had no
adjustments to unrecognized income tax liabilities or benefits
pursuant to the provisions of Section 740-10-25 for the periods
ended June 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015.

 

Stock-based
compensation

 

ASC 718
"Compensation - Stock Compensation" codified SFAS No. 123
prescribes accounting and reporting standards for all stock-based
compensation plans payments award to employees, including employee
stock options, restricted stock, employee stock purchase plans and
stock appreciation rights, may be classified as either e
