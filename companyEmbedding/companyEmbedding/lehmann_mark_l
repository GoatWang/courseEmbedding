Act Or Do Not Act.Â  Please read the Notice carefully.
Â 
IF YOU BOUGHT OR ACQUIRED LEHMAN-ISSUED STRUCTURED PRODUCTS UNDERWRITTEN AND SOLD BY UBS FINANCIAL SERVICES, INC. ("UBSFS") IN 2007 AND 2008, YOU COULD RECEIVE A PAYMENT FROM A CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT.Â

  District of New York

Â 
Â 
The Courtâs Settlement Hearing
The
Court will hold a Settlement Hearing at 4:30 p.m. on December 10, 2013, at the
Daniel Patrick Moynihan United States Courthouse, 500 Pearl Street, Courtroom 21B,
New York, NY 10007.Â  At this hearing, the
Honorable Lewis A. Kaplan will consider whether the Settlement is fair,
reasonable, and adequate.Â  The Court also
will consider the proposed Plan of Allocation for the Net Settlement Fund and
the application of Class Counsel for attorneysâ fees and reimbursement of
expenses.
Â 
What is this case
about?
This
class action Settlement involves securities known as structured products that
were issued by Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and underwritten and sold by UBS
Financial Services Inc. in 2007 and 2008.Â 
Structured products are a kind of security that consists of a fixed income
security and a type of derivative, such as a basket of securities, options,
commodities, or foreign currencies.Â  Some
of the structured products involved in the class action also offered âprincipal
protection.âÂ  A list of the structured
products that are part of this Settlement can be downloaded by  clicking here.
The
lawsuit alleges that UBSFS violated federal securities laws in underwriting and
selling the Structured Products.Â  The
plaintiffs contend, among other things, that the offering materials for the
Structured Products contained materially false and misleading statements and
omitted material information about Lehmanâs financial condition and about the
âprincipal protectionâ feature of some of the Structured Products.Â  During the litigation, the plaintiffs also
inquired into the procedures by which UBSFS structured, marketed, and sold the
Structured Products, the sales commissions earned, and communications between
UBSFS financial advisors and customers.Â 
UBSFS denies that it did anything wrong, or that any purchasers of
Structured Products incurred losses due to any alleged misrepresentations or
omissions in the offering materials.
Â 
The Settlement Benefits
A Settlement Fund of $120,000,000 (before deduction of
attorneysâ fees and expenses and administrative costs) will be distributed to
certain investors who bought or acquired the securities identified on  Exhibit A
during the relevant time period, and who make a âRecognized Claimâ under the
proposed Plan of Allocation.Â  Plaintiffs
estimate that Settlement Class Members who purchased or acquired Structured
Products with a total face value of approximately $892 million may have
suffered damages during the relevant time period.Â  Assuming all Settlement Class Members submit
valid and timely claims, plaintiffs estimate that the average recovery per
damaged Structured Product under the Settlement is $1.34 for Structured
Products with a face value of $10.00 and $134.00 for Structured Products with a
face value of $1,000.00, before
deduction of Court-awarded attorneysâ fees and expenses and administrative
costs.
You
can use the proposed Plan of Allocation to calculate your Recognized
Claim.Â  It is unlikely that you will
receive the full amount of your Recognized Claim, however, because your payment
will depend on the number of valid Claim Forms that
are received and the total of all Settlement Class Membersâ Recognized Claims.
The Plan of Allocation can be downloaded by  clicking here. 
Â 
The Rights of the Settlement Class Members
If you are a Class
Member, you have the following options:
Â 
Submit a Claim Form
If you are a potential Settlement Class
Member, to be eligible to share in the distribution of the Settlement proceeds,
you must timely submit a valid Claim Form, which can be found by clicking here, postmarked
no later than February 4, 2014.Â  If you are a potential Settlement Class
Member and do not submit a valid Claim Form, you will not be eligible to share
in the distribution of the Net Settlement Fund, but you will nevertheless be
bound by any judgments or orders entered by the Court in the Action.
Â 
Â 
Exclude
yourself from the Settlement
If you are a potential Settlement Class
Member, but wish to exclude yourself from the Settlement Class, you must submit
a written request for exclusion that is in accordance with the instructions set
forth in the Notice and is postmarked no later than November 19, 2013.Â  If you are a potential Settlement Class
Member and do not timely exclude yourself from the Settlement Class, you will
be bound by any judgments or orders entered by the Court in the Action.
Â 
Object
to the Settlement
Any objections to the proposed
Settlement, Plan of Allocation, or Class Counselâs application for attorneysâ
fees and reimbursement of expenses must be mailed to the Court, Class Counsel,
and Defense Counsel in accordance with the instructions set forth in the
Notice, and received by each no later
than November 19, 2013.

You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.

The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.
