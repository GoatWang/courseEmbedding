Services 

Each client is unique. Everything we do is driven by your goals and needs.
 
PLANNING
 
A financial plan can serve as a personal road map. If you wish to use this service we will develop a plan based on your individual needs, objectives and aspirations. Read More 


We begin with a detailed questionnaire followed by an in-depth discussion of your financial situation. Using this information, we create a plan that addresses your specific concerns, taking into consideration your income, assets, liabilities, spending habits and time horizon. Over subsequent years your plan can serve as a benchmark to monitor progress towards your goals, a sounding board in important financial decisions and a guide to allocating your investment portfolio. As your needs and circumstances change, we will make adjustments to the plan as necessary.


ASSET ALLOCATION
A customized investment strategy begins with a needs analysis and a rigorous risk tolerance assessment which is summarized in your personal investment policy statement. Read More 


LongView considers each client’s tax sensitivity, time horizon and financial goals when creating an investment portfolio. These elements help us determine the proper asset allocation and inform our security selection. LongView clients benefit from personalized, diversified portfolios which reflect their specific needs.


RESEARCH
Identifying the best fund managers in the industry, tracking their performance and researching potential new investments is central to our work. Our assessment of current macro-economic and market conditions provides us with a broad context within which to consider these opportunities. Read More 


Frequent conference calls with fund managers, analysts and economists are part of our process. We make onsite visits to fund companies across the country to assess them on their home ground. Our portfolio managers meet daily to discuss our research and to evaluate risks and opportunities.


PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT
We monitor and rebalance portfolios on a regular basis. We will also make tactical adjustments based on our own assessment of investment opportunities, under or over valued asset classes and potential risks. Read More 


Tax considerations and longer term planning are an additional aspect of our portfolio management.


RETIREMENT PLANNING
For many clients, retirement planning comes with a host of unique concerns. The timing of leaving the workforce and taking Social Security, increased longevity, rising healthcare costs, adequate savings, sufficient income – all influence the decision of when and how to retire. Read More 


We work closely with clients to examine all available options, we then create a strategy for success and see the client through implementation and maintenance of their customized retirement solutions. From opening an individual retirement account to advice on setting up a combination 401(k)/defined benefit plan for your business, LongView provides solutions and guidance in planning for the years to come.


REPORTING
We believe that open and clear communication is integral to the success of our relationships. To that end, we produce in-depth portfolio performance reports, quarterly letters and topical alerts as well as ongoing updates of our outlook on our website. Read More 


A dedicated, primary advisor is accessible to you at all times. We encourage regular, face to face client meetings and are happy to meet in our offices or wherever is most convenient. Should you have questions or concerns, we encourage clients to call or email us.


COACHING
LongView provides comprehensive financial counsel. We help clients avoid the financial mistakes and missteps that often come from emotional responses to market behavior or unsettling life events. Read More 


We work with our clients to help them stick to their investment plan and take advantage of favorable circumstances when they arise. Our clients draw on our collective seventy-plus years of experience and benefit from sound advice whether life throws them a curveball or a windfall.


ESTATE PLANNING
We help clients take care of the people and the organizations that are the most important to them. For clients who wish to leave a legacy, LongView works closely with other trusted advisors such as attorneys and CPAs. Read More 


We can guide you through the creation of wills, trusts and medical directives. We engage in planning for traditional, non-traditional and special needs families. We will help you craft a charitable giving strategy that benefits your preferred religious organizations, educational institutions, non-profit entities and your community.


ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES
Our Client Services Manager will help you with account set-up and maintenance, withdrawals, transfers, wires and online access. Our custodian, Charles Schwab, also offers checking accounts, debit cards and automated Required Minimum Distributions. Read More 


Our goal is to offer seamless administration of your accounts.


EDUCATOR RETIREMENT SERVICES
LongView Educator Retirement Services offers schools and colleges a range of comprehensive 403(b) retirement solutions. We help schools fulfill their legal responsibilities to their employees by offering plans with low fees, competitive fund performance, best enrollment practices, and ease of use. Read More 


Unlike many firms, LongView assumes full fiduciary responsibility for all plans. In addition, we provide individual counseling to plan participants to help ensure they reach their retirement goals.



“Do not seek to follow in the footsteps of the wise; seek what they sought.”

Our story
Simple. Safe.
We founded Longview so that we could put to work the investment principles we have always followed on behalf of our own families — for clients we care about.
Our goal is to safely increase our clients’ wealth over time. We want them to sleep well and have total peace of mind.
Our strategy starts with keeping things simple and safe. We invest with our eyes on stability and growth over the long term. We believe so strongly in our strategy that we have literally bought into it — everyone at Longview is invested alongside our clients, in the same stocks and in the same weightings.
We also keep our client base small enough to ensure that we can provide consistently excellent service. Whether client or colleague, we build relationships of mutual respect designed to stand the test of time.
