About this book




Industrial products that are made from, or contain, nitrogen are described in parts of some encyclopedias and standard reference works. However it is not always simple to determine from these varied sources the present status of the technology and markets for various nitrogen products. We therefore perceived a need for a text that provides a comprehensive description of: 1) products that are made from or that contain nitrogen; 2) the processes that produce these products; and 3) the markets that consume these products. I have attempted to present the material in a standardized format that should make this book easy to use and helpful to the readers. The standard format for each product is: Introduction, Process, Production, and Uses, with some variations in different chapters. This book provides information that could be used by a wide range of readers: Fertilizer companies—to evaluate different production processes and review general trends in the market. Basic chemical companies—to evaluate different production processes and review general trends in the market. Specialty chemical companies—to investigate new chemical production and/or sales opportunities and the processes that could make those sales a possibility. Chemical distributors—to obtain a feel for the general market size for some chemicals and the basic handling and distribution procedures for various chemicals. Engineering Companies—to evaluate different production processes and review general trends in the market. Engineering and Chemistry Students—to learn more about practical applications of the principals that they have experienced in their classrooms and laboratories.

A "product" is anything that is tangibly used, touched, or consumed. This type of insurance is recommended for every business that manufactures a product but is especially important for companies that produce food, clothing, toys or anything else that could conceivably cause harm to someone.
Most business owner's policies include limited product liability coverage. If, for some reason, you do not have this coverage through a business owner's policy and your product runs the risk of inflicting harm on other people, you may need to buy product liability separately. Similarly, if your product presents a higher risk of injury (for example, it contains a hazardous material), you may need to purchase additional coverage.
Gary Maxwell Insurance Agency offers free, comparative quotes on product liability insurance from multiple insurance carriers so you can get the best possible rate.

You want to have the confidence that the business you've built is covered by a company that understands your business insurance needs.
Commercial business insurance provides wide-ranging protection for businesses and their subsidiaries under a single policy. There are various types of commercial business insurance that take care of property, liability and workers' compensation, to name a few. While property insurance covers damages to business property and products stored within the premises; liability insurance provides coverage for damages to third parties; and workers' compensation insurance covers injuries to employees.
Commercial business insurance is an important aspect of any business that cannot be ignored especially if the business premises are leased or rented and even otherwise. Whatever your commercial insurance needs, we can design a protection program that's right for you.

Item Description: Springer Science+Business Media, United States, 2004. Hardback. Book Condition: New. 2004 ed.. Language: English . This book usually ship within 10-15 business days and we will endeavor to dispatch orders quicker than this where possible. Brand New Book. Industrial products that are made from, or contain, nitrogen are described in parts of some encyclopedias and standard reference works. However it is not always simple to determine from these varied sources the present status of the technology and markets for various nitrogen products. We therefore perceived a need for a text that provides a comprehensive description of: 1) products that are made from or that contain nitrogen; 2) the processes that produce these products; and 3) the markets that consume these products. I have attempted to present the material in a standardized format that should make this book easy to use and helpful to the readers. The standard format for each product is: Introduction, Process, Production, and Uses, with some variations in different chapters. This book provides information that could be used by a wide range of readers: Fertilizer companies-to evaluate different production processes and review general trends in the market. Basic chemical companies-to evaluate different production processes and review general trends in the market.Specialty chemical companies-to investigate new chemical production and/or sales opportunities and the processes that could make those sales a possibility. Chemical distributors-to obtain a feel for the general market size for some chemicals and the basic handling and distribution procedures for various chemicals. Engineering Companies-to evaluate different production processes and review general trends in the market. Engineering and Chemistry Students-to learn more about practical applications of the principals that they have experienced in their classrooms and laboratories.
