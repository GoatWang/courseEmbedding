How do Provisional Patent Applications Work?
Make sure you understand exactly how they work, keeping in mind they only last for 12 months and are only useful if you eventually convert it into a non-provisional patent app!
LEARN MORE ABOUT PROVISIONAL PATENT APPS









Should I request a patent search?
It's the first step before a patent application! First, you learn how patentable your invention may be. If it's not very patentable, don't waste time and money on a patent app. Second, it may help you increase your patentability. By seeing what is similar, you can improve your invention around other existing invention and increase patentability.

TOBAM – Diversification, Diversification, Diversification …

		Posted on November 25, 2016 by Yves Rebetez in Insight Articles 


The well worn axiom in Real Estate is – location, location, location.
For Paris-based TOBAM, whose founder Yves Choueifaty we had the pleasure of sitting down with in Toronto recently, the corresponding mantra could well be Diversification, Diversification, Diversification… and, more Diversification.
What does TOBAM seek to bring to the table in a world where “Passive does not equal Neutral”? Respectively one where  beyond passive, “Smart Beta” or “Factor” based strategies increasingly are crowding the product shelf? Answer: the “Undiversifiable” portfolio.
Bottom line – It was probably high time we had a mathematician solve for “diversification”. As with TOBAM, this now appears to be “chose faite”, the question could be – will investors grab onto the diversification factor, one which come 2017 could arguably become increasingly useful?
What we know in the Smart Beta field, is that the enticement of Yield, and the premise of getting lower volatility, have both had a very significant gravitational pull to them for investors. As proper diversification is a key tenet of portfolio construction, will it resonate with them and correspondingly, attract significant assets? And if diversification alone doesn’t do it for them, will knowing that SRI filters are also part of the recipe be what clenches the deal? (TOBAM commingled equity funds’investment universes are filtered based upon the Norges Bank Investment Management SRI recommendations).
In Canada, Mackenzie Investments has launched 5 TOBAM based ETFs (2 in June when it joined the ranks of Canadian ETFs providers, 3 more since) created to help protect a portfolio from equity market biases, sector concentration and unmanaged risks. By increasing diversification and reducing biases, these equity ETFs seek to enhance risk-adjusted returns for investors.
The ETFs are managed through a partnership with TOBAM, a France based independent asset manager.  The goal of the investment strategy at TOBAM is to achieve the optimal beta through diversification and to spread risk evenly throughout the portfolio. Mackenzie’s Maximum Diversification ETF’s replicate and track proprietary indices provided by TOBAM’s Maximum Diversification Index Series.
TOBAM was among the founders of the “Smart-Beta” movement in 2005.  The firm has been awarded twice in 2015 for its pioneering role in the foundation of the alternative/smart beta movement, as well as more recently being recognized as “European Asset manager of the Year” by Funds Europe Awards in London.
TOBAM uses an innovative methodology to select and weight individual stocks to significantly reduce correlations between holdings.  The strategy is based on Mr. Choueifaty’s development of a formal measure of diversification, Diversification Ratio. While we know that diversification is a good way to manage risk as it reduces volatility and enhances the risk-adjusted returns, the problem was that there has not been a universally agreed mathematical measure of diversification. TOBAM’s research led to defining a mathematical measure, the Diversification Ratio, which provides TOBAM with a systematic approach for building well diversified portfolios.
The theory is that this approach will result in the most neutral possible portfolio, taking no bets on style or valuation – focusing instead on “capturing the full equity market risk premium”. Mr. Choueifaty notes that he may be the only portfolio manager who does not make any predictions about the future or whether or not a stock is valued properly. He may be the only active manager that is not looking to add ‘alpha’.
TOBAM’s objective is to maximize diversification in order to capture the risk premium of an asset class, in other words, to provide the optimal ‘beta’.  He notes that while many managers focus on capturing ‘alpha’ to contribute to performance, less attention may be dedicated to improving ‘beta’ which often provides the major contribution to performance, and to risk.
TOBAM believes the error with passive investing is that more money is constantly being allocated to overvalued stocks, those with the largest weights in the market. Hence, Passive does not equal Neutral. Active portfolio managers generally adhere to an investing strategy/style, such as growth, value or momentum. To invest in one of these styles is to assume that the investment trends will continue to provide positive returns, and that the manager will continue to select the best holdings to benefit from those trends, which may or may not be correct. Getting these bets right can be very challenging, particularly in the current environment.  TOBAM’s strategy differentiates itself in that the managers are not making any assumptions or forecasts about future returns or which strategies/styles will outperform and which ones will underperform.  The key goal is to maximize and provide the optimal ‘beta’, thereby enhancing returns and reducing volatility over a market cycle.
 

The Anti-Benchmark® strategy is designed to create portfolios proposing to lie closer to the ex-post efficient frontier than the market cap portfolio over a market cycle. Anti-Benchmark® portfolios access the available risk premium in a risk efficient manner and are intending to typically enhance performance vs. the benchmark by 3%-5% p.a. via greater diversification for equity portfolios, while also reducing volatility by 20-30% per annum over a market cycle. For credit portfolios, the strategy endeavours to outperform the benchmark by 1-2% per annum with less volatility as well
Source: TOBAM
The crux of the strategy is that holding a large number of assets does not necessarily mean the portfolio is optimally diversified, rather, it is that the portfolio must be exposed to a diversified number of sources of risk for optimal diversification. While a portfolio with 500 holdings may at first appear well diversified, if all 500 stocks are highly correlated to the price of oil, that portfolio is not very well diversified. TOBAM’s unique approach and formula seeks to maximize diversification of the portfolio by reducing the correlation of the various holdings.

At the sector level, the difference in exposure to financials and energy is notable.  Not surprisingly, XIU, which replicates the S&P/TSX 60, has significantly higher financials and energy weights, at 39.2% and 21.1% respectively. In contrast, MKC’s exposure to these sectors is significantly lower, at 22.2% and 9.1% respectively (the offsets are significantly greater consumer, technology, and telecom exposures).
In addition to MKC, Mackenzie also offers other Maximum Diversification ETFs:

Mackenzie Maximum Diversification All-World Developed Index ETF (MWD),
Mackenzie Maximum Diversification All-World Developed Ex-North America Index (MXU),
Mackenzie Maximum Diversification Developed Europe Index (MEU),
and Mackenzie Maximum Diversification U.S. Index (MUS).

 
“Smart Beta” in Canada: 
In the ETF World, when looking to invest in stocks, aside from traditional pure passive indexing, investors are faced with an ever expanding array of choices – most notably in the fast growing “Smart Beta” product shelf.
Checking-in on the uptake of “Smart Beta” in Canada, “Smart Beta” solutions have been growing at close to twice the pace of the overall ETF space (47.3% y/o/y to Oct 31, 2016 for smart beta, vs 24.8% for the overall product group), with Smart Beta AUM of some $21.6 Billion corresponding or close to 1/3 of overall equity AUM in the Canadian ETFs space).
A look across the traditional factors identified by MSCI Inc. :

Value,
Momentum,
Size,
Quality,
Yield,
and finally Volatility (low and min)

also including the more recently introduced Multi-Factors category, shows a category dominated by Yield, Volatility, and Size in Canada (though size here is a misnomer, in that including Equal Weight here overlooks the fact that equally weighting across US sectors such as Healthcare, and Banking, doesn’t exactly get one close to a pure “size” effect), claiming the bulk of the Assets, and therefore growth generated in recent years:

ETFs providing “Factor”, or “Multi-Factor” solutions provide ready access to desired / desirable investment attributes, which over time have proven to produce a risk premia for investors. The challenge, or issue? Factors can be in, or out of favor, and could spend lengthy periods in the “underperforming” category, testing investors’ patience in the process. In addition, it isn’t inconceivable that factors with long track records of delivering a risk premia could, on occasion, become the object of “crowded trades” subsequently translating into – worse case scenario – subpar returns…

Maximum Diversification®
Our Investment Philosophy

 






TOBAM’s investment philosophy is based on maximizing diversification in order to capture the risk premium of an asset class. While many managers focus upon ‘alpha’ to contribute to performance, less attention may be dedicated to improving ‘beta’ which often provides the major contribution to performance and risk. The most common way for investors to obtain ‘beta’ exposure is through a market cap-weighted strategy; however, academic and practitioner research shows that other strategies for gaining ‘beta’ exposure regularly outperform the market cap weighted strategies, leading to inefficiencies in the allocation. TOBAM believes that these inefficiencies arise from insufficient diversification in the market cap-weighted strategy.
Decades of academic studies since Harry Markowitz (1959) and William Sharpe (1964) have explained why diversification should play a key role in portfolios’s asset allocation.
Yves Choueifaty after years of academic research introduced a measure of diversification: the Diversification Ratio®. The details of this were initially published in 2006 in the United States Patent and Trademark Office (Choueifaty, “Methods and Systems for Providing an Anti-Benchmark Portfolio, May 2006) and later in 2008 in the Journal of Portfolio Management [Choueifaty & Al, “Toward Maximum Diversification” Fall 2008].
TOBAM’s Anti-Benchmark® strategy is based on the Maximum Diversification® approach, designed to maximize the degree of diversification when selecting the weighting of assets in the portfolio allocation process. The Diversification Ratio® is maximized to produce a portfolio designed to access risk premium evenly from all the effective independent sources of risk available in the market at any given time. TOBAM’s approach is fully quantitative and does not use any predictions of expected return, neither for the assets nor for any underlying risk factors.
		
 












Maximum Diversification®
The Anti-Benchmark® Strategy

 






The Anti-Benchmark® strategy aims to capture the full risk premium of an asset class available by maximizing diversification, delivering outperformance whilst reducing volatility.

 




 


The Anti-Benchmark® strategy is designed to create portfolios proposing to lie closer to the ex-post efficient frontier than the market cap portfolio over a market cycle. Anti-Benchmark® portfolios access the available risk premium in a risk efficient manner and intend to typically enhance performance vs. the benchmark by 3%-5% p.a. via greater diversification for equity portfolios, while also reducing volatility by 20-30% per annum over a market cycle. For credit portfolios, the strategy endeavours to outperform the benchmark by 1-2% per annum with less volatility as well.

Maximum Diversification®
In the Beginning was…RESEARCH

 








 


The Maximum Diversification® approach and Anti-Benchmark® model were developed and refined in-house, and are maintained by the Research team. 18 investment professionals are involved in research, working on a day to day basis to increase the theoretical foundation for the Anti-Benchmark® investment approach – making it one of the largest, if not the largest, research team dedicated to a single investment strategy in the asset management industry. Research is organized around three areas (theoretical support, implementation innovation and product research)
		
 



Theoretical Support:


Discover, explore and obtain a full understanding of potential new sources of risk premium
Although research may be technical and mathematical in nature, we strive to produce results that make common financial and economic sense, and can be intuitively explained to our investors and partners.
Share our knowledge with a selected audience, through our ties with leading academic institutions, leading long-term investors as well as renowned academic journals.

 

Implementation Innovation: Develop and refine applications for the Anti-Benchmark® investment approach

 

Product research & Development: Pursue innovation and new product development


 



TOBAM’s research effort is led by Tristan Froidure, who has over 18 years of investment experience researching and developing quantitative investment and trading strategies. The research department makes recommendations to the Executive Committee on potential improvements in the implementation of investment strategies. The Head of Research works closely with Yves Choueifaty to set the company’s research agenda.

“The Bourbaki Spirit”
By Tristan Froidure, Head of Research
In the 1930s a group of French mathematicians came together to reformulate modern mathematics from a perfectly rigorous, self-contained point of view. The group used the pseudonym Nicolas Bourbaki.
Here at TOBAM, we believe in what we call ‘the Bourbaki spirit’. We share Bourbaki’s refusal of concepts that are not precisely defined. We dedicate a significant amount of time focusing on definitions, which we view as a prerequisite to conducting sound and original research work.
This means we avoid using conventional wisdom when it uses unclear definitions. While our goal is not to produce an encyclopaedic and formidable body of work such as the “Éléments de mathématique”, this spirit has a distinctive influence on our approach. Our common research path involves going from clear definitions to establishing mathematical properties and then – and only then – conducting empirical tests to verify what could be expected from theoretical results.
Having these high research standards, we place a lot of efforts on research and have built a team of researchers and portfolio managers – who participate in or lead research initiatives – that are highly skilled, experienced and diversified. The three main research axes of our research team are:

Theoretical research, which includes portfolio construction, (essentially) convex optimization, statistics & econometrics.
Implementation research, in order to develop and refine the Anti-Benchmark approaches.
Generalization research: apply research results to other environments.

We work with some of the most sophisticated institutional investors in the world and we consider that applying our expertise and research capabilities to their complex challenges is a crucial step in building a solid and grounded research team. On top of our three main research axis, we hence spend a significant amount of our research efforts finding customized answers to challenging issues raised by our clients, in an effort to ensure no stone is unturned.
A diversified and effective research team
The team is encouraged to be as “out of the box” in its approach to ‘conventional wisdoms’ as possible. As such the diversity of the team is a critical part of how well it functions. We have a large range of expertise, from highly skilled mathematicians, engineers, economists, traders, all of which feeds in to the team’s ability to look at problems or assumptions from a very broad spectrum of viewpoints. Furthermore, research is conducted without a formal hierarchy. When it comes to their work, researchers are encouraged to exchange and develop ideas free from the constraints of a pecking order, which affords the team considerable freedom in their research approach and takes full advantage of the diversity of the team.
The team has a strong academic contingent, but our main goal is to focus on our own research projects and to focus less on academic literature to feed into our research process. In fact, publishing our results in the form of academic level papers internally is one of our main research goals. Indeed, the process of summarising our findings provides additional coherence to our work, and helps us focus on delivering research of the highest standard.
We first share our findings with our clients, which contributes to set the foundations of a knowledge sharing spirit. We have also published articles in journals to benefit from open debate from time to time. In the end, our ultimate agenda is to serve our clients and being fully dedicated to their needs and projects.
Research Transparency: an intelligent investment
TOBAM’s flagship portfolio construction method (Most Diversified Portfolio, or MDP) has been published for all to see. In fact, we like to think of ourselves as a ‘crystal box’, disclosing and openly discussing what we do with our clients. In today’s financial world, which has been rocked by a series of scandals, clever transparency is a winning bet. I think we would have fewer assets under management if we operated as a ‘black box’. Being transparent has also helped us systematically focus on and improve the weakest parts of our approach – a chain is only as strong as its weakest link.
Finally, we have always viewed transparency as a necessary condition for being taken seriously by large institutional investors.
We believe that the real world incarnation of the MDP under the brand “Anti-Benchmark” has the potential to replace traditional market capitalization weighted benchmarks as a core portfolio. This is thanks to its intrinsic qualities, and to the many resources TOBAM dedicates to transparent research.
Simple ideas are beautiful
I personally believe that the “best” ideas are simple, in Khalil Gibran[1]’s sense: “The obvious is that which is never seen until someone expresses it simply.” Take for example the notion of Portfolio Diversification which TOBAM first introduced in 2006. Its formulation is very simple and is becoming obvious today to Asset Management practitioners, academics and students. Ten years after its first publication, the research we are conducting today is still leading us to very exciting new results that are directly connected to it.

TOBAM’s proprietary methodology is a proven process for increasing the diversification of portfolio holdings to protect portfolios from structural bias and unmanaged risks often found in cap-weighted indices.The introduction today of these mutual funds follows the launch of two Mackenzie TOBAM focused ETFs: Mackenzie Maximum Diversification Canada Index ETF (MKC) and Mackenzie Maximum Diversification US Index ETF (MUS).“TOBAM’s award-winning methodology is now exclusively available through Mackenzie Investments as both ETFs and mutual funds to help all Canadian retail investors address their evolving needs,” said Michael Schnitman, Senior Vice President, Product, for Mackenzie Investments.  “We are pleased to offer this unique investment methodology to Canadian retail investors who are seeking better diversification to potentially outperform benchmarks.”TOBAM’s innovative methodology selects individual stocks and their weights so as to significantly reduce the correlations between individual holdings. In so doing, it utilizes a well-established principle in investment management that all other things being equal, a portfolio with higher diversification has a higher risk adjusted return than a less diversified portfolio.  Mackenzie Investments Mutual FundsThe mutual funds invest in the Mackenzie Maximum Diversification Index ETFs and may also invest a portion of its assets in other ETFs, or in securities directly:Mackenzie High Diversification Canadian Equity Class: Offered in a corporate class structure, it allows Canadians to invest in their own country while diversifying beyond Canada’s top three market sectors: Energy, Materials and Financials.Mackenzie High Diversification US Equity Fund: Gives investors access to the world’s largest and most diverse stock market.           About Mackenzie InvestmentsMackenzie Investments was founded in 1967, and is a leading investment management firm providing investment advisory and related services.
