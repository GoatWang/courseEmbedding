16 accessible and adventurous new songs
Stephen Dean knows how good it is for parishes to explore new and challenging music outside their familiar repertoire. It helps the entire community to grow -- musically and spiritually. Holy Gifts, his latest collection, gathers 16 of his best new songs from the past ten years.

Intricate and rewarding arrangements
Written in a style that's both accessible and adventurous, the songs cover Christmas, Palm Sunday, Holy Thursday, Pentecost and Ordinary Time. Cantors and choirs will find arrangements that are intricate and rewarding. Accompaniment is primarily piano or organ, with splendid parts for woodwinds, brass and strings.

Hymns, psalms, Gospel acclamations
The collection includes hymns, three responsorial psalms, a Gospel acclamation and music for the Liturgy of the Hours and the sacraments. A versatile piece for Holy Thursday, "Faith, Hope and Love" offers the choice of two texts, original verses by Stephen and the traditional "Ubi Caritas."

Communion processionals, Christmas songs
Inspired by the idea of sancta sanctis, "holy things (or gifts) for holy people," from eastern liturgies, the title song is a gorgeous processional chant for Communion. Other highlights include "May Love Be Ours," with text by Timothy Dudley Smith, and "Only the Shepherds," a Christmas song set to a lovely Catalan folk melody.

Modern music in the English choral tradition
A founding member of the St. Thomas More Group, Stephen Dean is one of the best modern composers in the English choral tradition. Holy Gifts will bless the cathedrals and small parishes that welcome these beautifully written new works into their repertoire.

Description


Following in the tradition of the St. Thomas More Group, this collection of liturgical compositions by Stephen Dean features several musical styles: traditional, choral, contemporary ballads and hymns. It features music for Eucharist, baptisms, funerals, and morning prayer, as well as seasonal selections for Advent, Christmas, Lent, and Easter. Also featured is the beautiful Magnificat by Anne Ward -- not a setting of the biblical text, but a rendition on the events of Mary's life.

Walk with Christ is designed to use a wide range of instruments, making it adaptable to whatever resources you have at hand. Small ensembles and cathedral choirs alike will enjoy singing these pieces.

16 accessible and adventurous new songs
Stephen Dean knows how good it is for parishes to explore new and challenging music outside their familiar repertoire. It helps the entire community to grow -- musically and spiritually. Holy Gifts, his latest collection, gathers 16 of his best new songs from the past ten years.

Intricate and rewarding arrangements
Written in a style that's both accessible and adventurous, the songs cover Christmas, Palm Sunday, Holy Thursday, Pentecost and Ordinary Time. Cantors and choirs will find arrangements that are intricate and rewarding. Accompaniment is primarily piano or organ, with splendid parts for woodwinds, brass and strings.

Hymns, psalms, Gospel acclamations
The collection includes hymns, three responsorial psalms, a Gospel acclamation and music for the Liturgy of the Hours and the sacraments. A versatile piece for Holy Thursday, "Faith, Hope and Love" offers the choice of two texts, original verses by Stephen and the traditional "Ubi Caritas."

Communion processionals, Christmas songs
Inspired by the idea of sancta sanctis, "holy things (or gifts) for holy people," from eastern liturgies, the title song is a gorgeous processional chant for Communion. Other highlights include "May Love Be Ours," with text by Timothy Dudley Smith, and "Only the Shepherds," a Christmas song set to a lovely Catalan folk melody.

Modern music in the English choral tradition
A founding member of the St. Thomas More Group, Stephen Dean is one of the best modern composers in the English choral tradition. Holy Gifts will bless the cathedrals and small parishes that welcome these beautifully written new works into their repertoire.

Description


Following in the tradition of the St. Thomas More Group, this collection of liturgical compositions by Stephen Dean features several musical styles: traditional, choral, contemporary ballads and hymns. It features music for Eucharist, baptisms, funerals, and morning prayer, as well as seasonal selections for Advent, Christmas, Lent, and Easter. Also featured is the beautiful Magnificat by Anne Ward -- not a setting of the biblical text, but a rendition on the events of Mary's life.

Walk with Christ is designed to use a wide range of instruments, making it adaptable to whatever resources you have at hand. Small ensembles and cathedral choirs alike will enjoy singing these pieces.

Bio
Stephen Dean, of the St. Thomas More Group, works for Decani Music, OCP’s agent in the United Kingdom. He is editor and publisher of Laudate, a successful hymnal which since 1999 has established a leading position in Britain. Stephen is also music advisor to the Diocese of East Anglia, and leads the music in the small parish where much of his music published by OCP was first performed.
Stephen’s songs are both accessible and adventurous. In his collection Holy Gifts, cantors and choirs will find arrangements that are intricate and rewarding. Along with Christopher Walker, Bernadette Farrell, Paul Inwood, Anne Quigley and other composers, Stephen founded the St. Thomas More Group, a parish-based study center in 1969. The center closed in 1995.
Stephen Dean lives in Suffolk in the UK.
