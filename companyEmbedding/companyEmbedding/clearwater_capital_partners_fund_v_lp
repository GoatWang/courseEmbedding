Philosophy
Approach



Philosophy
Clearwater Capital Partners believes that Asian economies are at a point where investment value – and the value added to investments – comes from an ability to help company owners and management deal with over-indebtedness or a poor capital structure.
To achieve this, Clearwater further believes that the mandate to make decisions must reside in local markets, where significant differences exist across often-complex regulatory, legal and political jurisdictions. From offices strategically located in New York, Hong Kong, Singapore, Mumbai, Seoul and Chongqing, Clearwater's employees currently represent the firm with at least 18 nationalities and 21 languages. Drawing on the country-specific knowledge it has accumulated, the firm has achieved the position of being consistently sought after for its demonstrated restructuring expertise and execution capabilities in complex situations across currencies and cultures.
Clearwater's efforts to cultivate a uniquely trained and experienced investment team are another essential component of its investment philosophy. Selectively recruited, "best-in-class" personnel are welcomed to the firm in relative proportion to rapidly expanding special situation opportunities in the firm's targeted, high-growth economies. By continually enhancing the depth of its capabilities, particularly in research and asset management, and availing itself of state-of-the-art systems, structures and controls, Clearwater seeks to identify, develop and nurture balanced positions characterized by stable, steady returns and targeted upside potential.

Country Exposure
Industry Exposure



			Clearwater Capital Partners' portfolio consists primarily of public and private debt, equity or other instruments issued by financially distressed or stressed enterprises in Asian credit markets. The firm's investment strategy is focused on building diversified holdings of non-correlated, cash-generating instruments that provide natural exits and are sourced from niche segments of the region's distressed market, where borrowers have demonstrated an ability and willingness to pay creditors.

			Clearwater's goal in its strategy is to limit risk and volatility while maximizing current returns and identifying targeted upside potential in the firm's portfolios. This is accomplished through the firm's investment philosophy; a disciplined investment approach that draws on Clearwater's in-depth, proprietary research; and sophisticated portfolio management conducted by market-seasoned professionals.
