SuperCom Ltd. announced that it has secured, together with its local partner, a contract with the Ministry of Justice of Denmark to deploy its PureSecurity Electronic Monitoring Suite, a solution aimed at increasing public safety, reducing prison overcrowding and lowering recidivism by tracking and monitoring public offenders. The comprehensive nationwide program, set to encompass all electronic monitoring (EM) of offender programs within the country, is planned to monitor up to 1000 enrollees simultaneously, and approximately 500 enrollees simultaneously in the initial deployment period. SuperCom will deploy its PureSecurity electronic monitoring solution, which will include home detention, and monitoring inside designated departure facilities.

HERZLIYA, ISRAEL -- (Marketwired) -- 07/13/17 --
        SuperCom(NASDAQ:SPCB), a global provider of secure solutions for the e-Government, Public Safety, HealthCare, and Finance sectors, today announced that it has secured, together with its local partner, a contract with the Ministry of Justice of Denmark to deploy its PureSecurity Electronic Monitoring Suite, a solution aimed at increasing public safety, reducing prison overcrowding and lowering recidivism by tracking and monitoring public offenders.
The comprehensive nationwide program, set to encompass all electronic monitoring (EM) of offender programs within the country, is planned to monitor up to 1000 enrollees simultaneously, and approximately 500 enrollees simultaneously in the initial deployment period. SuperCom will deploy its PureSecurity electronic monitoring solution, which will include home detention, and monitoring inside designated departure facilities. 
The incumbent vendor who held this contract for the past twelve years, as well as another industry leader took part in the competitive bid, which included negotiations with the contracting authority. The contract is spread over a term of 4 years, including an initial deployment period followed by 43 months of ongoing service. The budget consists mainly of costs for purchasing the electronic monitoring system and equipment, as well as recurring maintenance and support charges. The contract has been signed, and SuperCom expects to deploy the program and start generating recurring revenues within 3 months.
 "This national program represents an important win for us, signaling the market's recognition of our superior products and technologies and strategically positioning us to win additional tenders in well-established EM national programs in the Europe region," commented Mr. Arie Trabelsi, President and CEO of SuperCom.

SuperCom wins Czech tender for ankle monitors supply again

 The SuperCom firm, which won a Czech tender for the supply of ankle monitors for convicts and some suspects in February but the result was scrapped for lack of transparency, has won a new tender again, Justice Ministry's spokeswoman Tereza Schejbalova announced today.
The first tender, organised by the ministry-controlled Probation and Mediation Service, was challenged by the anti-trust office (UOHS) as opaque and the organisers eventually scrapped the result.
Afterwards, the Probation and Mediation Service formed a new tender commission and launched a new tender, which was won by the same company, Schejbalova said.
"I appreciate it that the new commission confirmed that we chose a quality supplier in the previous tender. I believe that nothing will prevent the introduction of electronic tagging any more," Justice Minister Robert Pelikan (ANO) said.
In the first phase, SuperCom will supply 280 electronic ankle monitors to the ministry, ensure a monitoring centre's operation and organise instructive courses for the staff, all worth 15.5 million crowns.
In the six years to follow, the ministry, or the Probation and Mediation Service, is to have up to 2,000 monitors at its disposal.
The ministry has been striving to introduce the electronic tagging for many years, but several previous tenders were scrapped.
In the latest tender, SuperCom emerged victorious from among six bidders.
The ankle monitors will be used to check convicts and some suspects under house arrest more effectively. Their advantage is that the monitored persons remain in contact with their families and can go to work, the ministry says.© Pakistan Press International, source Asianet-Pakistan

SuperCom and IMPINJ are both small-cap industrial products companies, but which is the better investment? We will contrast the two companies based on the strength of their dividends, valuation, profitabiliy, institutional ownership, risk, analyst recommendations and earnings. 20.9% of SuperCom shares are held by institutional investors.

SuperCom Group Wins Multi-Year National Electronic Monitoring Contract in Denmark
Jul 13 17
SuperCom Ltd. announced that it has secured, together with its local partner, a contract with the Ministry of Justice of Denmark to deploy its PureSecurity Electronic Monitoring Suite, a solution aimed at increasing public safety, reducing prison overcrowding and lowering recidivism by tracking and monitoring public offenders. The comprehensive nationwide program, set to encompass all electronic monitoring (EM) of offender programs within the country, is planned to monitor up to 1000 enrollees simultaneously, and approximately 500 enrollees simultaneously in the initial deployment period. SuperCom will deploy its PureSecurity electronic monitoring solution, which will include home detention, and monitoring inside designated departure facilities. The incumbent vendor who held this contract for the past twelve years, as well as another industry leader took part in the competitive bid, which included negotiations with the contracting authority. The contract is spread over a term of 4 years, including an initial deployment period followed by 43 months of ongoing service. The budget consists mainly of costs for purchasing the electronic monitoring system and equipment, as well as recurring maintenance and support charges. The contract has been signed, and SuperCom expects to deploy the program and start generating recurring revenues within 3 months.
