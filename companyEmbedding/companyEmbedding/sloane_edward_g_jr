referred to as the “Effective Date”), by and between
First Business Financial Services, Inc. (the
“Company”), a Wisconsin corporation, and Edward G.
Sloane, Jr. (the “Executive”).

WHEREAS,
the Company recognizes that circumstances may arise in which a
Change in Control involving the Company occurs, through acquisition
or otherwise, thereby causing uncertainty of employment without
regard to the Executive’s competence or past contributions.
Such uncertainty may result in the loss of the valuable services of
the Executive to the detriment of the Company and its shareholders;
and

WHEREAS,
both the Company and the Executive are desirous that any proposal
for a Change in Control will be considered by the Executive
objectively and with reference only to the business interests of
the Company and its shareholders; and

WHEREAS,
the Executive will be in a better position to consider the
Company’s best interests if the Executive is afforded
reasonable security, as provided in this Agreement, against altered
conditions of employment which could result from any such Change in
Control.

NOW,
THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and of the mutual
covenants and agreements of the parties set forth in this
Agreement, and of other good and valuable consideration, the

that is remedied by the Company promptly after receipt of notice

terminate employment for Good Reason shall not be affected by the

constituting Good Reason herein.

separation from service with the Company due to a termination of
the Executive’s employment within twelve (12) calendar months
after a Change in Control by reason of death, Disability, the
Executive’s voluntary termination without Good Reason, or the
Company’s involuntary termination of the Executive’s
employment for Cause.

2.3    Description
of Severance Benefits .
In the event that the Executive becomes entitled to receive
Severance Benefits, as provided in Sections 2.1 and 2.2 herein, the
Company shall pay to the Executive and provide the Executive with
the following:









(a)



A
lump-sum cash amount equal to the Executive’s unpaid Base
Salary, accrued vacation pay, unreimbursed business expenses, and
all other items earned by and owed to the Executive through and
including the date of the Qualifying Termination. Such payment
shall constitute full satisfaction for these amounts owed to the
Executive.



 









(b)



A
lump-sum cash amount payable to the Executive under any annual
bonus plan then in effect in respect of the most recently completed
fiscal year, to the extent not theretofore paid.



 









(c)



A
cash amount equal to two (2) multiplied by the Executive’s
annual rate of Base Salary in effect upon the date of the
Qualifying Termination or, if greater, by the Executive’s
annual rate of Base Salary in effect immediately prior to the
occurrence of the Change in Control. Such cash amount shall be paid
out in four (4) equal semiannual installments, with the initial
payment to occur on the pay period following the (6) month
anniversary of the Executive’s Effective Date of Termination.
The three (3) remaining installments shall then be paid out, one
each at the end of successive six (6) month intervals following the
initial payment until all installments have been paid in
full.



 









(d)



A
cash amount equal to the greater of: (i) the Executive’s
then-current target bonus opportunity established under any annual
bonus plan for the plan year in which the Qualifying Termination
occurs; or (ii) the Executive’s target bonus opportunity, if
any, in effect prior to the occurrence of the Change in Control.
Such payment shall be adjusted on a pro rata basis based on the
number of days the Executive was actually employed during such plan
year and shall be paid in four (4) equal semiannual installments at
the times and in the manner set forth in subsection (c) above. Such
payment shall constitute full satisfaction for this amount owed to
the Executive.



 









(e)



If
as of the Effective Date of Termination the Company continues to
maintain a group health insurance plan that would allow for the
participation of the Executive without violating the terms of the
group health insurance plan (or any other related insurance
policies) or violating any of the Code’s nondiscrimination
requirements applicable to the health insurance coverage, then the
Company shall provide, at the exact same cost to the Executive, and
at the same coverage level as in effect as of the Effective Date
of




 


5
 




 

Termination
(subject to changes in coverage levels applicable to all employees
generally), a continuation of the Executive’s (and the
Executive’s eligible dependents’) health insurance
coverage for eighteen (18) months from the Effective Date of
Termination. The applicable COBRA health insurance benefit
continuation period shall begin coincident with the beginning of
this eighteen (18) month benefit continuation period.
Notwithstanding
the health benefits provided above, if the Executive becomes
covered under the health insurance coverage of a subsequent
employer which does not contain any exclusion or limitation with
respect to any preexisting condition of the Executive or the
Executive’s eligible dependents, this health insurance
benefit coverage by the Company shall be discontinued
prior
