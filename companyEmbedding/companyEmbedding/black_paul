(WXYZ) - There's a new consumer alert on something you may buy all the time.
Are you getting what you pay for when you purchase hair care products? At least one brand says what's sold in big retail stores may not be what you think. You can find Paul Mitchell shampoo at retail stores like Target, but the company's reps say you can't be sure it's the real deal.
"It's either counterfeit, tampered with or black market," says Robert Cromeans, the Global Artistic Director for John Paul Mitchell Systems, commonly called "Paul Mitchell."
"We don't sell to these outlets. We only sell to salons like mine or around the world," he says. However, Action News found Paul Mitchell products in Target, CVS and Walgreens. "The fact of the matter is... they aren't buying directly from us," he says.
The company says it has contracts with distributors that are only in the professional hair care industry. The distributors then sell the products to the salons. Somewhere in that chain, Paul Mitchell says a wholesaler gets involved and buys the product in what the company calls a "back door" deal. The product then ends up on retail store shelves where it should never be.
"That product could be old... it could be tampered with... it could be counterfeit. The product is not going to be first-quality," says Vikki Bresnahan who is in charge of brand protection at the company.
She says old products don't perform well and counterfeit products could be dangerous. She points out a counterfeit case where the fake Paul Mitchell product had high levels of bacteria. The company says it usually costs more in a drug store or supermarket than it does in a professional salon.
Bresnahan said the products in the stores cost between 50 cents and five dollars more. They say the best way to protect your hair, health and wallet is to buy from a certified salon.

As a short woman this bag is calling my name! Normal crossbodies are way too long on my frame, but since this one is adjustable I can wear it at just the right height. Perfection!!

Our Values
For us, producing the highest quality professional hair care available is simply not enough. John Paul Mitchell Systems is (and always will be) dedicated to making our world a more beautiful place. We were the first professional beauty company to stand up against animal testing and our charitable efforts continue to set the standard for giving in our industry. A commitment to caring for people and the planet is a driving force in everything we do.

No Animal Testing
Never Have. Never Will.
In 1980, we became the first professional beauty company to publicly stand up against animal testing. Now, nearly 35 years later, that pledge to our furry friends remains a driving force in all that we do.







Caring For Our Planet
Live Beautifully
Whether we're planting trees, protecting animals or preserving our natural resources, John Paul Mitchell Systems is (and always has been) dedicated to making our world a more beautiful place.











Product Control
The Real Deal on Diversion
Diversion occurs when professional salon products are sold by unauthorized retailers. Oftentimes these products are old, stolen, counterfeit or tampered with. That's why you should only purchase John Paul Mitchell Systems products within the professional beauty salon industry.







Research & Development
Our product development process begins in our state-of-the-art Product Innovation Center (PIC), in Santa Clarita, California. It's here where our products are researched, formulated and tested (on humans!). From concept to completion, our talented teams work hand-in-hand to perfect every formula and bring our newest innovations to life.







The Awapuhi Farm
Green from the get-go. In 1983, our co-founders established a self-sustaining, solar-powered Awapuhi farm in Hawaii—all of the Awapuhi used in our products is still harvested there today.

I thoroughly enjoy shopping on their website because I always find the unique and hard-to-find plants that are not seen in your typical home improvement store or nursery."
             - Bizrate® survey, Mar ‘17” Source




              I recommend Breck's to family and friends. I give Breck's lily tree bulbs instead of floral arrangements to relatives/friends who have had a death in the family. They are very appreciate of a lovely gift that grows bigger and more beautiful year after year. They look at the lily trees as a beautiful living memorial.  - Bizrate® survey, Nov ‘16” Source
