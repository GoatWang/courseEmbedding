Home » Newsroom Tridib Mazumdar Named Howard R. Gendal Professor of Marketing
 
 5.8.06

 

 

 

 

 

 

 





Tridib Mazumdar, professor of marketing and associate dean for faculty development and research in the Martin J. Whitman School of Management at Syracuse University, has been named the inaugural Howard R. Gendal Professor of Marketing. The Gendal Professorship was named by Steven K. Gendal in honor of his father, who graduated from The College of Arts and Sciences in 1966. 

“The Whitman School is tremendously pleased at the creation of this professorship, and Professor Mazumdar’s outstanding record in teaching and research makes him a natural fit for such an honor,” says Melvin T. Stith, dean of the Whitman School. Mazumdar joined the Whitman School in 1987. In that time, he has been honored with many awards, including the Oberwager Prize, which recognizes faculty for their positive influence on Whitman undergraduates, the Exceptional Teaching Award, and the MBA Student Association Faculty of the Year Award (twice). His research on pricing, reference prices, product valuation, and product development and been published in top marketing journals, and he serves on the editorial review boards of the Journal of Retailing, Pricing Strategy and Practice, and International Journal of Business Innovation and Research. Mazumdar is the director of the Earl V. Snyder Center for Innovation Management in the Whitman School. 

Mazumdar holds a degree in engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology and a MBA and PhD in business from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University.

Steven Gendal is a 1993 graduate of the Whitman School and is a principal in Whippoorwill Associates Inc., a dedicated distressed investment management firm. Gendal has also established a scholarship for Whitman students in his father's name, to be used as leverage in recruiting top MBA candidates. In fall 2006 the first Howard Gendal Scholar will be named.
