A separate account is a segregated accounting and reporting account held by an insurance company not in, but rather "separate" from its general account. A separate account allows an investor to choose an investment category according to his individual risk tolerance, and desire for performance. An account may be a generic conservative or aggressive investment allocation, or a specific mutual fund-type account. Some offshore companies allow the account owners to specify the type of separate account to open.
Separate accounts in the U.S. markets are often characterized as either managed or non-managed. A managed separate account is synonymous to a mutual fund in the sense that the investments of the separate account are actively managed (such as stocks, bonds or other debt instruments, loans, derivative instruments, etc.). A non-managed separate account is one that invests more "passively" in that it typically owns shares of other managed pools of investments such as mutual fund shares. This is similar to a "fund of funds" whereby the separate account ("fund") simply invests in shares of one or more mutual funds. This arrangement is sometimes more efficient and cost-effective rather than the insurance company maintaining many separate accounts with similar baskets of securities.
Separate accounts are sometimes confused with separately managed accounts (SMAs), which are privately managed investment accounts opened through a brokerage or financial adviser that uses pooled money to buy individual assets. These differ from mutual funds because the investor directly owns the securities instead of owning a share in a pool of securities. Most SMAs require a minimum investment of $100,000 or more.

4. All other terms and provisions of the Agreement not amended herein shall

What is a 'Separate Account'
A separate account is a privately managed investment account opened through a brokerage or financial advisor that uses pooled money to buy individual assets. 2. In the context of variable annuities, these are payments made to an insurance company for the purpose of investing in securities. These securities are kept separate from the insurer's general investments. 

BREAKING DOWN 'Separate Account'
1. This differs from a mutual fund because the investor directly owns the securities instead of owning a share in a pool of securities. Most separate accounts require a minimum investment of $100,000 or more.

VPA
Variable Products Administration
Network Coordination Software for Variable Products

VPA coordinates the activities of normally disparate mainframe/PC computer systems involved with the various Variable Products:

    
Investment systems, which administer the invested assets of a Separate Account, usually Mutual Funds.
Policy Administration systems, which handle the policy liabilities of a Separate Account.
General Ledger systems, which handle the accounting for Separate Accounts.

The VPA system gathers information from, and dispenses information to, these other systems. In low volume installations, much of the input can be manual, but in high volume installations, automation of the input/output is accomplished using various Feed files.

    
Capabilities of the VPA system:


Multiple Life Insurance companies can be handled, which is particularly useful for New York and non-NY affiliated companies.
Mutual Fund assets can be organized and maintained by Fund Manager and/or Fund Custodian and/or Series Fund.
Life Insurance product liabilities are organized by Plans of Business within Lines of Business, which include VA, VLI, Seed Monies, and Pensions.
Within each company, SubAccounts are mapped to the various Asset/Liability classes for minimization of data input. For instance, an NAV for any Mutual Fund need be input only once across all companies, lines of business, etc.
Annuitant SubAccounts are maintained for annuitized VA contracts, with complete communication to the companion Annuity Benefits Administration (ABA) system.
A production and several test environments can be separately maintained to facilitate testing of any new plans, mutual funds or any other system features. Some installations divide the test environments into two levels for separate types of testing, with descriptors such as QA (or Certification), and UAT (or Model Office).

A separate account is a segregated accounting and reporting account held by an insurance company not in, but rather "separate" from its general account. A separate account allows an investor to choose an investment category according to his individual risk tolerance, and desire for performance. An account may be a generic conservative or aggressive investment allocation, or a specific mutual fund-type account. Some offshore companies allow the account owners to specify the type of separate account to open.
Separate accounts in the U.S. markets are often characterized as either managed or non-managed. A managed separate account is synonymous to a mutual fund in the sense that the investments of the separate account are actively managed (such as stocks, bonds or other debt instruments, loans, derivative instruments, etc.). A non-managed separate account is one that invests more "passively" in that it typically owns shares of other managed pools of investments such as mutual fund shares. This is similar to a "fund of funds" whereby the separate account ("fund") simply invests in shares of one or more mutual funds. This arrangement is sometimes more efficient and cost-effective rather than the insurance company maintaining many separate accounts with similar baskets of securities.
Separate accounts are sometimes confused with separately managed accounts (SMAs), which are privately managed investment accounts opened through a brokerage or financial adviser that uses pooled money to buy individual assets. These differ from mutual funds because the investor directly owns the securities instead of owning a share in a pool of securities. Most SMAs require a minimum investment of $100,000 or more.

A separate account is a segregated accounting and reporting account held by an insurance company not in, but rather "separate" from its general account. A separate account allows an investor to choose an investment category according to his individual risk tolerance, and desire for performance. An account may be a generic conservative or aggressive investment allocation, or a specific mutual fund-type account. Some offshore companies allow the account owners to specify the type of separate account to open.
Separate accounts in the U.S. markets are often characterized as either managed or non-managed. A managed separate account is synonymous to a mutual fund in the sense that the investments of the separate account are actively managed (such as stocks, bonds or other debt instruments, loans, derivative instruments, etc.). A non-managed separate account is one that invests more "passively" in that it typically owns shares of other managed pools of investments such as mutual fund shares. This is similar to a "fund of funds" whereby the separate account ("fund") simply invests in shares of one or more mutual funds. This arrangement is sometimes more efficient and cost-effective rather than the insurance company maintaining many separate accounts with similar baskets of securities.
Separate accounts are sometimes confused with separately managed accounts (SMAs), which are privately managed investment accounts opened through a brokerage or financial adviser that uses pooled money to buy individual assets. These differ from mutual funds because the investor directly owns the securities instead of owning a share in a pool of securities. Most SMAs require a minimum investment of $100,000 or more.
