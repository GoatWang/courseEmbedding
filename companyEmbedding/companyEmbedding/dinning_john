Start with good-quality cookware and bakeware.Nothing will receive more wear and tear than your bakeware and cookware sets. Make sure you have all the basics; any 12- or 15-piece set should include a frying pan, a skillet, a saucepan, a stockpot and appropriate lids. To store all your new kitchen equipment, look for a pot rack, pullout cabinet drawers or a rolling kitchen cart. Buy dinnerware and silverware that fits every occasion.Formal dinnerware is great for holidays, but it’s rarely used, which means it’s probably not worth the space it takes up. Try to find something that suits your daily life — you can always spruce up your table using table linens, crystal serveware and other tabletop decor. Really want that fine china? Include a buffet or sideboard in your dining room for additional storage. Don’t take the cheap route for large kitchen appliances.Although it feels great to find a deal, there are some items that are worth the splurge. Because of their frequent use and already expensive price tag, large kitchen appliances are definitely about quality. They don’t need to be top-of-the-line, but a good-quality refrigerator, dishwasher, oven and cooktop/range will last you for years to come, so you won’t have to worry about constantly replacing them. Smaller things, such as a microwave or coffeemaker, don’t have such big price tags, so they can be swapped with very few headaches. Consider what kitchen tools and gadgets you will actually use.We all get wrapped up in the kitchen aisle of big-box stores, with measuring cups, mixing bowls and graters galore. Before you make a purchase, think about how often you will actually use that product. Can openers and kitchen shears make sense for everyone, but baking tools and food scales are specialty purchases based on personal preferences. Browse our kitchen and dining section to find the products you love.

Start with good-quality cookware and bakeware.Nothing will receive more wear and tear than your bakeware and cookware sets. Make sure you have all the basics; any 12- or 15-piece set should include a frying pan, a skillet, a saucepan, a stockpot and appropriate lids. To store all your new kitchen equipment, look for a pot rack, pullout cabinet drawers or a rolling kitchen cart. Buy dinnerware and silverware that fits every occasion.Formal dinnerware is great for holidays, but it’s rarely used, which means it’s probably not worth the space it takes up. Try to find something that suits your daily life — you can always spruce up your table using table linens, crystal serveware and other tabletop decor. Really want that fine china? Include a buffet or sideboard in your dining room for additional storage. Don’t take the cheap route for large kitchen appliances.Although it feels great to find a deal, there are some items that are worth the splurge. Because of their frequent use and already expensive price tag, large kitchen appliances are definitely about quality. They don’t need to be top-of-the-line, but a good-quality refrigerator, dishwasher, oven and cooktop/range will last you for years to come, so you won’t have to worry about constantly replacing them. Smaller things, such as a microwave or coffeemaker, don’t have such big price tags, so they can be swapped with very few headaches. Consider what kitchen tools and gadgets you will actually use.We all get wrapped up in the kitchen aisle of big-box stores, with measuring cups, mixing bowls and graters galore. Before you make a purchase, think about how often you will actually use that product. Can openers and kitchen shears make sense for everyone, but baking tools and food scales are specialty purchases based on personal preferences. Browse our kitchen and dining section to find the products you love.

Shipping & Returns Policy
  View complete shipping
  and returns policy & FAQs.

        


White Glove Shipping
Appropriate for large or fragile items.

      Costs range from $100 for smaller items delivered locally to $1,000+ for extra large
      items transported across the Continental United States. Final cost depends on the size of the items and the
      buyer's location.
    

      Local deliveries typically take about 2 weeks and longer
      distance deliveries typically take about 3-6 weeks.
    
Flat Rate Shipping

      Shipment through recognized carriers such as UPS, FedEx, and USPS. Appropriate for smaller items, most
      accessories and some small furniture.
    

      Costs range from $9 to $299 and up, depending on the size and weight of the item.
    
Delivery is typically 7-10 days
Local Pickup

      Local pickup allows a buyer to avoid shipping costs by picking up an item in person. The buyer must contact the
      seller within five business days of their purchase to coordinate a pickup date and time. Delays may result in
      additional charges.
    
Local Delivery

      As a lower cost alternative, some of our sellers offer local curbside delivery within a limited geography around
      their location. The buyer must contact the seller within five business days of their purchase to coordinate a
      delivery date and time. Delays may result in additional charges.
    

      If additional labor is required to move the item inside or upstairs, buyers should make sure to plan accordingly.
    




Returns & Cancellations

        Except for Local Pickup and Local Delivery, buyers have 48 hours after delivery to inspect
        their item(s) and contact support@chairish.com if they wish
        to return an item. There are no restocking fees, but we deduct outbound and return shipping charges from the
        buyer's original purchase price (+ taxes when applicable). Buyers may not be reimbursed for returns that are not
        received in original condition.
