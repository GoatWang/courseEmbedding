       Aresty Institute of Executive Education
The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania


 
Speaker > Biography
Tom Colligan was appointed Vice Dean of The Wharton School’s Aresty Institute of Executive Education in September 2007.  
 Tom began his career at Lybrand, Ross Brothers & Montgomery (now PricewaterhouseCoopers), after serving in the U.S. Air Force, and was an integral part of PwC’s organizational transition.  During his tenure at PwC, Tom served on the Governing Board and Management Committee, and, subsequent to the merger of Price Waterhouse and Coopers & Lybrand, developed the market strategy for PricewaterhouseCoopers.  In his role as Vice Chairman, Tom was responsible for developing a firm-wide strategy for cultivating and deepening relationships with PwC’s top 100 clients, representing $1.5 billion in revenue.  Tom has hands-on experience with issues of finance, growth and execution in Fortune 500 firms.
 In addition to his corporate responsibilities, Tom has served as a lead partner and a trusted advisor to Fortune 500 firms in a number of industries including Technology, Telecommunications, Pharmaceuticals and Consumer Products.  Prior to spearheading the market strategy and the chairman’s program, Tom had global responsibility for Technology, InfoComm and Entertainment for the audit business.  During his tenure, he grew this practice from 18,000 to more than 22,000 professionals worldwide.  He lead his firm in handling large, complex, high-profile transactions, including the trivestiture of AT&T, the merger of Bell Atlantic and Nynex (now Verizon), the IPO of Lucent, the spinoff of AT&T Wireless, the acquisitions of MediaOne and Liberty Media by AT&T and numerous debt and convertible offerings at AT&T and Wyeth.
 During his career, Tom has been directly responsible for the admission of over 50 partners to PwC.  Many of these partners are now in leadership positions, including industry leaders, office managing partners and global leaders on major accounts.  His passion for mentoring is manifested in training programs he implemented focused on relationship development and client management.  Tom is not only a financial expert, but also a professional supporting others who serve in financial leadership and financial expert positions.
 Tom retired from PricewaterhouseCoopers as a Vice Chairman in June of 2004 and currently serves on the board of Schering Plough and consults to the board of Sharp Electronics.  He previously served on the board of Educational Management Corporation which was sold in a private-equity transaction in 2006.

– USA, CA – Central Garden & Pet Company (NASDAQ:CENT) (NASDAQ:CENTA), a leading innovator, marketer and producer of quality branded products for the lawn and garden and pet supplies markets, today announced that it has appointed two new independent directors, George C. Roeth and Thomas J. Colligan, to the Company’s Board of Directors, effective immediately. The appointment of these directors increases Central’s Board from seven to nine directors.
John Ranelli, President & CEO of Central, said, “We are pleased to welcome George and Tom to Central, each of whom brings strong global financial, operations and marketing expertise to our Board. George has a proven track record of delivering profitable growth at Clorox, and Tom has a strong financial background and significant experience with complex, global transactions. These attributes will be invaluable to Central and meaningfully strengthen our Board. We look forward to their contributions as we continue to position Central for long-term revenue growth and seek to enhance shareholder value.”
Mr. Roeth, age 53, is a 27-year veteran of The Clorox Company, where he held various leadership positions of increasing responsibility and delivered profitable results in challenging and highly competitive business environments. Most recently, from 2013 to 2014, Mr. Roeth served as Chief Operating Officer and Executive Vice President, where he helped successfully lead the execution of the Company’s strategic plan and simultaneously drove global sales, lowered costs and improved customer satisfaction. Previously, Mr. Roeth served as Senior Vice President and General Manager, during which time he was also Chairman of the Board for the Clorox and Procter & Gamble Joint Venture, representing over $1 billion in sales and a unique partnership between two direct competitors. Prior to that, Mr. Roeth served in several senior-level marketing and operations roles at Clorox, including Vice President and General Manager, Vice President of Growth and Marketing, and Vice President of Brand Development, among others. Mr. Roeth holds a Master’s in Business Administration from Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management and a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration from the University of California at Berkeley.
Mr. Colligan, age 70, served in executive roles for 37 years at PriceWaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC), including as the firm’s Vice Chairman from 2001 to 2004. While at PwC, Mr. Colligan developed a firm-wide strategy for cultivating relationships with PwC’s top clients, in addition to serving as lead partner on several complex, high-profile transactions across a number of industries, including consumer products, technology, telecommunications, and pharmaceuticals. After retiring from PwC in 2004, Mr. Colligan worked for two years as managing director at Duke Corporate Education before becoming Vice Dean of Executive Education at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School until 2010. During his time at Wharton, Mr. Colligan established new programs and grew the business by more than 50 percent. Mr. Colligan currently serves on the Boards of The ADT Corporation, and The Targus Corporation, and consults to the Board of Sharp Electronics. He previously served on the Boards of CNH Global, Office Depot, Inc., Schering Plough Corporation, Educational Management Corporation, and Anesiva, Inc.
