 I Used Cleansing Cleansing Conditioner On My Fine Hair & Here's What Happened

By Emily McClure

Feb 8 2016



 We've likely all seen the informercials for the hair care line WEN by Chaz Dean at some point in our lives. You know the ones with all the gorgeous woman shaking their hair around, and swearing that the cleansing conditioner is basically magic in a bottle? As a die-hard haircare fanatic, I had to see if the rumors were true. I decided to put the WEN Cleansing Conditioner to the test to see if it could transform my thin hair into luscious, TV-worthy strands. 
If you haven't heard of the WEN cleansing conditioners, these products are essentially an all-in-one shampoo, conditioner, and styling treatment. The brand boasts that these products can work well for any hair type depending on which formulation you try. Personally, I reached for the Fig version, as it promised to give my hair moisture, bounce, and shine. 
While there have recently been some not-so-excellent (but also quite rare) reports of negative side effects from using this stuff, I was willing to take the chance. As someone who loves beauty products, I'm aware there is always a risk when trying out new products. With that said, here's how the WEN cleansing conditioner worked for my fine, thin hair.

Day 1
Before

After a day filled with planes, trains, and automobiles, I was in desperate need of a shower (as you can see in the photo). With that in mind, I thought it would also be a good time to start my WEN Cleansing Conditioner experiment. My hair was already greasy/frizzy/unruly when I arrived home, so I wanted to see what sort of magic this cleansing conditioner could pull off. 

The first thing I want to point out about this product is just how much of it the brand actually recommends using. Printed on the back label, the brand suggests using using 10-16 pumps of product for short hair, 16-24 pumps for medium hair, and 24-32 pumps for long hair. To me, that sounds like actual insanity. Why do you need that much product on your hair? As someone with fine hair, I immediately began to worry about this weighing my hair down. 
Normal Amount of Shampoo I Use VS. Amount Recommended By WEN
Shampoo


Here is the normal amount of shampoo that I have to use to clean my hair and scalp.  
WEN Cleansing Conditioner

Here is how much WEN I had to use as per recommended on the bottle. Shown in the photo above is ten pumps. This amount is the minimum recommended amount for any length of hair. My strands were quaking in their roots. 
After

Once I got into the shower, I pumped the large amount of product into my hands, and spread evenly across my hair. As recommended in the product directions, I massaged the conditioner into my scalp, and pulled through across my ends. I let the product soak in for a few minutes, and then rinsed. 
I noticed while I was massaging in the product that my hair felt almost thicker. It seems crazy, but it actually felt like I had more hair. Also, I noticed that less strands were falling out mid-shower. As any girl with longer hair might, I tend to notice strands pilling up in my shower. However, nothing fell out when I used WEN. It was great!
After my shower, I blow dried my hair to see the end result. It looked more shiny and bouncy, in my opinion. Honestly, I was just happy that it was clean. 

Day 2

When I woke up the next morning, my roots were already greasy. This was an unexpected surprise as it usually take a day or two of being unwashed for my hair to get oily. Unfortunately, I had to run errands this morning, and didn't have time to shower. However, I did have time for a kitten selfie to show you just how stringy my hair looked. 

The photo above is my pre-shower photo. Typically, I have volume in the morning that fades away during the afternoon. However, my hair was already looking greasy and flat. 

When I arrived home, I immediately jumped in the shower. After going through the whole cleansing and blow drying routine again, my hair resumed to that shiny, voluminous look from Day 1. It still felt great in the shower (despite the product amount) and I love my "after" look. However, I was still wary of the product due to how greasy my roots were before I showered. It had only been 24 hours of using the product, and my hair already wasn't acting like it's normal self.
Day 3

On Day 3, I woke with wondering what in the world my hair would be looking like. Thankfully, my roots weren't as greasy as they had been the morning of Day 2, but they still were oilier than I would like. 
I hopped in the shower, used the cleansing conditioner, and even was extra careful to thoroughly wash out the product, just in case it was leftover product that was making my hair so greasy. Once again, I loved the end result after I blow dried my hair. I will admit thought that I used other products to style my hair on this day like heat protectant and texturizing paste. I usually use styling products on a day-to-day basis, so I wanted to see how these would match up with the WEN. 
Going on throughout my day, I noticed my hair get flatter. This is pretty typical for my straight strands, so I wasn't too bothered by it. However, at the end of this very long day, I noticed my hair still looked pretty shiny and healthy. Overall, I was impressed. 
Day 4

On Day 4, I woke up late, and therefore, I had zero time to shower. Thankfully, I work at a hair salon, so I knew I was going to be able to style my hair. Much to my horror, however, my hair was a total grease-ball when I finally looked at it in a mirror. I hadn't noticed before I arrived at the salon, but my hair was a frizzy, greasy mess. It was the epitome of a bad hair day. 
After loads of dry shampoo and curling (see photo above), my roots still weren't looking any better. I was literally counting down the hours until I could shower.

Day 5

So, Day 5 wasn't that bad. I showered in the morning, applied the product, and had a normal great result. My only downside is that after I curled my hair, the waves fell a little more quickly than normal. However, my locks were super soft from the WEN, so I knew my chances for long-lasting waves weren't good to begin with. This was the first time that whole week were I was totally confident about my hair from start to finish. 
Day 6

By Day 6, I was settling into a routine with WEN. If I was going to use the product, I had to use it morning in order to have clean looking hair. Even though I still prefer to shower at night, I didn't want to chance having greasy hair. 
That night I went out for drinks with a few friends, and they surprisingly commented on how shiny my hair looked. It was definitely the confidence booster I needed after a week of hair struggles. 
Day 7

On the last day of my experiment, I continued my routine of waking up early to shower and style my hair. As I had a busy day ahead of me, I didn't want to have to worry about another disastrous hair day. After my styling, I noticed once again that my curls seemed to fall a little faster than normal, but besides that my hair looked great. 
Final Thoughts
The WEN Cleansing Conditioner is a great product for those with fine hair who make a point to shower and style their hair every morning. If you're a slightly lazier person like myself, then this may not be your go-to product. While it made my hair look fabulous post-shower, my strands became extremely oily and unmanageable if I tried to skip a day between washes — or even if I'd showered the night before. It was definitely a love/hate relationship throughout the week. However, I can see myself reaching for the conditioner again on days when I crave a little extra shine... if I get myself out of bed on time.

Confessions of a Former Extension Addict
November 20, 2015 by emily 100 Comments Hi. My name is Emily and I used to be addicted to hair extensions. I’ve had every kind from the bonded to the tape-ins to simple clip-ins, and of course had the broken off hair to show for it. On top of that, I don’t know if you all remember, but last year (September 9th, 2014.. not that I’ve kept track or anything) I got bangs cut and as embarrassing as it is to admit, it was a traumatizing experience to say the least. Just picture me hiding under my covers and ordering headbands on my computer like a maniac. Not pretty.
Over the past year I have been on a mission to get my hair to be as healthy as possible, all the while avoiding the easy fix of throwing in some extensions. So, here are my biggest tips for growing your hair out and keeping it as healthy as possible!
 

Hair Vitaimins–  I give these to all of my friends that are trying to grow their hair out and they really do work so quickly! After I got my bangs cut I started taking these and they were significantly grown out after a month of taking these vitamins. Even my husband noticed!
Wet Brush– This is pretty much the only hairbrush I use besides my Mason Pearson brush. If you’re not ready to splurge on a MP, try this one! It’s so much easier on your hair than a traditional hairbrush.
Deep Conditioner- I use this Living Proof Hair Treatment once a week
Scrunchies- I put my hair in a bun on the top of my head with a giant scrunchie every night!
Silk Pillowcase– I bought this at Sephora and it has made my blow outs last so much longer!
Dry Shampoo- This is a safe place, right? Please don’t judge me but I wash my hair about once a week. Part because its not good to wash your hair too much and mostly because I’m lazy. I buy this Living Proof Dry Shampoo in bulk!

What are your secrets for growing out a bad haircut? Or just keeping your hair healthy? Leave them in comments!

Emily, Your hair looks amazing! I use coconut oil on my hair, just put it on and sleep on it. I lay a towel down so my pillow doesn’t soak up the oil. Then in the morning wash it out and my hair is so soft and shiny! I also use baby powder instead of dry shampoo, it works amazingly on blonde hair. And I’m like you I only wash my hair about twice a week:)

I absolutely love Color Wow Color Security Shampoo & Conditioner to keep hair healthy, shiny, and color clear. It’s great for extensions as well because its’ gentle formula doesn’t break the glue bonds, making for longer lasting extensions!
Hopy you try 🙂

Emily, as always… Thank you for sharing. My staples for my hair are Aveda- smooth infusion shampoo and conditioner, Aveda smooth infusion glossing straightener(even though my hair is stick straight- it polishes and protects from heat- I use this around my face and ends of hair where it is most fragile) and to top it off-  I am addicted to Kenra blowdry spray- it is an intense thermal protectant, it’s lightweight so it doesn’t weigh down the hair, eliminates frizz & humidity…it also detangles, smooths, softens and adds a bit of a shine.  There is a similar product in the Oribe line that I like very well, but I honestly like Kenra blowdry spray a little better. My hair is similar to your blonde color- medium thickness with fine texture.

I massage olive oil into my hair all over from scalp to roots once a week. I leave it for couple hours or overnight (I cover my pillow with a clean towel and sleep on it with hair tied up in bun). it allowed the oil to sink in the hair. shampoo well (I massage the scalp well to remove the oil). conditioner is optional. I do it only on the bottom of my hair. result is so soft and manageable hair!! olive oil is amazing! same go for coconut oil. the thing with coconut oil is it comes in solid form- you have to heat it to make it melt to liquid for hair application.

Emily i have to be honest i thought you looked so pretty with your Shorter hair cut years ago! You Have a nice face for short hair! 
And about the hair tips i swear this works. It sounds crazy but try and hang upside doWn  off you bed. A doctor told me once that this causes the blood to rush tO your scalp. If you do this a few Minutes a day it works! And give yourself or have someone else give you a scalp massage Like 10 minutes a day. This alone worked. I have blonde hair too and a monTh after doing both of these things my roots were like inches longer than uSual.

awww what a shame you didnt find me back then, i make custom made hair fringes and beehives could have helped you cover up the growing out phase…if you ever fancy ‘faux’ bangs again, happy to make you some 😉

Do you still use your WEn? I have recently begun using New Wash by Hairstory ( same concept) and it has left my hair feeling rather greasy.  Any suggestions?

Also-when straightening hair and/or curling it- always apply argan oil (or another hair sErum/oIl) Before straightening to prevent stripping Of natural oils and instead your straightener will Strip more of the hair product

My doctor said it was okay to take them while I was pregnant/nursing. It helped so much I didn’t notice any hair loss! I’d definitely check with your doctor though just to be sure it’s okay since everyone is different 🙂

I am a hairstylist in california and was also an extension abuser/enthusiest. I cut my hair into a bob two Years ago to just get rid of all the fragile/broken hair.
I started usiNg redken extreme lengths biotin protein sealer. Its amazing!!! Just apply a pea size to ends of haif first then through the Rest. It helps with Breakage, ends splitting and gorwing healthy long hair. My hair is now down the middle of my Back, multiple haircuts later and its beyond healthy. Highly recommend!

Sell on Houzz - Learn MoreChoose wall art you love.The number one rule for selecting artwork is that it should speak to you. If it isn’t meaningful in any way, it’s best to keep searching. If you’ve themed your furniture and décor around a certain color or idea, that can get you started in your search. Many paintings and other artwork have a cultural theme, such as aboriginal art or Japanese art. On the other hand, black and white photography goes great with anything. Whatever style you choose, just make sure it represents your tastes, interests or history. Check out every type of wall art out there.If you’re looking for paintings that fit perfectly with your traditional décor, consider fine art prints. These are a great alternative if you can’t afford genuine Picasso paintings or works by other famous artists. Pencil art and some sculptures can also fit in well with a traditional scheme. If you’re in the mood for some modern artwork, illustrations and mixed media are a great place to start. Sculptures made from metal or glass can also have a modern tone. Try going bold with abstract paintings, urban art or pop art, which tend to incorporate more modern influences like graffiti and celebrities, plus bright colors. Photographs work well with any décor as they can cross between modern and traditional easily depending on the subject matter. Don’t be afraid to mix and match, either. A modern piece can go amazingly well with a traditional home, and vice versa. Arrange your new artwork for optimal viewing.Once you’ve found those perfect, meaningful pieces, you’ll want to place them in a spot that allows everyone who passes by to admire them. Common locations for artwork include above a seating area or, better yet, facing your seating arrangement. Proper lighting and visibility is also important, as is hanging your new pieces at the correct height. Aim for eye level or the gallery standard, which says the center of your paintings should be approximately 60 inches from the floor.

Cute, sparkly

Just the right size.  By the way, I got a left and a right earring, not two going the same way as shown in the photo.

Have fun with wall decor.If your floor space is limited, it’s important to make the most of your walls by using every inch for home decor. If your walls are looking a little barren, spice them up with colorful artwork. Your own photo collage can add a personal touch to any room, while mirrors can make a small space seem larger thanks to their reflective qualities. If storage is an issue, use shelves and stack them with fun trinkets or flowers. Don’t forget about the wall itself! Add some flavor with colorful, patterned wallpaper or go for a brightly painted accent wall. Home decorations make great table toppers.If your living room needs a lift, liven it up by adding a few thoughtful home decor accessories. Photos always make great additions, but keep them interesting by mixing and matching your frames. When lit, candles add a romantic, relaxing feel, and coffee table books about travel, home design, fashion or photography make for great conversation starters. House decorations can cozy up your floor.While floor space may be limited, there’s always room for a well-placed area rug or two. These are a great way to add texture, color and warmth to a hardwood or tile floor. Choose a traditional floral pattern or some funky chevrons to get started, then pair your  pattern with a textured Berber rug or soft shag for ultimate indulgence. Add some vibrancy to neutral-colored furniture. One of the easiest ways to punch up a look is through the fabric you display. Swap out throw pillows and blankets to liven up a dull home decor foundation, and search right here on Houzz for bold or mismatched patterns, comfy throws and cushy pillows. Don’t forget the drapes.Dress up your windows with elegant, bold or even light and airy treatments. Because of their size, floor-length curtains can make a dramatic difference and can transition a room from traditional to contemporary all by themselves.

We've all admired the works of Rembrandt, Picasso and Andy Warhol for years, so why not showcase our favorites at home where we can enjoy them for hours on end? Buying artwork created by a notable artist doesn't have to drain your bank account, though we're sure having the original Mona Lisa in your living room is sure to be a conversation starter. Instead you can display detailed  art prints on your walls without worrying about breaking the bank — or upsetting a museum. More
