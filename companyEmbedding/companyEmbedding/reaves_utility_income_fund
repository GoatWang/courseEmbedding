The Reaves Asset Management Closed End Fund

Factsheet

S&P 500 Index
The Standard & Poor's composite index of 500 stocks, a widely recognized, unmanaged index of common stock prices. Index performance does not reflect fund performance. An investor cannot invest directly in an index.
One may not invest directly in an index.



Fund Overview
Investment Objective
The Fund's objective is to provide a high level of after-tax total return consisting primarily of tax-advantaged dividend income and capital appreciation. It intends to invest at least 80% of its total assets in dividend-paying common and preferred stocks and debt instruments of companies within the utility industry. The remaining 20% of its assets may be invested in other securities including stocks, money market instruments and debt instruments, as well as certain derivative instruments in the utility industry or other industries.

Managed to seek tax-advantaged dividend income
Focus on utilities – currently among the higher yielding sectors
Potential for enhanced yield with the use of leverage
Potential for capital appreciation
Professionally managed by W.H. Reaves & Company, Inc. (dba Reaves Asset Management), an investment advisor with 34 years of utility investment management experience 

A Focus on Tax-Advantaged Dividend Income
The Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act was signed into law on May 28, 2003. One provision of the Act provides that qualifying dividend income received by individual taxpayers will now be taxed at long-term capital gain tax rates which are a maximum of 15%. Currently, interest income and non-qualifying dividend income can reach federal tax rates as high as 35%.
Qualified dividend tax rates have fallen dramatically (to 15%), yet only certain dividends qualify for this tax treatment. Dividends from real estate investment trusts (REITs), master limited partnerships and trust preferred securities generally do not qualify. Also, the period in which the investor holds a security can determine whether or not a dividend is qualified. The Reaves Utility Income Fund is managed with these taxation issues in mind in seeking the objective of maximizing qualified dividend income.
Leverage to Potentially Enhance Yield 
One advantage of closed-end mutual funds is the ability to use financial leverage as part of the overall investment strategy. The Fund expects to use financial leverage through the issuance of preferred shares and/or through borrowings, including the issuance of debt securities. The Fund intends to use leverage initially of up to approximately 38% of its total assets.



The Reaves Utility Income Fund is a closed-end fund and closed-end funds do not continuously issue shares for sale as open-end mutual funds do. Since the initial public offering, the Fund now trades in the secondary market. Investors wishing to buy or sell shares need to place orders through an intermediary or broker. The share price of a closed-end fund is based on the market's value. The Fund's investment objective is fundamental and may not be changed without the vote of the Fund's shareholders.
An investor should consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing. To obtain a annual report
 or semi-annual report
 which contains this and other information visit www.utilityincomefund.com or call 1-800-644-5571. Read them carefully before investing.

Reaves Utility Income Fund






Business Wire




Jun 30, 2017 9:30 AM EDT













 




























































  On June 30, 2017, the Reaves Utility Income Fund (NYSE MKT: UTG) (the "Fund"), a closed-end sector fund, paid a monthly distribution on its common stock of $0.16 per share to shareholders of record at the close of business on June 16, 2017.  The following table sets forth the estimated amount of the sources of distribution for purposes of Section 19 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and the related rules adopted thereunder. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), the Fund estimates the following percentages, of the total distribution amount per share, attributable to (i) current and prior fiscal year net investment income, (ii) net realized short-term capital gain, (iii) net realized long-term capital gain and (iv) return of capital or other capital source as a percentage of the total distribution amount. These percentages are disclosed for the current distribution as well as the fiscal year-to-date cumulative distribution amount per share for the Fund.                             Current Distribution from:                       Per Share ($)     %       Net Investment Income     0.09854     61.59%       Net Realized Short-Term Capital Gain     0.00000     0.00%       Net Realized Long-Term Capital Gain     0.06146     38.41%       Return of Capital or other Capital Source     0.00000     0.00%       Total (per common share)     0.16000     100.00%                       Fiscal Year-to-Date Cumulative               Distributions from:                   Per Share ($)     %       Net Investment Income     0.54652     24.84%       Net Realized Short-Term Capital Gain     0.01517     0.69%       Net Realized Long-Term Capital Gain     1.63831     74.47%       Return of Capital or other Capital Source     0.00000     0.00%       Total (per common share)       2.20000       100.00%                        The timing and character of distributions for federal income tax purposes are determined in accordance with income tax regulations which may differ from GAAP. As such, all or a portion of this distribution may be reportable as taxable income on your 2017 federal income tax return. The final tax character of any distribution declared in 2017 will be determined in January 2018 and reported to you on IRS Form 1099-DIV.

Please note: Closed end funds are subject to the risk of their underlying assets and investment strategy. Unlike open end funds, closed end funds trade on an exchange at a price which is often a discount to their net asset value (NAV). The market price may experience periods of increased volatility due to the use of leverage as well as market and fund illiquidity. Important information you should know about investing in closed-end funds.

What does it mean?

							A fund's Morningstar Rating is a quantitative assessment of a fund's past performance that accounts for both risk and return, with funds earning between 1 and 5 stars. As always, this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process. A high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision.

*The Overall Morningstar RatingTM for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and ten-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a funds monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads and redemption fees, if applicable), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.)The performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted. Distributions are not guaranteed and the amount of distributions will vary depending on a number of factors. Market prices and investment return will vary, therefore you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares. Click on the "Performance & Risk" link to view quarter-end performance. All performance data is for the common shares of the fund. Total distribution rate (at market or NAV) may include unknown combinations of income, capital gains and return of capital.Cumulative total returns are reported as of the period indicated. Life of fund figures are reported as of the commencement date to the period indicated. ^Premium/Discount to NAV represents the percentage by which the funds market price exceeds or is less than net asset value (NAV). Shares of closed-end funds frequently trade at a market price that is a discount to their NAV.Top holdings are as of the date indicated and may not be representative of the funds current or future investments.
