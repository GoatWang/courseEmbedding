	NRG

	), as borrower, completed an amendment to its senior secured credit facility (the 

	Senior Credit Facilities

	) pursuant to the terms of the First Amendment Agreement, dated as of January 24, 2017 (the 

	Amendment Agreement

	Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement

	), to reduce the margin on certain borrowings under its Senior Credit Facilities.




	 




	Borrowings under the Senior Credit Facilities are determined at NRGs election, at LIBOR or at base rate, in each case, plus an applicable margin. The Amendment Agreement decreases the applicable margins for borrowings under (i) ABR Term Loans from 1.75% to 1.25% and (ii) Eurodollar Term Loans from 2.75% to 2.25%, as such terms are defined in the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The decreases to the applicable margins became effective upon execution of the Amendment Agreement.

	Each of this First Amendment and the Amended Credit Agreement (i) has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Borrower and, with respect to this First Amendment only, each Subsidiary Guarantor, (ii) constitutes the Borrowers and, with respect to this First Amendment only, each Subsidiary Guarantors  legal, valid and binding obligation, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer or other laws now or hereafter in effect affecting creditors rights generally and (including with respect to specific performance) subject to general principles of equity, regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law and to the discretion of the court before which any proceeding therefor may be brought, (iii) will not violate (A) any applicable provision of any material law, statute, rule or regulation, or of the certificate or articles of incorporation or other constitutive documents or by-laws of the Borrower or any Subsidiary Guarantor, (B) any order of any Governmental Authority or arbitrator or (C) after giving effect to the transactions contemplated by this First Amendment, any provision of any indenture or any material agreement or other material instrument to which the Borrower or any Subsidiary Guarantor is a party or by which any of them or any of their property is or may be bound, (iv) after giving effect to the transactions contemplated by this First Amendment, will not be in conflict with, result in a breach of or constitute (alone or with notice or lapse of time or both) a default under, or give rise to any right to accelerate or to require the prepayment, repurchase or redemption of any obligation under any such indenture or material agreement or other material instrument and (v) will not result in the creation or imposition of any Lien upon or with respect to any property or assets now owned or hereafter acquired by the Borrower or any other Loan Party (other than Liens created under the Security Documents).




	 





	(c) 

	No action, consent or approval of, registration or filing with, notice to, or any other action by, any Governmental Authority is or will be required in connection with this First Amendment or the Amended Credit Agreement, except for (i) the filing of UCC financing statements and filings with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and the United States Copyright Office, (ii) recordation of modifications of the Mortgages, if any, (iii) actions specifically described in Section 3.19 of the Credit Agreement or any of the Security Documents, if any, (iv) any immaterial actions, consents, approvals, registrations or filings or (v) such as have been made or obtained and are in full force and effect.




	 





	(d) 

	The representations and warranties set forth in the Amended Credit Agreement and each other Loan Document are true and correct in all material respects on and as of the First Amendment Effective Date, with the same effect as though made on and as of such date, except to the extent such representations and warranties expressly relate to an earlier date, in which case such representations and warranties were true and correct in all material respects on and as of such earlier date;

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
