Unit Trusts
Unit Trusts provide a simple, convenient way to gain exposure to an asset class, market sector or investment discipline. Like a traditional mutual fund, unit trusts hold a pool of securities (such as stocks, bonds or alternative investments) chosen by a professional investment manager and are available with a wide range of objectives and risk levels.

Build America Bonds Income Trust (BABS0034)
	
		





Objective
		  	
		
		Build America Bonds are new taxable municipal bonds created from the $787 billion stimulus package passed in 2009 by Congress. The purpose of the bonds is to build and repair America's roads, bridges, transit and rail systems, schools, ports and inland waterways, and other infrastructure, while stimulating the U.S. economy and job growth. Van Kampen Unit Trusts provide investors with convenient access to a diversified portfolio of taxable municipal bonds with a low minimum investment, consistent monthly income, daily liquidity and transparency.




Investment objective The trust seeks to provide a high level of current income and to preserve capital. The trust invests in a portfolio of long-term taxable municipal bonds, primarily consisting of "Build America Bonds". As of the date of deposit, the trust will invest at least 80% of its assets in Build America Bonds, and may include other taxable municipal bonds for purposes of diversification.

1Estimated current return (ECR) is based on the estimated annual income as a percentage of the current price of the units. Estimated long-term return (ELTR) is calculated using a formula which (1) takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values, yields (which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated retirement of all the bonds in the trust and (2) takes into account the expenses and sales charge associated with each trust unit. There can be no assurance that either the estimated current return or ELTR will be realized in the future and an investor's units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
2The ELTR life represents the estimated life of the bonds in a Trust's portfolio determined for the purposes of calculating Estimated Long-Term Return.
3Estimated Annual Income Per Unit is as of close the most recent business day and is based on the estimated cash flows per unit. This amount will vary with changes in expenses, interest rates and the maturity, call or sale of bonds.
4Estimated Daily Rate of Accrual represents the annual interest from the securities within the portfolio divided by the number of days on which interest is calculated annually.

This trust is unmanaged. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust.An investment in the trust should be made with an understanding of the risks associated therewith, such as the inability of the issuer or an insurer to pay the principal of or interest on a bond when due, volatile interest rates, early call provisions and changes to the tax status of the bonds. As interest rates rise, bond prices fall.Investments in this trust may be subject to interest rate risk. If interest rates rise, the value of the bonds in a trust may decline and if interest rates decline the value of the bonds may increase.

1The S&P and Moody's ratings apply to the bonds held by the trust, and not the trust itself.   A Standard & Poor's credit rating is a current opinion of the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific debt obligation. This opinion of creditworthiness may take into consideration the creditworthiness of guarantors, insurers or other forms of credit enhancement on the obligation.  Moody's municipal ratings are opinions of the investment quality of the issues and issues in the US municipal and tax-exempt markets. As such, these ratings incorporate Moody's assessment of the default probability and loss severity of these issuers and issues.


1Estimated current return (ECR) is based on the estimated annual income as a percentage of the current price of the units. Estimated long-term return (ELTR) is calculated using a formula which (1) takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values, yields (which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated retirement of all the bonds in the trust and (2) takes into account the expenses and sales charge associated with each trust unit. There can be no assurance that either the estimated current return or ELTR will be realized in the future and an investor's units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
2The ELTR life represents the estimated life of the bonds in a Trust's portfolio determined for the purposes of calculating Estimated Long-Term Return.
3Estimated Annual Income Per Unit is as of close the most recent business day and is based on the estimated cash flows per unit. This amount will vary with changes in expenses, interest rates and the maturity, call or sale of bonds.
4Estimated Daily Rate of Accrual represents the annual interest from the securities within the portfolio divided by the number of days on which interest is calculated annually.
5Represents the principal amount of the underlying bonds per unit. Bonds may be sold to meet redemptions, to pay expenses, and in other limited circumstances. The sale of bonds will affect the principal amount of bonds included in the trust and as a result the principal amount of bonds per unit. There can be no assurance that a unitholder will receive this par value per unit in the future.

The performance data quoted for the individual series of a trust that has not terminated or has an open termination date is from the deposit date through the current date quoted. For individual series that have terminated, performance data quoted is from the deposit date through the termination date.Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate and units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
Returns are cumulative total returns (not annualized) unless labeled as average annual total returns. All returns reflect trust expenses as incurred and assume reinvestment of income and principal distributions, except for trusts that do not offer the option of reinvesting distributions into additional trust units. Please see the related trust prospectus for additional information. Returns do not reflect taxes.
A trust's performance, especially for short time periods, should not be the sole factor in making your investment decision. Please keep in mind that high, double-digit returns are highly unusual and cannot be sustained. Investors should also be aware that these returns were primarily achieved during favorable market conditions.
Returns With Sales Charge reflect the maximum sales charge that would be payable by an investor upon sale or redemption of units at the end of the applicable period(s). The sales charge includes any initial or deferred sales charges other than creation and development fee. These returns do not reflect any creation and development fee prior to collection (generally the close of the initial offering period). Any creation and development fee is reflected in the returns as of the time of payment. by a trust. These returns reflect any contingent deferred sales charges only if the charges would be payable upon a unit sale or redemption at or prior to the end of the applicable performance period(s). Certain trusts are no longer offered for sale to the public and, as a result, do not publish an offer price or have a sales charge. In these cases, returns will not reflect a sales charge if a trust was not actually offered for sale to the public on the first day of the applicable period because units of the trust could not have been purchased by an investor at that time. These returns will show 'N/A' for With Sales Charge data
Returns Without Sales Charge do not reflect any sales charge and do not reflect any creation and development fee prior to collection (generally the close of the initial offering period). Any creation and development fee is reflected in the returns as of the time of payment by a trust.
There is no assurance the trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit investment trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust. Certain trusts are unmanaged and their portfolios are not intended to change during the trusts' lives except in limited circumstances. Certain trusts are passively managed and seek to track their target index during the trust's life. For a more complete discussion of the risks of investing in this trust, click on the Fact Card.

1Estimated current return (ECR) is based on the estimated annual income as a percentage of the current price of the units. Estimated long-term return (ELTR) is calculated using a formula which (1) takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values, yields (which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated retirement of all the bonds in the trust and (2) takes into account the expenses and sales charge associated with each trust unit. There can be no assurance that either the estimated current return or ELTR will be realized in the future and an investor's units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
2The ELTR life represents the estimated life of the bonds in a Trust's portfolio determined for the purposes of calculating Estimated Long-Term Return.
3Estimated Annual Income Per Unit is as of close the most recent business day and is based on the estimated cash flows per unit. This amount will vary with changes in expenses, interest rates and the maturity, call or sale of bonds.
4Estimated Daily Rate of Accrual represents the annual interest from the securities within the portfolio divided by the number of days on which interest is calculated annually.
5Represents the principal amount of the underlying bonds per unit. Bonds may be sold to meet redemptions, to pay expenses, and in other limited circumstances. The sale of bonds will affect the principal amount of bonds included in the trust and as a result the principal amount of bonds per unit. There can be no assurance that a unitholder will receive this par value per unit in the future.

Build America Bonds Income Trust (BABS0043)
	
		





Objective
		  	
		
		Build America Bonds are new taxable municipal bonds created from the $787 billion stimulus package passed in 2009 by Congress. The purpose of the bonds is to build and repair America's roads, bridges, transit and rail systems, schools, ports and inland waterways, and other infrastructure, while stimulating the U.S. economy and job growth. Invesco Unit Trusts provide investors with convenient access to a diversified portfolio of taxable municipal bonds with a low minimum investment, consistent monthly income, daily liquidity and transparency.




Investment objective The trust seeks to provide a high level of current income and to preserve capital. The trust invests in a portfolio of long-term taxable municipal bonds, primarily consisting of "Build America Bonds". As of the date of deposit, the trust will invest at least 80% of its assets in Build America Bonds, and may include other taxable municipal bonds for purposes of diversification.

1The S&P and Moody's ratings apply to the bonds held by the trust, and not the trust itself.   A Standard & Poor's credit rating is a current opinion of the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific debt obligation. This opinion of creditworthiness may take into consideration the creditworthiness of guarantors, insurers or other forms of credit enhancement on the obligation.  Moody's municipal ratings are opinions of the investment quality of the issues and issues in the US municipal and tax-exempt markets. As such, these ratings incorporate Moody's assessment of the default probability and loss severity of these issuers and issues.


1Estimated current return (ECR) is based on the estimated annual income as a percentage of the current price of the units. Estimated long-term return (ELTR) is calculated using a formula which (1) takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values, yields (which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated retirement of all the bonds in the trust and (2) takes into account the expenses and sales charge associated with each trust unit. There can be no assurance that either the estimated current return or ELTR will be realized in the future and an investor's units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
2The ELTR life represents the estimated life of the bonds in a Trust's portfolio determined for the purposes of calculating Estimated Long-Term Return.
3Estimated Annual Income Per Unit is as of close the most recent business day and is based on the estimated cash flows per unit. This amount will vary with changes in expenses, interest rates and the maturity, call or sale of bonds.
4Estimated Daily Rate of Accrual represents the annual interest from the securities within the portfolio divided by the number of days on which interest is calculated annually.
5Represents the principal amount of the underlying bonds per unit. Bonds may be sold to meet redemptions, to pay expenses, and in other limited circumstances. The sale of bonds will affect the principal amount of bonds included in the trust and as a result the principal amount of bonds per unit. There can be no assurance that a unitholder will receive this par value per unit in the future.


For Fixed-Income trusts, "S.F." indicates a sinking fund is established with respect to an issue of bonds.The trust portfolio is provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell the individual securities shown above.

About risk



There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust.An investment in the trust should be made with an understanding of the risks associated therewith, such as the inability of the issuer or an insurer to pay the principal of or interest on a bond when due, volatile interest rates, early call provisions and changes to the tax status of the bonds. As interest rates rise, bond prices fall.Investments in this trust may be subject to interest rate risk. If interest rates rise, the value of the bonds in a trust may decline and if interest rates decline the value of the bonds may increase. Also, the longer the period to maturity, the greater the sensitivity to interest rate changes tends to be.In particular, should a Build America Bond's issuer fail to continue to meet the applicable requirements imposed on the bonds as provided by the American Recovery & Reinvestment Act of 2009, it is possible that such issuer may not receive federal cash subsidy payments, impairing the issuer's ability to make scheduled interest payments.The trust may concentrate in bonds of a particular type of issuer. This makes the trust less diversified and subject to a greater risk than a more diversified portfolio.

The performance data quoted for the individual series of a trust that has not terminated or has an open termination date is from the deposit date through the current date quoted. For individual series that have terminated, performance data quoted is from the deposit date through the termination date.Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate and units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
Returns are cumulative total returns (not annualized) unless labeled as average annual total returns. All returns reflect trust expenses as incurred and assume reinvestment of income and principal distributions, except for trusts that do not offer the option of reinvesting distributions into additional trust units. Please see the related trust prospectus for additional information. Returns do not reflect taxes.
A trust's performance, especially for short time periods, should not be the sole factor in making your investment decision. Please keep in mind that high, double-digit returns are highly unusual and cannot be sustained. Investors should also be aware that these returns were primarily achieved during favorable market conditions.
Returns With Sales Charge reflect the maximum sales charge that would be payable by an investor upon sale or redemption of units at the end of the applicable period(s). The sales charge includes any initial or deferred sales charges other than creation and development fee. These returns do not reflect any creation and development fee prior to collection (generally the close of the initial offering period). Any creation and development fee is reflected in the returns as of the time of payment. by a trust. These returns reflect any contingent deferred sales charges only if the charges would be payable upon a unit sale or redemption at or prior to the end of the applicable performance period(s). Certain trusts are no longer offered for sale to the public and, as a result, do not publish an offer price or have a sales charge. In these cases, returns will not reflect a sales charge if a trust was not actually offered for sale to the public on the first day of the applicable period because units of the trust could not have been purchased by an investor at that time. These returns will show 'N/A' for With Sales Charge data
Returns Without Sales Charge do not reflect any sales charge and do not reflect any creation and development fee prior to collection (generally the close of the initial offering period). Any creation and development fee is reflected in the returns as of the time of payment by a trust.
There is no assurance the trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit investment trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust. Certain trusts are unmanaged and their portfolios are not intended to change during the trusts' lives except in limited circumstances. Certain trusts are passively managed and seek to track their target index during the trust's life. For a more complete discussion of the risks of investing in this trust, click on the Fact Card.

1Estimated current return (ECR) is based on the estimated annual income as a percentage of the current price of the units. Estimated long-term return (ELTR) is calculated using a formula which (1) takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values, yields (which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated retirement of all the bonds in the trust and (2) takes into account the expenses and sales charge associated with each trust unit. There can be no assurance that either the estimated current return or ELTR will be realized in the future and an investor's units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
2The ELTR life represents the estimated life of the bonds in a Trust's portfolio determined for the purposes of calculating Estimated Long-Term Return.
3Estimated Annual Income Per Unit is as of close the most recent business day and is based on the estimated cash flows per unit. This amount will vary with changes in expenses, interest rates and the maturity, call or sale of bonds.
4Estimated Daily Rate of Accrual represents the annual interest from the securities within the portfolio divided by the number of days on which interest is calculated annually.
5Represents the principal amount of the underlying bonds per unit. Bonds may be sold to meet redemptions, to pay expenses, and in other limited circumstances. The sale of bonds will affect the principal amount of bonds included in the trust and as a result the principal amount of bonds per unit. There can be no assurance that a unitholder will receive this par value per unit in the future.

Build America Bonds Income Trust (BABS0042)
	
		





Objective
		  	
		
		Build America Bonds are new taxable municipal bonds created from the $787 billion stimulus package passed in 2009 by Congress. The purpose of the bonds is to build and repair America's roads, bridges, transit and rail systems, schools, ports and inland waterways, and other infrastructure, while stimulating the U.S. economy and job growth. Invesco Unit Trusts provide investors with convenient access to a diversified portfolio of taxable municipal bonds with a low minimum investment, consistent monthly income, daily liquidity and transparency.




Investment objective The trust seeks to provide a high level of current income and to preserve capital. The trust invests in a portfolio of long-term taxable municipal bonds, primarily consisting of "Build America Bonds". As of the date of deposit, the trust will invest at least 80% of its assets in Build America Bonds, and may include other taxable municipal bonds for purposes of diversification.

1The S&P and Moody's ratings apply to the bonds held by the trust, and not the trust itself.   A Standard & Poor's credit rating is a current opinion of the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific debt obligation. This opinion of creditworthiness may take into consideration the creditworthiness of guarantors, insurers or other forms of credit enhancement on the obligation.  Moody's municipal ratings are opinions of the investment quality of the issues and issues in the US municipal and tax-exempt markets. As such, these ratings incorporate Moody's assessment of the default probability and loss severity of these issuers and issues.


1Estimated current return (ECR) is based on the estimated annual income as a percentage of the current price of the units. Estimated long-term return (ELTR) is calculated using a formula which (1) takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values, yields (which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated retirement of all the bonds in the trust and (2) takes into account the expenses and sales charge associated with each trust unit. There can be no assurance that either the estimated current return or ELTR will be realized in the future and an investor's units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
2The ELTR life represents the estimated life of the bonds in a Trust's portfolio determined for the purposes of calculating Estimated Long-Term Return.
3Estimated Annual Income Per Unit is as of close the most recent business day and is based on the estimated cash flows per unit. This amount will vary with changes in expenses, interest rates and the maturity, call or sale of bonds.
4Estimated Daily Rate of Accrual represents the annual interest from the securities within the portfolio divided by the number of days on which interest is calculated annually.
5Represents the principal amount of the underlying bonds per unit. Bonds may be sold to meet redemptions, to pay expenses, and in other limited circumstances. The sale of bonds will affect the principal amount of bonds included in the trust and as a result the principal amount of bonds per unit. There can be no assurance that a unitholder will receive this par value per unit in the future.

About risk



There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust.An investment in the trust should be made with an understanding of the risks associated therewith, such as the inability of the issuer or an insurer to pay the principal of or interest on a bond when due, volatile interest rates, early call provisions and changes to the tax status of the bonds. As interest rates rise, bond prices fall.Investments in this trust may be subject to interest rate risk. If interest rates rise, the value of the bonds in a trust may decline and if interest rates decline the value of the bonds may increase. Also, the longer the period to maturity, the greater the sensitivity to interest rate changes tends to be.In particular, should a Build America Bond's issuer fail to continue to meet the applicable requirements imposed on the bonds as provided by the American Recovery & Reinvestment Act of 2009, it is possible that such issuer may not receive federal cash subsidy payments, impairing the issuer's ability to make scheduled interest payments.The trust may concentrate in bonds of a particular type of issuer. This makes the trust less diversified and subject to a greater risk than a more diversified portfolio.

For individual series that have terminated, performance data quoted is from the deposit date through the termination date.Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate and units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
Returns are cumulative total returns (not annualized) unless labeled as average annual total returns. All returns reflect trust expenses as incurred and assume reinvestment of income and principal distributions, except for trusts that do not offer the option of reinvesting distributions into additional trust units. Please see the related trust prospectus for additional information. Returns do not reflect taxes.
A trust's performance, especially for short time periods, should not be the sole factor in making your investment decision. Please keep in mind that high, double-digit returns are highly unusual and cannot be sustained. Investors should also be aware that these returns were primarily achieved during favorable market conditions.
Returns With Sales Charge reflect the maximum sales charge that would be payable by an investor upon sale or redemption of units at the end of the applicable period(s). The sales charge includes any initial or deferred sales charges other than creation and development fee. These returns do not reflect any creation and development fee prior to collection (generally the close of the initial offering period). Any creation and development fee is reflected in the returns as of the time of payment. by a trust. These returns reflect any contingent deferred sales charges only if the charges would be payable upon a unit sale or redemption at or prior to the end of the applicable performance period(s). Certain trusts are no longer offered for sale to the public and, as a result, do not publish an offer price or have a sales charge. In these cases, returns will not reflect a sales charge if a trust was not actually offered for sale to the public on the first day of the applicable period because units of the trust could not have been purchased by an investor at that time. These returns will show 'N/A' for With Sales Charge data

Estimated long-term return (ELTR) is calculated using a formula which (1) takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values, yields (which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated retirement of all the bonds in the trust and (2) takes into account the expenses and sales charge associated with each trust unit. There can be no assurance that either the estimated current return or ELTR will be realized in the future and an investor's units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
2The ELTR life represents the estimated life of the bonds in a Trust's portfolio determined for the purposes of calculating Estimated Long-Term Return.
3Estimated Annual Income Per Unit is as of close the most recent business day and is based on the estimated cash flows per unit. This amount will vary with changes in expenses, interest rates and the maturity, call or sale of bonds.
4Estimated Daily Rate of Accrual represents the annual interest from the securities within the portfolio divided by the number of days on which interest is calculated annually.
5Represents the principal amount of the underlying bonds per unit. Bonds may be sold to meet redemptions, to pay expenses, and in other limited circumstances. The sale of bonds will affect the principal amount of bonds included in the trust and as a result the principal amount of bonds per unit. There can be no assurance that a unitholder will receive this par value per unit in the future.

About risk



There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust.An investment in the trust should be made with an understanding of the risks associated therewith, such as the inability of the issuer or an insurer to pay the principal of or interest on a bond when due, volatile interest rates, early call provisions and changes to the tax status of the bonds. As interest rates rise, bond prices fall.Investments in this trust may be subject to interest rate risk. If interest rates rise, the value of the bonds in a trust may decline and if interest rates decline the value of the bonds may increase. Also, the longer the period to maturity, the greater the sensitivity to interest rate changes tends to be.In particular, should a Build America Bond's issuer fail to continue to meet the applicable requirements imposed on the bonds as provided by the American Recovery & Reinvestment Act of 2009, it is possible that such issuer may not receive federal cash subsidy payments, impairing the issuer's ability to make scheduled interest payments.The trust may concentrate in bonds of a particular type of issuer. This makes the trust less diversified and subject to a greater risk than a more diversified portfolio.
