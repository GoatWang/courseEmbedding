By building these communities around a specific interest, DMC’s proprietary niche community platforms engages audiences in the automotive, health and wellness, travel and businesses services industries on a deeper level than generic platforms. 
DMC builds and acquires content-rich websites, website networks and online communities. With a market trend towards niche messaging and DMC’s significant presence and momentum, we expect to grow our network to 100 million subscribers in the next three years, reaping all the benefits in aggregating large audiences on a highly focused basis, capitalizing on big data , and growing multiple lines of revenue that come with such a presence. 















Wherever people can connect, they will.
But mass communication (Twitter and Facebook) is starting to cede ground to private messaging and more focused and private platforms (WhatsApp, Snapchat).
Mass marketing is getting lost in the shift.
As the world’s internet users turn to more focused groups and communities—communities that unite them through specific interests, beliefs and causes—marketers who’ve devoted significant resources to Twitter, LinkedIn and Facebook are left wondering how to follow.    













Existing platforms tend to focus on marketers as the core audience, neglecting the features or capabilities like comprehensive privacy controls that attract significant numbers of users.
Building platforms that our users love is DMC’s bread and butter. DMC’s community platform in development addresses and delivers exactly what users want more of- privacy, control, better connectedness with their like minded friends and peers, and the ability to express themselves more freely.
The traditional agency model is broken. On today’s web, users are happy to engage with brands when they trust and love the platform they’re on and the content is highly relevant to them. Build for users, and marketers will follow.
That’s what DMC is about. It’s mass marketing on a niche scale. 













One of the fundamental truths of today’s web is the mind-boggling amount of very specific interests communities form around. DMC uses a proprietary community content management system (CMS) that allows it, to ramp up new communities quickly, centralizing management and optimizing content on each site, individually and as a network.
So when we identify an emerging niche interest, we can quickly build a website network to serve the community around that interest.
That approach has led us to massive success to date. The DMC ecosystem consists of:

We build website networks that passionate communities of enthusiasts love. In the process, we create highly targeted online venues to connect marketers with very specific audiences. 













The DMC platform has been in service for two years, after extensive development and testing. Now, we’re planning significant enhancements to take the platform to the next level to focus on video, mobile, enhanced user permission levels, and increased community engagement.
As part of our foundation, DMC, acquired the Enthusiast Online Network which provided its proprietary community content management system, a user engagement incentive engine to increase user inactivity, and a multitude of website communities, creating instant traction and market presence.
Already, DMC sites have been reviewed and approved by some of the largest advertising and affiliate networks:

He also served in executive or senior consultant roles with hedge fund manager Fisher Francis Trees & Watts/Charter Atlantic, and the investment bank, Lehman Brothers.


Co-founder of the world's second-ever interactive advertising network, Allan led the company to a merger with Petry Interactive, making the company the underlying technology platform and business model of what became 24/7 Real Media, one of the largest internet ad networks in the world, where he also served as Director of Affiliate Relations, completing 13 acquisitions of online ad networks.
