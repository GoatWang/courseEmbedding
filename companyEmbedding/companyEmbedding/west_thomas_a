Security


What are OnePass security guidelines?



Each OnePass username and password is unique to a user. It is highly recommended that you do not share your information with anyone else at your organization. Some products require two-step authentication, where a security code or question may be required to access products.




Compromised credentials



If your username and password are suspected or known to be compromised, our priority is to work with you to resecure your profile and protect your data. Next steps and more background information can be found in the Compromised Credentials - FAQS (PDF).




What is two-step authentication?



Two-step authentication is an optional, enhanced setting that keeps your profile secure by requiring a code in addition to your normal password at sign-in. This acts as an extra layer of security to ensure no one else is able to access your profile. Some products require two-step authentication due to secure content.




How do I receive the security code?



You can receive a security code via text message, automated phone call, email, or with a downloaded authenticator application.




Do I need to enter a security code each time I sign in?



No. You can skip two-step authentication on trusted devices, such as your home or personal computer. When you enter a security code at sign-in, select the Trust this device checkbox. This feature should not be used on public computers. To clear trusted devices, sign in to OnePass and navigate to Security and click on the Privacy tab.




How do I enable two-step authentication?




Sign in to OnePass.
Navigate to Security.
Click the toggle to enable two-step authentication.





How can I change my security questions and answers?



Sign in to OnePass and navigate to the Security tab.




Registration keys


What is a registration key?



A registration key is a code made up of letters and numbers that allows access to one of the many Thomson Reuters products, such as Westlaw, CLEAR, Firm Central and more. Registration keys are unique to each user and cannot be used for multiple OnePass profiles. Before using a product, you must activate a valid registration key by adding it to your OnePass profile. 




How do I activate my registration key?



Once you have received your registration key via email, you can either click the Activate Now link from the email or follow these steps to add a key to a OnePass profile.





Help yourself


If you received a registration key in an email, click the Register or Activate button.
If you do not have a OnePass profile:
Create a new OnePass profile.
					   Enter the email address you want associated with your Thomson Reuters products.
					   Enter your name and create a username and password.
					   Click the Register a product button.
					   Select the product you have a registration key for.
					   Enter the registration key and a label to differentiate it from others.
If you have a OnePass profile:

					   Navigate to Products.
					   Click the Register a product button.

What if I have multiple registration keys?

LOT TRACKING







To better serve our customers, we have implemented a new phone system.  Please call (866) 874-6161 to reach a TPi representative.






Quick Facts

    TPi stocks over 1000 microingredients (vitamins, trace minerals, amino acids, neutraceuticals, etc…), manufactures custom premixes, and operates distribution channels to customers west of the Continental Divide. We also distribute internationally to several countries along the Pacific Rim, Canada, and Mexico. Our customers are livestock feed companies, pet food companies, and vertically integrated food companies.  Furthermore, our manufacturing plant and distribution centers are clean, well maintained and managed by competent and experienced employees.  Everyday our goal is to treat those around us how we would like to be treated while providing a level of quality assurance that surpasses industry standards.  TPi was incorporated in May, 1989 and officially opened in 1990. Our stock was purchased by Land O' Lakes Purina Feed in July, 1997, and we operate as a Nutra Blend Brand. 


Quick Facts

    TPi has two manufacturing plants situated on one property in Madera, CA. On the property there is our Main Plant and our Specialty Premix Plant (SPP). The SPP plant evolved as equine customers and end consumers began requesting feeds made in an ionophore (Rumensin® & Bovatec®) free plant. We accepted the challenge and met the requests. After five years of ionophore free status, we chose to make the SPP 100% medication free. No medications are allowed in the SPP and we control contamination up the procurement chain. The SPP has multiple mixers, an Air-Swept-Pullverizer, liquid pumping systems, a tablet press, and several packaging options. The SPP has the capability to manufacture various sized orders from 25 lbs to a full truckload. The production staff in the SPP is our most experienced and include employees that have been with TPi since the early 90’s. 


Quick Facts

    TPi strives daily to improve our customers’ confidence level  with our products and custom premixes. We are 100% compliant with the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002(Bioterrorism Act/BTA) through our own lot tracking and bar coding system. We are also Safe Feed/Safe Food Certified, and efforts are underway to become HACCP certified. Other quality assurance certifications under consideration are FAMI-QS, ISO9001, NASC, and several private certifications. Overall TPi’s goal is to meet or exceed our customers’ needs for Quality Assurance through cooperation, transparency, processing, and innovation.



Quick Facts

    TPi’s domestic market territory consists of states along and west of the Continental Divide. TPi also accesses the international market through the ports of Long Beach, CA; Oakland, CA; and Portland, OR. We do interact and extend our domestic market territory with our sister company based out of Neosho, MO called Nutra Blend. Nutra Blend’s market territory is mainly the states east of the Continental Divide. TPi and Nutra Blend’s market territories provide us with a nationwide footprint for the efficient distribution of microingredients and high quality premixes.

Obtaining Copies
If Digital Images Are Displaying
You can download online images yourself.  Alternatively, you can  purchase copies of various types through Library of Congress Duplication  Services.
HABS/HAER/HALS materials have generally been scanned at high resolution that is suitable for most publication purposes (see Digitizing the Collection for further details about the digital images).

Photographs--All photographs are printed from digital files to preserve the fragile originals. 

Make note of the Call Number and Item Number that appear under the  photograph in the multiple-image display (e.g., HAER, NY,52-BRIG,4-2). 
If possible, include a printout of the photograph. 

Drawings--All drawings are printed from digital files to preserve the fragile originals. 

Make note of the Survey Number (e.g., HAER NY - 143) and Sheet  Number (e.g., "Sheet 1 of 4"), which appear on the edge of the drawing.  (NOTE: These numbers are visible in the Tiff "Reference Image" display.) 
If possible, include a printout of the drawing. 

Data Pages

Make note of the Call Number in the catalog record. 


If Digital Images Are Not Displaying
In the rare case that a digital image for HABS/HAER/HALS  documentation is not displaying online, select images for reproduction  through one of these methods:

Visit the Prints & Photographs Reading Room and request to  view the group (general information about service in the reading room is  available at: http://www.loc.gov/rr/print/info/001_ref.html). It is best to contact reference staff in advance (see: http://www.loc.gov/rr/print/address.html) to make sure the material is on site.  OR 
P&P reading room staff can provide up to 15 quick copies of  items per calendar year (many original items in the holdings are too old  or fragile to make such copies, but generally HABS/HAER/HALS materials  are in good enough condition to be placed on photocopy machines). For  assistance, see our Ask a Librarian page OR 
Hire a freelance researcher to do further selection for you (a list of researchers in available at: http://www.loc.gov/rr/print/resource/013_pic.html). 
You can purchase copies of various types, including quick  copies, through Library of Congress Duplication Services (price lists,  contact information, and order forms for Library of Congress Duplication  Services are available on the Duplication Services Web site): 

Make note of the Call Number listed above. 
Look at the Medium field above. If it lists more than one item: 

The entire group can be ordered as photocopies or high-quality copies. 
All the items in a particular medium (e.g., all drawings, all  photographs) can be ordered as photocopies or high-quality copies. 



Access to Originals

Please use the following steps to determine whether you need to fill out a call slip in the Prints
    and Photographs Reading Room to view the original item(s). In some cases, a surrogate (substitute image) is
    available, often in the form of a digital image, a copy print, or microfilm.
    




Is the item digitized? (A thumbnail (small) image will be visible on the left.)



Yes, the item is digitized.
                Please use the digital image in preference to requesting the original. All images can be
                viewed at a large size when you are in any reading room at the Library of Congress.  In some
                cases, only thumbnail (small) images are available when you are outside the Library of
                Congress because the item is rights restricted or has not been evaluated for rights
                restrictions.
                
                As a preservation measure, we generally do not serve an original item when a digital image
                is available.  If you have a compelling reason to see the original, consult with a reference
                librarian.  (Sometimes, the original is simply too fragile to serve. For example, glass and
                film photographic negatives are particularly subject to damage. They are also easier to see
                online where they are presented as positive images.)
            

No, the item is not digitized. Please go to #2.
            




Do the Access Advisory or Call Number fields above indicate that a non-digital surrogate exists,
            such as microfilm or copy prints?



Yes, another surrogate exists. Reference staff can direct you to this
                surrogate.
            

No, another surrogate does not exist. Please go to #3.
            



        If you do not see a thumbnail image or a reference to another surrogate, please fill out a call slip in
        the Prints and Photographs Reading Room. In many cases, the originals can be served in a few minutes.
        Other materials require appointments for later the same day or in the future.  Reference staff can
        advise you in both how to fill out a call slip and when the item can be served.
    


    To contact Reference staff in the Prints and Photographs Reading Room, please use our
    Ask A Librarian service or call the reading room between 8:30 and
    5:00 at 202-707-6394, and Press 3.

                Significance: The Thomas Coke By-product Works is possibly the finest intact early twentieth century by-product coke works available for interpretation.  The construction of the Koppers-Becker coke ovens at Thomas in 1925 marked the end in the process to convert from beehive coking ovens to by-product recover coking in the Birmingham Industrial District.  Thus, the site represents the modern method of extracting by-products from the coking process and using them to make industrial chemicals such as coal gas, tar, ammonia, light oil and naphthalene.  The coke was used to fuel the Thomas Company's blast furnaces.

Obtaining Copies
If Digital Images Are Displaying
You can download online images yourself.  Alternatively, you can  purchase copies of various types through Library of Congress Duplication  Services.
HABS/HAER/HALS materials have generally been scanned at high resolution that is suitable for most publication purposes (see Digitizing the Collection for further details about the digital images).

Photographs--All photographs are printed from digital files to preserve the fragile originals. 

Make note of the Call Number and Item Number that appear under the  photograph in the multiple-image display (e.g., HAER, NY,52-BRIG,4-2). 
If possible, include a printout of the photograph. 

Drawings--All drawings are printed from digital files to preserve the fragile originals. 

Make note of the Survey Number (e.g., HAER NY - 143) and Sheet  Number (e.g., "Sheet 1 of 4"), which appear on the edge of the drawing.  (NOTE: These numbers are visible in the Tiff "Reference Image" display.) 
If possible, include a printout of the drawing. 

Data Pages

Make note of the Call Number in the catalog record. 


If Digital Images Are Not Displaying
In the rare case that a digital image for HABS/HAER/HALS  documentation is not displaying online, select images for reproduction  through one of these methods:

Visit the Prints & Photographs Reading Room and request to  view the group (general information about service in the reading room is  available at: http://www.loc.gov/rr/print/info/001_ref.html). It is best to contact reference staff in advance (see: http://www.loc.gov/rr/print/address.html) to make sure the material is on site.  OR 
P&P reading room staff can provide up to 15 quick copies of  items per calendar year (many original items in the holdings are too old  or fragile to make such copies, but generally HABS/HAER/HALS materials  are in good enough condition to be placed on photocopy machines). For  assistance, see our Ask a Librarian page OR 
Hire a freelance researcher to do further selection for you (a list of researchers in available at: http://www.loc.gov/rr/print/resource/013_pic.html). 
You can purchase copies of various types, including quick  copies, through Library of Congress Duplication Services (price lists,  contact information, and order forms for Library of Congress Duplication  Services are available on the Duplication Services Web site): 

Make note of the Call Number listed above. 
Look at the Medium field above. If it lists more than one item: 

The entire group can be ordered as photocopies or high-quality copies. 
All the items in a particular medium (e.g., all drawings, all  photographs) can be ordered as photocopies or high-quality copies. 



Access to Originals

Please use the following steps to determine whether you need to fill out a call slip in the Prints
    and Photographs Reading Room to view the original item(s). In some cases, a surrogate (substitute image) is
    available, often in the form of a digital image, a copy print, or microfilm.
    




Is the item digitized? (A thumbnail (small) image will be visible on the left.)



Yes, the item is digitized.
                Please use the digital image in preference to requesting the original. All images can be
                viewed at a large size when you are in any reading room at the Library of Congress.  In some
                cases, only thumbnail (small) images are available when you are outside the Library of
                Congress because the item is rights restricted or has not been evaluated for rights
                restrictions.
                
                As a preservation measure, we generally do not serve an original item when a digital image
                is available.  If you have a compelling reason to see the original, consult with a reference
                librarian.  (Sometimes, the original is simply too fragile to serve. For example, glass and
                film photographic negatives are particularly subject to damage. They are also easier to see
                online where they are presented as positive images.)
            

No, the item is not digitized. Please go to #2.
            




Do the Access Advisory or Call Number fields above indicate that a non-digital surrogate exists,
            such as microfilm or copy prints?



Yes, another surrogate exists. Reference staff can direct you to this
                surrogate.
            

No, another surrogate does not exist. Please go to #3.
            



        If you do not see a thumbnail image or a reference to another surrogate, please fill out a call slip in
        the Prints and Photographs Reading Room. In many cases, the originals can be served in a few minutes.
        Other materials require appointments for later the same day or in the future.  Reference staff can
        advise you in both how to fill out a call slip and when the item can be served.
    


    To contact Reference staff in the Prints and Photographs Reading Room, please use our
    Ask A Librarian service or call the reading room between 8:30 and
    5:00 at 202-707-6394, and Press 3.
