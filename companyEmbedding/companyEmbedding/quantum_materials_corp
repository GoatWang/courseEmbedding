Quantum Dots and the Environment

Our quantum dot synthesis is the “greenest” or most environmentally-friendly process due to its use of ordinary commercial surfactants, typically used in shampoos and laundry detergents as the principal chemical, rather than toxic chemicals normally used in batch synthesis processes. Our automated process provides economies of scale in production of more quantum dots per chemicals used due to economical micro-mixing during the continuous flow process. Higher production levels, less waste and toxic chemicals are factors that contribute to our ability to claim LCOE – Lowest Cost of Enterprise, with lower cost of  materials, processes, devices and waste disposal, demonstrating it is possible to be both environmentally conscious and good business.

Quantum Materials recognizes that non-heavy metal quantum dots must be developed to further protect the environment. In 2015, we have introduced new Cadmium-free (non-heavy metal) quantum dots. We have already made important firsts in the industry in heat, moisture and oxidation resistance and large Stoke Shift quantum dots, by focusing significant research and development effort in enhancing the performance of these materials to satisfy the needs of lighting and display clients for environmentally friendly quantum dots.

Quantum Materials Granted Patent, Honored By Gartner as 2017 Cool Vendor in 3D Printing
                   
                    
                  


San Marcos, TX – May 23, 2017 -- Quantum Materials Corp (OTCBB:QTMM) today announced that the United States Patent and Trademark Office has granted Quantum Materials Corp Patent # 9577149 for the continuous synthesis of high quantum yield InP/ZnS nanocrystals.
                      
“This is an important milestone in consolidating and protecting our intellectual property for large scale volume synthesis of non-cadmium quantum dots,” Quantum Materials founder and CEO Stephen Squires stated. “Continuous synthesis micro-reaction technology is the solution for synthesis of high-quality nanoparticles due to the many advantages our patented process provides, including precise temperature control, mixing efficiencies, fast reaction speed and parallel operation for scalable volume production.”
                    
United States Patent # 9577149 (available at this LINK) covers the continuous-flow synthesis process for the preparation of high quality indium phosphide/zinc sulfide core/shell semiconducting nanocrystals - in particular quantum dots (QD) -  conducted in a micro-reaction system comprising at least one mixing chamber connected to one reaction chamber.
                    
“We have begun continuous-flow volume production of high-efficiency blue quantum dots that we believe will play an important role in the future of quantum dot light-emitting diodes (QD-LEDs). Prior to this point, blue quantum dots exhibited unfavorable energy levels in comparison to red and green quantum dots with respect to device efficiency,” Mr. Squire concluded.
                    
In addition, renowned analyst group Gartner, Inc. has named Quantum Materials as one of five 2017 Cool Vendors in 3D Printing for the Company’s solution to the problem of counterfeit 3D printed parts – embedding light-emitting quantum dots in 3D printing plastic resins for product identification that is nearly impossible to counterfeit. The report from Gartner analysts Pete Basiliere, Marc Halpern and Andrew Stevens is available at https://www.gartner.com/doc/3720117
                    

                    In other Company news, Quantum Materials Corp was recently informed it is a finalist for the 2017 Austin A-List Awards for most Innovative Startups, as presented by the Austin Chamber of Commerce. Final award notification will occur at the A-List Awards on May 25, 2017.

THE PROBLEM

Memory chips are stalled in their quest to continue Moore’s Law, limited to 22 nanometers, which indicates that equivalent physical oxide thickness will not scale below 0.5 nm (about twice the diameter of a silicon atom), which is the expected value at the 22 nm node. According to Wikipedia, this is an indication that CMOS scaling in this area has reached a wall at this point, possibly disturbing Moore's law. On the ITRS roadmap, the successor to 22 nm technology will be 14 nm technology.

THE SOLUTION

Quantum dots are conceived as a possible new advanced material for this purpose due to their small 2nm to 10nm size and semiconductor characteristics. Other materials are being explored but quantum dot advantages in uniformity, custom characteristics, flexibility to use different metals to make optimal QD, and reliable production and cost make Quantum Materials Tetrapod and QDX™ Quantum Dots excellent choices.

THE PROBLEM

Some forms of Printed Electronic use “ink”. Ink formulations have come a long way since fruits and plants were used to provide stains for cave paintings. Today’s conductive ink formulations may use extracts from soy or highly particle-ized metals of silver, copper or carbon materials. The quest in security inks is for novel and singular uncopyable systems.  Cost is the biggest issue and limiting factor for expanding usage of quantum dots in the ink markets.
The Printed Electronics industry is a leader in moving on environmental issues. The newsprinting industry switched  to ecological friendly soy ink years ago. It is safe to say there are very few applications that will be filled with heavy metal inks. Non-heavy metal quantum dot and semiconductor nanocrystals must be developed to meet this requirement and challenge.

THE SOLUTION

Opportunities in the Security Ink field include Brand Identification, Anticounterfeiting, Track & Trace, and Product Authentication. Although Quantum Dots are the newcomer to the ink market they bring many advantages.  Their Smaller size is better than large QD for meeting inkjet printing requirements and semiconductor nanocrystal quantum dots are many times smaller than conductive metals with measurements starting at 2NM.
Automating the QD manufacturing process and then scaling to large scale production of high quality and performance quantum dots that add value will created new markets for wide distribution and usage volumes. The cost of using quantum dots will come by decline by changing a novelty into a commodity. QMC CSO, Dr. Ghassan Jabbour has written extensively on printing quantum dot inks. Quantum Materials can offer a variety of non-heavy metal inks tailored to the requirements of the project.
In addition, inorganic and insoluble QD are are more durable than dyes or pigments and resistant to aging by photobleaching without surface modification for longer product lifetimes. Due to advantageous size and characteristics, fewer quantum dots may be needed due to lower loading levels needed for most ink applications.

Selectivity of Tetrapod Arm Length and Width

In Photovoltaic Solar Cells longer arms will absorb more photons. In Biotech, shorter arms have higher surface to mass ratios for better functionalization while maintaining charge transport advantages. Except for size and color, It is not easy to adjust the inherent characteristics of spheroid hybrid quantum dots by synthesis, but only by surface modification or attachments, adding expense and possible error to the process.

TM editors' note: This article discusses a penny stock and/or microcap. Such stocks are easily manipulated; do your own careful due diligence.
Quantum Materials Corp (“QMC”) (OTC: QTMM ) is neck-deep into the fascinating world of quantum dot (“QD“) technology. Haven’t heard of QDs? You will be hearing a lot more about them soon enough, as they’re increasingly embedded into a new generation of LCD TVs.Like lithium-ion batteries, QD technology has been around for decades, but only now is starting to make serious inroads into a widening range of end-uses, most notably display monitors.   

When QDs are integrated into LCDs, they enable a much more vibrant color spectrum, in part by expanding the gamut of colors perceivable by the human eye.Key to the story is that QD-embedded LCDs compare very favorably to OLED TVs, currently the top-tier TV on the market. OLEDs are very expensive, though, and unlike in LCDs, where costs have been slashed in recent years, there’s no telling if OLED TV prices will fall nearly as fast or as far. However, it’s likely that they won’t, simply because as an incumbent technology, LCDs are produced on a massive scale by dozens of manufacturers. 
Enough of the tech talk.Most people walk into a Best Buy and purchase the biggest TV at the lowest cost, in many cases willing to pay 10% or 15% more for a name brand like LG or Samsung.Some tech-savvy websites say that top of the line QD-enabled LCDs match OLEDs in overall picture quality. ConsumerReports.org does not necessarily support that thesis.It has OLEDs as the top 5 rated TVs and only then do QD LCDs come into view. However, the ratings are not terribly far apart, and OLEDs are typically 75% to 150% more expensive. We’re talking about a price difference that can be in the $1,000(s), not just $100s.Bottom line? QD LCD TV’s will very likely proliferate, and companies with strong QD technology and manufacturing platforms are well positioned to thrive.  
That’s where QMC comes in. I spent a lot of time understanding the key aspects of QDs before interviewing the Company’s CEO, Sri Peruvemba. In speaking with him, one can stumble deep into the weeds very quickly. We agreed to keep the interview at the 30,000–foot level. The views expressed herein are entirely those of Mr. Peruvemba. 
Sri, please tell readers more about Quantum Materials Corp? 
Quantum Materials Corp (“QMC”)  [OTCQB: QTMM]  is an innovative technology company that is primarily a manufacturer of quantum dots (“QDs“).We have developed a proprietary, IP-protected technology and process to manufacture QDs on a highly scalable basis, an achievement not common in the industry. A key competitive advantage is the continuous-flow production capacity we engineered to allow us to produce premium quality quantum dots for QD-enabled LCDs (“QD LCDs”).  
Quantum dots are truly amazing. They’re a thousand times smaller than microscopic crystals, or nano-crystals, which, when excited by UV to blue light, emit light of different colors depending on the material and size of the nano particle.Imagine shining a flashlight on a baseball and it glowing bright red. That’s the general idea of a quantum dot, except, of course, almost inconceivably smaller in size.

Quantum Materials Corp, tiny Products, GIANT Potential

By Peter Epstein -  November 25, 2016 








Quantum Materials Corp (“QMC”) (OTC: QTMM) is neck-deep into the fascinating world of quantum dot (“QD“) technology.  Haven’t heard of QDs?  You will be hearing a lot more about them soon enough, as they’re increasingly embedded into a new generation of LCD TVs.  Like lithium-ion batteries, QD technology has been around for decades, but only now is starting to make serious inroads into a widening range of end-uses, most notably display monitors.   

When QDs are integrated into LCDs, they enable a much more vibrant color spectrum, in part by expanding the gamut of colors perceivable by the human eye.  Key to the story is that QD-embedded LCDs compare very favorably to OLED TVs, currently the top-tier TV on the market.  OLEDs are very expensive though, and unlike in LCDs, where costs have been slashed in recent years, there’s no telling if OLED TV prices will fall nearly as fast or as far.  However, it’s likely that they won’t, simply because as an incumbent technology, LCDs are produced on a massive scale by dozens of manufacturers.
Enough of the tech talk.  Most people walk into a Best Buy and purchase the biggest TV at the lowest cost, in many cases willing to pay 10% or 15% more for a name brand like LG or Samsung.  Some tech-savvy websites say that top of the line QD-enabled LCDs match OLEDs in overall picture quality.  ConsumerReports.org does not necessarily support that thesis.  It has OLEDs as the top 5 rated TVs and only then do QD LCDs come into view.  However, the ratings are not terribly far apart, and OLEDs are typically 75% to 150% more expensive.  We’re talking about a price difference that can be in the $1,000(s), not just $100s.  Bottom line?  QD LCD TV’s will very likely proliferate, and companies with strong QD technology and manufacturing platforms are well positioned to thrive.
That’s where QMC comes in.  I spent a lot of time understanding the key aspects of QDs before interviewing the Company’s CEO, Sri Peruvemba.  In speaking with him, one can stumble deep into the weeds very quickly.  We agreed to keep the interview at the 30,000–foot level.  The views expressed herein are entirely those of Mr. Peruvemba. 

Sri, please tell readers more about Quantum Materials Corp? 
Quantum Materials Corp (“QMC”)  [OTCQB: QTMM]  is an innovative technology company that is primarily a manufacturer of quantum dots (“QDs“).  We have developed a proprietary, IP-protected technology and process to manufacture QDs on a highly scalable basis, an achievement not common in the industry.  A key competitive advantage is the continuous-flow production capacity we engineered to allow us to produce premium quality quantum dots for QD-enabled LCDs (“QD LCDs”).  
Quantum dots are truly amazing.  They’re a thousand-times smaller than microscopic crystals, or nano-crystals, which, when excited by UV to blue light, emit light of different colors depending on the material and size of the nano particle.  Imagine shining a flashlight on a baseball and it glowing bright red.  That’s the general idea of a quantum dot, except, of course, almost inconceivably smaller in size.
++++
With our innovative approach, we aim to leapfrog traditional batch synthesis (non-uniform) production platforms.  We’re confident we can ship large, industrial-scale quantities of QDs, at very competitive prices.  Samples have been sent to a number of the largest display technology companies in the world.  A single commercial purchase order would put QMC on the map. 
We have recruited some of the most accomplished scientists, researchers, engineers, and production personnel in the material sciences industry.  This was a key factor in my decision to join QMC,  I think we have an outstanding team, especially given our small size.
How large are the existing markets that you plan to penetrate?  What new markets do you envision?
The most immediate market (and the one in which we have most traction), is in LCD TVs, representing hundreds of millions of units per year.  QDs can also be used in billboards, monitors, laptops, & tablet devices.  Each of these segments also represent the potential for hundreds of millions of units annually, so these display markets represent by far our biggest focus.
QMC was founded to drive QD solar energy (photovoltaic, or QDPV) development.  We have a wholly-owned subsidiary to fulfill the promise that QDs hold in expanding PV implementation.  A major advantage of QDPV is that established PV cells depend on relatively thick layers of material for adequate light energy absorption.  By contrast, QDPV devices possess absorption rates orders-of-magnitude higher, they can absorb infrared energy at night and on cloudy days.  That radically reduces the thickness and therefore the materials required, meaningfully cutting manufacturing costs.




So, quantum dot technology moderately enhances the picture quality of LCD TVs and other display monitors at less cost.  Is there more to the story? 
That’s a good question.  Yes, there is more to the story, especially with regard to solar and a number of other exciting end uses. For us though, higher quality QDs  in much greater quantities and at significantly lower cost is our mantra.  Our quantum dots will substantially enhance the picture quality of a LCD TV.  Over time, we fully expect our QDs to be used in other products; we will be wholesaling them to companies spearheading widespread adoption of new end uses.  As such, we will sidestep the technologically competitive and brand penetration risks of our customers.  

Competition must be fierce, including from giants like Samsung.  How can your company thrive in this environment?
I get asked that a lot!  Much of the competition comes from smaller firms, like ours, trying to disrupt larger players.  Some have won designs and shipped QDs into TV applications.  We have patents and valuable IP licenses, and our scalable QD manufacturing process is highly automated, so we can offer customers both high quality and high capacity that’s not significantly impacted by labor or geography.  We see the larger players in the industry as potential customers and partners rather than competitors.  Most don’t have well-established, high-quality quantum dot technology in house, or sufficient manufacturing capacity.  Large players should be eager to partner with a company like QMC.
You said large & small, public & private companies are already using quantum dots.  What can you say about the cost, quality, and other elements of existing QDs? 
Much of the success in the market emanates from companies that have supplied cadmium-based (heavy metal) QDs.  This is important because, with restrictions on the use of cadmium in Europe and Japan, the future for those products is not bright.  We are not the only game in town, but the volumes of products supplied by competitors is still quite small.  Since we use manufacturing processes that we believe are superior, we expect to deliver a better product suite, again, at a very competitive price. 
What about technology risk from new methods of producing quantum dots?  Could your Intellectual Property become obsolete? 
We are the new method for making QDs; we are the ones posing a risk to the incumbent’s IP.  Our IP is strong, and we are always developing new IP to secure and consolidate our position in the market.  This is still an emerging science, so I expect a lot of developments in the next decade, and we’re seeing a lot of research being done at universities, as well as at large and small companies.  No one knows for sure, but the expanding size and wider range of end-uses promise a large QD market for the foreseeable future.
If quantum dot technology has been around for decades, why hasn’t the market taken off?
Developing and optimizing the quality of materials and integrating new core technologies such as QDs takes time.  It’s no different from the original LCD & OLED technologies that took decades to develop.  No different from lithium-ion batteries that are becoming ubiquitous.  Products from select companies are shipping, and there are TVs in the market that utilize QDs.  However, it’s still early days, and the market is huge.  While we think we have an opportunity to capture substantial market share, even more modest penetration could, over time, amount to hundreds of millions in revenue.  Not bad for a company with an Enterprise Value [market cap + debt – cash] of US$25 million. 
Do you feel that QMC has a finite window of opportunity during which it has to gain traction or risk missing key growth stages in the market? 
Yes, each market from TV to Solar to innovative uses to ensure the authenticity of pharmaceuticals, each have windows of opportunity.  We are constantly monitoring these windows to make sure we’re well–positioned, and we think we are.  However, as mentioned, display represents the clearest path to revenue generation.  Solar provides us with longer-term potential, potential for which we could possibly self-fund based on cash flow from our display segment. 
I understand that the Company has been sending sample material to a number of parties. What type of end-users are being targeted? 
Yes, that’s right.  Companies receiving samples are those able to take our QDs and produce film composites for use in TVs and other display applications.  We are talking about a handful of large, well-established players in the TV supply chain.  This is a critical step for us, and we think it demonstrates where we stand in our development phase.  Small companies like ours are able to sell samples because our customers believe that our technology and our ability to operate at industrial-scale is secure.  That means the ability to ramp up if/when we receive commercial-scale purchase orders.  And, look, the companies buying our samples aren’t playing games, the display industry is a serious business.  There’s lots of money at stake, including investment on their part to evaluate our samples and make QD-composite films.
To the extent that you believe the valuation of QMC is attractive, why should readers consider investing now?  Why not wait for commercial purchase orders?
As evidenced by major TV manufacturers beginning to offer QD-enhanced model lines, QDs have arrived, but the market is wide open.  If we are at a tipping point in QDs, then waiting for a major de-risking event like a purchase order could mean missing out on a large move in the share price.  It’s that simple.  We’re confident that our team can provide QDs of the highest quality, in the volumes necessary, for wholesale commercial introduction.  If we can execute on that premise, QMC could be a very interesting company.  Still, there remains considerable risk.  We’ve been at this for years but have yet to cross the finish line.  That’s the unmistakable risk/reward proposition for investors, an opportunity which evolves as a company goes from, “lab to fab.”  We have a great future ahead of us, and we’re aiming to create a valuable company for our employees, customers and shareholders.

Sri, thank you so much for your time and thought-provoking answers. Quantum dots are hard to conceptualize, but their functionality and importance in a growing number of end uses is just beginning.  I hope this interview serves as inspiration to learn more about quantum dots and about Quantum Materials Corp (OTC: QTMM).  For further information on this subject, please take a look at the following:

What are QDs? 
Disclosures: Quantum Materials Corp. is a company that I, Peter Epstein, CFA, MBA, am invested in.  I have no existing or prior relationship with CEO, Sri Peruvemba or QMC.  QMC is a small cap company will all the attendant risks.  This interview is in no way whatsoever a recommendation or solicitation to buy or sell any security.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
