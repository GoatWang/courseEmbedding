Recall Details

















Expanded Voluntary Worldwide Recall of EpiPen® Auto-Injector







                        Mylan announced on March 31, 2017, that Meridian Medical Technologies, a Pfizer company and Mylan’s manufacturing partner for EpiPen® Auto-Injector, has expanded a voluntary recall of select lots of EpiPen (epinephrine injection, USP) and EpiPen Jr® (epinephrine injection, USP) Auto-Injectors to now include additional lots distributed in the U.S. and other markets in consultation with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

This recall is being conducted as a result of the receipt of two previously disclosed reports outside of the U.S. of failure to activate the device. Both reports are related to the single lot that was previously recalled by Meridian. The incidence of the defect is extremely rare and testing and analysis across the potentially impacted lots has not identified any units with a defect. However, the recall is being expanded by Meridian to include additional lots as a precautionary measure out of an abundance of caution. 

The recall impacts certain lots of the 0.3 mg and 0.15 mg strengths of EpiPen Auto-Injector. None of the recalled lots include the authorized generic for EpiPen Auto-Injector, which is also manufactured by Meridian Medical Technologies. 

The recalled product was manufactured and distributed by Meridian between December 2015 and July 2016. The expanded voluntary recall is being initiated in the U.S. The recall also will extend to additional markets in Europe, Asia, North and South America.

Epinephrine is the first-line treatment for a life-threatening allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) and access to this product is critical in the event of an emergency. Delays in epinephrine administration have been associated with negative health consequences.

More information about the risks and benefits of EpiPen® Auto-Injector can be found at EpiPen.com.

Mylan N.V. is an American global generic and specialty pharmaceuticals company registered in the Netherlands, with principal executive offices in Hatfield, Hertfordshire, UK and global headquarters in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, US.[2] In 2007, Mylan acquired a controlling interest in India-based Matrix Laboratories Limited, a top producer of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) for generic drugs,[3] and the generics business of Germany-based Merck KGaA.[4] Through these acquisitions, Mylan grew from the third-largest generic and pharmaceuticals company in the United States to the second-largest generic and specialty pharmaceuticals company in the world.[5]
In 2016, Mylan's pricing of the EpiPen, an epinephrine autoinjector, became controversial and was widely referred to as "price gouging". As a result, investigations were opened into whether Mylan had misclassified the EpiPen under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, a common form of pharmaceutical fraud. In October 2016, Mylan settled these investigations with the U.S. Department of Justice, agreeing to pay $465 million and enter into a corporate integrity agreement concerning the rebate program. In a report published on June 12, 2017 the Institutional Shareholder Services criticized Mylan for the "outsized compensation" of Mylan's directors. Former CEO Robert Coury received a "$98 million" 2016 "pay package" in spite of the "harm to the company inflicted by the EpiPen controversies" and "steep shareholder losses." The report urged Mylan's shareholders to "oust all of Mylan's existing directors".[6]

Location[edit]
Founded in 1961, the company was first located in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia.[16] The company moved to Morgantown, West Virginia, in 1965, and in 1976 it relocated its corporate headquarters to the Pittsburgh suburb Canonsburg, Pennsylvania. Finally in 2004 it moved to a new office center in nearby Southpointe, a suburban business park located in Cecil Township, where it is still located.[17]
Stock[edit]
On February 23, 1973, Mylan had its initial public offering (IPO),[18] becoming a publicly traded company on the OTC market under the ticker symbol MYLN. In 1976 the stock moved to NASDAQ. Their final stock move was in 1986, when their stock became available for trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol MYL. Currently, the stock is traded on the NASDAQ.
History[edit]
Mylan Pharmaceuticals was founded as a drug distributor in 1961 by Milan Puskar and Don Panoz.[16] In 1966 Mylan began manufacturing penicillin G tablets as well as vitamins and other dietary supplements.[16][19]
Panoz left Mylan in 1969 and Puskar quit the company in 1973, as it grew and experienced financial difficulties; the board hired Roy McKnight as board chairman, who convinced Puskar to return in 1976.[19]
Mylan discontinued operating as a contract manufacturing organization in 1980 and instead chose to market their products under their own "Mylan-labeled" brand.[citation needed]
With the passage of the Hatch-Waxman Act in 1984, Mylan and other small generic companies gained value; in the eighteen months following passage of the law Mylan's earnings grew 166% to $12.5 million and its stock value rose 800%.[20]
In the 1980s one of the most prescribed drugs in the US was Dyazide, a diuretic that was a combination drug containing triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide; it had been on the market since 1965 and its patents had expired in 1980.[21] Complications arose with the introductions of generics versions, because the formulation of Dyazide resulted in variable batches that made it impossible for generic manufacturers to show that their versions were bioequivalent.[22][23]
Some generic companies committed fraud trying to bring a generic version of Dyazide. Bolar Pharmaceutical had the first generic version approved in 1987,[21] but it turned out that Bolar had fraudulently substituted Dyazide for its own version to conduct studies that were submitted to the FDA by 1989 the FDA rescinded its approval based on its suspicions and filed criminal charges against Bolar, to which Bolar eventually pled guilty in 1991.[24][25][26]
Mylan chose to develop a new version of a triamterene/hydrochlorothiazide combination drug instead of going the generic route; it developed a different, more stable formulation[23] and used different dosages of each active ingredient (50 mg hydrochlorothiazide and 75 mg triamterene, compared with Dyazide's 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide and 50 mg triamterene).[27] This drug had to get approval as a new drug, as opposed to a generic; their product was called Maxzide and was approved in 1984.[27][28] The higher dose allowed once per day dosing, which Mylan and its marketing partner, Lederle, believed would help it compete against Dyazide, which had $210M in sales in 1983.[27] However, Mylan's patents on the drug were declared invalid in court, and its marketing exclusivity expired in 1987, prompting a rush of generic competition[29]
Mylan had concerns about the practices of its competitors and the FDA in general, and also with regard to companies seeking to bring generic versions of Maxzide. Mylan hired private investigators to examine its competitors' practices, and when it found evidence of corruption, it submitted it to the House Oversight and Investigations Committee, which investigated and found fraud and corruption within the Food and Drug Administration's generic drugs division and at other generic companies.[19] Two of the companies that had gotten approval to market generic versions of Maxzide, Vitarine Pharmaceutical and Par Pharmaceutical, were targets of Mylan's initial investigation and were found to have used Mylan's Maxzide to obtain their bioequivalence data, leading both companies to withdraw its generic competitor to Mylan's product.[19][30]
The corruption in the nascent generics industry and at the office in the FDA regulating it was widely covered in the media, and led to widespread concern among doctors and the public in the late 1980s and early 1990s that generic drugs were not really the same as the branded drugs they were meant to replace.[24][31][22]
In 1987 Mylan agreed to enter into a joint venture with Bolar to buy Somerset Pharmaceuticals; Mylan wanted access to Somersets' drug discovery capabilities as well as its new drug for Parkinson's, selegiline; the deal was completed in 1988 but its consummation was dependent on FDA approval of selegiline, which came in 1989.[19][32][33]
Mylan acquired Bertek Inc. in 1993 for its transdermal patch technologies, and kept as a subsidiary; in 1999 Mylan renamed the company Mylan Technologies Inc. (MTI).[34] MTI eventually came to be the contract manufacturer for the selegiline transdermal patch and was the first company to market generic nitroglycerin, estradiol, clonidine, and fentanyl transdermal patches.[34] Mylan acquired UDL Laboratories, a supplier of unit dose generic medications to institutional and long-term care facilities in 1996.[35]
In 1998 when it was the world's second largest generics company, Mylan came under investigation from the Federal Trade Commission after it raised the prices of its products, tripling them in the case of lorazepam; Mylan had entered into an exclusive agreement with Profarmica, an Italian company that supplied drug ingredients, after which Mylan's competitors had higher prices and a diminished supply of raw ingredients for lorazepam and other drugs.[36] Before the round of price increases the price of generic drugs had been 5 - 10% of the price of branded drugs and afterwards it was around 50%.[36] The FTC filed suit at the end of 1998 and 32 states filed parallel actions; the case was settled in 2000, with Mylan paying a total of $147M -- $100M in disgorged profits into a fund to reimburse consumers and state agencies that had overpaid, $8 million in attorney's fees to the State Attorneys General, $35 million, plus $4 million in attorney's fees, to settle certain class actions with insurers and managed care organizations -- and Mylan and three ingredient suppliers (Cambrex Corporation, Profarmaco S.R.L., and Gyma Laboratories) also agreed to an injunction barring them from entering into similar anticompetitive agreements in the future.[37][38]
In 2004 Mylan and King Pharmaceuticals began discussing a deal in which Mylan would acquire King for about $4B; Mylan wanted to expand its presence in branded pharmaceuticals and to acquire King's sales force.[39] The deal became one of the business soap operas of the year, and included an SEC investigation into King's accounting and Carl Icahn obtaining a 9.8% interest in Mylan and becoming its largest stakeholder in order to kill the deal; the parties called off the deal in February 2005.[39] Icahn offered to buy Mylan for $5.4B[40] and ran a slate of board members to change the direction of Mylan; he won three seats in May 2005.[41] In June Mylan bought back 25% of its shares in order to fend off Icahn;[42] and in July Icahn gave up his bid and sold his shares.[43]
In August 2006 Mylan announced that it had reached agreement to buy a controlling interest in Matrix Laboratories, an Indian supplier of active pharmaceutical ingredients; the deal gave Mylan access to markets in India and China and was completed in January the next year.[44][45]
In May 2007 Mylan and Merck KGaA agreed that Mylan would acquire Merck's generics arm for $6.6B; the deal was completed that October and tripled the size of Mylan.[46][47] Mylan acquired the rights to market the EpiPen in the transaction; at that time annual sales were around $200 million[48] and the EpiPen had about 90% of the market.[49]
In 2009, the company filed two lawsuits against the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette after the newspaper ran an article that was critical of the quality control procedures used at the company's Morgantown plant.[50][51] The company had earlier quality control issues involving the FDA.[52] The lawsuits were dropped in 2012 without any damages paid by the Post-Gazette, which stated "The Post-Gazette did not find and did not intend to report that Mylan had manufactured or distributed any defective drugs. The Post-Gazette regrets if any reader of the article thought otherwise."[53]
Also in 2009, Mylan and its subsidiary UDL agreed to pay a $118M to settle a suit filed under the False Claims Act in which Mylan/UDL and two other companies were accused of underpaying states under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. The program requires drug companies to give rebates to states under Medicaid and the rebates are higher for new drugs than for generics; the suit said that the companies sold new drugs but paid rebates as if they were generics.[54]
In 2011, Mylan entered into an agreement with Pfizer for the exclusive worldwide rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize Pfizer's generic equivalent to GlaxoSmithKline's Advair (US)/Seretide (UK) Diskus incorporating Pfizer's proprietary dry powder inhaler delivery platform;[55] Mylan launched the product in the UK in 2015[56] and in February 2016 the FDA accepted its ANDA, putting it in line behind Hikma and Sandoz to launch a generic version in the US.[57]
In 2012, Mylan launched a program called EpiPen4Schools to sell EpiPens in bulk and with discounts to schools; to participate in the program schools had to agree not to buy epinephrine autoinjectors from any other company for a year.[58]
In December 2012, the National Association of State Boards of Education launched a policy initiative designed to "help state boards of education as they develop student health policies regarding anaphylaxis and epinephrine auto-injector access and use," and advocated for state laws protecting school from legal liability for stocking and using epinephrine autoinjectors. Gayle Manchin, the mother of Mylan's CEO, Heather Bresch, had become president of the association in 2010, and shortly after had discussed donations from her "daughter's company" to the association. Manchin had been appointed to the West Virginia state school board by her husband, then-governor of the state Joe Manchin, in 2007.[59]
In 2013 Mylan acquired an Indian generic injectable drugs company, Agila Specialties Private, for $1.6 billion in cash.[60] In 2015 three plants acquired in that deal were issued warning letters by the FDA.[61]
After successful lobbying from Mylan,[48] in 2013, the "School Access to Emergency Epinephrine Act" became law after passing Congress with broad and bipartisan support; it protected anyone from liability if they administered epinephrine to a child in a school (previously, only trained professionals or the affected person were allowed to administer the drug, and were open to liability), and it provided some financial incentives for schools that didn’t already stock epinephrine autoinjector to start stocking them.[62] Joe Manchin, the father of Mylan's CEO, was a senator at that time.[59]
In July 2014, Mylan and Abbott Laboratories announced an agreement under which Mylan would buy Abbott's generic drugs business in developed markets for stock valued at about $5.3 billion.[63] Mylan acquired Mumbai-based Famy Care and expand its presence in the market for women's contraceptives at about $750 million.[64]
Starting in 2014, according to a 2017 report in the New York Times, mid-level executives began questioning the rate at which the company had increased and was planning to continue to increase the price of the Epi-Pen, and raising concerns that the price increases were unethical; the Times reported that when these concerns were brought to Robert Coury, the chairman of the board, Coury "replied that he was untroubled. He raised both his middle fingers and explained, using colorful language, that anyone criticizing Mylan, including its employees, ought to go copulate with themselves. Critics in Congress and on Wall Street, he said, should do the same. And regulators at the Food and Drug Administration? They, too, deserved a round of anatomically challenging self-fulfillment."  The Times reported that Bresch provided similarly dismissive responses.[65]
In April 2015, Mylan tried negotiate with the management of Irish pharmaceutical firm Perrigo to acquire the company, and when those negotiations failed Mylan attempted a hostile takeover, offering to buy $26B in shares directly from shareholders; too few shareholders agreed to sell their stock by the deadline set in November 2015 and the effort failed.[66]
Two weeks after Mylan made its first offer for Perrigo, Teva Pharmaceutical offered to buy Mylan for $40B; the combined companies would have been the world's largest generic company and the 9th biggest drug company in the world.[67] In July, Teva dropped its bid for Mylan and instead acquired Allergan's generic drug business for about the same price.[68][69]
In June 2015, Mylan agreed to work with Pulmatrix, a company with a proprietary inhaled drug delivery platform, to co-develop a product to treat for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; the product was PUR0200, a generic drug in a Pulmatrix device.[70]
In February 2016, the company announced it would acquire Meda for $9.9 billion.[71] In May of the same year the company announced it would acquire Renaissance Acquisition Holdings dermatology division for up to $1 billion.[72]
In 2015 Mylan had about $1.5B in sales of EpiPens and those sales accounted for 40% of Mylan's profit.[48] Mylan had maintained about a 90% market share since it had acquired the product, and had continually raised the price of EpiPens starting in 2009: in 2009, the wholesale price of two EpiPens was about $100; by July 2013, the price was about $265; in May 2015, it was around $461; and in May 2016, the price rose again to around $609,[73] around a 500% jump from the price in 2009.[74] In the summer of 2016, as parents prepared to send their children back to school and went to pharmacies to get new EpiPens, people began to express outrage at the cost of the EpiPen and Mylan was widely and harshly criticized.[75][76] The price hikes led to investigations by Congress and states attorneys general; in October 2016 Mylan agreed to pay a $465M fine related to incorrect rebates it paid under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.[77]
In December 2016, the attorneys general of 20 states filed a civil complaint accusing Mylan of a coordinated scheme to artificially maintain high prices for a generic antibiotic and diabetes drug. The complaint alleged price collusion schemes between six pharmaceutical firms including informal gatherings, telephone calls, and text messages.[78]
According to the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Inspector General analysis, the U.S. government may have overpaid "as much as $1.27 billion between 2006 and 2016" to drugmaker Mylan N.V. for the EpiPen emergency allergy treatment. This represents three times the proposed settlement of $465 million announced by Mylan in October 2016. Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee that launched the "probe of EpiPen pricing probe in 2016, released the analysis on May 30, 2017.[79] On the same day, a group of Mylan "investment funds urged shareholders to vote against the re-election of the company's directors after it paid Chairman Robert Coury over $97 million last year."[79]

Criticism[edit]
EpiPen pricing[edit]

See also: Heather Bresch § Business executive
Mylan acquired the right to market and distribute the EpiPen line of epinephrine autoinjector devices from Merck KGaA as part of their 2007 deal;[73] that right had formerly been held by Dey LP, a wholly owned subsidiary of Merck.[80] The devices deliver about $1 worth of drug.[48] At that time annual sales were around $200M.[48] Bresch, the company's CEO, saw an opportunity to increase sales through marketing and advocacy, and the company launched a marketing campaign to increase awareness of the dangers of anaphylaxis for people with severe allergies that made the brand "EpiPen" as identified with its product as "Kleenex" is with facial tissue; the company also successfully lobbied the FDA to broaden the label to include risk of anaphylaxis and in parallel, successfully lobbied Congress to generate legislation making EpiPens available in schools and in public places like defibrillators are, and hired the same people that Medtronic had worked with on defibrillator legislation to do so.[48] Mylan's efforts to gain market dominance were aided when Sanofi's competing product was recalled in November 2015 and further when Teva's generic competitor was rejected by the FDA in March 2016.[81]
By the first half of 2015, Mylan had an 85% market share of such devices in the US[48] and in that year sales reached around $1.5B and accounted for 40% of Mylan's profit.[82] Those profits were also due in part to Mylan's continually raising the price of EpiPens starting in 2009; in 2007 the wholesale price of two EpiPens was about $100, the price was about the same in 2009, by July 2013 the price about $265, in May 2015 it was around $461, and in May 2016 the price rose again to around $609.[73] The last price increase sparked widespread outrage, including criticism from Martin Shkreli, "poster boy for grasping pharma greed," letters from two Senators and initiation of Congressional investigations,[82][83] and Mylan's pricing of the EpiPen was widely referred to as price gouging.[84][85][86] The last price increase coincided with a new line of TV commercials that were described as "shocking" and "no holds barred", depicting an anaphylactic reaction from the point of view of the young woman having it at a party, and ending with the young woman seeing her swollen and hive-covered face in the mirror before she collapses.[87] In response to criticism, Mylan increased financial assistance available for some patients to purchase EpiPens,[88] a gesture that was called a "classic public relations move" by Harvard Medical School professor Aaron Kesselheim.[89] The up to $300 saving cards can only be used by a small number of people who need the drug, and no one on Medicaid. They do nothing about the high price which is still being paid by insurers, who ultimately pass the cost onto consumers.[89]
In September 2016, the New York State Attorney General began an investigation into Mylan's EpiPen4Schools program in New York to determine if the program's contracts violated antitrust law[90] and the West Virginia State Attorney General opened an investigation into whether Mylan had given the state the correct discount under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and subpoenaed the company when it refused to provide the documentation the state requested.[91]
In October 2016 the CEO of Mylan testified to Congress that Pfizer/King charged Mylan about $34.50 for one device.[92] In September 2016, a Silicon Valley engineering consultancy performed a teardown analysis of the EpiPen and estimated the manufacturing and packaging costs at about $10 for a two-pack.[93]
In October 2016, Mylan announced a settlement with the US Department of Justice over rebates paid by Mylan to states under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.[77] Questions had been raised by Congress and others about why EpiPen had been classified as a generic rather a proprietary product in the program since 1997; generic drugs have lower rebates (13%) than proprietary drugs (23%), and price hikes for generic drugs cannot be passed onto states, and a common form of pharmaceutical fraud involves misclassifying proprietary drugs as generic under the program.[94] Under the agreement Mylan agreed to pay a $465 million payment and to a sign a corporate integrity agreement requiring it to perform better in the future;[77] the settlement also resolved cases brought by states related to the rebates.[95] Simultaneously with the settlement Mylan also announced it was being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission related to the drug rebate program.[96]
In June 2017 the New York Times published an article reporting on internal Mylan discussions about price increases on the EpiPen between 2014 and 2016, in which the company chairman expressed disdain for people and agencies who might criticize the company; the reporter wrote: "Those top leaders’ responses are a far cry from the message on Mylan’s website, which says that 'we challenge every member of every team to challenge the status quo,' and that 'we put people and patients first, trusting that profits will follow.'", and also noted that "The firm is a case study in the limits of what consumer and employee activism, as well as government oversight, can achieve." [65][97][98][99]
Execution drugs[edit]
Mylan manufactures rocuronium bromide, which is approved by the state of Alabama for use in executions by lethal injection. European manufacturers refuse to sell drugs which can be used for executions to the United States, except to distributors or users who sign legally binding agreements that the drug will not be used for executions down the delivery chain.[100]
In September 2014, the London-based human rights organization Reprieve told Mylan that they were the only FDA-approved manufacturer of rocuronium bromide without legal controls in place to prevent its use in executions, and there was "a very real risk that Mylan may soon become the go-to provider of execution drugs for states across the country". The German asset manager DJE Kapital (de) divested itself of $70 million in Mylan shares for that reason. Mylan said that their distribution was "legally compliant".[100]

Mylan N.V. is an American global generic and specialty pharmaceuticals company registered in the Netherlands, with principal executive offices in Hatfield, Hertfordshire, UK and global headquarters in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, US.[2] In 2007, Mylan acquired a controlling interest in India-based Matrix Laboratories Limited, a top producer of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) for generic drugs,[3] and the generics business of Germany-based Merck KGaA.[4] Through these acquisitions, Mylan grew from the third-largest generic and pharmaceuticals company in the United States to the second-largest generic and specialty pharmaceuticals company in the world.[5]
In 2016, Mylan's pricing of the EpiPen, an epinephrine autoinjector, became controversial and was widely referred to as "price gouging". As a result, investigations were opened into whether Mylan had misclassified the EpiPen under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, a common form of pharmaceutical fraud. In October 2016, Mylan settled these investigations with the U.S. Department of Justice, agreeing to pay $465 million and enter into a corporate integrity agreement concerning the rebate program. In a report published on June 12, 2017 the Institutional Shareholder Services criticized Mylan for the "outsized compensation" of Mylan's directors. Former CEO Robert Coury received a "$98 million" 2016 "pay package" in spite of the "harm to the company inflicted by the EpiPen controversies" and "steep shareholder losses." The report urged Mylan's shareholders to "oust all of Mylan's existing directors".[6]

Location[edit]
Founded in 1961, the company was first located in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia.[16] The company moved to Morgantown, West Virginia, in 1965, and in 1976 it relocated its corporate headquarters to the Pittsburgh suburb Canonsburg, Pennsylvania. Finally in 2004 it moved to a new office center in nearby Southpointe, a suburban business park located in Cecil Township, where it is still located.[17]
Stock[edit]
On February 23, 1973, Mylan had its initial public offering (IPO),[18] becoming a publicly traded company on the OTC market under the ticker symbol MYLN. In 1976 the stock moved to NASDAQ. Their final stock move was in 1986, when their stock became available for trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol MYL. Currently, the stock is traded on the NASDAQ.
History[edit]
Mylan Pharmaceuticals was founded as a drug distributor in 1961 by Milan Puskar and Don Panoz.[16] In 1966 Mylan began manufacturing penicillin G tablets as well as vitamins and other dietary supplements.[16][19]
Panoz left Mylan in 1969 and Puskar quit the company in 1973, as it grew and experienced financial difficulties; the board hired Roy McKnight as board chairman, who convinced Puskar to return in 1976.[19]
Mylan discontinued operating as a contract manufacturing organization in 1980 and instead chose to market their products under their own "Mylan-labeled" brand.[citation needed]
With the passage of the Hatch-Waxman Act in 1984, Mylan and other small generic companies gained value; in the eighteen months following passage of the law Mylan's earnings grew 166% to $12.5 million and its stock value rose 800%.[20]
In the 1980s one of the most prescribed drugs in the US was Dyazide, a diuretic that was a combination drug containing triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide; it had been on the market since 1965 and its patents had expired in 1980.[21] Complications arose with the introductions of generics versions, because the formulation of Dyazide resulted in variable batches that made it impossible for generic manufacturers to show that their versions were bioequivalent.[22][23]
Some generic companies committed fraud trying to bring a generic version of Dyazide. Bolar Pharmaceutical had the first generic version approved in 1987,[21] but it turned out that Bolar had fraudulently substituted Dyazide for its own version to conduct studies that were submitted to the FDA by 1989 the FDA rescinded its approval based on its suspicions and filed criminal charges against Bolar, to which Bolar eventually pled guilty in 1991.[24][25][26]
Mylan chose to develop a new version of a triamterene/hydrochlorothiazide combination drug instead of going the generic route; it developed a different, more stable formulation[23] and used different dosages of each active ingredient (50 mg hydrochlorothiazide and 75 mg triamterene, compared with Dyazide's 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide and 50 mg triamterene).[27] This drug had to get approval as a new drug, as opposed to a generic; their product was called Maxzide and was approved in 1984.[27][28] The higher dose allowed once per day dosing, which Mylan and its marketing partner, Lederle, believed would help it compete against Dyazide, which had $210M in sales in 1983.[27] However, Mylan's patents on the drug were declared invalid in court, and its marketing exclusivity expired in 1987, prompting a rush of generic competition[29]
Mylan had concerns about the practices of its competitors and the FDA in general, and also with regard to companies seeking to bring generic versions of Maxzide. Mylan hired private investigators to examine its competitors' practices, and when it found evidence of corruption, it submitted it to the House Oversight and Investigations Committee, which investigated and found fraud and corruption within the Food and Drug Administration's generic drugs division and at other generic companies.[19] Two of the companies that had gotten approval to market generic versions of Maxzide, Vitarine Pharmaceutical and Par Pharmaceutical, were targets of Mylan's initial investigation and were found to have used Mylan's Maxzide to obtain their bioequivalence data, leading both companies to withdraw its generic competitor to Mylan's product.[19][30]
The corruption in the nascent generics industry and at the office in the FDA regulating it was widely covered in the media, and led to widespread concern among doctors and the public in the late 1980s and early 1990s that generic drugs were not really the same as the branded drugs they were meant to replace.[24][31][22]
In 1987 Mylan agreed to enter into a joint venture with Bolar to buy Somerset Pharmaceuticals; Mylan wanted access to Somersets' drug discovery capabilities as well as its new drug for Parkinson's, selegiline; the deal was completed in 1988 but its consummation was dependent on FDA approval of selegiline, which came in 1989.[19][32][33]
Mylan acquired Bertek Inc. in 1993 for its transdermal patch technologies, and kept as a subsidiary; in 1999 Mylan renamed the company Mylan Technologies Inc. (MTI).[34] MTI eventually came to be the contract manufacturer for the selegiline transdermal patch and was the first company to market generic nitroglycerin, estradiol, clonidine, and fentanyl transdermal patches.[34] Mylan acquired UDL Laboratories, a supplier of unit dose generic medications to institutional and long-term care facilities in 1996.[35]
In 1998 when it was the world's second largest generics company, Mylan came under investigation from the Federal Trade Commission after it raised the prices of its products, tripling them in the case of lorazepam; Mylan had entered into an exclusive agreement with Profarmica, an Italian company that supplied drug ingredients, after which Mylan's competitors had higher prices and a diminished supply of raw ingredients for lorazepam and other drugs.[36] Before the round of price increases the price of generic drugs had been 5 - 10% of the price of branded drugs and afterwards it was around 50%.[36] The FTC filed suit at the end of 1998 and 32 states filed parallel actions; the case was settled in 2000, with Mylan paying a total of $147M -- $100M in disgorged profits into a fund to reimburse consumers and state agencies that had overpaid, $8 million in attorney's fees to the State Attorneys General, $35 million, plus $4 million in attorney's fees, to settle certain class actions with insurers and managed care organizations -- and Mylan and three ingredient suppliers (Cambrex Corporation, Profarmaco S.R.L., and Gyma Laboratories) also agreed to an injunction barring them from entering into similar anticompetitive agreements in the future.[37][38]
In 2004 Mylan and King Pharmaceuticals began discussing a deal in which Mylan would acquire King for about $4B; Mylan wanted to expand its presence in branded pharmaceuticals and to acquire King's sales force.[39] The deal became one of the business soap operas of the year, and included an SEC investigation into King's accounting and Carl Icahn obtaining a 9.8% interest in Mylan and becoming its largest stakeholder in order to kill the deal; the parties called off the deal in February 2005.[39] Icahn offered to buy Mylan for $5.4B[40] and ran a slate of board members to change the direction of Mylan; he won three seats in May 2005.[41] In June Mylan bought back 25% of its shares in order to fend off Icahn;[42] and in July Icahn gave up his bid and sold his shares.[43]
In August 2006 Mylan announced that it had reached agreement to buy a controlling interest in Matrix Laboratories, an Indian supplier of active pharmaceutical ingredients; the deal gave Mylan access to markets in India and China and was completed in January the next year.[44][45]
In May 2007 Mylan and Merck KGaA agreed that Mylan would acquire Merck's generics arm for $6.6B; the deal was completed that October and tripled the size of Mylan.[46][47] Mylan acquired the rights to market the EpiPen in the transaction; at that time annual sales were around $200 million[48] and the EpiPen had about 90% of the market.[49]
In 2009, the company filed two lawsuits against the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette after the newspaper ran an article that was critical of the quality control procedures used at the company's Morgantown plant.[50][51] The company had earlier quality control issues involving the FDA.[52] The lawsuits were dropped in 2012 without any damages paid by the Post-Gazette, which stated "The Post-Gazette did not find and did not intend to report that Mylan had manufactured or distributed any defective drugs. The Post-Gazette regrets if any reader of the article thought otherwise."[53]
Also in 2009, Mylan and its subsidiary UDL agreed to pay a $118M to settle a suit filed under the False Claims Act in which Mylan/UDL and two other companies were accused of underpaying states under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. The program requires drug companies to give rebates to states under Medicaid and the rebates are higher for new drugs than for generics; the suit said that the companies sold new drugs but paid rebates as if they were generics.[54]
In 2011, Mylan entered into an agreement with Pfizer for the exclusive worldwide rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize Pfizer's generic equivalent to GlaxoSmithKline's Advair (US)/Seretide (UK) Diskus incorporating Pfizer's proprietary dry powder inhaler delivery platform;[55] Mylan launched the product in the UK in 2015[56] and in February 2016 the FDA accepted its ANDA, putting it in line behind Hikma and Sandoz to launch a generic version in the US.[57]
In 2012, Mylan launched a program called EpiPen4Schools to sell EpiPens in bulk and with discounts to schools; to participate in the program schools had to agree not to buy epinephrine autoinjectors from any other company for a year.[58]
In December 2012, the National Association of State Boards of Education launched a policy initiative designed to "help state boards of education as they develop student health policies regarding anaphylaxis and epinephrine auto-injector access and use," and advocated for state laws protecting school from legal liability for stocking and using epinephrine autoinjectors. Gayle Manchin, the mother of Mylan's CEO, Heather Bresch, had become president of the association in 2010, and shortly after had discussed donations from her "daughter's company" to the association. Manchin had been appointed to the West Virginia state school board by her husband, then-governor of the state Joe Manchin, in 2007.[59]
In 2013 Mylan acquired an Indian generic injectable drugs company, Agila Specialties Private, for $1.6 billion in cash.[60] In 2015 three plants acquired in that deal were issued warning letters by the FDA.[61]
After successful lobbying from Mylan,[48] in 2013, the "School Access to Emergency Epinephrine Act" became law after passing Congress with broad and bipartisan support; it protected anyone from liability if they administered epinephrine to a child in a school (previously, only trained professionals or the affected person were allowed to administer the drug, and were open to liability), and it provided some financial incentives for schools that didn’t already stock epinephrine autoinjector to start stocking them.[62] Joe Manchin, the father of Mylan's CEO, was a senator at that time.[59]
In July 2014, Mylan and Abbott Laboratories announced an agreement under which Mylan would buy Abbott's generic drugs business in developed markets for stock valued at about $5.3 billion.[63] Mylan acquired Mumbai-based Famy Care and expand its presence in the market for women's contraceptives at about $750 million.[64]
Starting in 2014, according to a 2017 report in the New York Times, mid-level executives began questioning the rate at which the company had increased and was planning to continue to increase the price of the Epi-Pen, and raising concerns that the price increases were unethical; the Times reported that when these concerns were brought to Robert Coury, the chairman of the board, Coury "replied that he was untroubled. He raised both his middle fingers and explained, using colorful language, that anyone criticizing Mylan, including its employees, ought to go copulate with themselves. Critics in Congress and on Wall Street, he said, should do the same. And regulators at the Food and Drug Administration? They, too, deserved a round of anatomically challenging self-fulfillment."  The Times reported that Bresch provided similarly dismissive responses.[65]
In April 2015, Mylan tried negotiate with the management of Irish pharmaceutical firm Perrigo to acquire the company, and when those negotiations failed Mylan attempted a hostile takeover, offering to buy $26B in shares directly from shareholders; too few shareholders agreed to sell their stock by the deadline set in November 2015 and the effort failed.[66]
Two weeks after Mylan made its first offer for Perrigo, Teva Pharmaceutical offered to buy Mylan for $40B; the combined companies would have been the world's largest generic company and the 9th biggest drug company in the world.[67] In July, Teva dropped its bid for Mylan and instead acquired Allergan's generic drug business for about the same price.[68][69]
In June 2015, Mylan agreed to work with Pulmatrix, a company with a proprietary inhaled drug delivery platform, to co-develop a product to treat for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; the product was PUR0200, a generic drug in a Pulmatrix device.[70]
In February 2016, the company announced it would acquire Meda for $9.9 billion.[71] In May of the same year the company announced it would acquire Renaissance Acquisition Holdings dermatology division for up to $1 billion.[72]
In 2015 Mylan had about $1.5B in sales of EpiPens and those sales accounted for 40% of Mylan's profit.[48] Mylan had maintained about a 90% market share since it had acquired the product, and had continually raised the price of EpiPens starting in 2009: in 2009, the wholesale price of two EpiPens was about $100; by July 2013, the price was about $265; in May 2015, it was around $461; and in May 2016, the price rose again to around $609,[73] around a 500% jump from the price in 2009.[74] In the summer of 2016, as parents prepared to send their children back to school and went to pharmacies to get new EpiPens, people began to express outrage at the cost of the EpiPen and Mylan was widely and harshly criticized.[75][76] The price hikes led to investigations by Congress and states attorneys general; in October 2016 Mylan agreed to pay a $465M fine related to incorrect rebates it paid under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.[77]
In December 2016, the attorneys general of 20 states filed a civil complaint accusing Mylan of a coordinated scheme to artificially maintain high prices for a generic antibiotic and diabetes drug. The complaint alleged price collusion schemes between six pharmaceutical firms including informal gatherings, telephone calls, and text messages.[78]
According to the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Inspector General analysis, the U.S. government may have overpaid "as much as $1.27 billion between 2006 and 2016" to drugmaker Mylan N.V. for the EpiPen emergency allergy treatment. This represents three times the proposed settlement of $465 million announced by Mylan in October 2016. Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee that launched the "probe of EpiPen pricing probe in 2016, released the analysis on May 30, 2017.[79] On the same day, a group of Mylan "investment funds urged shareholders to vote against the re-election of the company's directors after it paid Chairman Robert Coury over $97 million last year."[79]

Criticism[edit]
EpiPen pricing[edit]

See also: Heather Bresch § Business executive
Mylan acquired the right to market and distribute the EpiPen line of epinephrine autoinjector devices from Merck KGaA as part of their 2007 deal;[73] that right had formerly been held by Dey LP, a wholly owned subsidiary of Merck.[80] The devices deliver about $1 worth of drug.[48] At that time annual sales were around $200M.[48] Bresch, the company's CEO, saw an opportunity to increase sales through marketing and advocacy, and the company launched a marketing campaign to increase awareness of the dangers of anaphylaxis for people with severe allergies that made the brand "EpiPen" as identified with its product as "Kleenex" is with facial tissue; the company also successfully lobbied the FDA to broaden the label to include risk of anaphylaxis and in parallel, successfully lobbied Congress to generate legislation making EpiPens available in schools and in public places like defibrillators are, and hired the same people that Medtronic had worked with on defibrillator legislation to do so.[48] Mylan's efforts to gain market dominance were aided when Sanofi's competing product was recalled in November 2015 and further when Teva's generic competitor was rejected by the FDA in March 2016.[81]
By the first half of 2015, Mylan had an 85% market share of such devices in the US[48] and in that year sales reached around $1.5B and accounted for 40% of Mylan's profit.[82] Those profits were also due in part to Mylan's continually raising the price of EpiPens starting in 2009; in 2007 the wholesale price of two EpiPens was about $100, the price was about the same in 2009, by July 2013 the price about $265, in May 2015 it was around $461, and in May 2016 the price rose again to around $609.[73] The last price increase sparked widespread outrage, including criticism from Martin Shkreli, "poster boy for grasping pharma greed," letters from two Senators and initiation of Congressional investigations,[82][83] and Mylan's pricing of the EpiPen was widely referred to as price gouging.[84][85][86] The last price increase coincided with a new line of TV commercials that were described as "shocking" and "no holds barred", depicting an anaphylactic reaction from the point of view of the young woman having it at a party, and ending with the young woman seeing her swollen and hive-covered face in the mirror before she collapses.[87] In response to criticism, Mylan increased financial assistance available for some patients to purchase EpiPens,[88] a gesture that was called a "classic public relations move" by Harvard Medical School professor Aaron Kesselheim.[89] The up to $300 saving cards can only be used by a small number of people who need the drug, and no one on Medicaid. They do nothing about the high price which is still being paid by insurers, who ultimately pass the cost onto consumers.[89]
In September 2016, the New York State Attorney General began an investigation into Mylan's EpiPen4Schools program in New York to determine if the program's contracts violated antitrust law[90] and the West Virginia State Attorney General opened an investigation into whether Mylan had given the state the correct discount under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and subpoenaed the company when it refused to provide the documentation the state requested.[91]
In October 2016 the CEO of Mylan testified to Congress that Pfizer/King charged Mylan about $34.50 for one device.[92] In September 2016, a Silicon Valley engineering consultancy performed a teardown analysis of the EpiPen and estimated the manufacturing and packaging costs at about $10 for a two-pack.[93]
In October 2016, Mylan announced a settlement with the US Department of Justice over rebates paid by Mylan to states under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.[77] Questions had been raised by Congress and others about why EpiPen had been classified as a generic rather a proprietary product in the program since 1997; generic drugs have lower rebates (13%) than proprietary drugs (23%), and price hikes for generic drugs cannot be passed onto states, and a common form of pharmaceutical fraud involves misclassifying proprietary drugs as generic under the program.[94] Under the agreement Mylan agreed to pay a $465 million payment and to a sign a corporate integrity agreement requiring it to perform better in the future;[77] the settlement also resolved cases brought by states related to the rebates.[95] Simultaneously with the settlement Mylan also announced it was being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission related to the drug rebate program.[96]
In June 2017 the New York Times published an article reporting on internal Mylan discussions about price increases on the EpiPen between 2014 and 2016, in which the company chairman expressed disdain for people and agencies who might criticize the company; the reporter wrote: "Those top leaders’ responses are a far cry from the message on Mylan’s website, which says that 'we challenge every member of every team to challenge the status quo,' and that 'we put people and patients first, trusting that profits will follow.'", and also noted that "The firm is a case study in the limits of what consumer and employee activism, as well as government oversight, can achieve."

Mylan manufactures rocuronium bromide, which is approved by the state of Alabama for use in executions by lethal injection. European manufacturers refuse to sell drugs which can be used for executions to the United States, except to distributors or users who sign legally binding agreements that the drug will not be used for executions down the delivery chain.[100]
In September 2014, the London-based human rights organization Reprieve told Mylan that they were the only FDA-approved manufacturer of rocuronium bromide without legal controls in place to prevent its use in executions, and there was "a very real risk that Mylan may soon become the go-to provider of execution drugs for states across the country". The German asset manager DJE Kapital (de) divested itself of $70 million in Mylan shares for that reason. Mylan said that their distribution was "legally compliant".[100]

Mylan N.V. is an American global generic and specialty pharmaceuticals company registered in the Netherlands, with principal executive offices in Hatfield, Hertfordshire, UK and global headquarters in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, US.[2] In 2007, Mylan acquired a controlling interest in India-based Matrix Laboratories Limited, a top producer of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) for generic drugs,[3] and the generics business of Germany-based Merck KGaA.[4] Through these acquisitions, Mylan grew from the third-largest generic and pharmaceuticals company in the United States to the second-largest generic and specialty pharmaceuticals company in the world.[5]
In 2016, Mylan's pricing of the EpiPen, an epinephrine autoinjector, became controversial and was widely referred to as "price gouging". As a result, investigations were opened into whether Mylan had misclassified the EpiPen under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, a common form of pharmaceutical fraud. In October 2016, Mylan settled these investigations with the U.S. Department of Justice, agreeing to pay $465 million and enter into a corporate integrity agreement concerning the rebate program. In a report published on June 12, 2017 the Institutional Shareholder Services criticized Mylan for the "outsized compensation" of Mylan's directors. Former CEO Robert Coury received a "$98 million" 2016 "pay package" in spite of the "harm to the company inflicted by the EpiPen controversies" and "steep shareholder losses." The report urged Mylan's shareholders to "oust all of Mylan's existing directors".[6]

Location[edit]
Founded in 1961, the company was first located in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia.[16] The company moved to Morgantown, West Virginia, in 1965, and in 1976 it relocated its corporate headquarters to the Pittsburgh suburb Canonsburg, Pennsylvania. Finally in 2004 it moved to a new office center in nearby Southpointe, a suburban business park located in Cecil Township, where it is still located.[17]
Stock[edit]
On February 23, 1973, Mylan had its initial public offering (IPO),[18] becoming a publicly traded company on the OTC market under the ticker symbol MYLN. In 1976 the stock moved to NASDAQ. Their final stock move was in 1986, when their stock became available for trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol MYL. Currently, the stock is traded on the NASDAQ.
History[edit]
Mylan Pharmaceuticals was founded as a drug distributor in 1961 by Milan Puskar and Don Panoz.[16] In 1966 Mylan began manufacturing penicillin G tablets as well as vitamins and other dietary supplements.[16][19]
Panoz left Mylan in 1969 and Puskar quit the company in 1973, as it grew and experienced financial difficulties; the board hired Roy McKnight as board chairman, who convinced Puskar to return in 1976.[19]
Mylan discontinued operating as a contract manufacturing organization in 1980 and instead chose to market their products under their own "Mylan-labeled" brand.[citation needed]
With the passage of the Hatch-Waxman Act in 1984, Mylan and other small generic companies gained value; in the eighteen months following passage of the law Mylan's earnings grew 166% to $12.5 million and its stock value rose 800%.[20]
In the 1980s one of the most prescribed drugs in the US was Dyazide, a diuretic that was a combination drug containing triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide; it had been on the market since 1965 and its patents had expired in 1980.[21] Complications arose with the introductions of generics versions, because the formulation of Dyazide resulted in variable batches that made it impossible for generic manufacturers to show that their versions were bioequivalent.[22][23]
Some generic companies committed fraud trying to bring a generic version of Dyazide. Bolar Pharmaceutical had the first generic version approved in 1987,[21] but it turned out that Bolar had fraudulently substituted Dyazide for its own version to conduct studies that were submitted to the FDA by 1989 the FDA rescinded its approval based on its suspicions and filed criminal charges against Bolar, to which Bolar eventually pled guilty in 1991.[24][25][26]
Mylan chose to develop a new version of a triamterene/hydrochlorothiazide combination drug instead of going the generic route; it developed a different, more stable formulation[23] and used different dosages of each active ingredient (50 mg hydrochlorothiazide and 75 mg triamterene, compared with Dyazide's 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide and 50 mg triamterene).[27] This drug had to get approval as a new drug, as opposed to a generic; their product was called Maxzide and was approved in 1984.[27][28] The higher dose allowed once per day dosing, which Mylan and its marketing partner, Lederle, believed would help it compete against Dyazide, which had $210M in sales in 1983.[27] However, Mylan's patents on the drug were declared invalid in court, and its marketing exclusivity expired in 1987, prompting a rush of generic competition[29]
Mylan had concerns about the practices of its competitors and the FDA in general, and also with regard to companies seeking to bring generic versions of Maxzide. Mylan hired private investigators to examine its competitors' practices, and when it found evidence of corruption, it submitted it to the House Oversight and Investigations Committee, which investigated and found fraud and corruption within the Food and Drug Administration's generic drugs division and at other generic companies.[19] Two of the companies that had gotten approval to market generic versions of Maxzide, Vitarine Pharmaceutical and Par Pharmaceutical, were targets of Mylan's initial investigation and were found to have used Mylan's Maxzide to obtain their bioequivalence data, leading both companies to withdraw its generic competitor to Mylan's product.[19][30]
The corruption in the nascent generics industry and at the office in the FDA regulating it was widely covered in the media, and led to widespread concern among doctors and the public in the late 1980s and early 1990s that generic drugs were not really the same as the branded drugs they were meant to replace.[24][31][22]
In 1987 Mylan agreed to enter into a joint venture with Bolar to buy Somerset Pharmaceuticals; Mylan wanted access to Somersets' drug discovery capabilities as well as its new drug for Parkinson's, selegiline; the deal was completed in 1988 but its consummation was dependent on FDA approval of selegiline, which came in 1989.[19][32][33]
Mylan acquired Bertek Inc. in 1993 for its transdermal patch technologies, and kept as a subsidiary; in 1999 Mylan renamed the company Mylan Technologies Inc. (MTI).[34] MTI eventually came to be the contract manufacturer for the selegiline transdermal patch and was the first company to market generic nitroglycerin, estradiol, clonidine, and fentanyl transdermal patches.[34] Mylan acquired UDL Laboratories, a supplier of unit dose generic medications to institutional and long-term care facilities in 1996.[35]
In 1998 when it was the world's second largest generics company, Mylan came under investigation from the Federal Trade Commission after it raised the prices of its products, tripling them in the case of lorazepam; Mylan had entered into an exclusive agreement with Profarmica, an Italian company that supplied drug ingredients, after which Mylan's competitors had higher prices and a diminished supply of raw ingredients for lorazepam and other drugs.[36] Before the round of price increases the price of generic drugs had been 5 - 10% of the price of branded drugs and afterwards it was around 50%.[36] The FTC filed suit at the end of 1998 and 32 states filed parallel actions; the case was settled in 2000, with Mylan paying a total of $147M -- $100M in disgorged profits into a fund to reimburse consumers and state agencies that had overpaid, $8 million in attorney's fees to the State Attorneys General, $35 million, plus $4 million in attorney's fees, to settle certain class actions with insurers and managed care organizations -- and Mylan and three ingredient suppliers (Cambrex Corporation, Profarmaco S.R.L., and Gyma Laboratories) also agreed to an injunction barring them from entering into similar anticompetitive agreements in the future.[37][38]
In 2004 Mylan and King Pharmaceuticals began discussing a deal in which Mylan would acquire King for about $4B; Mylan wanted to expand its presence in branded pharmaceuticals and to acquire King's sales force.[39] The deal became one of the business soap operas of the year, and included an SEC investigation into King's accounting and Carl Icahn obtaining a 9.8% interest in Mylan and becoming its largest stakeholder in order to kill the deal; the parties called off the deal in February 2005.[39] Icahn offered to buy Mylan for $5.4B[40] and ran a slate of board members to change the direction of Mylan; he won three seats in May 2005.[41] In June Mylan bought back 25% of its shares in order to fend off Icahn;[42] and in July Icahn gave up his bid and sold his shares.[43]
In August 2006 Mylan announced that it had reached agreement to buy a controlling interest in Matrix Laboratories, an Indian supplier of active pharmaceutical ingredients; the deal gave Mylan access to markets in India and China and was completed in January the next year.[44][45]
In May 2007 Mylan and Merck KGaA agreed that Mylan would acquire Merck's generics arm for $6.6B; the deal was completed that October and tripled the size of Mylan.[46][47] Mylan acquired the rights to market the EpiPen in the transaction; at that time annual sales were around $200 million[48] and the EpiPen had about 90% of the market.[49]
In 2009, the company filed two lawsuits against the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette after the newspaper ran an article that was critical of the quality control procedures used at the company's Morgantown plant.[50][51] The company had earlier quality control issues involving the FDA.[52] The lawsuits were dropped in 2012 without any damages paid by the Post-Gazette, which stated "The Post-Gazette did not find and did not intend to report that Mylan had manufactured or distributed any defective drugs. The Post-Gazette regrets if any reader of the article thought otherwise."[53]
Also in 2009, Mylan and its subsidiary UDL agreed to pay a $118M to settle a suit filed under the False Claims Act in which Mylan/UDL and two other companies were accused of underpaying states under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. The program requires drug companies to give rebates to states under Medicaid and the rebates are higher for new drugs than for generics; the suit said that the companies sold new drugs but paid rebates as if they were generics.[54]
In 2011, Mylan entered into an agreement with Pfizer for the exclusive worldwide rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize Pfizer's generic equivalent to GlaxoSmithKline's Advair (US)/Seretide (UK) Diskus incorporating Pfizer's proprietary dry powder inhaler delivery platform;[55] Mylan launched the product in the UK in 2015[56] and in February 2016 the FDA accepted its ANDA, putting it in line behind Hikma and Sandoz to launch a generic version in the US.[57]
In 2012, Mylan launched a program called EpiPen4Schools to sell EpiPens in bulk and with discounts to schools; to participate in the program schools had to agree not to buy epinephrine autoinjectors from any other company for a year.[58]
In December 2012, the National Association of State Boards of Education launched a policy initiative designed to "help state boards of education as they develop student health policies regarding anaphylaxis and epinephrine auto-injector access and use," and advocated for state laws protecting school from legal liability for stocking and using epinephrine autoinjectors. Gayle Manchin, the mother of Mylan's CEO, Heather Bresch, had become president of the association in 2010, and shortly after had discussed donations from her "daughter's company" to the association. Manchin had been appointed to the West Virginia state school board by her husband, then-governor of the state Joe Manchin, in 2007.[59]
In 2013 Mylan acquired an Indian generic injectable drugs company, Agila Specialties Private, for $1.6 billion in cash.[60] In 2015 three plants acquired in that deal were issued warning letters by the FDA.[61]
After successful lobbying from Mylan,[48] in 2013, the "School Access to Emergency Epinephrine Act" became law after passing Congress with broad and bipartisan support; it protected anyone from liability if they administered epinephrine to a child in a school (previously, only trained professionals or the affected person were allowed to administer the drug, and were open to liability), and it provided some financial incentives for schools that didn’t already stock epinephrine autoinjector to start stocking them.[62] Joe Manchin, the father of Mylan's CEO, was a senator at that time.[59]
In July 2014, Mylan and Abbott Laboratories announced an agreement under which Mylan would buy Abbott's generic drugs business in developed markets for stock valued at about $5.3 billion.[63] Mylan acquired Mumbai-based Famy Care and expand its presence in the market for women's contraceptives at about $750 million.[64]
Starting in 2014, according to a 2017 report in the New York Times, mid-level executives began questioning the rate at which the company had increased and was planning to continue to increase the price of the Epi-Pen, and raising concerns that the price increases were unethical; the Times reported that when these concerns were brought to Robert Coury, the chairman of the board, Coury "replied that he was untroubled. He raised both his middle fingers and explained, using colorful language, that anyone criticizing Mylan, including its employees, ought to go copulate with themselves. Critics in Congress and on Wall Street, he said, should do the same. And regulators at the Food and Drug Administration? They, too, deserved a round of anatomically challenging self-fulfillment."  The Times reported that Bresch provided similarly dismissive responses.[65]
In April 2015, Mylan tried negotiate with the management of Irish pharmaceutical firm Perrigo to acquire the company, and when those negotiations failed Mylan attempted a hostile takeover, offering to buy $26B in shares directly from shareholders; too few shareholders agreed to sell their stock by the deadline set in November 2015 and the effort failed.[66]
Two weeks after Mylan made its first offer for Perrigo, Teva Pharmaceutical offered to buy Mylan for $40B; the combined companies would have been the world's largest generic company and the 9th biggest drug company in the world.[67] In July, Teva dropped its bid for Mylan and instead acquired Allergan's generic drug business for about the same price.[68][69]
In June 2015, Mylan agreed to work with Pulmatrix, a company with a proprietary inhaled drug delivery platform, to co-develop a product to treat for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; the product was PUR0200, a generic drug in a Pulmatrix device.[70]
In February 2016, the company announced it would acquire Meda for $9.9 billion.[71] In May of the same year the company announced it would acquire Renaissance Acquisition Holdings dermatology division for up to $1 billion.[72]
In 2015 Mylan had about $1.5B in sales of EpiPens and those sales accounted for 40% of Mylan's profit.[48] Mylan had maintained about a 90% market share since it had acquired the product, and had continually raised the price of EpiPens starting in 2009: in 2009, the wholesale price of two EpiPens was about $100; by July 2013, the price was about $265; in May 2015, it was around $461; and in May 2016, the price rose again to around $609,[73] around a 500% jump from the price in 2009.[74] In the summer of 2016, as parents prepared to send their children back to school and went to pharmacies to get new EpiPens, people began to express outrage at the cost of the EpiPen and Mylan was widely and harshly criticized.[75][76] The price hikes led to investigations by Congress and states attorneys general; in October 2016 Mylan agreed to pay a $465M fine related to incorrect rebates it paid under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.[77]
In December 2016, the attorneys general of 20 states filed a civil complaint accusing Mylan of a coordinated scheme to artificially maintain high prices for a generic antibiotic and diabetes drug. The complaint alleged price collusion schemes between six pharmaceutical firms including informal gatherings, telephone calls, and text messages.[78]
According to the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Inspector General analysis, the U.S. government may have overpaid "as much as $1.27 billion between 2006 and 2016" to drugmaker Mylan N.V. for the EpiPen emergency allergy treatment. This represents three times the proposed settlement of $465 million announced by Mylan in October 2016. Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee that launched the "probe of EpiPen pricing probe in 2016, released the analysis on May 30, 2017.[79] On the same day, a group of Mylan "investment funds urged shareholders to vote against the re-election of the company's directors after it paid Chairman Robert Coury over $97 million last year."[79]

EpiPen pricing[edit]

See also: Heather Bresch § Business executive
Mylan acquired the right to market and distribute the EpiPen line of epinephrine autoinjector devices from Merck KGaA as part of their 2007 deal;[73] that right had formerly been held by Dey LP, a wholly owned subsidiary of Merck.[80] The devices deliver about $1 worth of drug.[48] At that time annual sales were around $200M.[48] Bresch, the company's CEO, saw an opportunity to increase sales through marketing and advocacy, and the company launched a marketing campaign to increase awareness of the dangers of anaphylaxis for people with severe allergies that made the brand "EpiPen" as identified with its product as "Kleenex" is with facial tissue; the company also successfully lobbied the FDA to broaden the label to include risk of anaphylaxis and in parallel, successfully lobbied Congress to generate legislation making EpiPens available in schools and in public places like defibrillators are, and hired the same people that Medtronic had worked with on defibrillator legislation to do so.[48] Mylan's efforts to gain market dominance were aided when Sanofi's competing product was recalled in November 2015 and further when Teva's generic competitor was rejected by the FDA in March 2016.[81]
By the first half of 2015, Mylan had an 85% market share of such devices in the US[48] and in that year sales reached around $1.5B and accounted for 40% of Mylan's profit.[82] Those profits were also due in part to Mylan's continually raising the price of EpiPens starting in 2009; in 2007 the wholesale price of two EpiPens was about $100, the price was about the same in 2009, by July 2013 the price about $265, in May 2015 it was around $461, and in May 2016 the price rose again to around $609.[73] The last price increase sparked widespread outrage, including criticism from Martin Shkreli, "poster boy for grasping pharma greed," letters from two Senators and initiation of Congressional investigations,[82][83] and Mylan's pricing of the EpiPen was widely referred to as price gouging.[84][85][86] The last price increase coincided with a new line of TV commercials that were described as "shocking" and "no holds barred", depicting an anaphylactic reaction from the point of view of the young woman having it at a party, and ending with the young woman seeing her swollen and hive-covered face in the mirror before she collapses.[87] In response to criticism, Mylan increased financial assistance available for some patients to purchase EpiPens,[88] a gesture that was called a "classic public relations move" by Harvard Medical School professor Aaron Kesselheim.[89] The up to $300 saving cards can only be used by a small number of people who need the drug, and no one on Medicaid. They do nothing about the high price which is still being paid by insurers, who ultimately pass the cost onto consumers.[89]
In September 2016, the New York State Attorney General began an investigation into Mylan's EpiPen4Schools program in New York to determine if the program's contracts violated antitrust law[90] and the West Virginia State Attorney General opened an investigation into whether Mylan had given the state the correct discount under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and subpoenaed the company when it refused to provide the documentation the state requested.[91]
In October 2016 the CEO of Mylan testified to Congress that Pfizer/King charged Mylan about $34.50 for one device.[92] In September 2016, a Silicon Valley engineering consultancy performed a teardown analysis of the EpiPen and estimated the manufacturing and packaging costs at about $10 for a two-pack.[93]
In October 2016, Mylan announced a settlement with the US Department of Justice over rebates paid by Mylan to states under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.[77] Questions had been raised by Congress and others about why EpiPen had been classified as a generic rather a proprietary product in the program since 1997; generic drugs have lower rebates (13%) than proprietary drugs (23%), and price hikes for generic drugs cannot be passed onto states, and a common form of pharmaceutical fraud involves misclassifying proprietary drugs as generic under the program.[94] Under the agreement Mylan agreed to pay a $465 million payment and to a sign a corporate integrity agreement requiring it to perform better in the future;[77] the settlement also resolved cases brought by states related to the rebates.[95] Simultaneously with the settlement Mylan also announced it was being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission related to the drug rebate program.[96]
In June 2017 the New York Times published an article reporting on internal Mylan discussions about price increases on the EpiPen between 2014 and 2016, in which the company chairman expressed disdain for people and agencies who might criticize the company; the reporter wrote: "Those top leaders’ responses are a far cry from the message on Mylan’s website, which says that 'we challenge every member of every team to challenge the status quo,' and that 'we put people and patients first, trusting that profits will follow.'", and also noted that "The firm is a case study in the limits of what consumer and employee activism, as well as government oversight, can achieve." [65][97][98][99]
Execution drugs[edit]
Mylan manufactures rocuronium bromide, which is approved by the state of Alabama for use in executions by lethal injection. European manufacturers refuse to sell drugs which can be used for executions to the United States, except to distributors or users who sign legally binding agreements that the drug will not be used for executions down the delivery chain.[100]
In September 2014, the London-based human rights organization Reprieve told Mylan that they were the only FDA-approved manufacturer of rocuronium bromide without legal controls in place to prevent its use in executions, and there was "a very real risk that Mylan may soon become the go-to provider of execution drugs for states across the country". The German asset manager DJE Kapital (de) divested itself of $70 million in Mylan shares for that reason. Mylan said that their distribution was "legally compliant".[100]

Mylan N.V. is an American global generic and specialty pharmaceuticals company registered in the Netherlands, with principal executive offices in Hatfield, Hertfordshire, UK and global headquarters in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, US.[2] In 2007, Mylan acquired a controlling interest in India-based Matrix Laboratories Limited, a top producer of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) for generic drugs,[3] and the generics business of Germany-based Merck KGaA.[4] Through these acquisitions, Mylan grew from the third-largest generic and pharmaceuticals company in the United States to the second-largest generic and specialty pharmaceuticals company in the world.[5]
In 2016, Mylan's pricing of the EpiPen, an epinephrine autoinjector, became controversial and was widely referred to as "price gouging". As a result, investigations were opened into whether Mylan had misclassified the EpiPen under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, a common form of pharmaceutical fraud. In October 2016, Mylan settled these investigations with the U.S. Department of Justice, agreeing to pay $465 million and enter into a corporate integrity agreement concerning the rebate program. In a report published on June 12, 2017 the Institutional Shareholder Services criticized Mylan for the "outsized compensation" of Mylan's directors. Former CEO Robert Coury received a "$98 million" 2016 "pay package" in spite of the "harm to the company inflicted by the EpiPen controversies" and "steep shareholder losses." The report urged Mylan's shareholders to "oust all of Mylan's existing directors".[6]

Location[edit]
Founded in 1961, the company was first located in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia.[16] The company moved to Morgantown, West Virginia, in 1965, and in 1976 it relocated its corporate headquarters to the Pittsburgh suburb Canonsburg, Pennsylvania. Finally in 2004 it moved to a new office center in nearby Southpointe, a suburban business park located in Cecil Township, where it is still located.[17]
Stock[edit]
On February 23, 1973, Mylan had its initial public offering (IPO),[18] becoming a publicly traded company on the OTC market under the ticker symbol MYLN. In 1976 the stock moved to NASDAQ. Their final stock move was in 1986, when their stock became available for trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol MYL. Currently, the stock is traded on the NASDAQ.
History[edit]
Mylan Pharmaceuticals was founded as a drug distributor in 1961 by Milan Puskar and Don Panoz.[16] In 1966 Mylan began manufacturing penicillin G tablets as well as vitamins and other dietary supplements.[16][19]
Panoz left Mylan in 1969 and Puskar quit the company in 1973, as it grew and experienced financial difficulties; the board hired Roy McKnight as board chairman, who convinced Puskar to return in 1976.[19]
Mylan discontinued operating as a contract manufacturing organization in 1980 and instead chose to market their products under their own "Mylan-labeled" brand.[citation needed]
With the passage of the Hatch-Waxman Act in 1984, Mylan and other small generic companies gained value; in the eighteen months following passage of the law Mylan's earnings grew 166% to $12.5 million and its stock value rose 800%.[20]
In the 1980s one of the most prescribed drugs in the US was Dyazide, a diuretic that was a combination drug containing triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide; it had been on the market since 1965 and its patents had expired in 1980.[21] Complications arose with the introductions of generics versions, because the formulation of Dyazide resulted in variable batches that made it impossible for generic manufacturers to show that their versions were bioequivalent.[22][23]
Some generic companies committed fraud trying to bring a generic version of Dyazide. Bolar Pharmaceutical had the first generic version approved in 1987,[21] but it turned out that Bolar had fraudulently substituted Dyazide for its own version to conduct studies that were submitted to the FDA by 1989 the FDA rescinded its approval based on its suspicions and filed criminal charges against Bolar, to which Bolar eventually pled guilty in 1991.[24][25][26]
Mylan chose to develop a new version of a triamterene/hydrochlorothiazide combination drug instead of going the generic route; it developed a different, more stable formulation[23] and used different dosages of each active ingredient (50 mg hydrochlorothiazide and 75 mg triamterene, compared with Dyazide's 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide and 50 mg triamterene).[27] This drug had to get approval as a new drug, as opposed to a generic; their product was called Maxzide and was approved in 1984.[27][28] The higher dose allowed once per day dosing, which Mylan and its marketing partner, Lederle, believed would help it compete against Dyazide, which had $210M in sales in 1983.[27] However, Mylan's patents on the drug were declared invalid in court, and its marketing exclusivity expired in 1987, prompting a rush of generic competition[29]
Mylan had concerns about the practices of its competitors and the FDA in general, and also with regard to companies seeking to bring generic versions of Maxzide. Mylan hired private investigators to examine its competitors' practices, and when it found evidence of corruption, it submitted it to the House Oversight and Investigations Committee, which investigated and found fraud and corruption within the Food and Drug Administration's generic drugs division and at other generic companies.[19] Two of the companies that had gotten approval to market generic versions of Maxzide, Vitarine Pharmaceutical and Par Pharmaceutical, were targets of Mylan's initial investigation and were found to have used Mylan's Maxzide to obtain their bioequivalence data, leading both companies to withdraw its generic competitor to Mylan's product.[19][30]
The corruption in the nascent generics industry and at the office in the FDA regulating it was widely covered in the media, and led to widespread concern among doctors and the public in the late 1980s and early 1990s that generic drugs were not really the same as the branded drugs they were meant to replace.[24][31][22]
In 1987 Mylan agreed to enter into a joint venture with Bolar to buy Somerset Pharmaceuticals; Mylan wanted access to Somersets' drug discovery capabilities as well as its new drug for Parkinson's, selegiline; the deal was completed in 1988 but its consummation was dependent on FDA approval of selegiline, which came in 1989.[19][32][33]
Mylan acquired Bertek Inc. in 1993 for its transdermal patch technologies, and kept as a subsidiary; in 1999 Mylan renamed the company Mylan Technologies Inc. (MTI).[34] MTI eventually came to be the contract manufacturer for the selegiline transdermal patch and was the first company to market generic nitroglycerin, estradiol, clonidine, and fentanyl transdermal patches.[34] Mylan acquired UDL Laboratories, a supplier of unit dose generic medications to institutional and long-term care facilities in 1996.[35]
In 1998 when it was the world's second largest generics company, Mylan came under investigation from the Federal Trade Commission after it raised the prices of its products, tripling them in the case of lorazepam; Mylan had entered into an exclusive agreement with Profarmica, an Italian company that supplied drug ingredients, after which Mylan's competitors had higher prices and a diminished supply of raw ingredients for lorazepam and other drugs.[36] Before the round of price increases the price of generic drugs had been 5 - 10% of the price of branded drugs and afterwards it was around 50%.[36] The FTC filed suit at the end of 1998 and 32 states filed parallel actions; the case was settled in 2000, with Mylan paying a total of $147M -- $100M in disgorged profits into a fund to reimburse consumers and state agencies that had overpaid, $8 million in attorney's fees to the State Attorneys General, $35 million, plus $4 million in attorney's fees, to settle certain class actions with insurers and managed care organizations -- and Mylan and three ingredient suppliers (Cambrex Corporation, Profarmaco S.R.L., and Gyma Laboratories) also agreed to an injunction barring them from entering into similar anticompetitive agreements in the future.[37][38]
In 2004 Mylan and King Pharmaceuticals began discussing a deal in which Mylan would acquire King for about $4B; Mylan wanted to expand its presence in branded pharmaceuticals and to acquire King's sales force.[39] The deal became one of the business soap operas of the year, and included an SEC investigation into King's accounting and Carl Icahn obtaining a 9.8% interest in Mylan and becoming its largest stakeholder in order to kill the deal; the parties called off the deal in February 2005.[39] Icahn offered to buy Mylan for $5.4B[40] and ran a slate of board members to change the direction of Mylan; he won three seats in May 2005.[41] In June Mylan bought back 25% of its shares in order to fend off Icahn;[42] and in July Icahn gave up his bid and sold his shares.[43]
In August 2006 Mylan announced that it had reached agreement to buy a controlling interest in Matrix Laboratories, an Indian supplier of active pharmaceutical ingredients; the deal gave Mylan access to markets in India and China and was completed in January the next year.[44][45]
In May 2007 Mylan and Merck KGaA agreed that Mylan would acquire Merck's generics arm for $6.6B; the deal was completed that October and tripled the size of Mylan.[46][47] Mylan acquired the rights to market the EpiPen in the transaction; at that time annual sales were around $200 million[48] and the EpiPen had about 90% of the market.[49]
In 2009, the company filed two lawsuits against the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette after the newspaper ran an article that was critical of the quality control procedures used at the company's Morgantown plant.[50][51] The company had earlier quality control issues involving the FDA.[52] The lawsuits were dropped in 2012 without any damages paid by the Post-Gazette, which stated "The Post-Gazette did not find and did not intend to report that Mylan had manufactured or distributed any defective drugs. The Post-Gazette regrets if any reader of the article thought otherwise."[53]
Also in 2009, Mylan and its subsidiary UDL agreed to pay a $118M to settle a suit filed under the False Claims Act in which Mylan/UDL and two other companies were accused of underpaying states under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. The program requires drug companies to give rebates to states under Medicaid and the rebates are higher for new drugs than for generics; the suit said that the companies sold new drugs but paid rebates as if they were generics.[54]
In 2011, Mylan entered into an agreement with Pfizer for the exclusive worldwide rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize Pfizer's generic equivalent to GlaxoSmithKline's Advair (US)/Seretide (UK) Diskus incorporating Pfizer's proprietary dry powder inhaler delivery platform;[55] Mylan launched the product in the UK in 2015[56] and in February 2016 the FDA accepted its ANDA, putting it in line behind Hikma and Sandoz to launch a generic version in the US.[57]
In 2012, Mylan launched a program called EpiPen4Schools to sell EpiPens in bulk and with discounts to schools; to participate in the program schools had to agree not to buy epinephrine autoinjectors from any other company for a year.[58]
In December 2012, the National Association of State Boards of Education launched a policy initiative designed to "help state boards of education as they develop student health policies regarding anaphylaxis and epinephrine auto-injector access and use," and advocated for state laws protecting school from legal liability for stocking and using epinephrine autoinjectors. Gayle Manchin, the mother of Mylan's CEO, Heather Bresch, had become president of the association in 2010, and shortly after had discussed donations from her "daughter's company" to the association. Manchin had been appointed to the West Virginia state school board by her husband, then-governor of the state Joe Manchin, in 2007.[59]
In 2013 Mylan acquired an Indian generic injectable drugs company, Agila Specialties Private, for $1.6 billion in cash.[60] In 2015 three plants acquired in that deal were issued warning letters by the FDA.[61]
After successful lobbying from Mylan,[48] in 2013, the "School Access to Emergency Epinephrine Act" became law after passing Congress with broad and bipartisan support; it protected anyone from liability if they administered epinephrine to a child in a school (previously, only trained professionals or the affected person were allowed to administer the drug, and were open to liability), and it provided some financial incentives for schools that didn’t already stock epinephrine autoinjector to start stocking them.[62] Joe Manchin, the father of Mylan's CEO, was a senator at that time.[59]
In July 2014, Mylan and Abbott Laboratories announced an agreement under which Mylan would buy Abbott's generic drugs business in developed markets for stock valued at about $5.3 billion.[63] Mylan acquired Mumbai-based Famy Care and expand its presence in the market for women's contraceptives at about $750 million.[64]
Starting in 2014, according to a 2017 report in the New York Times, mid-level executives began questioning the rate at which the company had increased and was planning to continue to increase the price of the Epi-Pen, and raising concerns that the price increases were unethical; the Times reported that when these concerns were brought to Robert Coury, the chairman of the board, Coury "replied that he was untroubled. He raised both his middle fingers and explained, using colorful language, that anyone criticizing Mylan, including its employees, ought to go copulate with themselves. Critics in Congress and on Wall Street, he said, should do the same. And regulators at the Food and Drug Administration? They, too, deserved a round of anatomically challenging self-fulfillment."  The Times reported that Bresch provided similarly dismissive responses.[65]
In April 2015, Mylan tried negotiate with the management of Irish pharmaceutical firm Perrigo to acquire the company, and when those negotiations failed Mylan attempted a hostile takeover, offering to buy $26B in shares directly from shareholders; too few shareholders agreed to sell their stock by the deadline set in November 2015 and the effort failed.[66]
Two weeks after Mylan made its first offer for Perrigo, Teva Pharmaceutical offered to buy Mylan for $40B; the combined companies would have been the world's largest generic company and the 9th biggest drug company in the world.[67] In July, Teva dropped its bid for Mylan and instead acquired Allergan's generic drug business for about the same price.[68][69]
In June 2015, Mylan agreed to work with Pulmatrix, a company with a proprietary inhaled drug delivery platform, to co-develop a product to treat for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; the product was PUR0200, a generic drug in a Pulmatrix device.[70]
In February 2016, the company announced it would acquire Meda for $9.9 billion.[71] In May of the same year the company announced it would acquire Renaissance Acquisition Holdings dermatology division for up to $1 billion.[72]
In 2015 Mylan had about $1.5B in sales of EpiPens and those sales accounted for 40% of Mylan's profit.[48] Mylan had maintained about a 90% market share since it had acquired the product, and had continually raised the price of EpiPens starting in 2009: in 2009, the wholesale price of two EpiPens was about $100; by July 2013, the price was about $265; in May 2015, it was around $461; and in May 2016, the price rose again to around $609,[73] around a 500% jump from the price in 2009.[74] In the summer of 2016, as parents prepared to send their children back to school and went to pharmacies to get new EpiPens, people began to express outrage at the cost of the EpiPen and Mylan was widely and harshly criticized.[75][76] The price hikes led to investigations by Congress and states attorneys general; in October 2016 Mylan agreed to pay a $465M fine related to incorrect rebates it paid under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.[77]
In December 2016, the attorneys general of 20 states filed a civil complaint accusing Mylan of a coordinated scheme to artificially maintain high prices for a generic antibiotic and diabetes drug. The complaint alleged price collusion schemes between six pharmaceutical firms including informal gatherings, telephone calls, and text messages.[78]
According to the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Inspector General analysis, the U.S. government may have overpaid "as much as $1.27 billion between 2006 and 2016" to drugmaker Mylan N.V. for the EpiPen emergency allergy treatment. This represents three times the proposed settlement of $465 million announced by Mylan in October 2016. Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee that launched the "probe of EpiPen pricing probe in 2016, released the analysis on May 30, 2017.[79] On the same day, a group of Mylan "investment funds urged shareholders to vote against the re-election of the company's directors after it paid Chairman Robert Coury over $97 million last year."[79]

EpiPen pricing[edit]

Mylan acquired the right to market and distribute the EpiPen line of epinephrine autoinjector devices from Merck KGaA as part of their 2007 deal;[73] that right had formerly been held by Dey LP, a wholly owned subsidiary of Merck.[80] The devices deliver about $1 worth of drug.[48] At that time annual sales were around $200M.[48] Bresch, the company's CEO, saw an opportunity to increase sales through marketing and advocacy, and the company launched a marketing campaign to increase awareness of the dangers of anaphylaxis for people with severe allergies that made the brand "EpiPen" as identified with its product as "Kleenex" is with facial tissue; the company also successfully lobbied the FDA to broaden the label to include risk of anaphylaxis and in parallel, successfully lobbied Congress to generate legislation making EpiPens available in schools and in public places like defibrillators are, and hired the same people that Medtronic had worked with on defibrillator legislation to do so.[48] Mylan's efforts to gain market dominance were aided when Sanofi's competing product was recalled in November 2015 and further when Teva's generic competitor was rejected by the FDA in March 2016.[81]
By the first half of 2015, Mylan had an 85% market share of such devices in the US[48] and in that year sales reached around $1.5B and accounted for 40% of Mylan's profit.[82] Those profits were also due in part to Mylan's continually raising the price of EpiPens starting in 2009; in 2007 the wholesale price of two EpiPens was about $100, the price was about the same in 2009, by July 2013 the price about $265, in May 2015 it was around $461, and in May 2016 the price rose again to around $609.[73] The last price increase sparked widespread outrage, including criticism from Martin Shkreli, "poster boy for grasping pharma greed," letters from two Senators and initiation of Congressional investigations,[82][83] and Mylan's pricing of the EpiPen was widely referred to as price gouging.[84][85][86] The last price increase coincided with a new line of TV commercials that were described as "shocking" and "no holds barred", depicting an anaphylactic reaction from the point of view of the young woman having it at a party, and ending with the young woman seeing her swollen and hive-covered face in the mirror before she collapses.[87] In response to criticism, Mylan increased financial assistance available for some patients to purchase EpiPens,[88] a gesture that was called a "classic public relations move" by Harvard Medical School professor Aaron Kesselheim.[89] The up to $300 saving cards can only be used by a small number of people who need the drug, and no one on Medicaid. They do nothing about the high price which is still being paid by insurers, who ultimately pass the cost onto consumers.[89]
In September 2016, the New York State Attorney General began an investigation into Mylan's EpiPen4Schools program in New York to determine if the program's contracts violated antitrust law[90] and the West Virginia State Attorney General opened an investigation into whether Mylan had given the state the correct discount under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and subpoenaed the company when it refused to provide the documentation the state requested.[91]
In October 2016 the CEO of Mylan testified to Congress that Pfizer/King charged Mylan about $34.50 for one device.[92] In September 2016, a Silicon Valley engineering consultancy performed a teardown analysis of the EpiPen and estimated the manufacturing and packaging costs at about $10 for a two-pack.[93]
In October 2016, Mylan announced a settlement with the US Department of Justice over rebates paid by Mylan to states under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.[77] Questions had been raised by Congress and others about why EpiPen had been classified as a generic rather a proprietary product in the program since 1997; generic drugs have lower rebates (13%) than proprietary drugs (23%), and price hikes for generic drugs cannot be passed onto states, and a common form of pharmaceutical fraud involves misclassifying proprietary drugs as generic under the program.[94] Under the agreement Mylan agreed to pay a $465 million payment and to a sign a corporate integrity agreement requiring it to perform better in the future;[77] the settlement also resolved cases brought by states related to the rebates.[95] Simultaneously with the settlement Mylan also announced it was being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission related to the drug rebate program.[96]
In June 2017 the New York Times published an article reporting on internal Mylan discussions about price increases on the EpiPen between 2014 and 2016, in which the company chairman expressed disdain for people and agencies who might criticize the company; the reporter wrote: "Those top leaders’ responses are a far cry from the message on Mylan’s website, which says that 'we challenge every member of every team to challenge the status quo,' and that 'we put people and patients first, trusting that profits will follow.'", and also noted that "The firm is a case study in the limits of what consumer and employee activism, as well as government oversight, can achieve." [65][97][98][99]
Execution drugs[edit]
Mylan manufactures rocuronium bromide, which is approved by the state of Alabama for use in executions by lethal injection. European manufacturers refuse to sell drugs which can be used for executions to the United States, except to distributors or users who sign legally binding agreements that the drug will not be used for executions down the delivery chain.[100]
In September 2014, the London-based human rights organization Reprieve told Mylan that they were the only FDA-approved manufacturer of rocuronium bromide without legal controls in place to prevent its use in executions, and there was "a very real risk that Mylan may soon become the go-to provider of execution drugs for states across the country". The German asset manager DJE Kapital (de) divested itself of $70 million in Mylan shares for that reason. Mylan said that their distribution was "legally compliant".[100]

Mylan N.V. is an American global generic and specialty pharmaceuticals company registered in the Netherlands, with principal executive offices in Hatfield, Hertfordshire, UK and global headquarters in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, US.[2] In 2007, Mylan acquired a controlling interest in India-based Matrix Laboratories Limited, a top producer of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) for generic drugs,[3] and the generics business of Germany-based Merck KGaA.[4] Through these acquisitions, Mylan grew from the third-largest generic and pharmaceuticals company in the United States to the second-largest generic and specialty pharmaceuticals company in the world.[5]
In 2016, Mylan's pricing of the EpiPen, an epinephrine autoinjector, became controversial and was widely referred to as "price gouging". As a result, investigations were opened into whether Mylan had misclassified the EpiPen under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, a common form of pharmaceutical fraud. In October 2016, Mylan settled these investigations with the U.S. Department of Justice, agreeing to pay $465 million and enter into a corporate integrity agreement concerning the rebate program. In a report published on June 12, 2017 the Institutional Shareholder Services criticized Mylan for the "outsized compensation" of Mylan's directors. Former CEO Robert Coury received a "$98 million" 2016 "pay package" in spite of the "harm to the company inflicted by the EpiPen controversies" and "steep shareholder losses." The report urged Mylan's shareholders to "oust all of Mylan's existing directors".[6]

Location[edit]
Founded in 1961, the company was first located in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia.[16] The company moved to Morgantown, West Virginia, in 1965, and in 1976 it relocated its corporate headquarters to the Pittsburgh suburb Canonsburg, Pennsylvania. Finally in 2004 it moved to a new office center in nearby Southpointe, a suburban business park located in Cecil Township, where it is still located.[17]
Stock[edit]
On February 23, 1973, Mylan had its initial public offering (IPO),[18] becoming a publicly traded company on the OTC market under the ticker symbol MYLN. In 1976 the stock moved to NASDAQ. Their final stock move was in 1986, when their stock became available for trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol MYL. Currently, the stock is traded on the NASDAQ.
History[edit]
Mylan Pharmaceuticals was founded as a drug distributor in 1961 by Milan Puskar and Don Panoz.[16] In 1966 Mylan began manufacturing penicillin G tablets as well as vitamins and other dietary supplements.[16][19]
Panoz left Mylan in 1969 and Puskar quit the company in 1973, as it grew and experienced financial difficulties; the board hired Roy McKnight as board chairman, who convinced Puskar to return in 1976.[19]
Mylan discontinued operating as a contract manufacturing organization in 1980 and instead chose to market their products under their own "Mylan-labeled" brand.[citation needed]
With the passage of the Hatch-Waxman Act in 1984, Mylan and other small generic companies gained value; in the eighteen months following passage of the law Mylan's earnings grew 166% to $12.5 million and its stock value rose 800%.[20]
In the 1980s one of the most prescribed drugs in the US was Dyazide, a diuretic that was a combination drug containing triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide; it had been on the market since 1965 and its patents had expired in 1980.[21] Complications arose with the introductions of generics versions, because the formulation of Dyazide resulted in variable batches that made it impossible for generic manufacturers to show that their versions were bioequivalent.[22][23]
Some generic companies committed fraud trying to bring a generic version of Dyazide. Bolar Pharmaceutical had the first generic version approved in 1987,[21] but it turned out that Bolar had fraudulently substituted Dyazide for its own version to conduct studies that were submitted to the FDA by 1989 the FDA rescinded its approval based on its suspicions and filed criminal charges against Bolar, to which Bolar eventually pled guilty in 1991.[24][25][26]
Mylan chose to develop a new version of a triamterene/hydrochlorothiazide combination drug instead of going the generic route; it developed a different, more stable formulation[23] and used different dosages of each active ingredient (50 mg hydrochlorothiazide and 75 mg triamterene, compared with Dyazide's 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide and 50 mg triamterene).[27] This drug had to get approval as a new drug, as opposed to a generic; their product was called Maxzide and was approved in 1984.[27][28] The higher dose allowed once per day dosing, which Mylan and its marketing partner, Lederle, believed would help it compete against Dyazide, which had $210M in sales in 1983.[27] However, Mylan's patents on the drug were declared invalid in court, and its marketing exclusivity expired in 1987, prompting a rush of generic competition[29]
Mylan had concerns about the practices of its competitors and the FDA in general, and also with regard to companies seeking to bring generic versions of Maxzide. Mylan hired private investigators to examine its competitors' practices, and when it found evidence of corruption, it submitted it to the House Oversight and Investigations Committee, which investigated and found fraud and corruption within the Food and Drug Administration's generic drugs division and at other generic companies.[19] Two of the companies that had gotten approval to market generic versions of Maxzide, Vitarine Pharmaceutical and Par Pharmaceutical, were targets of Mylan's initial investigation and were found to have used Mylan's Maxzide to obtain their bioequivalence data, leading both companies to withdraw its generic competitor to Mylan's product.[19][30]
The corruption in the nascent generics industry and at the office in the FDA regulating it was widely covered in the media, and led to widespread concern among doctors and the public in the late 1980s and early 1990s that generic drugs were not really the same as the branded drugs they were meant to replace.[24][31][22]
In 1987 Mylan agreed to enter into a joint venture with Bolar to buy Somerset Pharmaceuticals; Mylan wanted access to Somersets' drug discovery capabilities as well as its new drug for Parkinson's, selegiline; the deal was completed in 1988 but its consummation was dependent on FDA approval of selegiline, which came in 1989.[19][32][33]
Mylan acquired Bertek Inc. in 1993 for its transdermal patch technologies, and kept as a subsidiary; in 1999 Mylan renamed the company Mylan Technologies Inc. (MTI).[34] MTI eventually came to be the contract manufacturer for the selegiline transdermal patch and was the first company to market generic nitroglycerin, estradiol, clonidine, and fentanyl transdermal patches.[34] Mylan acquired UDL Laboratories, a supplier of unit dose generic medications to institutional and long-term care facilities in 1996.[35]
In 1998 when it was the world's second largest generics company, Mylan came under investigation from the Federal Trade Commission after it raised the prices of its products, tripling them in the case of lorazepam; Mylan had entered into an exclusive agreement with Profarmica, an Italian company that supplied drug ingredients, after which Mylan's competitors had higher prices and a diminished supply of raw ingredients for lorazepam and other drugs.[36] Before the round of price increases the price of generic drugs had been 5 - 10% of the price of branded drugs and afterwards it was around 50%.[36] The FTC filed suit at the end of 1998 and 32 states filed parallel actions; the case was settled in 2000, with Mylan paying a total of $147M -- $100M in disgorged profits into a fund to reimburse consumers and state agencies that had overpaid, $8 million in attorney's fees to the State Attorneys General, $35 million, plus $4 million in attorney's fees, to settle certain class actions with insurers and managed care organizations -- and Mylan and three ingredient suppliers (Cambrex Corporation, Profarmaco S.R.L., and Gyma Laboratories) also agreed to an injunction barring them from entering into similar anticompetitive agreements in the future.[37][38]
In 2004 Mylan and King Pharmaceuticals began discussing a deal in which Mylan would acquire King for about $4B; Mylan wanted to expand its presence in branded pharmaceuticals and to acquire King's sales force.[39] The deal became one of the business soap operas of the year, and included an SEC investigation into King's accounting and Carl Icahn obtaining a 9.8% interest in Mylan and becoming its largest stakeholder in order to kill the deal; the parties called off the deal in February 2005.[39] Icahn offered to buy Mylan for $5.4B[40] and ran a slate of board members to change the direction of Mylan; he won three seats in May 2005.[41] In June Mylan bought back 25% of its shares in order to fend off Icahn;[42] and in July Icahn gave up his bid and sold his shares.[43]
In August 2006 Mylan announced that it had reached agreement to buy a controlling interest in Matrix Laboratories, an Indian supplier of active pharmaceutical ingredients; the deal gave Mylan access to markets in India and China and was completed in January the next year.[44][45]
In May 2007 Mylan and Merck KGaA agreed that Mylan would acquire Merck's generics arm for $6.6B; the deal was completed that October and tripled the size of Mylan.[46][47] Mylan acquired the rights to market the EpiPen in the transaction; at that time annual sales were around $200 million[48] and the EpiPen had about 90% of the market.[49]
In 2009, the company filed two lawsuits against the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette after the newspaper ran an article that was critical of the quality control procedures used at the company's Morgantown plant.[50][51] The company had earlier quality control issues involving the FDA.[52] The lawsuits were dropped in 2012 without any damages paid by the Post-Gazette, which stated "The Post-Gazette did not find and did not intend to report that Mylan had manufactured or distributed any defective drugs. The Post-Gazette regrets if any reader of the article thought otherwise."[53]
Also in 2009, Mylan and its subsidiary UDL agreed to pay a $118M to settle a suit filed under the False Claims Act in which Mylan/UDL and two other companies were accused of underpaying states under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. The program requires drug companies to give rebates to states under Medicaid and the rebates are higher for new drugs than for generics; the suit said that the companies sold new drugs but paid rebates as if they were generics.[54]
In 2011, Mylan entered into an agreement with Pfizer for the exclusive worldwide rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize Pfizer's generic equivalent to GlaxoSmithKline's Advair (US)/Seretide (UK) Diskus incorporating Pfizer's proprietary dry powder inhaler delivery platform;[55] Mylan launched the product in the UK in 2015[56] and in February 2016 the FDA accepted its ANDA, putting it in line behind Hikma and Sandoz to launch a generic version in the US.[57]
In 2012, Mylan launched a program called EpiPen4Schools to sell EpiPens in bulk and with discounts to schools; to participate in the program schools had to agree not to buy epinephrine autoinjectors from any other company for a year.[58]
In December 2012, the National Association of State Boards of Education launched a policy initiative designed to "help state boards of education as they develop student health policies regarding anaphylaxis and epinephrine auto-injector access and use," and advocated for state laws protecting school from legal liability for stocking and using epinephrine autoinjectors. Gayle Manchin, the mother of Mylan's CEO, Heather Bresch, had become president of the association in 2010, and shortly after had discussed donations from her "daughter's company" to the association. Manchin had been appointed to the West Virginia state school board by her husband, then-governor of the state Joe Manchin, in 2007.[59]
In 2013 Mylan acquired an Indian generic injectable drugs company, Agila Specialties Private, for $1.6 billion in cash.[60] In 2015 three plants acquired in that deal were issued warning letters by the FDA.[61]
After successful lobbying from Mylan,[48] in 2013, the "School Access to Emergency Epinephrine Act" became law after passing Congress with broad and bipartisan support; it protected anyone from liability if they administered epinephrine to a child in a school (previously, only trained professionals or the affected person were allowed to administer the drug, and were open to liability), and it provided some financial incentives for schools that didn’t already stock epinephrine autoinjector to start stocking them.[62] Joe Manchin, the father of Mylan's CEO, was a senator at that time.[59]
In July 2014, Mylan and Abbott Laboratories announced an agreement under which Mylan would buy Abbott's generic drugs business in developed markets for stock valued at about $5.3 billion.[63] Mylan acquired Mumbai-based Famy Care and expand its presence in the market for women's contraceptives at about $750 million.[64]
Starting in 2014, according to a 2017 report in the New York Times, mid-level executives began questioning the rate at which the company had increased and was planning to continue to increase the price of the Epi-Pen, and raising concerns that the price increases were unethical; the Times reported that when these concerns were brought to Robert Coury, the chairman of the board, Coury "replied that he was untroubled. He raised both his middle fingers and explained, using colorful language, that anyone criticizing Mylan, including its employees, ought to go copulate with themselves. Critics in Congress and on Wall Street, he said, should do the same. And regulators at the Food and Drug Administration? They, too, deserved a round of anatomically challenging self-fulfillment."  The Times reported that Bresch provided similarly dismissive responses.[65]
In April 2015, Mylan tried negotiate with the management of Irish pharmaceutical firm Perrigo to acquire the company, and when those negotiations failed Mylan attempted a hostile takeover, offering to buy $26B in shares directly from shareholders; too few shareholders agreed to sell their stock by the deadline set in November 2015 and the effort failed.[66]
Two weeks after Mylan made its first offer for Perrigo, Teva Pharmaceutical offered to buy Mylan for $40B; the combined companies would have been the world's largest generic company and the 9th biggest drug company in the world.[67] In July, Teva dropped its bid for Mylan and instead acquired Allergan's generic drug business for about the same price.[68][69]
In June 2015, Mylan agreed to work with Pulmatrix, a company with a proprietary inhaled drug delivery platform, to co-develop a product to treat for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; the product was PUR0200, a generic drug in a Pulmatrix device.[70]
In February 2016, the company announced it would acquire Meda for $9.9 billion.[71] In May of the same year the company announced it would acquire Renaissance Acquisition Holdings dermatology division for up to $1 billion.[72]
In 2015 Mylan had about $1.5B in sales of EpiPens and those sales accounted for 40% of Mylan's profit.[48] Mylan had maintained about a 90% market share since it had acquired the product, and had continually raised the price of EpiPens starting in 2009: in 2009, the wholesale price of two EpiPens was about $100; by July 2013, the price was about $265; in May 2015, it was around $461; and in May 2016, the price rose again to around $609,[73] around a 500% jump from the price in 2009.[74] In the summer of 2016, as parents prepared to send their children back to school and went to pharmacies to get new EpiPens, people began to express outrage at the cost of the EpiPen and Mylan was widely and harshly criticized.[75][76] The price hikes led to investigations by Congress and states attorneys general; in October 2016 Mylan agreed to pay a $465M fine related to incorrect rebates it paid under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.[77]
In December 2016, the attorneys general of 20 states filed a civil complaint accusing Mylan of a coordinated scheme to artificially maintain high prices for a generic antibiotic and diabetes drug. The complaint alleged price collusion schemes between six pharmaceutical firms including informal gatherings, telephone calls, and text messages.[78]
According to the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Inspector General analysis, the U.S. government may have overpaid "as much as $1.27 billion between 2006 and 2016" to drugmaker Mylan N.V. for the EpiPen emergency allergy treatment. This represents three times the proposed settlement of $465 million announced by Mylan in October 2016. Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee that launched the "probe of EpiPen pricing probe in 2016, released the analysis on May 30, 2017.[79] On the same day, a group of Mylan "investment funds urged shareholders to vote against the re-election of the company's directors after it paid Chairman Robert Coury over $97 million last year."[79]

EpiPen pricing[edit]

See also: Heather Bresch § Business executive
Mylan acquired the right to market and distribute the EpiPen line of epinephrine autoinjector devices from Merck KGaA as part of their 2007 deal;[73] that right had formerly been held by Dey LP, a wholly owned subsidiary of Merck.[80] The devices deliver about $1 worth of drug.[48] At that time annual sales were around $200M.[48] Bresch, the company's CEO, saw an opportunity to increase sales through marketing and advocacy, and the company launched a marketing campaign to increase awareness of the dangers of anaphylaxis for people with severe allergies that made the brand "EpiPen" as identified with its product as "Kleenex" is with facial tissue; the company also successfully lobbied the FDA to broaden the label to include risk of anaphylaxis and in parallel, successfully lobbied Congress to generate legislation making EpiPens available in schools and in public places like defibrillators are, and hired the same people that Medtronic had worked with on defibrillator legislation to do so.[48] Mylan's efforts to gain market dominance were aided when Sanofi's competing product was recalled in November 2015 and further when Teva's generic competitor was rejected by the FDA in March 2016.[81]
By the first half of 2015, Mylan had an 85% market share of such devices in the US[48] and in that year sales reached around $1.5B and accounted for 40% of Mylan's profit.[82] Those profits were also due in part to Mylan's continually raising the price of EpiPens starting in 2009; in 2007 the wholesale price of two EpiPens was about $100, the price was about the same in 2009, by July 2013 the price about $265, in May 2015 it was around $461, and in May 2016 the price rose again to around $609.[73] The last price increase sparked widespread outrage, including criticism from Martin Shkreli, "poster boy for grasping pharma greed," letters from two Senators and initiation of Congressional investigations,[82][83] and Mylan's pricing of the EpiPen was widely referred to as price gouging.[84][85][86] The last price increase coincided with a new line of TV commercials that were described as "shocking" and "no holds barred", depicting an anaphylactic reaction from the point of view of the young woman having it at a party, and ending with the young woman seeing her swollen and hive-covered face in the mirror before she collapses.[87] In response to criticism, Mylan increased financial assistance available for some patients to purchase EpiPens,[88] a gesture that was called a "classic public relations move" by Harvard Medical School professor Aaron Kesselheim.[89] The up to $300 saving cards can only be used by a small number of people who need the drug, and no one on Medicaid. They do nothing about the high price which is still being paid by insurers, who ultimately pass the cost onto consumers.[89]
In September 2016, the New York State Attorney General began an investigation into Mylan's EpiPen4Schools program in New York to determine if the program's contracts violated antitrust law[90] and the West Virginia State Attorney General opened an investigation into whether Mylan had given the state the correct discount under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and subpoenaed the company when it refused to provide the documentation the state requested.[91]
In October 2016 the CEO of Mylan testified to Congress that Pfizer/King charged Mylan about $34.50 for one device.[92] In September 2016, a Silicon Valley engineering consultancy performed a teardown analysis of the EpiPen and estimated the manufacturing and packaging costs at about $10 for a two-pack.[93]
In October 2016, Mylan announced a settlement with the US Department of Justice over rebates paid by Mylan to states under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.[77] Questions had been raised by Congress and others about why EpiPen had been classified as a generic rather a proprietary product in the program since 1997; generic drugs have lower rebates (13%) than proprietary drugs (23%), and price hikes for generic drugs cannot be passed onto states, and a common form of pharmaceutical fraud involves misclassifying proprietary drugs as generic under the program.[94] Under the agreement Mylan agreed to pay a $465 million payment and to a sign a corporate integrity agreement requiring it to perform better in the future;[77] the settlement also resolved cases brought by states related to the rebates.[95] Simultaneously with the settlement Mylan also announced it was being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission related to the drug rebate program.[96]
In June 2017 the New York Times published an article reporting on internal Mylan discussions about price increases on the EpiPen between 2014 and 2016, in which the company chairman expressed disdain for people and agencies who might criticize the company; the reporter wrote: "Those top leaders’ responses are a far cry from the message on Mylan’s website, which says that 'we challenge every member of every team to challenge the status quo,' and that 'we put people and patients first, trusting that profits will follow.'", and also noted that "The firm is a case study in the limits of what consumer and employee activism, as well as government oversight, can achieve." [65][97][98][99]
Execution drugs[edit]
Mylan manufactures rocuronium bromide, which is approved by the state of Alabama for use in executions by lethal injection. European manufacturers refuse to sell drugs which can be used for executions to the United States, except to distributors or users who sign legally binding agreements that the drug will not be used for executions down the delivery chain.[100]
In September 2014, the London-based human rights organization Reprieve told Mylan that they were the only FDA-approved manufacturer of rocuronium bromide without legal controls in place to prevent its use in executions, and there was "a very real risk that Mylan may soon become the go-to provider of execution drugs for states across the country". The German asset manager DJE Kapital (de) divested itself of $70 million in Mylan shares for that reason. Mylan said that their distribution was "legally compliant".[100]

Mylan N.V. is an American global generic and specialty pharmaceuticals company registered in the Netherlands, with principal executive offices in Hatfield, Hertfordshire, UK and global headquarters in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, US.[2] In 2007, Mylan acquired a controlling interest in India-based Matrix Laboratories Limited, a top producer of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) for generic drugs,[3] and the generics business of Germany-based Merck KGaA.[4] Through these acquisitions, Mylan grew from the third-largest generic and pharmaceuticals company in the United States to the second-largest generic and specialty pharmaceuticals company in the world.[5]
In 2016, Mylan's pricing of the EpiPen, an epinephrine autoinjector, became controversial and was widely referred to as "price gouging". As a result, investigations were opened into whether Mylan had misclassified the EpiPen under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, a common form of pharmaceutical fraud. In October 2016, Mylan settled these investigations with the U.S. Department of Justice, agreeing to pay $465 million and enter into a corporate integrity agreement concerning the rebate program. In a report published on June 12, 2017 the Institutional Shareholder Services criticized Mylan for the "outsized compensation" of Mylan's directors. Former CEO Robert Coury received a "$98 million" 2016 "pay package" in spite of the "harm to the company inflicted by the EpiPen controversies" and "steep shareholder losses." The report urged Mylan's shareholders to "oust all of Mylan's existing directors".[6]

Location[edit]
Founded in 1961, the company was first located in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia.[16] The company moved to Morgantown, West Virginia, in 1965, and in 1976 it relocated its corporate headquarters to the Pittsburgh suburb Canonsburg, Pennsylvania. Finally in 2004 it moved to a new office center in nearby Southpointe, a suburban business park located in Cecil Township, where it is still located.[17]
Stock[edit]
On February 23, 1973, Mylan had its initial public offering (IPO),[18] becoming a publicly traded company on the OTC market under the ticker symbol MYLN. In 1976 the stock moved to NASDAQ. Their final stock move was in 1986, when their stock became available for trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol MYL. Currently, the stock is traded on the NASDAQ.
History[edit]
Mylan Pharmaceuticals was founded as a drug distributor in 1961 by Milan Puskar and Don Panoz.[16] In 1966 Mylan began manufacturing penicillin G tablets as well as vitamins and other dietary supplements.[16][19]
Panoz left Mylan in 1969 and Puskar quit the company in 1973, as it grew and experienced financial difficulties; the board hired Roy McKnight as board chairman, who convinced Puskar to return in 1976.[19]
Mylan discontinued operating as a contract manufacturing organization in 1980 and instead chose to market their products under their own "Mylan-labeled" brand.[citation needed]
With the passage of the Hatch-Waxman Act in 1984, Mylan and other small generic companies gained value; in the eighteen months following passage of the law Mylan's earnings grew 166% to $12.5 million and its stock value rose 800%.[20]
In the 1980s one of the most prescribed drugs in the US was Dyazide, a diuretic that was a combination drug containing triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide; it had been on the market since 1965 and its patents had expired in 1980.[21] Complications arose with the introductions of generics versions, because the formulation of Dyazide resulted in variable batches that made it impossible for generic manufacturers to show that their versions were bioequivalent.[22][23]
Some generic companies committed fraud trying to bring a generic version of Dyazide. Bolar Pharmaceutical had the first generic version approved in 1987,[21] but it turned out that Bolar had fraudulently substituted Dyazide for its own version to conduct studies that were submitted to the FDA by 1989 the FDA rescinded its approval based on its suspicions and filed criminal charges against Bolar, to which Bolar eventually pled guilty in 1991.[24][25][26]
Mylan chose to develop a new version of a triamterene/hydrochlorothiazide combination drug instead of going the generic route; it developed a different, more stable formulation[23] and used different dosages of each active ingredient (50 mg hydrochlorothiazide and 75 mg triamterene, compared with Dyazide's 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide and 50 mg triamterene).[27] This drug had to get approval as a new drug, as opposed to a generic; their product was called Maxzide and was approved in 1984.[27][28] The higher dose allowed once per day dosing, which Mylan and its marketing partner, Lederle, believed would help it compete against Dyazide, which had $210M in sales in 1983.[27] However, Mylan's patents on the drug were declared invalid in court, and its marketing exclusivity expired in 1987, prompting a rush of generic competition[29]
Mylan had concerns about the practices of its competitors and the FDA in general, and also with regard to companies seeking to bring generic versions of Maxzide. Mylan hired private investigators to examine its competitors' practices, and when it found evidence of corruption, it submitted it to the House Oversight and Investigations Committee, which investigated and found fraud and corruption within the Food and Drug Administration's generic drugs division and at other generic companies.[19] Two of the companies that had gotten approval to market generic versions of Maxzide, Vitarine Pharmaceutical and Par Pharmaceutical, were targets of Mylan's initial investigation and were found to have used Mylan's Maxzide to obtain their bioequivalence data, leading both companies to withdraw its generic competitor to Mylan's product.[19][30]
The corruption in the nascent generics industry and at the office in the FDA regulating it was widely covered in the media, and led to widespread concern among doctors and the public in the late 1980s and early 1990s that generic drugs were not really the same as the branded drugs they were meant to replace.[24][31][22]
In 1987 Mylan agreed to enter into a joint venture with Bolar to buy Somerset Pharmaceuticals; Mylan wanted access to Somersets' drug discovery capabilities as well as its new drug for Parkinson's, selegiline; the deal was completed in 1988 but its consummation was dependent on FDA approval of selegiline, which came in 1989.[19][32][33]
Mylan acquired Bertek Inc. in 1993 for its transdermal patch technologies, and kept as a subsidiary; in 1999 Mylan renamed the company Mylan Technologies Inc. (MTI).[34] MTI eventually came to be the contract manufacturer for the selegiline transdermal patch and was the first company to market generic nitroglycerin, estradiol, clonidine, and fentanyl transdermal patches.[34] Mylan acquired UDL Laboratories, a supplier of unit dose generic medications to institutional and long-term care facilities in 1996.[35]
In 1998 when it was the world's second largest generics company, Mylan came under investigation from the Federal Trade Commission after it raised the prices of its products, tripling them in the case of lorazepam; Mylan had entered into an exclusive agreement with Profarmica, an Italian company that supplied drug ingredients, after which Mylan's competitors had higher prices and a diminished supply of raw ingredients for lorazepam and other drugs.[36] Before the round of price increases the price of generic drugs had been 5 - 10% of the price of branded drugs and afterwards it was around 50%.[36] The FTC filed suit at the end of 1998 and 32 states filed parallel actions; the case was settled in 2000, with Mylan paying a total of $147M -- $100M in disgorged profits into a fund to reimburse consumers and state agencies that had overpaid, $8 million in attorney's fees to the State Attorneys General, $35 million, plus $4 million in attorney's fees, to settle certain class actions with insurers and managed care organizations -- and Mylan and three ingredient suppliers (Cambrex Corporation, Profarmaco S.R.L., and Gyma Laboratories) also agreed to an injunction barring them from entering into similar anticompetitive agreements in the future.[37][38]
In 2004 Mylan and King Pharmaceuticals began discussing a deal in which Mylan would acquire King for about $4B; Mylan wanted to expand its presence in branded pharmaceuticals and to acquire King's sales force.[39] The deal became one of the business soap operas of the year, and included an SEC investigation into King's accounting and Carl Icahn obtaining a 9.8% interest in Mylan and becoming its largest stakeholder in order to kill the deal; the parties called off the deal in February 2005.[39] Icahn offered to buy Mylan for $5.4B[40] and ran a slate of board members to change the direction of Mylan; he won three seats in May 2005.[41] In June Mylan bought back 25% of its shares in order to fend off Icahn;[42] and in July Icahn gave up his bid and sold his shares.[43]
In August 2006 Mylan announced that it had reached agreement to buy a controlling interest in Matrix Laboratories, an Indian supplier of active pharmaceutical ingredients; the deal gave Mylan access to markets in India and China and was completed in January the next year.[44][45]
In May 2007 Mylan and Merck KGaA agreed that Mylan would acquire Merck's generics arm for $6.6B; the deal was completed that October and tripled the size of Mylan.[46][47] Mylan acquired the rights to market the EpiPen in the transaction; at that time annual sales were around $200 million[48] and the EpiPen had about 90% of the market.[49]
In 2009, the company filed two lawsuits against the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette after the newspaper ran an article that was critical of the quality control procedures used at the company's Morgantown plant.[50][51] The company had earlier quality control issues involving the FDA.[52] The lawsuits were dropped in 2012 without any damages paid by the Post-Gazette, which stated "The Post-Gazette did not find and did not intend to report that Mylan had manufactured or distributed any defective drugs. The Post-Gazette regrets if any reader of the article thought otherwise."[53]
Also in 2009, Mylan and its subsidiary UDL agreed to pay a $118M to settle a suit filed under the False Claims Act in which Mylan/UDL and two other companies were accused of underpaying states under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. The program requires drug companies to give rebates to states under Medicaid and the rebates are higher for new drugs than for generics; the suit said that the companies sold new drugs but paid rebates as if they were generics.[54]
In 2011, Mylan entered into an agreement with Pfizer for the exclusive worldwide rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize Pfizer's generic equivalent to GlaxoSmithKline's Advair (US)/Seretide (UK) Diskus incorporating Pfizer's proprietary dry powder inhaler delivery platform;[55] Mylan launched the product in the UK in 2015[56] and in February 2016 the FDA accepted its ANDA, putting it in line behind Hikma and Sandoz to launch a generic version in the US.[57]
In 2012, Mylan launched a program called EpiPen4Schools to sell EpiPens in bulk and with discounts to schools; to participate in the program schools had to agree not to buy epinephrine autoinjectors from any other company for a year.[58]
In December 2012, the National Association of State Boards of Education launched a policy initiative designed to "help state boards of education as they develop student health policies regarding anaphylaxis and epinephrine auto-injector access and use," and advocated for state laws protecting school from legal liability for stocking and using epinephrine autoinjectors. Gayle Manchin, the mother of Mylan's CEO, Heather Bresch, had become president of the association in 2010, and shortly after had discussed donations from her "daughter's company" to the association. Manchin had been appointed to the West Virginia state school board by her husband, then-governor of the state Joe Manchin, in 2007.[59]
In 2013 Mylan acquired an Indian generic injectable drugs company, Agila Specialties Private, for $1.6 billion in cash.[60] In 2015 three plants acquired in that deal were issued warning letters by the FDA.[61]
After successful lobbying from Mylan,[48] in 2013, the "School Access to Emergency Epinephrine Act" became law after passing Congress with broad and bipartisan support; it protected anyone from liability if they administered epinephrine to a child in a school (previously, only trained professionals or the affected person were allowed to administer the drug, and were open to liability), and it provided some financial incentives for schools that didn’t already stock epinephrine autoinjector to start stocking them.[62] Joe Manchin, the father of Mylan's CEO, was a senator at that time.[59]
In July 2014, Mylan and Abbott Laboratories announced an agreement under which Mylan would buy Abbott's generic drugs business in developed markets for stock valued at about $5.3 billion.[63] Mylan acquired Mumbai-based Famy Care and expand its presence in the market for women's contraceptives at about $750 million.[64]
Starting in 2014, according to a 2017 report in the New York Times, mid-level executives began questioning the rate at which the company had increased and was planning to continue to increase the price of the Epi-Pen, and raising concerns that the price increases were unethical; the Times reported that when these concerns were brought to Robert Coury, the chairman of the board, Coury "replied that he was untroubled. He raised both his middle fingers and explained, using colorful language, that anyone criticizing Mylan, including its employees, ought to go copulate with themselves. Critics in Congress and on Wall Street, he said, should do the same. And regulators at the Food and Drug Administration? They, too, deserved a round of anatomically challenging self-fulfillment."  The Times reported that Bresch provided similarly dismissive responses.[65]
In April 2015, Mylan tried negotiate with the management of Irish pharmaceutical firm Perrigo to acquire the company, and when those negotiations failed Mylan attempted a hostile takeover, offering to buy $26B in shares directly from shareholders; too few shareholders agreed to sell their stock by the deadline set in November 2015 and the effort failed.[66]
Two weeks after Mylan made its first offer for Perrigo, Teva Pharmaceutical offered to buy Mylan for $40B; the combined companies would have been the world's largest generic company and the 9th biggest drug company in the world.[67] In July, Teva dropped its bid for Mylan and instead acquired Allergan's generic drug business for about the same price.[68][69]
In June 2015, Mylan agreed to work with Pulmatrix, a company with a proprietary inhaled drug delivery platform, to co-develop a product to treat for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; the product was PUR0200, a generic drug in a Pulmatrix device.[70]
In February 2016, the company announced it would acquire Meda for $9.9 billion.[71] In May of the same year the company announced it would acquire Renaissance Acquisition Holdings dermatology division for up to $1 billion.[72]
In 2015 Mylan had about $1.5B in sales of EpiPens and those sales accounted for 40% of Mylan's profit.[48] Mylan had maintained about a 90% market share since it had acquired the product, and had continually raised the price of EpiPens starting in 2009: in 2009, the wholesale price of two EpiPens was about $100; by July 2013, the price was about $265; in May 2015, it was around $461; and in May 2016, the price rose again to around $609,[73] around a 500% jump from the price in 2009.[74] In the summer of 2016, as parents prepared to send their children back to school and went to pharmacies to get new EpiPens, people began to express outrage at the cost of the EpiPen and Mylan was widely and harshly criticized.[75][76] The price hikes led to investigations by Congress and states attorneys general; in October 2016 Mylan agreed to pay a $465M fine related to incorrect rebates it paid under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.[77]
In December 2016, the attorneys general of 20 states filed a civil complaint accusing Mylan of a coordinated scheme to artificially maintain high prices for a generic antibiotic and diabetes drug. The complaint alleged price collusion schemes between six pharmaceutical firms including informal gatherings, telephone calls, and text messages.[78]
According to the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Inspector General analysis, the U.S. government may have overpaid "as much as $1.27 billion between 2006 and 2016" to drugmaker Mylan N.V. for the EpiPen emergency allergy treatment. This represents three times the proposed settlement of $465 million announced by Mylan in October 2016. Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee that launched the "probe of EpiPen pricing probe in 2016, released the analysis on May 30, 2017.[79] On the same day, a group of Mylan "investment funds urged shareholders to vote against the re-election of the company's directors after it paid Chairman Robert Coury over $97 million last year."[79]

EpiPen pricing[edit]

See also: Heather Bresch § Business executive
Mylan acquired the right to market and distribute the EpiPen line of epinephrine autoinjector devices from Merck KGaA as part of their 2007 deal;[73] that right had formerly been held by Dey LP, a wholly owned subsidiary of Merck.[80] The devices deliver about $1 worth of drug.[48] At that time annual sales were around $200M.[48] Bresch, the company's CEO, saw an opportunity to increase sales through marketing and advocacy, and the company launched a marketing campaign to increase awareness of the dangers of anaphylaxis for people with severe allergies that made the brand "EpiPen" as identified with its product as "Kleenex" is with facial tissue; the company also successfully lobbied the FDA to broaden the label to include risk of anaphylaxis and in parallel, successfully lobbied Congress to generate legislation making EpiPens available in schools and in public places like defibrillators are, and hired the same people that Medtronic had worked with on defibrillator legislation to do so.[48] Mylan's efforts to gain market dominance were aided when Sanofi's competing product was recalled in November 2015 and further when Teva's generic competitor was rejected by the FDA in March 2016.[81]
By the first half of 2015, Mylan had an 85% market share of such devices in the US[48] and in that year sales reached around $1.5B and accounted for 40% of Mylan's profit.[82] Those profits were also due in part to Mylan's continually raising the price of EpiPens starting in 2009; in 2007 the wholesale price of two EpiPens was about $100, the price was about the same in 2009, by July 2013 the price about $265, in May 2015 it was around $461, and in May 2016 the price rose again to around $609.[73] The last price increase sparked widespread outrage, including criticism from Martin Shkreli, "poster boy for grasping pharma greed," letters from two Senators and initiation of Congressional investigations,[82][83] and Mylan's pricing of the EpiPen was widely referred to as price gouging.[84][85][86] The last price increase coincided with a new line of TV commercials that were described as "shocking" and "no holds barred", depicting an anaphylactic reaction from the point of view of the young woman having it at a party, and ending with the young woman seeing her swollen and hive-covered face in the mirror before she collapses.[87] In response to criticism, Mylan increased financial assistance available for some patients to purchase EpiPens,[88] a gesture that was called a "classic public relations move" by Harvard Medical School professor Aaron Kesselheim.[89] The up to $300 saving cards can only be used by a small number of people who need the drug, and no one on Medicaid. They do nothing about the high price which is still being paid by insurers, who ultimately pass the cost onto consumers.[89]
In September 2016, the New York State Attorney General began an investigation into Mylan's EpiPen4Schools program in New York to determine if the program's contracts violated antitrust law[90] and the West Virginia State Attorney General opened an investigation into whether Mylan had given the state the correct discount under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and subpoenaed the company when it refused to provide the documentation the state requested.[91]
In October 2016 the CEO of Mylan testified to Congress that Pfizer/King charged Mylan about $34.50 for one device.[92] In September 2016, a Silicon Valley engineering consultancy performed a teardown analysis of the EpiPen and estimated the manufacturing and packaging costs at about $10 for a two-pack.[93]
In October 2016, Mylan announced a settlement with the US Department of Justice over rebates paid by Mylan to states under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.[77] Questions had been raised by Congress and others about why EpiPen had been classified as a generic rather a proprietary product in the program since 1997; generic drugs have lower rebates (13%) than proprietary drugs (23%), and price hikes for generic drugs cannot be passed onto states, and a common form of pharmaceutical fraud involves misclassifying proprietary drugs as generic under the program.[94] Under the agreement Mylan agreed to pay a $465 million payment and to a sign a corporate integrity agreement requiring it to perform better in the future;[77] the settlement also resolved cases brought by states related to the rebates.[95] Simultaneously with the settlement Mylan also announced it was being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission related to the drug rebate program.[96]
In June 2017 the New York Times published an article reporting on internal Mylan discussions about price increases on the EpiPen between 2014 and 2016, in which the company chairman expressed disdain for people and agencies who might criticize the company; the reporter wrote: "Those top leaders’ responses are a far cry from the message on Mylan’s website, which says that 'we challenge every member of every team to challenge the status quo,' and that 'we put people and patients first, trusting that profits will follow.'", and also noted that "The firm is a case study in the limits of what consumer and employee activism, as well as government oversight, can achieve." [65][97][98][99]
Execution drugs[edit]
Mylan manufactures rocuronium bromide, which is approved by the state of Alabama for use in executions by lethal injection. European manufacturers refuse to sell drugs which can be used for executions to the United States, except to distributors or users who sign legally binding agreements that the drug will not be used for executions down the delivery chain.[100]
In September 2014, the London-based human rights organization Reprieve told Mylan that they were the only FDA-approved manufacturer of rocuronium bromide without legal controls in place to prevent its use in executions, and there was "a very real risk that Mylan may soon become the go-to provider of execution drugs for states across the country". The German asset manager DJE Kapital (de) divested itself of $70 million in Mylan shares for that reason. Mylan said that their distribution was "legally compliant".[100]

Scared of tech stocks? Health-care shares are cheaper — and rallying

Mylan shares rise as FDA advisors recommend breast-cancer drug approval
Mylan NV  shares rose in the extended session Thursday after the drug maker said a Food and Drug Administration advisory committee recommended approval of its generic version of Roche's breast-cancer drug Herceptin. Mylan shares rose 1.3% to $39.55 after hours. The FDA's Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee voted 16 to 0 recommending that the agency approve trastuzumab, a biologically similar version of Roche's breast-cancer drug Herceptin, Mylan said. Mylan and partner Biocon Ltd., based in Bengaluru, India, developed the drug. The FDA is not obligated to follow the recommendations of its advisory committees but generally does.

Adamis Pharma stock skyrockets after rival EpiPen product gets FDA approval
Adamis Pharmaceuticals Corp.  shares soared 53% to a one-year high Thursday after the company's allergic reaction treatment, intended as a rival to Mylan's EpiPen , was approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Symjepi includes two syringes pre-filled with a dose each of epinephrine, which is used to treat allergic reactions. Adamis' news follows a scandal last summer over the escalating price of Mylan's EpiPen. After the fallout, Mylan released an authorized generic version of the EpiPen that cost less, or about $300 for a two-pack. CVS made an authorized generic for Impax Laboratories Inc.'s Adrenaclick  available at about $100 for a two-pack early this year. Adamis did not say how much its Symjepi product would cost, only that it's anticipated to have a "lower cost." Adrenaclick is "unlikely to set the pricing of the marketplace as Adamis PFS enters," said Maxim analyst Jason Kolbert, since Adrenaclick is an older product, among other things. Adamis' product should launch by the middle of this summer, he said. Symjepi "may actually be a better, more user-friendly product (design-wise) versus EpiPen, Adrenaclick and AuviQ," which is made by Kaleo Inc., he said. "The market opportunity is large. Even with just moderate market share assumptions, PFS becomes a significant product." Adamis' syringe product previously failed to receive FDA approval in June 2016, with the FDA asking for more tests. The company said it is preparing to apply for approval for a children's version of Symjepi. Adamis shares have surged 24% over the last three months, compared with a 2% rise in the S&P 500 .

U.S. may have overpaid for EpiPen by $1.3 billion, Grassley says
U.S. taxpayers may have overpaid for EpiPen by as much as $1.27 billion from 2006 through 2016, U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley said Wednesday, citing an estimate from the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General. The Iowa Republican said that's far more than the $465 million that EpiPen maker Mylan  agreed to in settlement negotiations with the Justice Department.

Mylan stock rises 3% after first-quarter profit beat, revenue miss
Mylan NV  shares rose 2.8% in premarket trade Tuesday after the company reported a first-quarter profit beat and revenue miss. Earnings for the latest quarter rose to $66.4 million, or 12 cents per share, from $13.9 million, or 3 cents per share in the year-earlier period. Adjusted earnings-per-share were 93 cents, compared with the FactSet consensus of 92 cents. Revenue rose to $2.72 billion from $2.19 billion, compared with the FactSet consensus of $2.82 billion. The latest results included a decline in sales of the EpiPen allergic reaction treatment due to new competition and Mylan's release of a cheaper, authorized generic product, the company said. Mylan reaffirmed its March guidance for full year 2017 revenues between $12.25 billion and $13.75 billion, earnings between $2.8 billion and $3.0 billion and adjusted EPS of $5.15 to $5.55. Mylan shares have declined 3.3% over the last three months, compared with a 3.5% rise in the S&P 500 .

Announcement

Mylan N.V. (NASDAQ, TASE: MYL) today announced that Meridian Medical Technologies, a Pfizer company and Mylan's manufacturing partner for EpiPen® Auto-Injector, has expanded a voluntary recall of select lots of EpiPen (epinephrine injection, USP) and EpiPen Jr® (epinephrine injection, USP) Auto-Injectors to now include additional lots distributed in the U.S. and other markets in consultation with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).This recall is being conducted as a result of the receipt of two previously disclosed reports outside of the U.S. of failure to activate the device due to a potential defect in a supplier component. The potential defect could make the device difficult to activate in an emergency (failure to activate or increased force needed to activate) and have significant health consequences for a patient experiencing a life-threatening allergic reaction (anaphylaxis). Both reports are related to the single lot that was previously recalled. The incidence of the defect is extremely rare and testing and analysis across the potentially impacted lots has not identified any units with a defect. However, the recall is being expanded to include additional lots as a precautionary measure out of an abundance of caution.The recalled product was manufactured by Meridian Medical Technologies, a Pfizer company, and distributed by Mylan Specialty between December 2015 and July 2016. The expanded voluntary recall is being initiated in the U.S. and also will extend to additional markets in Europe, Asia, North and South America.The recall impacts the 0.3 mg and 0.15 mg strengths of EpiPen Auto-Injector. None of the recalled lots include the authorized generic for EpiPen Auto-Injector, which is also manufactured by Meridian Medical Technologies. U.S. Impacted Lots:Product/DosageNDC NumberLot NumberExpiration DateEpiPen Jr 2-Pak® Auto-Injectors, 0.15 mg49502-501-025GN767April 2017EpiPen Jr 2-Pak® Auto-Injectors, 0.15 mg49502-501-025GN773April 2017EpiPen 2-Pak® Auto-Injectors, 0.3 mg49502-500-025GM631April 2017EpiPen 2-Pak® Auto-Injectors, 0.3 mg49502-500-025GM640May 2017EpiPen Jr 2-Pak® Auto-Injectors, 0.15 mg49502-501-026GN215September 2017EpiPen 2-Pak® Auto-Injectors, 0.3 mg49502-500-026GM082September 2017EpiPen 2-Pak® Auto-Injectors, 0.3 mg49502-500-026GM072September 2017EpiPen 2-Pak® Auto-Injectors, 0.3 mg49502-500-026GM081September 2017EpiPen 2-Pak® Auto-Injectors, 0.3 mg49502-500-026GM088October 2017EpiPen 2-Pak® Auto-Injectors, 0.3 mg49502-500-026GM199October 2017EpiPen 2-Pak® Auto-Injectors, 0.3 mg49502-500-026GM091October 2017EpiPen 2-Pak® Auto-Injectors, 0.3 mg49502-500-026GM198October 2017EpiPen 2-pak® Auto-Injectors, 0.3 mg49502-500-026GM087October 2017Mylan is committed to replacing recalled devices at no cost and Mylan would like to reassure patients that there will be no additional replacement-related financial burden to them as a result of this recall. Patients, customers and distributors are being notified and should refer to Mylan.com/EpiPenRecall for updates on product return and replacement instructions. We are asking patients to keep their existing product until their replacement product can be secured.Patients may receive either EpiPen Auto-Injector or the authorized generic for EpiPen Auto-Injector at the pharmacy as a replacement based on availability. The authorized generic has the exact same drug formulation, has the exact same operating instructions and is therapeutically equivalent to EpiPen Auto Injector, and may be substituted for EpiPen Auto Injector.It is important that patients continue to carry their current EpiPen Auto-Injector until they receive a replacement device. To return your product please contact Stericycle at 877-650-3494. If you have any additional questions regarding this recall, please contact Mylan Customer Relations at 800-796-9526 or customer.service@mylan.com.Adverse reactions or quality problems experienced with the use of this product may be reported to the FDA's MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting program either online, by regular mail or by fax.Complete and submit the report Online: www.fda.gov/medwatch/report.htmRegular Mail or Fax: Download form www.fda.gov/MedWatch/getforms.htm or call 1-800-332-1088 to request a reporting form, then complete and return to the address on the pre-addressed form, or submit by fax to 1-800-FDA-0178.This voluntary recall is being conducted with the knowledge of FDA.Epinephrine is the first-line treatment for a life-threatening allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) and access to this product is critical in the event of an emergency. Delays in epinephrine administration have been associated with negative health consequences. More information about the risks and benefits of EpiPen® Auto-Injector can be found at EpiPen.com.Please see the full Prescribing Information and Patient Information.

Administration of a sterile injectable that has foreign particulates has the potential of severe health consequences. Intrathecal administration could result in a life threatening adverse event or result in permanent impairment of a body function. Intravenous administration has the potential to damage and/or obstruct blood vessels which could induce emboli, particularly in the lungs. If a right to left cardiac shunt is present, the particulate may lead to arterial emboli and result in stroke, myocardial infarction, respiratory failure, and loss of renal and hepatic function or tissue necrosis. Other adverse effects associated with intravenous injection of particulate matter include local inflammation, phlebitis, allergic response and/or embolization in the body and infection. Intra-arterial administration could result in damage to blood vessels in the distal extremities or organs. Intramuscular administration could result in foreign-body inflammatory response, with local pain, swelling and possible long term granuloma formation. To date, Mylan has not received any reports of adverse events related to this recall.
Gemcitabine for Injection, USP 200mg is an intravenously administered product indicated for the treatment of ovarian cancer, breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer and pancreatic cancer. These lots were distributed in the U.S. between Feb. 18, 2014, and Dec. 19, 2014, and were manufactured and packaged by Agila Onco Therapies Limited, a Mylan company. Lot 7801089 is packaged with a Pfizer Injectable label.
Carboplatin Injection 10mg/mL is an intravenously administered product indicated for the treatment of advanced ovarian carcinoma. The lot was distributed in the U.S. between Aug. 11, 2014, and Oct. 7, 2014, and was packaged by Agila Onco Therapies Limited, a Mylan company, with a Mylan Institutional label. 
Methotrexate Injection, USP 25mg/mL can be administered intramuscularly, intravenously, intra-arterially, or intrathecally and is indicated for certain neoplastic diseases, severe psoriasis and adult rheumatoid arthritis. The lot was distributed in the U.S. between Jan. 16, 2014, and March 25, 2014, and was packaged by Agila Onco Therapies Limited, a Mylan company, with a Pfizer Injectables label.
Cytarabine Injection can be administered intravenously or intrathecally and in combination with other approved anti-cancer drugs is indicated for remission induction in acute non-lymphocytic leukemia of adults and pediatric patients. The lot was distributed in the U.S. between May 02, 2014, and July 24, 2014, and was manufactured and packaged by Agila Onco Therapies Limited, a Mylan company located in Bangalore, India and is packaged with a Pfizer Injectables label.
Mylan is notifying its distributors and customers by letter and is arranging for return of all recalled products. Distributors, retailers, hospitals, clinics, and physicians that have these products which are being recalled should stop use and return to place of purchase.

Tweet on Twitter


 The Mylan N.V. (NASDAQ:MYL) EpiPen reign may be about to come to an end, the Food and Drug Administration having approved an affordable alternative.  Adamis Pharmaceuticals Corp (NASDAQ:ADMP) generic version, Symjepi, is the latest addition in the highly competitive space.
The fact that Adami’s product will be much cheaper means Mylan will struggle to ship as many products as it did in the past. The launch could not have come at a worse time for the pharmaceutical company which has seen its market share trimmed with the launch of alternatives from the likes of Kaleo Auvi.
Mylan has been the subject of immense criticism over the price it charges for its EpiPen products. Outrage from the public has already attracted the attention of legislators who asked the company to justify why it charges consumers up to $600 for its products.  The company was later fined $465 million for wrongly classifying its EpiPen under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.
 Price Wars 
Pricing wars should be a point of concern for Mylan given the reaction that Adamis got on announcing the approval of Symjepi by the FDA.
“Pricing is on everyone’s mind as it should be given all of the pricing controversies around EpiPen. Pricing for Symjepi hasn’t been determined yet as that will be set around the time of the launch. […] Adamis does intend to position this product as the low-cost alternative to the other offerings in this market,” said Adamis Spokesperson.
 Symjepi’s cost advantage is not the only thing that Mylan will have to worry about.  The new prefilled syringe is not an auto-injector; taking its ease of use to another level.  The fact that some doctors struggle to use auto-injectors helps bolster the case of why Symjepi could be an attractive prospect for the mass market.
 Adami’s product is also highly portable at four inches long, something that observers believe will give it a competitive edge against the other alternatives.  Mylan might have to rethink its EpiPen Strategy if it is to generate any sales going forward.
Mylan stock was up by 1.39% in Monday’s trading session ending the day at $37.23 a share.

Mylan Provides Update on Meridian Medical Technologies', a Pfizer Company, Expanded Voluntary Worldwide Recall of EpiPen® Auto-Injector

HERTFORDSHIRE, England and PITTSBURGH, March 31, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Mylan N.V. (NASDAQ, TASE: MYL) today announced that Meridian Medical Technologies, a Pfizer company and Mylan's manufacturing partner for EpiPen® Auto-Injector, has expanded a voluntary recall of select lots of EpiPen (epinephrine injection, USP) and EpiPen Jr® (epinephrine injection, USP) Auto-Injectors to now include additional lots distributed in the U.S. and other markets in consultation with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).



This recall is being conducted as a result of the receipt of two previously disclosed reports outside of the U.S. of failure to activate the device due to a potential defect in a supplier component. The potential defect could make the device difficult to activate in an emergency (failure to activate or increased force needed to activate) and have significant health consequences for a patient experiencing a life-threatening allergic reaction (anaphylaxis). Both reports are related to the single lot that was previously recalled. The incidence of the defect is extremely rare and testing and analysis across the potentially impacted lots has not identified any units with a defect. However, the recall is being expanded to include additional lots as a precautionary measure out of an abundance of caution.
The recalled product was manufactured by Meridian Medical Technologies, a Pfizer company, and distributed by Mylan Specialty between December 2015 and July 2016. The expanded voluntary recall is being initiated in the U.S. and also will extend to additional markets in Europe, Asia, North and South America.
The recall impacts the 0.3 mg and 0.15 mg strengths of EpiPen Auto-Injector. None of the recalled lots include the authorized generic for EpiPen Auto-Injector, which is also manufactured by Meridian Medical Technologies.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Mylan N.V. is an American global generic and specialty pharmaceuticals company registered in the Netherlands, with principal executive offices in Hatfield, Hertfordshire, UK and global headquarters in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, US.[2] In 2007, Mylan acquired a controlling interest in India-based Matrix Laboratories Limited, a top producer of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) for generic drugs,[3] and the generics business of Germany-based Merck KGaA.[4] Through these acquisitions, Mylan grew from the third-largest generic and pharmaceuticals company in the United States to the second-largest generic and specialty pharmaceuticals company in the world.[5]
In 2016, Mylan's pricing of the EpiPen, an epinephrine autoinjector, became controversial and was widely referred to as "price gouging". As a result, investigations were opened into whether Mylan had misclassified the EpiPen under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, a common form of pharmaceutical fraud. In October 2016, Mylan settled these investigations with the U.S. Department of Justice, agreeing to pay $465 million and enter into a corporate integrity agreement concerning the rebate program. In a report published on June 12, 2017 the Institutional Shareholder Services criticized Mylan for the "outsized compensation" of Mylan's directors. Former CEO Robert Coury received a "$98 million" 2016 "pay package" in spite of the "harm to the company inflicted by the EpiPen controversies" and "steep shareholder losses." The report urged Mylan's shareholders to "oust all of Mylan's existing directors".[6]

Location[edit]
Founded in 1961, the company was first located in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia.[16] The company moved to Morgantown, West Virginia, in 1965, and in 1976 it relocated its corporate headquarters to the Pittsburgh suburb Canonsburg, Pennsylvania. Finally in 2004 it moved to a new office center in nearby Southpointe, a suburban business park located in Cecil Township, where it is still located.[17]
Stock[edit]
On February 23, 1973, Mylan had its initial public offering (IPO),[18] becoming a publicly traded company on the OTC market under the ticker symbol MYLN. In 1976 the stock moved to NASDAQ. Their final stock move was in 1986, when their stock became available for trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol MYL. Currently, the stock is traded on the NASDAQ.
History[edit]
Mylan Pharmaceuticals was founded as a drug distributor in 1961 by Milan Puskar and Don Panoz.[16] In 1966 Mylan began manufacturing penicillin G tablets as well as vitamins and other dietary supplements.[16][19]
Panoz left Mylan in 1969 and Puskar quit the company in 1973, as it grew and experienced financial difficulties; the board hired Roy McKnight as board chairman, who convinced Puskar to return in 1976.[19]
Mylan discontinued operating as a contract manufacturing organization in 1980 and instead chose to market their products under their own "Mylan-labeled" brand.[citation needed]
With the passage of the Hatch-Waxman Act in 1984, Mylan and other small generic companies gained value; in the eighteen months following passage of the law Mylan's earnings grew 166% to $12.5 million and its stock value rose 800%.[20]
In the 1980s one of the most prescribed drugs in the US was Dyazide, a diuretic that was a combination drug containing triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide; it had been on the market since 1965 and its patents had expired in 1980.[21] Complications arose with the introductions of generics versions, because the formulation of Dyazide resulted in variable batches that made it impossible for generic manufacturers to show that their versions were bioequivalent.[22][23]
Some generic companies committed fraud trying to bring a generic version of Dyazide. Bolar Pharmaceutical had the first generic version approved in 1987,[21] but it turned out that Bolar had fraudulently substituted Dyazide for its own version to conduct studies that were submitted to the FDA by 1989 the FDA rescinded its approval based on its suspicions and filed criminal charges against Bolar, to which Bolar eventually pled guilty in 1991.[24][25][26]
Mylan chose to develop a new version of a triamterene/hydrochlorothiazide combination drug instead of going the generic route; it developed a different, more stable formulation[23] and used different dosages of each active ingredient (50 mg hydrochlorothiazide and 75 mg triamterene, compared with Dyazide's 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide and 50 mg triamterene).[27] This drug had to get approval as a new drug, as opposed to a generic; their product was called Maxzide and was approved in 1984.[27][28] The higher dose allowed once per day dosing, which Mylan and its marketing partner, Lederle, believed would help it compete against Dyazide, which had $210M in sales in 1983.[27] However, Mylan's patents on the drug were declared invalid in court, and its marketing exclusivity expired in 1987, prompting a rush of generic competition[29]
Mylan had concerns about the practices of its competitors and the FDA in general, and also with regard to companies seeking to bring generic versions of Maxzide. Mylan hired private investigators to examine its competitors' practices, and when it found evidence of corruption, it submitted it to the House Oversight and Investigations Committee, which investigated and found fraud and corruption within the Food and Drug Administration's generic drugs division and at other generic companies.[19] Two of the companies that had gotten approval to market generic versions of Maxzide, Vitarine Pharmaceutical and Par Pharmaceutical, were targets of Mylan's initial investigation and were found to have used Mylan's Maxzide to obtain their bioequivalence data, leading both companies to withdraw its generic competitor to Mylan's product.[19][30]
The corruption in the nascent generics industry and at the office in the FDA regulating it was widely covered in the media, and led to widespread concern among doctors and the public in the late 1980s and early 1990s that generic drugs were not really the same as the branded drugs they were meant to replace.[24][31][22]
In 1987 Mylan agreed to enter into a joint venture with Bolar to buy Somerset Pharmaceuticals; Mylan wanted access to Somersets' drug discovery capabilities as well as its new drug for Parkinson's, selegiline; the deal was completed in 1988 but its consummation was dependent on FDA approval of selegiline, which came in 1989.[19][32][33]
Mylan acquired Bertek Inc. in 1993 for its transdermal patch technologies, and kept as a subsidiary; in 1999 Mylan renamed the company Mylan Technologies Inc. (MTI).[34] MTI eventually came to be the contract manufacturer for the selegiline transdermal patch and was the first company to market generic nitroglycerin, estradiol, clonidine, and fentanyl transdermal patches.[34] Mylan acquired UDL Laboratories, a supplier of unit dose generic medications to institutional and long-term care facilities in 1996.[35]
In 1998 when it was the world's second largest generics company, Mylan came under investigation from the Federal Trade Commission after it raised the prices of its products, tripling them in the case of lorazepam; Mylan had entered into an exclusive agreement with Profarmica, an Italian company that supplied drug ingredients, after which Mylan's competitors had higher prices and a diminished supply of raw ingredients for lorazepam and other drugs.[36] Before the round of price increases the price of generic drugs had been 5 - 10% of the price of branded drugs and afterwards it was around 50%.[36] The FTC filed suit at the end of 1998 and 32 states filed parallel actions; the case was settled in 2000, with Mylan paying a total of $147M -- $100M in disgorged profits into a fund to reimburse consumers and state agencies that had overpaid, $8 million in attorney's fees to the State Attorneys General, $35 million, plus $4 million in attorney's fees, to settle certain class actions with insurers and managed care organizations -- and Mylan and three ingredient suppliers (Cambrex Corporation, Profarmaco S.R.L., and Gyma Laboratories) also agreed to an injunction barring them from entering into similar anticompetitive agreements in the future.[37][38]
In 2004 Mylan and King Pharmaceuticals began discussing a deal in which Mylan would acquire King for about $4B; Mylan wanted to expand its presence in branded pharmaceuticals and to acquire King's sales force.[39] The deal became one of the business soap operas of the year, and included an SEC investigation into King's accounting and Carl Icahn obtaining a 9.8% interest in Mylan and becoming its largest stakeholder in order to kill the deal; the parties called off the deal in February 2005.[39] Icahn offered to buy Mylan for $5.4B[40] and ran a slate of board members to change the direction of Mylan; he won three seats in May 2005.[41] In June Mylan bought back 25% of its shares in order to fend off Icahn;[42] and in July Icahn gave up his bid and sold his shares.[43]
In August 2006 Mylan announced that it had reached agreement to buy a controlling interest in Matrix Laboratories, an Indian supplier of active pharmaceutical ingredients; the deal gave Mylan access to markets in India and China and was completed in January the next year.[44][45]
In May 2007 Mylan and Merck KGaA agreed that Mylan would acquire Merck's generics arm for $6.6B; the deal was completed that October and tripled the size of Mylan.[46][47] Mylan acquired the rights to market the EpiPen in the transaction; at that time annual sales were around $200 million[48] and the EpiPen had about 90% of the market.[49]
In 2009, the company filed two lawsuits against the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette after the newspaper ran an article that was critical of the quality control procedures used at the company's Morgantown plant.[50][51] The company had earlier quality control issues involving the FDA.[52] The lawsuits were dropped in 2012 without any damages paid by the Post-Gazette, which stated "The Post-Gazette did not find and did not intend to report that Mylan had manufactured or distributed any defective drugs. The Post-Gazette regrets if any reader of the article thought otherwise."[53]
Also in 2009, Mylan and its subsidiary UDL agreed to pay a $118M to settle a suit filed under the False Claims Act in which Mylan/UDL and two other companies were accused of underpaying states under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. The program requires drug companies to give rebates to states under Medicaid and the rebates are higher for new drugs than for generics; the suit said that the companies sold new drugs but paid rebates as if they were generics.[54]
In 2011, Mylan entered into an agreement with Pfizer for the exclusive worldwide rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize Pfizer's generic equivalent to GlaxoSmithKline's Advair (US)/Seretide (UK) Diskus incorporating Pfizer's proprietary dry powder inhaler delivery platform;[55] Mylan launched the product in the UK in 2015[56] and in February 2016 the FDA accepted its ANDA, putting it in line behind Hikma and Sandoz to launch a generic version in the US.[57]
In 2012, Mylan launched a program called EpiPen4Schools to sell EpiPens in bulk and with discounts to schools; to participate in the program schools had to agree not to buy epinephrine autoinjectors from any other company for a year.[58]
In December 2012, the National Association of State Boards of Education launched a policy initiative designed to "help state boards of education as they develop student health policies regarding anaphylaxis and epinephrine auto-injector access and use," and advocated for state laws protecting school from legal liability for stocking and using epinephrine autoinjectors. Gayle Manchin, the mother of Mylan's CEO, Heather Bresch, had become president of the association in 2010, and shortly after had discussed donations from her "daughter's company" to the association. Manchin had been appointed to the West Virginia state school board by her husband, then-governor of the state Joe Manchin, in 2007.[59]
In 2013 Mylan acquired an Indian generic injectable drugs company, Agila Specialties Private, for $1.6 billion in cash.[60] In 2015 three plants acquired in that deal were issued warning letters by the FDA.[61]
After successful lobbying from Mylan,[48] in 2013, the "School Access to Emergency Epinephrine Act" became law after passing Congress with broad and bipartisan support; it protected anyone from liability if they administered epinephrine to a child in a school (previously, only trained professionals or the affected person were allowed to administer the drug, and were open to liability), and it provided some financial incentives for schools that didn’t already stock epinephrine autoinjector to start stocking them.[62] Joe Manchin, the father of Mylan's CEO, was a senator at that time.[59]
In July 2014, Mylan and Abbott Laboratories announced an agreement under which Mylan would buy Abbott's generic drugs business in developed markets for stock valued at about $5.3 billion.[63] Mylan acquired Mumbai-based Famy Care and expand its presence in the market for women's contraceptives at about $750 million.[64]
Starting in 2014, according to a 2017 report in the New York Times, mid-level executives began questioning the rate at which the company had increased and was planning to continue to increase the price of the Epi-Pen, and raising concerns that the price increases were unethical; the Times reported that when these concerns were brought to Robert Coury, the chairman of the board, Coury "replied that he was untroubled. He raised both his middle fingers and explained, using colorful language, that anyone criticizing Mylan, including its employees, ought to go copulate with themselves. Critics in Congress and on Wall Street, he said, should do the same. And regulators at the Food and Drug Administration? They, too, deserved a round of anatomically challenging self-fulfillment."  The Times reported that Bresch provided similarly dismissive responses.[65]
In April 2015, Mylan tried negotiate with the management of Irish pharmaceutical firm Perrigo to acquire the company, and when those negotiations failed Mylan attempted a hostile takeover, offering to buy $26B in shares directly from shareholders; too few shareholders agreed to sell their stock by the deadline set in November 2015 and the effort failed.[66]
Two weeks after Mylan made its first offer for Perrigo, Teva Pharmaceutical offered to buy Mylan for $40B; the combined companies would have been the world's largest generic company and the 9th biggest drug company in the world.[67] In July, Teva dropped its bid for Mylan and instead acquired Allergan's generic drug business for about the same price.[68][69]
In June 2015, Mylan agreed to work with Pulmatrix, a company with a proprietary inhaled drug delivery platform, to co-develop a product to treat for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; the product was PUR0200, a generic drug in a Pulmatrix device.[70]
In February 2016, the company announced it would acquire Meda for $9.9 billion.[71] In May of the same year the company announced it would acquire Renaissance Acquisition Holdings dermatology division for up to $1 billion.[72]
In 2015 Mylan had about $1.5B in sales of EpiPens and those sales accounted for 40% of Mylan's profit.[48] Mylan had maintained about a 90% market share since it had acquired the product, and had continually raised the price of EpiPens starting in 2009: in 2009, the wholesale price of two EpiPens was about $100; by July 2013, the price was about $265; in May 2015, it was around $461; and in May 2016, the price rose again to around $609,[73] around a 500% jump from the price in 2009.[74] In the summer of 2016, as parents prepared to send their children back to school and went to pharmacies to get new EpiPens, people began to express outrage at the cost of the EpiPen and Mylan was widely and harshly criticized.[75][76] The price hikes led to investigations by Congress and states attorneys general; in October 2016 Mylan agreed to pay a $465M fine related to incorrect rebates it paid under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.[77]
In December 2016, the attorneys general of 20 states filed a civil complaint accusing Mylan of a coordinated scheme to artificially maintain high prices for a generic antibiotic and diabetes drug. The complaint alleged price collusion schemes between six pharmaceutical firms including informal gatherings, telephone calls, and text messages.[78]
According to the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Inspector General analysis, the U.S. government may have overpaid "as much as $1.27 billion between 2006 and 2016" to drugmaker Mylan N.V. for the EpiPen emergency allergy treatment. This represents three times the proposed settlement of $465 million announced by Mylan in October 2016. Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee that launched the "probe of EpiPen pricing probe in 2016, released the analysis on May 30, 2017.[79] On the same day, a group of Mylan "investment funds urged shareholders to vote against the re-election of the company's directors after it paid Chairman Robert Coury over $97 million last year."[79]

Criticism[edit]
EpiPen pricing[edit]

See also: Heather Bresch § Business executive
Mylan acquired the right to market and distribute the EpiPen line of epinephrine autoinjector devices from Merck KGaA as part of their 2007 deal;[73] that right had formerly been held by Dey LP, a wholly owned subsidiary of Merck.[80] The devices deliver about $1 worth of drug.[48] At that time annual sales were around $200M.[48] Bresch, the company's CEO, saw an opportunity to increase sales through marketing and advocacy, and the company launched a marketing campaign to increase awareness of the dangers of anaphylaxis for people with severe allergies that made the brand "EpiPen" as identified with its product as "Kleenex" is with facial tissue; the company also successfully lobbied the FDA to broaden the label to include risk of anaphylaxis and in parallel, successfully lobbied Congress to generate legislation making EpiPens available in schools and in public places like defibrillators are, and hired the same people that Medtronic had worked with on defibrillator legislation to do so.[48] Mylan's efforts to gain market dominance were aided when Sanofi's competing product was recalled in November 2015 and further when Teva's generic competitor was rejected by the FDA in March 2016.[81]
By the first half of 2015, Mylan had an 85% market share of such devices in the US[48] and in that year sales reached around $1.5B and accounted for 40% of Mylan's profit.[82] Those profits were also due in part to Mylan's continually raising the price of EpiPens starting in 2009; in 2007 the wholesale price of two EpiPens was about $100, the price was about the same in 2009, by July 2013 the price about $265, in May 2015 it was around $461, and in May 2016 the price rose again to around $609.[73] The last price increase sparked widespread outrage, including criticism from Martin Shkreli, "poster boy for grasping pharma greed," letters from two Senators and initiation of Congressional investigations,[82][83] and Mylan's pricing of the EpiPen was widely referred to as price gouging.[84][85][86] The last price increase coincided with a new line of TV commercials that were described as "shocking" and "no holds barred", depicting an anaphylactic reaction from the point of view of the young woman having it at a party, and ending with the young woman seeing her swollen and hive-covered face in the mirror before she collapses.[87] In response to criticism, Mylan increased financial assistance available for some patients to purchase EpiPens,[88] a gesture that was called a "classic public relations move" by Harvard Medical School professor Aaron Kesselheim.[89] The up to $300 saving cards can only be used by a small number of people who need the drug, and no one on Medicaid. They do nothing about the high price which is still being paid by insurers, who ultimately pass the cost onto consumers.[89]
In September 2016, the New York State Attorney General began an investigation into Mylan's EpiPen4Schools program in New York to determine if the program's contracts violated antitrust law[90] and the West Virginia State Attorney General opened an investigation into whether Mylan had given the state the correct discount under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and subpoenaed the company when it refused to provide the documentation the state requested.[91]
In October 2016 the CEO of Mylan testified to Congress that Pfizer/King charged Mylan about $34.50 for one device.[92] In September 2016, a Silicon Valley engineering consultancy performed a teardown analysis of the EpiPen and estimated the manufacturing and packaging costs at about $10 for a two-pack.[93]
In October 2016, Mylan announced a settlement with the US Department of Justice over rebates paid by Mylan to states under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.[77] Questions had been raised by Congress and others about why EpiPen had been classified as a generic rather a proprietary product in the program since 1997; generic drugs have lower rebates (13%) than proprietary drugs (23%), and price hikes for generic drugs cannot be passed onto states, and a common form of pharmaceutical fraud involves misclassifying proprietary drugs as generic under the program.[94] Under the agreement Mylan agreed to pay a $465 million payment and to a sign a corporate integrity agreement requiring it to perform better in the future;[77] the settlement also resolved cases brought by states related to the rebates.[95] Simultaneously with the settlement Mylan also announced it was being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission related to the drug rebate program.[96]
In June 2017 the New York Times published an article reporting on internal Mylan discussions about price increases on the EpiPen between 2014 and 2016, in which the company chairman expressed disdain for people and agencies who might criticize the company; the reporter wrote: "Those top leaders’ responses are a far cry from the message on Mylan’s website, which says that 'we challenge every member of every team to challenge the status quo,' and that 'we put people and patients first, trusting that profits will follow.'", and also noted that "The firm is a case study in the limits of what consumer and employee activism, as well as government oversight, can achieve." [65][97][98][99]
Execution drugs[edit]
Mylan manufactures rocuronium bromide, which is approved by the state of Alabama for use in executions by lethal injection. European manufacturers refuse to sell drugs which can be used for executions to the United States, except to distributors or users who sign legally binding agreements that the drug will not be used for executions down the delivery chain.[100]
In September 2014, the London-based human rights organization Reprieve told Mylan that they were the only FDA-approved manufacturer of rocuronium bromide without legal controls in place to prevent its use in executions, and there was "a very real risk that Mylan may soon become the go-to provider of execution drugs for states across the country". The German asset manager DJE Kapital (de) divested itself of $70 million in Mylan shares for that reason. Mylan said that their distribution was "legally compliant".[100]

Mylan N.V. is an American global generic and specialty pharmaceuticals company registered in the Netherlands, with principal executive offices in Hatfield, Hertfordshire, UK and global headquarters in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, US.[2] In 2007, Mylan acquired a controlling interest in India-based Matrix Laboratories Limited, a top producer of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) for generic drugs,[3] and the generics business of Germany-based Merck KGaA.[4] Through these acquisitions, Mylan grew from the third-largest generic and pharmaceuticals company in the United States to the second-largest generic and specialty pharmaceuticals company in the world.[5]
In 2016, Mylan's pricing of the EpiPen, an epinephrine autoinjector, became controversial and was widely referred to as "price gouging". As a result, investigations were opened into whether Mylan had misclassified the EpiPen under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, a common form of pharmaceutical fraud. In October 2016, Mylan settled these investigations with the U.S. Department of Justice, agreeing to pay $465 million and enter into a corporate integrity agreement concerning the rebate program. In a report published on June 12, 2017 the Institutional Shareholder Services criticized Mylan for the "outsized compensation" of Mylan's directors. Former CEO Robert Coury received a "$98 million" 2016 "pay package" in spite of the "harm to the company inflicted by the EpiPen controversies" and "steep shareholder losses." The report urged Mylan's shareholders to "oust all of Mylan's existing directors".[6]

Location[edit]
Founded in 1961, the company was first located in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia.[16] The company moved to Morgantown, West Virginia, in 1965, and in 1976 it relocated its corporate headquarters to the Pittsburgh suburb Canonsburg, Pennsylvania. Finally in 2004 it moved to a new office center in nearby Southpointe, a suburban business park located in Cecil Township, where it is still located.[17]
Stock[edit]
On February 23, 1973, Mylan had its initial public offering (IPO),[18] becoming a publicly traded company on the OTC market under the ticker symbol MYLN. In 1976 the stock moved to NASDAQ. Their final stock move was in 1986, when their stock became available for trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol MYL. Currently, the stock is traded on the NASDAQ.
History[edit]
Mylan Pharmaceuticals was founded as a drug distributor in 1961 by Milan Puskar and Don Panoz.[16] In 1966 Mylan began manufacturing penicillin G tablets as well as vitamins and other dietary supplements.[16][19]
Panoz left Mylan in 1969 and Puskar quit the company in 1973, as it grew and experienced financial difficulties; the board hired Roy McKnight as board chairman, who convinced Puskar to return in 1976.[19]
Mylan discontinued operating as a contract manufacturing organization in 1980 and instead chose to market their products under their own "Mylan-labeled" brand.[citation needed]
With the passage of the Hatch-Waxman Act in 1984, Mylan and other small generic companies gained value; in the eighteen months following passage of the law Mylan's earnings grew 166% to $12.5 million and its stock value rose 800%.[20]
In the 1980s one of the most prescribed drugs in the US was Dyazide, a diuretic that was a combination drug containing triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide; it had been on the market since 1965 and its patents had expired in 1980.[21] Complications arose with the introductions of generics versions, because the formulation of Dyazide resulted in variable batches that made it impossible for generic manufacturers to show that their versions were bioequivalent.[22][23]
Some generic companies committed fraud trying to bring a generic version of Dyazide. Bolar Pharmaceutical had the first generic version approved in 1987,[21] but it turned out that Bolar had fraudulently substituted Dyazide for its own version to conduct studies that were submitted to the FDA by 1989 the FDA rescinded its approval based on its suspicions and filed criminal charges against Bolar, to which Bolar eventually pled guilty in 1991.[24][25][26]
Mylan chose to develop a new version of a triamterene/hydrochlorothiazide combination drug instead of going the generic route; it developed a different, more stable formulation[23] and used different dosages of each active ingredient (50 mg hydrochlorothiazide and 75 mg triamterene, compared with Dyazide's 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide and 50 mg triamterene).[27] This drug had to get approval as a new drug, as opposed to a generic; their product was called Maxzide and was approved in 1984.[27][28] The higher dose allowed once per day dosing, which Mylan and its marketing partner, Lederle, believed would help it compete against Dyazide, which had $210M in sales in 1983.[27] However, Mylan's patents on the drug were declared invalid in court, and its marketing exclusivity expired in 1987, prompting a rush of generic competition[29]
Mylan had concerns about the practices of its competitors and the FDA in general, and also with regard to companies seeking to bring generic versions of Maxzide. Mylan hired private investigators to examine its competitors' practices, and when it found evidence of corruption, it submitted it to the House Oversight and Investigations Committee, which investigated and found fraud and corruption within the Food and Drug Administration's generic drugs division and at other generic companies.[19] Two of the companies that had gotten approval to market generic versions of Maxzide, Vitarine Pharmaceutical and Par Pharmaceutical, were targets of Mylan's initial investigation and were found to have used Mylan's Maxzide to obtain their bioequivalence data, leading both companies to withdraw its generic competitor to Mylan's product.[19][30]
The corruption in the nascent generics industry and at the office in the FDA regulating it was widely covered in the media, and led to widespread concern among doctors and the public in the late 1980s and early 1990s that generic drugs were not really the same as the branded drugs they were meant to replace.[24][31][22]
In 1987 Mylan agreed to enter into a joint venture with Bolar to buy Somerset Pharmaceuticals; Mylan wanted access to Somersets' drug discovery capabilities as well as its new drug for Parkinson's, selegiline; the deal was completed in 1988 but its consummation was dependent on FDA approval of selegiline, which came in 1989.[19][32][33]
Mylan acquired Bertek Inc. in 1993 for its transdermal patch technologies, and kept as a subsidiary; in 1999 Mylan renamed the company Mylan Technologies Inc. (MTI).[34] MTI eventually came to be the contract manufacturer for the selegiline transdermal patch and was the first company to market generic nitroglycerin, estradiol, clonidine, and fentanyl transdermal patches.[34] Mylan acquired UDL Laboratories, a supplier of unit dose generic medications to institutional and long-term care facilities in 1996.[35]
In 1998 when it was the world's second largest generics company, Mylan came under investigation from the Federal Trade Commission after it raised the prices of its products, tripling them in the case of lorazepam; Mylan had entered into an exclusive agreement with Profarmica, an Italian company that supplied drug ingredients, after which Mylan's competitors had higher prices and a diminished supply of raw ingredients for lorazepam and other drugs.[36] Before the round of price increases the price of generic drugs had been 5 - 10% of the price of branded drugs and afterwards it was around 50%.[36] The FTC filed suit at the end of 1998 and 32 states filed parallel actions; the case was settled in 2000, with Mylan paying a total of $147M -- $100M in disgorged profits into a fund to reimburse consumers and state agencies that had overpaid, $8 million in attorney's fees to the State Attorneys General, $35 million, plus $4 million in attorney's fees, to settle certain class actions with insurers and managed care organizations -- and Mylan and three ingredient suppliers (Cambrex Corporation, Profarmaco S.R.L., and Gyma Laboratories) also agreed to an injunction barring them from entering into similar anticompetitive agreements in the future.[37][38]
In 2004 Mylan and King Pharmaceuticals began discussing a deal in which Mylan would acquire King for about $4B; Mylan wanted to expand its presence in branded pharmaceuticals and to acquire King's sales force.[39] The deal became one of the business soap operas of the year, and included an SEC investigation into King's accounting and Carl Icahn obtaining a 9.8% interest in Mylan and becoming its largest stakeholder in order to kill the deal; the parties called off the deal in February 2005.[39] Icahn offered to buy Mylan for $5.4B[40] and ran a slate of board members to change the direction of Mylan; he won three seats in May 2005.[41] In June Mylan bought back 25% of its shares in order to fend off Icahn;[42] and in July Icahn gave up his bid and sold his shares.[43]
In August 2006 Mylan announced that it had reached agreement to buy a controlling interest in Matrix Laboratories, an Indian supplier of active pharmaceutical ingredients; the deal gave Mylan access to markets in India and China and was completed in January the next year.[44][45]
In May 2007 Mylan and Merck KGaA agreed that Mylan would acquire Merck's generics arm for $6.6B; the deal was completed that October and tripled the size of Mylan.[46][47] Mylan acquired the rights to market the EpiPen in the transaction; at that time annual sales were around $200 million[48] and the EpiPen had about 90% of the market.[49]
In 2009, the company filed two lawsuits against the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette after the newspaper ran an article that was critical of the quality control procedures used at the company's Morgantown plant.[50][51] The company had earlier quality control issues involving the FDA.[52] The lawsuits were dropped in 2012 without any damages paid by the Post-Gazette, which stated "The Post-Gazette did not find and did not intend to report that Mylan had manufactured or distributed any defective drugs. The Post-Gazette regrets if any reader of the article thought otherwise."[53]
Also in 2009, Mylan and its subsidiary UDL agreed to pay a $118M to settle a suit filed under the False Claims Act in which Mylan/UDL and two other companies were accused of underpaying states under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. The program requires drug companies to give rebates to states under Medicaid and the rebates are higher for new drugs than for generics; the suit said that the companies sold new drugs but paid rebates as if they were generics.[54]
In 2011, Mylan entered into an agreement with Pfizer for the exclusive worldwide rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize Pfizer's generic equivalent to GlaxoSmithKline's Advair (US)/Seretide (UK) Diskus incorporating Pfizer's proprietary dry powder inhaler delivery platform;[55] Mylan launched the product in the UK in 2015[56] and in February 2016 the FDA accepted its ANDA, putting it in line behind Hikma and Sandoz to launch a generic version in the US.[57]
In 2012, Mylan launched a program called EpiPen4Schools to sell EpiPens in bulk and with discounts to schools; to participate in the program schools had to agree not to buy epinephrine autoinjectors from any other company for a year.[58]
In December 2012, the National Association of State Boards of Education launched a policy initiative designed to "help state boards of education as they develop student health policies regarding anaphylaxis and epinephrine auto-injector access and use," and advocated for state laws protecting school from legal liability for stocking and using epinephrine autoinjectors. Gayle Manchin, the mother of Mylan's CEO, Heather Bresch, had become president of the association in 2010, and shortly after had discussed donations from her "daughter's company" to the association. Manchin had been appointed to the West Virginia state school board by her husband, then-governor of the state Joe Manchin, in 2007.[59]
In 2013 Mylan acquired an Indian generic injectable drugs company, Agila Specialties Private, for $1.6 billion in cash.[60] In 2015 three plants acquired in that deal were issued warning letters by the FDA.[61]
After successful lobbying from Mylan,[48] in 2013, the "School Access to Emergency Epinephrine Act" became law after passing Congress with broad and bipartisan support; it protected anyone from liability if they administered epinephrine to a child in a school (previously, only trained professionals or the affected person were allowed to administer the drug, and were open to liability), and it provided some financial incentives for schools that didn’t already stock epinephrine autoinjector to start stocking them.[62] Joe Manchin, the father of Mylan's CEO, was a senator at that time.[59]
In July 2014, Mylan and Abbott Laboratories announced an agreement under which Mylan would buy Abbott's generic drugs business in developed markets for stock valued at about $5.3 billion.[63] Mylan acquired Mumbai-based Famy Care and expand its presence in the market for women's contraceptives at about $750 million.[64]
Starting in 2014, according to a 2017 report in the New York Times, mid-level executives began questioning the rate at which the company had increased and was planning to continue to increase the price of the Epi-Pen, and raising concerns that the price increases were unethical; the Times reported that when these concerns were brought to Robert Coury, the chairman of the board, Coury "replied that he was untroubled. He raised both his middle fingers and explained, using colorful language, that anyone criticizing Mylan, including its employees, ought to go copulate with themselves. Critics in Congress and on Wall Street, he said, should do the same. And regulators at the Food and Drug Administration? They, too, deserved a round of anatomically challenging self-fulfillment."  The Times reported that Bresch provided similarly dismissive responses.[65]
In April 2015, Mylan tried negotiate with the management of Irish pharmaceutical firm Perrigo to acquire the company, and when those negotiations failed Mylan attempted a hostile takeover, offering to buy $26B in shares directly from shareholders; too few shareholders agreed to sell their stock by the deadline set in November 2015 and the effort failed.[66]
Two weeks after Mylan made its first offer for Perrigo, Teva Pharmaceutical offered to buy Mylan for $40B; the combined companies would have been the world's largest generic company and the 9th biggest drug company in the world.[67] In July, Teva dropped its bid for Mylan and instead acquired Allergan's generic drug business for about the same price.[68][69]
In June 2015, Mylan agreed to work with Pulmatrix, a company with a proprietary inhaled drug delivery platform, to co-develop a product to treat for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; the product was PUR0200, a generic drug in a Pulmatrix device.[70]
In February 2016, the company announced it would acquire Meda for $9.9 billion.[71] In May of the same year the company announced it would acquire Renaissance Acquisition Holdings dermatology division for up to $1 billion.[72]
In 2015 Mylan had about $1.5B in sales of EpiPens and those sales accounted for 40% of Mylan's profit.[48] Mylan had maintained about a 90% market share since it had acquired the product, and had continually raised the price of EpiPens starting in 2009: in 2009, the wholesale price of two EpiPens was about $100; by July 2013, the price was about $265; in May 2015, it was around $461; and in May 2016, the price rose again to around $609,[73] around a 500% jump from the price in 2009.[74] In the summer of 2016, as parents prepared to send their children back to school and went to pharmacies to get new EpiPens, people began to express outrage at the cost of the EpiPen and Mylan was widely and harshly criticized.[75][76] The price hikes led to investigations by Congress and states attorneys general; in October 2016 Mylan agreed to pay a $465M fine related to incorrect rebates it paid under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.[77]
In December 2016, the attorneys general of 20 states filed a civil complaint accusing Mylan of a coordinated scheme to artificially maintain high prices for a generic antibiotic and diabetes drug. The complaint alleged price collusion schemes between six pharmaceutical firms including informal gatherings, telephone calls, and text messages.[78]
According to the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Inspector General analysis, the U.S. government may have overpaid "as much as $1.27 billion between 2006 and 2016" to drugmaker Mylan N.V. for the EpiPen emergency allergy treatment. This represents three times the proposed settlement of $465 million announced by Mylan in October 2016. Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee that launched the "probe of EpiPen pricing probe in 2016, released the analysis on May 30, 2017.[79] On the same day, a group of Mylan "investment funds urged shareholders to vote against the re-election of the company's directors after it paid Chairman Robert Coury over $97 million last year."[79]

EpiPen pricing[edit]

See also: Heather Bresch § Business executive
Mylan acquired the right to market and distribute the EpiPen line of epinephrine autoinjector devices from Merck KGaA as part of their 2007 deal;[73] that right had formerly been held by Dey LP, a wholly owned subsidiary of Merck.[80] The devices deliver about $1 worth of drug.[48] At that time annual sales were around $200M.[48] Bresch, the company's CEO, saw an opportunity to increase sales through marketing and advocacy, and the company launched a marketing campaign to increase awareness of the dangers of anaphylaxis for people with severe allergies that made the brand "EpiPen" as identified with its product as "Kleenex" is with facial tissue; the company also successfully lobbied the FDA to broaden the label to include risk of anaphylaxis and in parallel, successfully lobbied Congress to generate legislation making EpiPens available in schools and in public places like defibrillators are, and hired the same people that Medtronic had worked with on defibrillator legislation to do so.[48] Mylan's efforts to gain market dominance were aided when Sanofi's competing product was recalled in November 2015 and further when Teva's generic competitor was rejected by the FDA in March 2016.[81]
By the first half of 2015, Mylan had an 85% market share of such devices in the US[48] and in that year sales reached around $1.5B and accounted for 40% of Mylan's profit.[82] Those profits were also due in part to Mylan's continually raising the price of EpiPens starting in 2009; in 2007 the wholesale price of two EpiPens was about $100, the price was about the same in 2009, by July 2013 the price about $265, in May 2015 it was around $461, and in May 2016 the price rose again to around $609.[73] The last price increase sparked widespread outrage, including criticism from Martin Shkreli, "poster boy for grasping pharma greed," letters from two Senators and initiation of Congressional investigations,[82][83] and Mylan's pricing of the EpiPen was widely referred to as price gouging.[84][85][86] The last price increase coincided with a new line of TV commercials that were described as "shocking" and "no holds barred", depicting an anaphylactic reaction from the point of view of the young woman having it at a party, and ending with the young woman seeing her swollen and hive-covered face in the mirror before she collapses.[87] In response to criticism, Mylan increased financial assistance available for some patients to purchase EpiPens,[88] a gesture that was called a "classic public relations move" by Harvard Medical School professor Aaron Kesselheim.[89] The up to $300 saving cards can only be used by a small number of people who need the drug, and no one on Medicaid. They do nothing about the high price which is still being paid by insurers, who ultimately pass the cost onto consumers.[89]
In September 2016, the New York State Attorney General began an investigation into Mylan's EpiPen4Schools program in New York to determine if the program's contracts violated antitrust law[90] and the West Virginia State Attorney General opened an investigation into whether Mylan had given the state the correct discount under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and subpoenaed the company when it refused to provide the documentation the state requested.[91]
In October 2016 the CEO of Mylan testified to Congress that Pfizer/King charged Mylan about $34.50 for one device.[92] In September 2016, a Silicon Valley engineering consultancy performed a teardown analysis of the EpiPen and estimated the manufacturing and packaging costs at about $10 for a two-pack.[93]
In October 2016, Mylan announced a settlement with the US Department of Justice over rebates paid by Mylan to states under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.[77] Questions had been raised by Congress and others about why EpiPen had been classified as a generic rather a proprietary product in the program since 1997; generic drugs have lower rebates (13%) than proprietary drugs (23%), and price hikes for generic drugs cannot be passed onto states, and a common form of pharmaceutical fraud involves misclassifying proprietary drugs as generic under the program.[94] Under the agreement Mylan agreed to pay a $465 million payment and to a sign a corporate integrity agreement requiring it to perform better in the future;[77] the settlement also resolved cases brought by states related to the rebates.[95] Simultaneously with the settlement Mylan also announced it was being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission related to the drug rebate program.[96]
In June 2017 the New York Times published an article reporting on internal Mylan discussions about price increases on the EpiPen between 2014 and 2016, in which the company chairman expressed disdain for people and agencies who might criticize the company; the reporter wrote: "Those top leaders’ responses are a far cry from the message on Mylan’s website, which says that 'we challenge every member of every team to challenge the status quo,' and that 'we put people and patients first, trusting that profits will follow.'", and also noted that "The firm is a case study in the limits of what consumer and employee activism, as well as government oversight, can achieve." [65][97][98][99]
Execution drugs[edit]
Mylan manufactures rocuronium bromide, which is approved by the state of Alabama for use in executions by lethal injection. European manufacturers refuse to sell drugs which can be used for executions to the United States, except to distributors or users who sign legally binding agreements that the drug will not be used for executions down the delivery chain.[100]
In September 2014, the London-based human rights organization Reprieve told Mylan that they were the only FDA-approved manufacturer of rocuronium bromide without legal controls in place to prevent its use in executions, and there was "a very real risk that Mylan may soon become the go-to provider of execution drugs for states across the country". The German asset manager DJE Kapital (de) divested itself of $70 million in Mylan shares for that reason. Mylan said that their distribution was "legally compliant".[100]

Mylan N.V. is an American global generic and specialty pharmaceuticals company registered in the Netherlands, with principal executive offices in Hatfield, Hertfordshire, UK and global headquarters in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, US.[2] In 2007, Mylan acquired a controlling interest in India-based Matrix Laboratories Limited, a top producer of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) for generic drugs,[3] and the generics business of Germany-based Merck KGaA.[4] Through these acquisitions, Mylan grew from the third-largest generic and pharmaceuticals company in the United States to the second-largest generic and specialty pharmaceuticals company in the world.[5]
In 2016, Mylan's pricing of the EpiPen, an epinephrine autoinjector, became controversial and was widely referred to as "price gouging". As a result, investigations were opened into whether Mylan had misclassified the EpiPen under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, a common form of pharmaceutical fraud. In October 2016, Mylan settled these investigations with the U.S. Department of Justice, agreeing to pay $465 million and enter into a corporate integrity agreement concerning the rebate program. In a report published on June 12, 2017 the Institutional Shareholder Services criticized Mylan for the "outsized compensation" of Mylan's directors. Former CEO Robert Coury received a "$98 million" 2016 "pay package" in spite of the "harm to the company inflicted by the EpiPen controversies" and "steep shareholder losses." The report urged Mylan's shareholders to "oust all of Mylan's existing directors".[6]

Location[edit]
Founded in 1961, the company was first located in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia.[16] The company moved to Morgantown, West Virginia, in 1965, and in 1976 it relocated its corporate headquarters to the Pittsburgh suburb Canonsburg, Pennsylvania. Finally in 2004 it moved to a new office center in nearby Southpointe, a suburban business park located in Cecil Township, where it is still located.[17]
Stock[edit]
On February 23, 1973, Mylan had its initial public offering (IPO),[18] becoming a publicly traded company on the OTC market under the ticker symbol MYLN. In 1976 the stock moved to NASDAQ. Their final stock move was in 1986, when their stock became available for trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol MYL. Currently, the stock is traded on the NASDAQ.
History[edit]
Mylan Pharmaceuticals was founded as a drug distributor in 1961 by Milan Puskar and Don Panoz.[16] In 1966 Mylan began manufacturing penicillin G tablets as well as vitamins and other dietary supplements.[16][19]
Panoz left Mylan in 1969 and Puskar quit the company in 1973, as it grew and experienced financial difficulties; the board hired Roy McKnight as board chairman, who convinced Puskar to return in 1976.[19]
Mylan discontinued operating as a contract manufacturing organization in 1980 and instead chose to market their products under their own "Mylan-labeled" brand.[citation needed]
With the passage of the Hatch-Waxman Act in 1984, Mylan and other small generic companies gained value; in the eighteen months following passage of the law Mylan's earnings grew 166% to $12.5 million and its stock value rose 800%.[20]
In the 1980s one of the most prescribed drugs in the US was Dyazide, a diuretic that was a combination drug containing triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide; it had been on the market since 1965 and its patents had expired in 1980.[21] Complications arose with the introductions of generics versions, because the formulation of Dyazide resulted in variable batches that made it impossible for generic manufacturers to show that their versions were bioequivalent.[22][23]
Some generic companies committed fraud trying to bring a generic version of Dyazide. Bolar Pharmaceutical had the first generic version approved in 1987,[21] but it turned out that Bolar had fraudulently substituted Dyazide for its own version to conduct studies that were submitted to the FDA by 1989 the FDA rescinded its approval based on its suspicions and filed criminal charges against Bolar, to which Bolar eventually pled guilty in 1991.[24][25][26]
Mylan chose to develop a new version of a triamterene/hydrochlorothiazide combination drug instead of going the generic route; it developed a different, more stable formulation[23] and used different dosages of each active ingredient (50 mg hydrochlorothiazide and 75 mg triamterene, compared with Dyazide's 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide and 50 mg triamterene).[27] This drug had to get approval as a new drug, as opposed to a generic; their product was called Maxzide and was approved in 1984.[27][28] The higher dose allowed once per day dosing, which Mylan and its marketing partner, Lederle, believed would help it compete against Dyazide, which had $210M in sales in 1983.[27] However, Mylan's patents on the drug were declared invalid in court, and its marketing exclusivity expired in 1987, prompting a rush of generic competition[29]
Mylan had concerns about the practices of its competitors and the FDA in general, and also with regard to companies seeking to bring generic versions of Maxzide. Mylan hired private investigators to examine its competitors' practices, and when it found evidence of corruption, it submitted it to the House Oversight and Investigations Committee, which investigated and found fraud and corruption within the Food and Drug Administration's generic drugs division and at other generic companies.[19] Two of the companies that had gotten approval to market generic versions of Maxzide, Vitarine Pharmaceutical and Par Pharmaceutical, were targets of Mylan's initial investigation and were found to have used Mylan's Maxzide to obtain their bioequivalence data, leading both companies to withdraw its generic competitor to Mylan's product.[19][30]
The corruption in the nascent generics industry and at the office in the FDA regulating it was widely covered in the media, and led to widespread concern among doctors and the public in the late 1980s and early 1990s that generic drugs were not really the same as the branded drugs they were meant to replace.[24][31][22]
In 1987 Mylan agreed to enter into a joint venture with Bolar to buy Somerset Pharmaceuticals; Mylan wanted access to Somersets' drug discovery capabilities as well as its new drug for Parkinson's, selegiline; the deal was completed in 1988 but its consummation was dependent on FDA approval of selegiline, which came in 1989.[19][32][33]
Mylan acquired Bertek Inc. in 1993 for its transdermal patch technologies, and kept as a subsidiary; in 1999 Mylan renamed the company Mylan Technologies Inc. (MTI).[34] MTI eventually came to be the contract manufacturer for the selegiline transdermal patch and was the first company to market generic nitroglycerin, estradiol, clonidine, and fentanyl transdermal patches.[34] Mylan acquired UDL Laboratories, a supplier of unit dose generic medications to institutional and long-term care facilities in 1996.[35]
In 1998 when it was the world's second largest generics company, Mylan came under investigation from the Federal Trade Commission after it raised the prices of its products, tripling them in the case of lorazepam; Mylan had entered into an exclusive agreement with Profarmica, an Italian company that supplied drug ingredients, after which Mylan's competitors had higher prices and a diminished supply of raw ingredients for lorazepam and other drugs.[36] Before the round of price increases the price of generic drugs had been 5 - 10% of the price of branded drugs and afterwards it was around 50%.[36] The FTC filed suit at the end of 1998 and 32 states filed parallel actions; the case was settled in 2000, with Mylan paying a total of $147M -- $100M in disgorged profits into a fund to reimburse consumers and state agencies that had overpaid, $8 million in attorney's fees to the State Attorneys General, $35 million, plus $4 million in attorney's fees, to settle certain class actions with insurers and managed care organizations -- and Mylan and three ingredient suppliers (Cambrex Corporation, Profarmaco S.R.L., and Gyma Laboratories) also agreed to an injunction barring them from entering into similar anticompetitive agreements in the future.[37][38]
In 2004 Mylan and King Pharmaceuticals began discussing a deal in which Mylan would acquire King for about $4B; Mylan wanted to expand its presence in branded pharmaceuticals and to acquire King's sales force.[39] The deal became one of the business soap operas of the year, and included an SEC investigation into King's accounting and Carl Icahn obtaining a 9.8% interest in Mylan and becoming its largest stakeholder in order to kill the deal; the parties called off the deal in February 2005.[39] Icahn offered to buy Mylan for $5.4B[40] and ran a slate of board members to change the direction of Mylan; he won three seats in May 2005.[41] In June Mylan bought back 25% of its shares in order to fend off Icahn;[42] and in July Icahn gave up his bid and sold his shares.[43]
In August 2006 Mylan announced that it had reached agreement to buy a controlling interest in Matrix Laboratories, an Indian supplier of active pharmaceutical ingredients; the deal gave Mylan access to markets in India and China and was completed in January the next year.[44][45]
In May 2007 Mylan and Merck KGaA agreed that Mylan would acquire Merck's generics arm for $6.6B; the deal was completed that October and tripled the size of Mylan.[46][47] Mylan acquired the rights to market the EpiPen in the transaction; at that time annual sales were around $200 million[48] and the EpiPen had about 90% of the market.[49]
In 2009, the company filed two lawsuits against the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette after the newspaper ran an article that was critical of the quality control procedures used at the company's Morgantown plant.[50][51] The company had earlier quality control issues involving the FDA.[52] The lawsuits were dropped in 2012 without any damages paid by the Post-Gazette, which stated "The Post-Gazette did not find and did not intend to report that Mylan had manufactured or distributed any defective drugs. The Post-Gazette regrets if any reader of the article thought otherwise."[53]
Also in 2009, Mylan and its subsidiary UDL agreed to pay a $118M to settle a suit filed under the False Claims Act in which Mylan/UDL and two other companies were accused of underpaying states under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. The program requires drug companies to give rebates to states under Medicaid and the rebates are higher for new drugs than for generics; the suit said that the companies sold new drugs but paid rebates as if they were generics.[54]
In 2011, Mylan entered into an agreement with Pfizer for the exclusive worldwide rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize Pfizer's generic equivalent to GlaxoSmithKline's Advair (US)/Seretide (UK) Diskus incorporating Pfizer's proprietary dry powder inhaler delivery platform;[55] Mylan launched the product in the UK in 2015[56] and in February 2016 the FDA accepted its ANDA, putting it in line behind Hikma and Sandoz to launch a generic version in the US.[57]
In 2012, Mylan launched a program called EpiPen4Schools to sell EpiPens in bulk and with discounts to schools; to participate in the program schools had to agree not to buy epinephrine autoinjectors from any other company for a year.[58]
In December 2012, the National Association of State Boards of Education launched a policy initiative designed to "help state boards of education as they develop student health policies regarding anaphylaxis and epinephrine auto-injector access and use," and advocated for state laws protecting school from legal liability for stocking and using epinephrine autoinjectors. Gayle Manchin, the mother of Mylan's CEO, Heather Bresch, had become president of the association in 2010, and shortly after had discussed donations from her "daughter's company" to the association. Manchin had been appointed to the West Virginia state school board by her husband, then-governor of the state Joe Manchin, in 2007.[59]
In 2013 Mylan acquired an Indian generic injectable drugs company, Agila Specialties Private, for $1.6 billion in cash.[60] In 2015 three plants acquired in that deal were issued warning letters by the FDA.[61]
After successful lobbying from Mylan,[48] in 2013, the "School Access to Emergency Epinephrine Act" became law after passing Congress with broad and bipartisan support; it protected anyone from liability if they administered epinephrine to a child in a school (previously, only trained professionals or the affected person were allowed to administer the drug, and were open to liability), and it provided some financial incentives for schools that didn’t already stock epinephrine autoinjector to start stocking them.[62] Joe Manchin, the father of Mylan's CEO, was a senator at that time.[59]
In July 2014, Mylan and Abbott Laboratories announced an agreement under which Mylan would buy Abbott's generic drugs business in developed markets for stock valued at about $5.3 billion.[63] Mylan acquired Mumbai-based Famy Care and expand its presence in the market for women's contraceptives at about $750 million.[64]
Starting in 2014, according to a 2017 report in the New York Times, mid-level executives began questioning the rate at which the company had increased and was planning to continue to increase the price of the Epi-Pen, and raising concerns that the price increases were unethical; the Times reported that when these concerns were brought to Robert Coury, the chairman of the board, Coury "replied that he was untroubled. He raised both his middle fingers and explained, using colorful language, that anyone criticizing Mylan, including its employees, ought to go copulate with themselves. Critics in Congress and on Wall Street, he said, should do the same. And regulators at the Food and Drug Administration? They, too, deserved a round of anatomically challenging self-fulfillment."  The Times reported that Bresch provided similarly dismissive responses.[65]
In April 2015, Mylan tried negotiate with the management of Irish pharmaceutical firm Perrigo to acquire the company, and when those negotiations failed Mylan attempted a hostile takeover, offering to buy $26B in shares directly from shareholders; too few shareholders agreed to sell their stock by the deadline set in November 2015 and the effort failed.[66]
Two weeks after Mylan made its first offer for Perrigo, Teva Pharmaceutical offered to buy Mylan for $40B; the combined companies would have been the world's largest generic company and the 9th biggest drug company in the world.[67] In July, Teva dropped its bid for Mylan and instead acquired Allergan's generic drug business for about the same price.[68][69]
In June 2015, Mylan agreed to work with Pulmatrix, a company with a proprietary inhaled drug delivery platform, to co-develop a product to treat for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; the product was PUR0200, a generic drug in a Pulmatrix device.[70]
In February 2016, the company announced it would acquire Meda for $9.9 billion.[71] In May of the same year the company announced it would acquire Renaissance Acquisition Holdings dermatology division for up to $1 billion.[72]
In 2015 Mylan had about $1.5B in sales of EpiPens and those sales accounted for 40% of Mylan's profit.[48] Mylan had maintained about a 90% market share since it had acquired the product, and had continually raised the price of EpiPens starting in 2009: in 2009, the wholesale price of two EpiPens was about $100; by July 2013, the price was about $265; in May 2015, it was around $461; and in May 2016, the price rose again to around $609,[73] around a 500% jump from the price in 2009.[74] In the summer of 2016, as parents prepared to send their children back to school and went to pharmacies to get new EpiPens, people began to express outrage at the cost of the EpiPen and Mylan was widely and harshly criticized.[75][76] The price hikes led to investigations by Congress and states attorneys general; in October 2016 Mylan agreed to pay a $465M fine related to incorrect rebates it paid under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.[77]
In December 2016, the attorneys general of 20 states filed a civil complaint accusing Mylan of a coordinated scheme to artificially maintain high prices for a generic antibiotic and diabetes drug. The complaint alleged price collusion schemes between six pharmaceutical firms including informal gatherings, telephone calls, and text messages.[78]
According to the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Inspector General analysis, the U.S. government may have overpaid "as much as $1.27 billion between 2006 and 2016" to drugmaker Mylan N.V. for the EpiPen emergency allergy treatment. This represents three times the proposed settlement of $465 million announced by Mylan in October 2016. Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee that launched the "probe of EpiPen pricing probe in 2016, released the analysis on May 30, 2017.[79] On the same day, a group of Mylan "investment funds urged shareholders to vote against the re-election of the company's directors after it paid Chairman Robert Coury over $97 million last year."[79]

EpiPen pricing[edit]

Mylan acquired the right to market and distribute the EpiPen line of epinephrine autoinjector devices from Merck KGaA as part of their 2007 deal;[73] that right had formerly been held by Dey LP, a wholly owned subsidiary of Merck.[80] The devices deliver about $1 worth of drug.[48] At that time annual sales were around $200M.[48] Bresch, the company's CEO, saw an opportunity to increase sales through marketing and advocacy, and the company launched a marketing campaign to increase awareness of the dangers of anaphylaxis for people with severe allergies that made the brand "EpiPen" as identified with its product as "Kleenex" is with facial tissue; the company also successfully lobbied the FDA to broaden the label to include risk of anaphylaxis and in parallel, successfully lobbied Congress to generate legislation making EpiPens available in schools and in public places like defibrillators are, and hired the same people that Medtronic had worked with on defibrillator legislation to do so.[48] Mylan's efforts to gain market dominance were aided when Sanofi's competing product was recalled in November 2015 and further when Teva's generic competitor was rejected by the FDA in March 2016.[81]
By the first half of 2015, Mylan had an 85% market share of such devices in the US[48] and in that year sales reached around $1.5B and accounted for 40% of Mylan's profit.[82] Those profits were also due in part to Mylan's continually raising the price of EpiPens starting in 2009; in 2007 the wholesale price of two EpiPens was about $100, the price was about the same in 2009, by July 2013 the price about $265, in May 2015 it was around $461, and in May 2016 the price rose again to around $609.[73] The last price increase sparked widespread outrage, including criticism from Martin Shkreli, "poster boy for grasping pharma greed," letters from two Senators and initiation of Congressional investigations,[82][83] and Mylan's pricing of the EpiPen was widely referred to as price gouging.[84][85][86] The last price increase coincided with a new line of TV commercials that were described as "shocking" and "no holds barred", depicting an anaphylactic reaction from the point of view of the young woman having it at a party, and ending with the young woman seeing her swollen and hive-covered face in the mirror before she collapses.[87] In response to criticism, Mylan increased financial assistance available for some patients to purchase EpiPens,[88] a gesture that was called a "classic public relations move" by Harvard Medical School professor Aaron Kesselheim.[89] The up to $300 saving cards can only be used by a small number of people who need the drug, and no one on Medicaid. They do nothing about the high price which is still being paid by insurers, who ultimately pass the cost onto consumers.[89]
In September 2016, the New York State Attorney General began an investigation into Mylan's EpiPen4Schools program in New York to determine if the program's contracts violated antitrust law[90] and the West Virginia State Attorney General opened an investigation into whether Mylan had given the state the correct discount under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and subpoenaed the company when it refused to provide the documentation the state requested.[91]
In October 2016 the CEO of Mylan testified to Congress that Pfizer/King charged Mylan about $34.50 for one device.[92] In September 2016, a Silicon Valley engineering consultancy performed a teardown analysis of the EpiPen and estimated the manufacturing and packaging costs at about $10 for a two-pack.[93]
In October 2016, Mylan announced a settlement with the US Department of Justice over rebates paid by Mylan to states under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.[77] Questions had been raised by Congress and others about why EpiPen had been classified as a generic rather a proprietary product in the program since 1997; generic drugs have lower rebates (13%) than proprietary drugs (23%), and price hikes for generic drugs cannot be passed onto states, and a common form of pharmaceutical fraud involves misclassifying proprietary drugs as generic under the program.[94] Under the agreement Mylan agreed to pay a $465 million payment and to a sign a corporate integrity agreement requiring it to perform better in the future;[77] the settlement also resolved cases brought by states related to the rebates.[95] Simultaneously with the settlement Mylan also announced it was being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission related to the drug rebate program.[96]
In June 2017 the New York Times published an article reporting on internal Mylan discussions about price increases on the EpiPen between 2014 and 2016, in which the company chairman expressed disdain for people and agencies who might criticize the company; the reporter wrote: "Those top leaders’ responses are a far cry from the message on Mylan’s website, which says that 'we challenge every member of every team to challenge the status quo,' and that 'we put people and patients first, trusting that profits will follow.'", and also noted that "The firm is a case study in the limits of what consumer and employee activism, as well as government oversight, can achieve." [65][97][98][99]
Execution drugs[edit]
Mylan manufactures rocuronium bromide, which is approved by the state of Alabama for use in executions by lethal injection. European manufacturers refuse to sell drugs which can be used for executions to the United States, except to distributors or users who sign legally binding agreements that the drug will not be used for executions down the delivery chain.[100]
In September 2014, the London-based human rights organization Reprieve told Mylan that they were the only FDA-approved manufacturer of rocuronium bromide without legal controls in place to prevent its use in executions, and there was "a very real risk that Mylan may soon become the go-to provider of execution drugs for states across the country". The German asset manager DJE Kapital (de) divested itself of $70 million in Mylan shares for that reason. Mylan said that their distribution was "legally compliant".[100]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
