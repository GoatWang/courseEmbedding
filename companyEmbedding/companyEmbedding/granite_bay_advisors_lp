Before you hire a financial advisor
Some things to think about when hiring a financial advisor in Granite Bay, CA



When do you need to hire a financial advisor in Granite Bay, CA ?


There are no legal requirements in Granite Bay requiring individuals to use a financial advisor. However, that doesn't mean it isn't a good idea. The decision to hire a financial advisor or not ultimately comes down to three primary criteria: expertise, time and money.


Managing all aspects of your finances is far from simple. Top financial advisors spend years studying and passing exams to become experts at their craft, and while not required, be on the look-out for certain designations like CFP, CFA and ChFC when considering advisors. They let you know that an independent authority has validated the advisor's expertise in the areas covered by the certification.


Managing your finances is time-consuming. You should consider carefully whether this is where you want to spend your free time. If not, Wealthminder can help you easily find a Granite Bay, CA financial advisor to meet your needs.


Hiring a financial advisor is not free. However, a great financial advisor should be able to articulate the value you will receive from their services and should over the long run pay for their fees many times over. Spend some time thinking about the long-term cost of not hiring an advisor instead of only looking at the short-term costs / fees.


How important is licensing for financial advisors in California ?


Financial advisors in Granite Bay, CA are required to register with the SEC, the state or both. Wealthminder's directory only contains advisors who are properly registered as Independent Advisor Representatives (IARs) and this information is updated on a periodic basis.


The rules for becoming an IAR vary by state, but advisors have to pass some combination of the following 3 exams before they can register: Series 63, Series 65 and Series 66.


Never hire an advisor who isn't properly registered with the regulators as they are not legally allowed to provide financial advice.


Wealthminder also keeps track of complaints people register with the regulators and you can find this information on every advisor's page.





You should get several bids before hiring a financial advisor


Before hiring a Granite Bay, CA financial advisor, be sure to get at least 3 detailed proposals. Quality financial advisors will take the time to explain their proposal, detailing both what they will do for you and how you will be charged. Be wary of an abnormally low proposal, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced proposals often come with hidden fees or sub-par advice. Choose an advisor you trust and can clearly communicate with. Wealthminder has made the proposal process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.


Why you should hire an advisor through Wealthminder?


Wealthminder is here to make the process simple and transparent for you. You take a few minutes of your time to describe what you want help with. We then pass your request on to the advisors in our network. If they are interested in your business, they will respond with an initial proposal. You then compare the proposals, ask follow-up questions, hold an initial consultation with the advisors whose proposals you like and ultimately hire the one that best meets your needs.


To participate in the proposal process, advisors must be legal fiduciaries (this means they have to look out for your best interest), agree to submit fee-only proposals (no kick-backs on the investment products they recommend) with the exception of insurance (because insurance can currently only be sold on commission) and have no black-marks with the regulators.


Financial recourse when hiring an advisor in California


California does offer recourse to investors if a relationship with an advisor goes wrong. Each state has a different means for filing a complaint and a simple google search should point you in the right direction.


In addition, you can also file a complaint with the SEC or FINRA.

Highland Capital Management Announces Expense Cap for Highland Small Cap Equity Fund

DALLAS – Highland Capital Management, L.P. (“Highland”), a Dallas-based investment management firm, which together with its affiliates manages approximately $19 billion in assets, announced the company has instituted a 95 basis point expense cap on the Highland Small Cap Equity Fund (HSZAX).
This move represents a 69 basis point savings from the last published gross expense ratio of 1.64 percent. The Highland Small Cap Equity Fund is sub-advised by Palisade Capital Management. It seeks to combine growth, value and core investment management styles and to maximize long term capital appreciation through investments in stocks of smaller companies. The Fund has achieved a four star ranking through Morningstar.¹
“We’re pleased to announce another expense cap further representing Highland’s continued commitment to providing competitive and differentiated strategies at attractive prices,” said Ethan Powell, Highland’s Chief Product Strategist. “We are committed to offering funds that are at or below the average expense ratio of their respective peer groups.”
Highland now has either expense caps or waivers in place in over half (7 out of 13) of its open-ended mutual funds.
About Highland Capital Management
Highland is a global alternatives and credit manager, specializing in credit hedge funds, long‐only funds and separate accounts; distressed and special situations private equity; and collateralized loan obligations (CLOs). Founded in 1993 by Jim Dondero and Mark Okada, Highland also offers alternative investments in healthcare, emerging markets, long/short equities, and natural resources. Highland consists of Highland Capital Management, L.P. and its affiliated advisers including Acis Capital Management, L.P., Falcon E&P Opportunities GP, LLC, Granite Bay Advisors, L.P., Highland Capital Healthcare Advisors, L.P., Highland Capital Management Fund Advisors, L.P., NexPoint Advisors, L.P., PetroCap, LLC and Tunstall Capital Management, L.P. Highland Capital Management, L.P. and its affiliated advisers are each separately registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

As of 7/31/14, the Morningstar ratings for the overall periods of the Class A, A-LW, C and Y Shares were 3, 4, 4 and 4 stars among 642 Small Growth funds, respectively; the ratings for the three  year periods of the Class A, A-LW, C and Y Shares were 4, 4, 4, and 5 stars among 642 Small Growth funds, respectively; the ratings for the five year periods of the Class A, A-LW, C and Y Shares were 3, 4, 4 and 4 stars among 569 Small Growth funds, respectively; and the ratings for the ten year periods of the Class A, A-LW, C and Y Shares were 3, 3, 3 and 4 stars among 377 Small Growth funds, respectively. The ratings are based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure.  The Overall Morningstar Rating for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three, five and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. Past performance is not indicative of future results.  ©2014 by Morningstar, Inc. All rights reserved. The information contained herein is proprietary to Morningstar; may not be copied or redistributed; and is not warranted to be accurate, complete or timely. For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating™ based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund’s monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.  Morningstar calculates a load-waived version of each A share class for U.S.-domiciled funds (”A-LW”). Load-waived ratings better reflect the investor experience for those who purchase shares through retirement plans or who otherwise qualify to have the front load waived.

Before investing in the Fund, you should carefully consider the Fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses.  For a copy of a prospectus or summary prospectus which contains this and other information, please visit our website at highlandfunds.com or call 1-877-665-1287.  Please read the fund prospectus carefully before investing.
