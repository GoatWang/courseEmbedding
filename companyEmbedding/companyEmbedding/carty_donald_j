Biography[edit]
Born in Toronto, Ontario, on July 23, 1946, Carty attended Queen's University and Harvard Business School. He took US citizenship during the 1980s. He worked for Air Canada and the Canadian Pacific Railway before joining American, although he served as CEO for CP Air from 1985 to 1987. At American, he served as controller, and later as executive vice president for finance and planning under CEO Robert Crandall, before becoming CEO of American himself in 1998.
In April 2003, in the long wake of the September 11 attacks and facing an industry beset by terrorism and hard times, Carty and his executive board were forced to strike a cost-cutting deal with American's labor unions, intended to mitigate AMR's upcoming $1 billion first-quarter loss. The deal—the largest corporate restructuring outside of bankruptcy in American history—almost unraveled several days later, when unions learned that AMR executives were keeping $41 million in retention bonuses. Although many other airlines had similar retention bonus arrangements,[2] several AMR board members—most notably University of Oklahoma president David L. Boren—called for Carty's resignation.
Carty stepped down on April 24, 2003. He was replaced as CEO by Gerard Arpey, and as chairman by Edward A. Brennan.
Carty was appointed as Chairman of Virgin America on February 6, 2006.[3] On February 2 of that year, Toronto-based Porter Airlines, in the process of starting up a small regional service out of the downtown Toronto island airport, announced that Carty would simultaneously serve as its chairman.
In 1999, Board Alert named him one of the year’s Outstanding Directors.In 2002, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. In September 2002, Carty was appointed by President Bush to the National Infrastructure Advisory Council where he served until the summer of 2005. He is a recipient of an Honorary Doctor of Law from Queen’s University.

EMC Expands Board of Directors with Appointment of José E. Almeida and Donald J. Carty



Tweet







HOPKINTON, Mass. , January 12, 2015  - 
EMC Corporation (NYSE:EMC) today announced the appointment of José (Joe) E. Almeida and Donald J. Carty to the EMC Board of Directors, effective immediately. With these additions, the EMC Board has been expanded to 13 directors. Mr. Almeida is currently Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Covidien plc. Mr. Carty is the retired Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of AMR Corporation and American Airlines, and retired Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer of Dell, Inc.
Joe Tucci, EMC Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, “Joe Almeida and Don Carty are two highly experienced leaders of major global corporations who will bring added depth and insights to our Board of Directors. We are delighted to welcome both Joe and Don to the Board.”
EMC’s Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee identified Messrs. Almeida and Carty through its process of outreach, including extensive independent search efforts as well as consideration of candidates recommended by shareholders, consistent with the Committee’s past practice. Elliott Management worked collaboratively with EMC to identify and review candidates. After thorough evaluation of candidate qualifications in light of the EMC Board’s criteria, the Committee recommended the appointment of Messrs. Almeida and Carty to the EMC Board.
Jesse Cohn, portfolio manager at Elliott Management, stated, “Both Joe and Don are strong and experienced executives, and we believe they will bring invaluable perspectives to the Board’s ongoing review of EMC’s strategic direction.”
In connection with the EMC Board’s decision to add the two new board members, Elliott has agreed to certain limited standstill and voting provisions through September 2015, including voting in favor of the Company’s proposed slate of directors at EMC’s 2015 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.
Mr. Almeida, 52, has served as Chairman of Covidien plc since 2012 and as President, Chief Executive Officer and a Director since July 2011. He currently serves on the Board of Directors of State Street Corporation. A native of Brazil, Mr. Almeida attended Escola de Engenharia Maua in São Paulo.
Mr. Carty, 68, served as Chairman and CEO of AMR Corporation from 1998 to 2003. He currently serves as Chairman of Virgin America Airlines, Inc. and is a director of Canadian National Railway Company and Talisman Energy Inc. Born in Toronto, Ontario, Mr. Carty attended Queen’s University and Harvard Business School.

Super comfy and very stylish - as the director of an assisted living community I walk 3-4 miles a day .... after 25 years in heels, I'm always looking for cool looking and supportive/comfortable shoes. These fit the bill 100%. Look good with dresses and skirts... and pretty hip with leggings and skinny pants.

Donald J. Carty resigned as American Airlines’ chairman and chief executive officer in April 2003 after less than five years in the job. But he wasn't done with the airline industry.He became involved with several small airlines, among them as an early investor in Virgin America. The California-based carrier, which began flying in 2007, aims to combine the benefits of low costs with the virtues of better-than-average customer service.On Monday, Virgin America moves its operations from Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport to Dallas Love Field. We talked to Carty, Virgin America's chairman, about the reasons for starting the airline, its experiences and why it was smart to switch North Texas airports.DMN: What does Virgin America bring to the market place in terms of customer service?Don Carty: That really was the original premise of this particular airline. At a time for a variety of reasons all our big airlines were struggling with costs and profitability and they all went bankrupt in the end. I don’t think there was as much attention paid to service as had been over the years. In fact, it was sort of a rush to the bottom. ‘We got to get our costs down. We got to get our prices down.’ Service, of course, was what suffered.When we originally conceived of Virgin America, it was with the express intent of trying to take advantage of that. Not the way that other startups had taken advantage of it, which was simply low cost, low price, low service, but using a more effective cost structure to deliver not just a well-priced product, a real value product, but one that had a unique level of service.In fairness, we got a hint of this when JetBlue started their company. To some degree, that was their model as well. They had some product features, particularly TVs in the seatback, a very engaged, energized work force that delivered a level of service that I thought was pretty interesting at the time.In fact, at that time I was still at American. One of the pieces of data I saw when looking at JetBlue’s performance was that in spite of their pricing, their average yield on some routes where they were going head to head with Delta at the time was higher. In other words, Delta had some higher prices but they were having to trash the pricing at the bottom end of the market just to fill the airplane.DMN: That would indicates that JetBlue had customers who weren’t buying simply on price.Carty: Exactly. JetBlue was always competitive in the market place. But they immediately had a following, that the brand was worth something. It wasn’t like some other low-cost carriers where the only aspect of the brand is you could get a cheap seat. This brand clearly had some attributes that people liked. When we were thinking about Virgin America, we obviously were informed by that experience.But we also thought more could be done, that even more creative service offering could be put in place, not necessarily ones that drove inordinate levels of costs because historically a lot of service delivery was around throwing labor at it, and labor is an expensive input for any business. So we thought about technology and planes and design, those kinds of things, as well as making sure as we hired people that we had people who were really customer-centric.The whole premise of the airline was that it was going to be customer-centric. That’s what our focus was going to be. It seems like a no-brainer in a service business, but I think the airline industry had lost sight of it. That’s what really created our opportunity.And what’s interesting, if you look across the industry, most of the low-cost models, the new entrants, have disappeared. You’re left with two in Virgin America and JetBlue who really have tried to stay customer-centric.At the other end of the spectrum, you’ve still got a Spirit that’s gone really, really low cost and really low price. I’m a little worried about the [Spirit] model in the longer run, but you’re exactly right. That’s partly because they’ve been absolutely obsessed with making sure that their costs didn’t get away from them. They’ve been able to deliver a product at a price that allows some people to travel that probably otherwise couldn’t have traveled.The fact is there’s an insatiable demand for travel in this country at some price. What they’ve tried to respond to is exactly that point. They’ve done it with almost an obsessive focus. You have to compliment them.What worries me about the model is so often someone you know that took it and thought it was a great deal comes back and says I’ll never ride it again. That may not be true. The next time they need to go some place, they may absolutely go back and do it again. But I just wonder how sustainable a model that is. So far, so good. They’re enormously profitable. They’re doing a great job of continuing the focus that they established for themselves.But I don’t know. I have no interest personally in being involved with a business that people hate. On the other hand, it’s been pretty rewarding for Spirit. They’ve done a good job for their investors, even though they’ve made their customers unhappy. They’ve done a good job for their investors.This is more fun. The parallels are obvious. Each carrier has pursued their own niche. We are very conscious of what we’re doing in terms of providing a different, better, exciting product. They’re very conscious of what they’re doing, of providing the lowest price in the market.DMN: When did you first get involved with Virgin America?Carty: Very early. I was an original investor.DMN: Planning for Virgin America began in 2005, didn’t it?Carty: Yeah. I became chairman when we kind of formed a board in 2006, just when we were putting the original investors together.It started a little earlier than my involvement because Richard [Virgin Group founder Richard Branson] had this idea that he wanted to have an American carrier and he knew that he’d have to cede control of that carrier to whoever his investors were. But he also didn’t want to hesitate. So he got started with this thing, even made some aircraft commitments even before the other investors were identified and we formed a board and I became the chairman at that time.That’s part of what caused a lot of the anxiety around the Transportation Department in terms of determining this a qualified American carrier because Richard had initiated this without U.S. investors.DMN: And led to original CEO Fred Reid’s ouster at the insistence of DOT officials.Carty: It’s really quite surprising that the DOT chose to do that. But there is not much doubt that Fred Reid was engaged before the U.S. investors were involved. Richard indeed did pick Fred Reid. The point we kept trying to make to DOT is that Richard may have hired him but we were the only people who could fire him.DMN: Virgin America slowed its growth several years ago. To what extent has Virgin America had to adjust its model?Carty: The reality of Virgin America is there were a number of things that in hindsight probably weren’t great decisions that had to be redone. But they weren’t about its business model as much about its operating model.For example, Fred chose a reservation system that simply wasn’t going to be robust enough to be the future reservation system of the company. So when we made a decision that we had to transition to Sabre, that of course is a tremendous diversion of management attention. You can’t keep growing at an accelerated rate when you’re re-plumbing the heart of the airline.There were three or four decisions like that where we just made naïve mistakes, I think. We had a maintenance system didn’t make any sense. Our allocation of internal and external work between line maintenance and major overhaul maintenance was not very workable at the station level.So a number of things that had to be retooled, and all that against the backdrop of some very rollercoaster times in the industry.We started off with an airline that – because we didn’t get Transportation Department approval – had airplanes on the ground and paying leases for them for months before the department allowed us to fly.DMN: That burns a lot of money.Carty: A lot of money. And then right after that, of course, the price of fuel peaked. We of all airlines couldn’t hedge. One, we probably didn’t have a strong enough balance sheet to do a lot of hedging, but we could have done some. But we didn’t want to hedge for fuel we weren’t sure we’d be able to use because we didn’t know whether we were going to be able to fly or not.We took really hard hits right up front.One of the additional reasons for the slowdown was to get focused on our balance sheet and get the company in the financial position to grow. I think it was a combination of things. But during those transitions I don’t think from the consumers’ point of view we really ever changed our business model.DMN: How would you characterize the success of flying to Dallas/Fort Worth Airport?Carty: Really quite good. We were pleased how quickly D/FW ramped. We did Chicago in about the same time frame. D/FW ramped much more quickly than Chicago.DMN: Then why move to Dallas Love Field and go up against Southwest Airlines?Carty: The answer is pretty clear. The Love Field opportunity allows us to offer our unique product attributes in contrast to our competitor, who’s obviously very effective but does not offer a lot of the product attributes that we do. It puts us in a market where we’re kind of the premium carrier with the premium product and we think there’s a huge amount of demand for that in downtown Dallas. Just the feedback we’ve received from people who either fly Southwest now or fly American now but would like to use Love Field has been pretty overwhelming.That, plus the fact that look, this is a restricted airport. Having assets in a  restricted airport has always been a good thing in the airline business, whether it’s LaGuardia or Washington National as long as you’re the one that has them. And we’ve been the carrier that hasn’t had them in a number of situations. We took three years fighting for slots at Newark.
