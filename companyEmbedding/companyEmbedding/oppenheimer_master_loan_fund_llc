Special Risks: Foreign investments may be volatile and involve additional expenses and special risks, including currency fluctuations, foreign taxes, regulatory and geopolitical risks. Emerging and developing market investments may be especially volatile. Eurozone investments may be subject to volatility and liquidity issues.  Investments in securities of growth companies may be volatile.  Mid-sized company stock is typically more volatile than that of larger company stock.  It may take a substantial period of time to realize a gain on an investment in a mid-sized company, if any gain is realized at all. Diversification does not guarantee profit or protect against loss.

Emerging and developing market investments may be especially volatile. Eurozone investments may be subject to volatility and liquidity issues.  Investments in securities of growth companies may be volatile.  Mid-sized company stock is typically more volatile than that of larger company stock.  It may take a substantial period of time to realize a gain on an investment in a mid-sized company, if any gain is realized at all. Investing significantly in a particular region, industry, sector or issuer may increase volatility and risk.



4. 
Special Risks: Investing in MLPs involves additional risks as compared to the risks of investing in common stock, including risks related to cash flow, dilution and voting rights. The Fund’s investments are concentrated in the energy infrastructure industry with an emphasis on securities issued by MLPs, which may increase volatility. Energy infrastructure companies are subject to risks specific to the industry such as fluctuations in commodity prices, reduced volumes of natural gas or other energy commodities, environmental hazards, changes in the macroeconomic or the regulatory environment or extreme weather. MLPs may trade less frequently than larger companies due to their smaller capitalizations which may result in erratic price movement or difficulty in buying or selling. Additional management fees and other expenses are associated with investing in MLP funds.

The Fund is subject to certain MLP tax risks. An investment in the Fund does not offer the same tax benefits of a direct investment in an MLP. The Fund is organized as a Subchapter “C” Corporation and is subject to U.S. federal income tax on taxable income at the corporate tax rate (currently as high as 35%) as well as state and local income taxes. The potential tax benefit of investing in MLPs depend on them being treated as partnerships for federal income tax purposes. If the MLP is deemed to be a corporation, its income would be subject to federal taxation at the entity level, reducing the amount of cash available for distribution which could result in a reduction of the fund’s value. MLP funds accrue deferred income taxes for future tax liabilities associated with the portion of MLP distributions considered to be a tax-deferred return of capital and for any net operating gains as well as capital appreciation of its investments. This deferred tax liability is reflected in the daily NAV and as a result a MLP fund's after-tax performance could differ significantly from the underlying assets even if the pre-tax performance is closely tracked.

The Fund is classified as a “non-diversified” fund and may invest a greater portion of its assets in the securities of a single issuer.

To the extent that a Fund obtains leverage through borrowings, there will be the potential for greater gains and the risk of magnified losses.


6. 
Special Risks: Senior loans are typically lower-rated and may be illiquid investments (which may not have a ready market).  The Fund may invest without limit in below-investment-grade securities.  The Fund may invest a variable amount in debt rated below "B." May invest 25% or more of its assets in securities issued by companies in the financial services sector which may be susceptible to economic and regulatory events, and increased volatility.   Foreign investments may be volatile and involve additional expenses and special risks, including currency fluctuations, foreign taxes, regulatory and geopolitical risks.  Fixed income investing entails credit and interest rate risks. When interest rates rise, bond prices generally fall, and the Fund’s share prices can fall. Derivative instruments entail higher volatility and risk of loss compared to traditional stock or bond investments. Leverage (borrowing) involves transaction and interest costs on amounts borrowed, which may reduce performance.


7. 
Special Risks: An investment in the Fund is subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of principal amount invested. Fund returns may not match the return of its respective index, known as non-correlation risk, due to operating expenses incurred by the Fund. The alternate weighting approach employed by the Fund (i.e., using revenues as a weighting measure), while designed to enhance potential returns, may not produce the desired results. Because the Fund is rebalanced quarterly, portfolio turnover may exceed 100%. The greater the portfolio turnover, the greater the transaction costs, which could have an adverse effect on Fund performance.


8. 
Special Risks: An investment in the Fund is subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of principal amount invested. There is no guarantee that the issuers of stocks will declare dividends in the future, or that dividends will remain at their current levels or increase over time. The Fund is classified as a “non-diversified” fund and may invest a greater portion of its assets in the securities of a single issuer.

FUND PERFORMANCE DISCUSSION
How has the Fund performed? Below is a discussion by OppenheimerFunds, Inc., of
the Fund�s performance during its fiscal period ended September�30, 2008,
followed by a graphical comparison of the Fund�s performance to an appropriate
broad-based market index.
Management�s Discussion of Fund Performance. For the reporting period ended
September�30, 2008, the Fund returned-6.50%, outpacing its benchmark, the Credit
Suisse Leveraged Loan Index, which returned -8.39%. The Fund�s negative absolute
performance was primarily due to unusually volatile conditions in the bank loan
market and credit problems affecting a small number of holdings. A severe credit
crisis and economic slow-down roiled the financial markets over the reporting
period, and the bank loan market proved to be no exception.
�����Turbulence in the credit markets occurred throughout the reporting period,
when investor concerns in the sub-prime mortgage sector of the U.S. bond market
began to spread to stocks and other fixed-income market sectors. As more
sub-prime mortgage holders defaulted on their loans due to higher interest rates
and declining housing prices, investors grew increasingly concerned that other
market sectors would be adversely affected. At the same time, the U.S. economy
suffered a downturn, also led by the plunge in home values and exacerbated by
soaring fuel and food prices.
�����As a result, previously risk-tolerant investors began to reassess their
attitudes toward risk, sparking selling pressure in most asset classes other than
U.S. Treasury securities. This �flight to quality� produced price declines in
both lower risk and higher risk credits. A number of highly leveraged
institutional sellers, faced with margin calls and redemption requests, were
compelled to raise cash by selling their more creditworthy holdings, which
prolonged and intensified the credit crisis early in 2008. In addition, many of
the world�s largest and more recognizable commercial and investment banks
reported massive sub-prime related losses, reinforcing negative investor
sentiment. Contrary to many analysts� expectations early in 2008, reports of
write-offs and
write-downs continued through the end of the reporting period,
fueling additional market turbulence.
�����In addition to the economic and market influences discussed above, the bank
loan market was influenced by its own supply-and-demand factors. As investors
grew increasingly risk-averse, demand for bank loans and other forms of corporate
debt waned. The collapse of the structured securities market, which previously
had been a robust source of demand for bank loans, was particularly noteworthy.
Meanwhile, a surge in leveraged buy-outs during the first half of 2007 left an
�overhang� of unsold loans, and supply remained ample for some time. These
imbalanced technical conditions put downward pressure on loan prices in the
primary and secondary markets.
6 | OPPENHEIMER MASTER LOAN FUND, LLC
�


�

�����In the midst of persistently unsettled economic and market conditions
throughout the reporting period, we maintained a generally defensive investment
strategy, de-emphasizing loans from issuers in industry groups�such as retailers,
consumer products, finance and housing�that we regarded as relatively sensitive
to macroeconomic factors. Instead, we focused primarily on loans from issuers in
less cyclical areas, including the health care and energy sectors. In addition,
the Fund held no exposure to troubled sub-prime mortgages during the reporting
period.

�����This sector allocation strategy enabled the Fund to participate more fully
in some of the bank loan market�s better performing areas, while sheltering it
from the full brunt of weakness among the laggards. Overweight positions in the
energy, health care and cable-and-broadcasting sectors proved particularly
beneficial to the Fund�s relative performance. However, the positive effects of
our sector allocations were offset by shortfalls in our security selection
strategy, as credit issues among individual holdings in the building materials
and consumer products areas detracted from performance.

�����As of the reporting period�s end, we have maintained the Fund�s generally
defensive investment posture. We are, albeit selectively, taking a more proactive
approach to capturing potential opportunities among what we believe to be
fundamentally sound loans that may have been punished too severely during the
downturn.

Comparing the Fund�s performance to the Market. The graph that follows shows the
performance of a hypothetical $10,000 investment in shares of the Fund held until
September�30, 2008. Performance is measured from inception of the Fund on October
31, 2007. The Fund�s performance reflects the reinvestment of all dividends and
capital gains distributions. Past performance cannot guarantee future results.

�����The Fund�s performance is compared to the Credit Suisse Leveraged Loan
Index, a representative index of tradable, senior secured, U.S.
dollar-denominated, non-investment-grade loans. Index performance reflects the
reinvestment of income but does not consider the effect of transaction costs, and
none of the data in the graph shows the effect of taxes. The Fund�s performance
reflects the effects of the Fund�s business and operating expenses. While index
comparisons may be useful to provide a benchmark for the Fund�s performance, it
must be noted that the Fund�s investments are not limited to the investments in
the index.

FUND EXPENSES
Fund Expenses. As a shareholder of the Fund, you incur two types
of costs: (1)�transaction costs, which may include sales charges
(loads)�on purchase payments, contingent deferred sales charges
on redemptions; and redemption fees (if applicable); and (2)
ongoing costs, including management fees; distribution and
service fees; and other Fund expenses. These examples are
intended to help you understand your ongoing costs (in dollars)
of investing in the Fund and to compare these costs with the
ongoing costs of investing in other mutual funds.
The examples are based on an investment of $1,000.00 invested
at the beginning of the period and held for the entire 6-month
period ended September�30, 2008.
Actual Expenses. The first section of the table provides
information about actual account values and actual expenses. You
may use the information in this section, together with the
amount you invested, to estimate the expense that you paid over
the period. Simply divide your account value by $1,000.00 (for
example, an $8,600.00 account value divided by $1,000.00 =
8.60), then multiply the result by the number in the first
section under the heading entitled �Expenses Paid During Period�
to estimate the expenses you paid on your account during this
period.
Hypothetical Example for Comparison Purposes. The second section
of the table provides information about hypothetical account
values and hypothetical expenses based on the Fund�s actual
expense ratio, and an assumed rate of return of 5% per year
before expenses, which is not the actual return. The
hypothetical account values and expenses may not be used to
estimate the actual ending account balance or expenses you paid
for the period. You may use this information to compare the
ongoing costs of investing in the Fund and other funds. To do
so, compare this 5% hypothetical example with the 5%
hypothetical examples that appear in the shareholder reports of
the other funds.
Please note that the expenses shown in the table are meant to
highlight your ongoing costs only and do not reflect any
transactional costs, such as front-end or contingent deferred
sales charges (loads), or a $12.00 fee imposed annually on
accounts valued at less than $500.00 (subject to exceptions
described in the Statement of Additional Information).
Therefore, the �hypothetical� section of the table is useful in
comparing ongoing

�

costs only, and will not help you determine the relative total
costs of owning different funds. In addition, if these
transactional costs were included, your costs would have been
higher.

Expenses are equal to the Fund�s annualized expense ratio, multiplied by the
average account value over the period, multiplied by 183/366 (to reflect the
one-half year period). The annualized expense ratio, excluding indirect
expenses from affiliated fund, based on the 6-month period ended September�30,
2008 is as follows:

�
�
�
�
�


Expense Ratio
�
�
�
�
�

The expense ratio reflects voluntary waivers or reimbursements of expenses by
the Fund�s Manager that can be terminated at any time, without advance notice.
The �Financial Highlights� table in the Fund�s financial statements, included
in this report, also show the gross expense ratio, without such waivers or
reimbursements and reduction to custodian expenses, if applicable.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Significant Accounting Policies

Oppenheimer Master Loan Fund, LLC (the �Fund�), is organized as a Delaware
limited liability company and registered under the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended, as a diversified open-end management investment company. The
Fund�s investment objective is to seek as high a level of current income and
preservation of capital as is consistent with investing primarily in loans and
other debt securities. The Fund�s investment adviser is OppenheimerFunds, Inc.
(the �Manager�). The Fund commenced operations on October�31, 2007.

�����Shares of the Fund are issued solely in private placement transactions that
do not involve any �public offering� within the meaning of Section�4(2) of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Investments in the Fund may only be made by
�accredited investors� within the meaning of Regulation�D under the Securities
Act, including other investment companies. The Fund currently offers one class of
shares.

�����For federal income tax purposes, the Fund qualifies as a partnership, and
each investor in the Fund is treated as the owner of its proportionate share of
the net assets, income, expenses, and realized and unrealized gains and losses of
the Fund. Accordingly, as a �pass-through� entity, the Fund pays no dividends or
capital gain distributions.

�����The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
followed by the Fund.

Securities Valuation. The Fund calculates the net asset value of its shares as of
the close of the New York Stock Exchange (the �Exchange�), normally 4:00 P.M.
Eastern time, on each day the Exchange is open for trading. Securities may be
valued primarily using dealer-supplied valuations or a portfolio pricing service
authorized by the Board of Directors. Securities traded on a registered U.S.
securities exchange are valued based on the last sale price of the security
traded on that exchange prior to the time when the Fund�s assets are valued.
Securities whose principal exchange is NASDAQ� are valued based on the closing
price reported by NASDAQ prior to the time when the Fund�s assets are valued. In
the absence of a sale, the security is valued at the last sale price on the prior
trading day, if it is within the spread of the closing �bid� and �asked� prices,
and if not, at the closing bid price. Securities traded on foreign exchanges are
valued based on the last sale price on the principal exchange on which the
security is traded, as identified by the portfolio pricing service, prior to the
time when the Fund�s assets are valued. In the absence of a sale, the security is
valued at the official closing price on the principal exchange. Corporate,
government and municipal debt instruments having a remaining maturity in excess
of sixty days and all mortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage
obligations and other asset-backed securities will be valued at the mean between
the �bid� and �asked� prices. Securities for which market quotations are not
readily available are valued at their fair value. Securities whose values have
been materially affected by what the Manager identifies as a significant event
occurring before the Fund�s assets are valued but after the close of their
respective exchanges will be fair valued. Fair value is determined in good faith
using consistently applied procedures under the supervision of the Board of
Directors. Shares of a registered investment company that are not traded on

F17 | OPPENHEIMER MASTER LOAN FUND, LLC

�



�

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued
1. Significant Accounting Policies Continued
an exchange are valued at the
acquired investment company�s net asset value per share. �Money market-type� debt
instruments with remaining maturities of sixty days or less are valued at cost
adjusted by the amortization of discount or premium to maturity (amortized cost),
which approximates market value.
Loans. Under normal market conditions, the Fund will invest at least 80% of its
net assets in Loans made to U.S. and foreign borrowers that are corporations,
partnerships or other business entities. The Fund will do so directly as an
original lender or by assignment or directly through participation agreements on
certain derivative instruments.While many of these loans will be collateralized,
the Fund can also invest in uncollateralized Loans. Loans are often issued in
connection with recapitalizations, acquisitions, leveraged buy-outs, and
refinancing of borrowers. The Loans often pay interest at rates that float above
(or are adjusted periodically based on) a benchmark that reflects current
interest rates although the Fund can also invest in Loans with fixed interest
rates.
�����As of September�30, 2008, securities with an aggregate market value of
$513,668,641, representing 96.18% of the Fund�s net assets were comprised of
Loans, of which $22,432,096 representing 4.20% of the Fund�s net assets, were
illiquid.
Credit Risk. The Fund invests in high-yield, non-investment-grade bonds, which
may be subject to a greater degree of credit risk. Credit risk relates to the
ability of the borrower or issuer to meet interest or principal payments or both
as they become due. The Fund may acquire securities in default, and is not
obligated to dispose of securities whose issuers subsequently default. As of
September�30, 2008, securities with an aggregate market value of $7,223,106,
representing 1.35% of the Fund�s net assets, were in default.
Investment in Oppenheimer Institutional Money Market Fund. The Fund is permitted
to invest daily available cash balances in an affiliated money market fund. The
Fund may invest the available cash in Class�E shares of Oppenheimer Institutional
Money Market Fund (�IMMF�) to seek current income while preserving liquidity.
IMMF is a registered open-end management investment company, regulated as a money
market fund under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. The Manager is
also the investment adviser of IMMF. The Fund�s investment in IMMF is included in
the Statement of Investments. As a shareholder, the Fund is subject to its
proportional share of IMMF�s Class�E expenses, including its management fee. The
Manager will waive fees and/or reimburse Fund expenses in an amount equal to the
indirect management fees incurred through the Fund�s investment in IMMF.
Investments With Off-Balance Sheet Market Risk. The Fund enters into financial
instrument transactions (such as swaps, futures, options and other derivatives)
that may have off-balance sheet market risk. Off-balance sheet market risk
exists when the maximum potential loss on a particular financial instrument is
greater than the value of such financial instrument, as reflected in the Fund�s
Statement of Assets and Liabilities.
F18 | OPPENHEIMER MASTER LOAN FUND, LLC
�


�

Federal Taxes. The Fund, as an entity, will not be subject to U.S. federal
income tax. The Fund will be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a
partnership, and not as an association taxable as a corporation. Therefore, a
tax provision is not required. Each Member is required for U.S. federal income
tax purposes to take into account, in its taxable year with which (or within
which a taxable year of the Fund ends), its distributive share of all items of
Fund income, gains, losses, and deductions for such taxable year of the Fund. A
Member must take such items into account even if the Fund does not distribute
cash or other property to such Member during its taxable year.

�����Although the Fund is treated as a partnership for Federal tax purposes, it
is intended that the Fund�s assets, income and distributions will be managed in
such a way that investment in the Fund would not cause an investor that is a
regulated investment company under Subchapter M of the Code (�RIC�) to fail that
qualification.

Directors� Compensation. The Board of Directors has adopted a compensation
deferral plan for independent directors that enables directors to elect to defer
receipt of all or a portion of the annual compensation they are entitled to
receive from the Fund. For purposes of determining the amount owed to the
Director under the plan, deferred amounts are treated as though equal dollar
amounts had been invested in shares of the Fund or in other Oppenheimer funds
selected by the Director. The Fund purchases shares of the funds selected for
deferral by the Director in amounts equal to his or her deemed investment,
resulting in a Fund asset equal to the deferred compensation liability. Such
assets are included as a component of �Other� within the asset section of the
Statement of Assets and Liabilities. Deferral of directors� fees under the plan
will not affect the net assets of the Fund, and will not materially affect the
Fund�s assets, liabilities or net investment income per share. Amounts will be
deferred until distributed in accordance to the compensation deferral plan.

Investment Income. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date or upon
ex-dividend notification in the case of certain foreign dividends where the
ex-dividend date may have passed. Non-cash dividends included in dividend income,
if any, are recorded at the fair market value of the securities received.
Interest income is recognized on an accrual basis. Discount and premium, which
are included in interest income on the Statement of Operations, are amortized or
accreted daily.

Custodian Fees. �Custodian fees and expenses� in the Statement of Operations may
include interest expense incurred by the Fund on any cash overdrafts of its
custodian account during the period. Such cash overdrafts may result from the
effects of failed trades in portfolio securities and from cash outflows
resulting from unanticipated shareholder redemption activity. The Fund pays
interest to its custodian on such cash overdrafts, to the extent they are not
offset by positive cash balances maintained by the Fund, at a rate equal to the
Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50%. The �Reduction to custodian expenses� line item,
if applicable, represents earnings on cash balances maintained by the Fund
during the period. Such interest expense and other custodian fees may be paid
with these earnings.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued
1. Significant Accounting Policies Continued
Security Transactions. Security transactions are recorded on the trade date.
Realized gains and losses on securities sold are determined on the basis of
identified cost.
Indemnifications. The Fund�s organizational documents provide
current and former Directors and officers with a limited indemnification against
liabilities arising in connection with the performance of their duties to the
Fund. In the normal course of business, the Fund may also enter into contracts
that provide general indemnifications. The Fund�s maximum exposure under these
arrangements is unknown as this would be dependent on future claims that may be
made against the Fund. The risk of material loss from such claims is considered
remote.
Other. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of increases and
decreases in net assets from operations during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.
2. Shares of Beneficial Interest
The Fund has authorized an unlimited number of $0.001 par value shares of
beneficial interest. Transactions in shares of beneficial interest were as

rate of 0.30%.

�

Transfer Agent Fees. OppenheimerFunds Services (�OFS�), a division of the
Manager, acts as the transfer and shareholder servicing agent for the Fund. The
Fund pays OFS a per account fee. For the period ended September�30, 2008, the
Fund paid no fees to OFS for services to the Fund.
Offering and Organizational Costs. The Manager paid all initial offering and
organizational costs associated with the registration and seeding of the Fund.
Waivers and Reimbursements of Expenses. The Manager will waive fees and/or
reimburse Fund expenses in an amount equal to the indirect management fees
incurred through the Fund�s investments in IMMF. During the period ended
September�30, 2008, the Manager waived $74,883 for management fees.
5. Swap Contracts
The Fund may enter into privately negotiated agreements with a counterparty to
exchange or �swap� payments at specified future intervals based on the return of
an asset (such as a stock, bond or currency) or non-asset reference (such as an
interest rate or index). The swap agreement will specify the �notional� amount of
the asset or non-asset reference to which the contract relates. As derivative
contracts, swaps typically do not have an associated cost at contract inception.
At initiation, contract terms are typically set at market value such that the
value of the swap is $0. If a counterparty specifies terms that would result in
the contract having a value other than $0 at initiation, one counterparty will
pay the other an upfront payment to equalize the contract. Subsequent changes in
market value are calculated based upon changes in the performance of the asset or
non-asset reference multiplied by the notional value of the contract. Contract
types may include credit default, interest rate, total return, and currency
swaps.
�����Swaps are marked to market daily using quotations primarily from pricing
services, counterparties or brokers. Swap contracts are reported on a schedule
following the Statement of Investments. The value of the contracts is separately
disclosed on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. The unrealized appreciation
(depreciation)�is comprised of the change in the valuation of the swap combined
with the accrued interest due to (owed by) the Fund at termination or settlement.
The net change in this amount during the period is included on the Statement of
Operations. Any payment received or paid to initiate a contract is recorded as a
cost of the swap in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities and as a component of
unrealized gain or loss on the Statement of Operations until contract
termination; upon contract termination, this amount is recorded as realized gain
or loss on the Statement of Operations. Excluding amounts paid at contract
initiation as described above, the Fund also records any periodic payments
received from (paid to) the counterparty, including at termination, as realized
gain (loss)�on the Statement of Operations.
�����Risks of entering into swap contracts include credit, market and liquidity
risk. Credit risk arises from the possibility that the counterparty fails to make
a payment when due or otherwise defaults under the terms of the contract. If the
counterparty defaults, the Fund�s loss will consist of the net amount of
contractual payments that the Fund has not

�

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued
5. Swap Contracts Continued
yet received. Market risk is the risk that the value
of the contract will depreciate due to unfavorable changes in the performance of
the asset or non-asset reference. Liquidity risk is the risk that the Fund may be
unable to close the contract prior to its termination.
Credit Default Swap
Contracts. A credit default swap is a bilateral contract that enables an investor
to buy or sell protection on a debt security against a defined-issuer credit
event, such as the issuer�s failure to make timely payments of interest or
principal on the debt security, bankruptcy or restructuring. The Fund may enter
into credit default swaps either by buying or selling protection on a single
security or a basket of securities (the �reference asset�).
�����The buyer of protection pays a periodic fee, similar to an insurance
premium, to the seller of protection based on the notional amount of debt
securities underlying the swap contract. The seller of protection agrees to
compensate the buyer of protection for future potential losses as a result of a
credit event on the reference asset. The contract effectively transfers the
credit event risk of the reference asset from the buyer of protection to the
seller of protection.
�����The ongoing value of the contract will fluctuate throughout the term of the
contract based primarily on the credit risk of the reference asset. If the credit
quality of the reference asset improves relative to the credit quality at
contract initiation, the buyer of protection may have an unrealized loss greater
than the anticipated periodic fee owed. This unrealized loss would be the result
of current credit protection being cheaper than the cost of credit protection at
contract initiation. If the buyer elects to terminate the contract prior to its
maturity, and there has been no credit event, this unrealized loss will become
realized. If the contract is held to maturity, and there has been no credit
event, the realized loss will be equal to the periodic fee paid over the life of
the contract.
�����If there is a credit event, the buyer of protection can exercise its rights
under the contract and receive a payment from the seller of protection equal to
the notional amount of the reference asset less the market value of the reference
asset. Upon exercise of the contract the difference between the value of the
underlying reference asset and the notional amount is recorded as realized gain
(loss)�and is included on the Statement of Operations.
�����Risks of credit default swaps include credit, market and liquidity risk.
Additional risks include but are not limited to: the cost of paying for credit
protection if there are no credit events or the cost of selling protection when
a credit event occurs (paying the notional amount to the protection buyer); and
pricing transparency when assessing the value of a credit default swap.
6. Loan Commitments
Pursuant to the terms of certain credit agreements, the Fund has unfunded loan
commitments of $2,165,422 at September�30, 2008. The Fund generally will
maintain with its custodian, liquid investments having an aggregate value at
least equal to the amount
F22 | OPPENHEIMER MASTER LOAN FUND, LLC
�


�

of unfunded loan commitments. Commitments of $2,165,422 are contractually
obligated to fund by a specified date and have been included as Corporate Loans
in the Statement of Investments.

7. Illiquid Securities

As of September�30, 2008, investments in securities included issues that are
illiquid. Investments may be illiquid because they do not have an active trading
market, making it difficult to value them or dispose of them promptly at an
acceptable price. The Fund will not invest more than 15% of its net assets
(determined at the time of purchase and reviewed periodically) in illiquid
securities. Securities that are illiquid are marked with an applicable footnote
on the Statement of Investments.

8. Borrowings

The Fund can borrow money, in amounts up to one third of the value of its total
assets at the time of the borrowings, to fund redemptions, but may not used
borrowed money to make investments. Borrowing money will subject the Fund to
greater costs than funds that do not borrow, and may also make the Fund�s share
price more sensitive to interest changes. Expenses incurred by the Fund with
respect to interest on borrowings and commitment fees are disclosed separately or
as other expenses on the Statement of Operations. The Fund entered into a Credit
Agreement (the �Agreement�) with a bank which enables it to participate in a
committed borrowing facility that permits borrowings of up to $50�million.
Interest is charged to the Fund, based on its borrowings, at applicable rates.
The Fund pays an annual commitment fee on the amount of the unused portion of the
total facility size. The Fund has the right to prepay such loans and terminate
its participation in the credit facility at any time upon prior notice.

The Fund had no borrowings under the Agreement during the period ended September
30, 2008. Details of the borrowings for the period ended September�30, 2008 are
as follows:

9. Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In September�2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (�FASB�) issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (�SFAS�) No.�157, Fair Value
Measurements. This standard establishes a single authoritative definition of
fair value, sets out a framework for measuring fair value and expands
disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No.�157 applies to fair value
measurements already required or permitted by existing standards. SFAS No.�157
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after
November�15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. As of
September�30, 2008, the Manager does not believe the adoption of SFAS No.�157
will materially impact the financial statement amounts; however, additional
disclosures may be required about the inputs used to develop the measurements
and the effect of certain of the measurements on changes in net assets for the
period.

9. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Continued

�����In March�2008, FASB issued SFAS No.�161, Disclosures about Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities. This standard requires enhanced disclosures
about derivative and hedging activities, including qualitative disclosures about
how and why the Fund uses derivative instruments, how these activities are
accounted for, and their effect on the Fund�s financial position, financial
performance and cash flows. SFAS No.�161 is effective for financial statements
issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November�15, 2008.
At this time, management is evaluating the implications of SFAS No.�161 and its
impact on the Fund�s financial statements and related disclosures.

10. Change In Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (Unaudited)

At a meeting held on August�20, 2008, the Board of Directors of the Fund
appointed KPMG LLP as the independent registered public accounting firm to the
Fund, replacing the firm of Deloitte & Touche LLP, effective for the fiscal 2008
audit. The audit report of Deloitte & Touche LLP with respect to the Fund�s
October�18, 2007 seed money financial statements contained no adverse opinion or
disclaimer of opinion and was not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit
scope or accounting principles. Further, there were no disagreements between the
Fund and Deloitte & Touche LLP on accounting principles, financial statement
disclosure or audit scope, which if not resolved to the satisfaction of Deloitte
& Touche LLP would have caused it to make reference to the disagreements in
connection with its report.

assess their qualifications. The Committee shall have the authority, upon approval of the

evaluating trustee nominees, the Committee considers, among other things, an individual�s
background, skills, and experience; whether the individual is an �interested person� as
defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940; and whether the individual would be deemed an
�audit committee financial expert� within the meaning of applicable SEC rules. The Committee
also considers whether the individual�s background, skills, and experience will complement the
background, skills, and experience of other nominees and will contribute to the Board. There
are no differences in the manner in which the Committee evaluates nominees for trustees based
on whether the nominee is recommended by a shareholder.


�

3.
�
The Committee may consider nominations from shareholders for the Board at such times as the
Committee meets to consider new nominees for the Board. The Committee shall have the sole
discretion to determine the candidates to present to the



�



�



�
�
Board and, in such cases where required, to shareholders. Recommendations for trustee nominees
should, at a minimum, be accompanied by the following:






�
�
�
the name, address, and business, educational, and/or other pertinent background of the
person being recommended;


�

�
�
�
a statement concerning whether the person is an �interested person� as defined in the
Investment Company Act of 1940;


�

�
�
�
any other information that the Funds would be required to include in a proxy statement
concerning the person if he or she was nominated; and


�

�
�
�
the name and address of the person submitting the recommendation and, if that person is
a shareholder, the period for which that person held Fund shares.






�
�
The recommendation also can include any additional information which the person submitting it
believes would assist the Committee in evaluating the recommendation.


�

4.
�
Shareholders should note that a person who owns securities issued by Massachusetts Mutual
Life Insurance Company (the parent company of the Funds� investment adviser) would be deemed
an �interested person� under the Investment Company Act of 1940. In addition, certain other
relationships with Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company or its subsidiaries, with
registered broker-dealers, or with the Funds� outside legal counsel may cause a person to be
deemed an �interested person.�


�

5.
�
Before the Committee decides to nominate an individual as a trustee, Committee members and
other directors customarily interview the individual in person. In addition, the individual
customarily is asked to complete a detailed questionnaire which is designed to elicit
information which must be disclosed under SEC and stock exchange rules and to determine
whether the individual is subject to any statutory disqualification from serving as a trustee
of a registered investment company.




Item�11. Controls and Procedures.

Based on their evaluation of the registrant�s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
rule 30a-3(c) under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (17 CFR 270.30a-3(c)) as of 09/30/2008, the
registrant�s principal executive officer and principal financial officer found the registrant�s
disclosure controls and procedures to provide reasonable assurances that information required to be
disclosed by the registrant in the reports that it files under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
(a)�is accumulated and communicated to registrant�s management, including its principal executive
officer and principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure,
and (b)�is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the
rules and forms adopted by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

�



�

There have been no changes in the registrant�s internal controls over financial reporting that
occurred during the registrant�s second fiscal quarter of the period covered by this report that
have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant�s internal
control over financial reporting.

                                           INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT

         AGREEMENT made as of the 25th day of October, 2007, by and between Oppenheimer Master Loan Fund, LLC
(the "Fund"), and OppenheimerFunds, Inc. ("OFI").

         WHEREAS, the Fund is an open-end, diversified management investment company registered as such with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") pursuant to the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the
"Investment Company Act"), and OFI is a registered investment adviser;

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and covenants hereinafter set forth, it is
agreed by and between the parties, as follows:

1.    General Provision.

         The Fund hereby employs OFI and OFI hereby undertakes to act as the investment adviser of the Fund and
to perform for the Fund such other duties and functions as are hereinafter set forth. OFI shall, in all matters,
give to the Fund and its Board of Directors the benefit of its best judgment, effort, advice and recommendations
and shall, at all times conform to, and use its best efforts to enable the Fund to conform to (i) the provisions
of the Investment Company Act and any rules or regulations thereunder; (ii) any other applicable provisions of
state or federal law; (iii) the provisions of the Limited Liability Company Agreement and the By-laws of the Fund
both as amended from time to time; (iv) policies and determinations of the Board of Directors of the Fund;
(v) the fundamental policies and investment restrictions of the Fund as reflected in its registration statement
under the Investment Company Act or as such policies may, from time to time, be amended by the Fund's
shareholders; and (vi) the Prospectus and Statement of Additional Information of the Fund in effect from time to
time. The appropriate officers and employees of OFI shall be available upon reasonable notice for consultation
with any of the Directors and officers of the Fund with respect to any matters dealing with the business and
affairs of the Fund including the valuation of any of the Fund's portfolio securities which are either not
registered for public sale or not being traded on any securities market.

2.    Investment Management.

         (a) OFI shall, subject to the direction and control by the Fund's Board of Directors, (i) regularly
provide investment advice and recommendations to the Fund with respect to its investments, investment policies
and the purchase and sale of securities; (ii) supervise continuously the investment program of the Fund and the
composition of its portfolio and determine what securities shall be purchased or sold by the Fund; and
(iii) arrange, subject to the provisions of paragraph "7" hereof, for the purchase of securities and other
investments for the Fund and the sale of securities and other investments held in the portfolio of the Fund.

         (b) Provided that the Fund shall not be required to pay any compensation other than as provided by the
terms of this Agreement and subject to the provisions of paragraph "7" hereof, OFI may obtain investment
information, research or assistance from any other person, firm or corporation to supplement, update or otherwise
improve its investment management services.

         (c) Provided that nothing herein shall be deemed to protect OFI from willful misfeasance, bad faith or
gross negligence in the performance of its duties, or reckless disregard of its obligations and duties under the
Agreement, OFI shall not be liable for any loss sustained by reason of good faith errors or omissions in
connection with any matters to which this Agreement relates.

         (d) Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent OFI or any officer thereof from acting as investment adviser
for any other person, firm or corporation and shall not in any way limit or restrict OFI or any of its directors,
officers or employees from buying, selling or trading any securities for its own account or for the account of
others for whom it or they may be acting, provided that such activities will not adversely affect or otherwise
impair the performance by OFI of its duties and obligations under this Agreement and under the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940.

         (e) OFI may, at its option and subject to approval by the Directors of the Fund, and to the extent
necessary, the shareholders of the Fund, appoint a sub-adviser to assume certain or all of the responsibilities
and obligations of OFI under this Agreement.

3.    Other Duties of OFI.

         OFI shall, at its own expense, provide and supervise the activities of all administrative and clerical
personnel as shall be required to provide effective corporate administration for the Fund, including the
compilation and maintenance of such records with respect to its operations as may reasonably be required; the
preparation and filing of such reports with respect thereto as shall be required by the Commission; composition
of periodic reports with respect to its operations for the shareholders of the Fund; composition of proxy
materials for meetings of the Fund's shareholders and the composition of such registration statements as may be
required by federal securities laws for the private placement of shares of the Fund. OFI shall, at its own cost
and expense, also provide the Fund with adequate office space, facilities and equipment.

4.    Allocation of Expenses.

         All other costs and expenses not expressly assumed by OFI under this Agreement, or to be paid by the
Placement Agent of the shares of the Fund, shall be paid by the Fund, including, but not limited to (i) interest
and taxes; (ii) brokerage commissions; (iii) premiums for fidelity and other insurance coverage requisite to its
operations; (iv) the fees and expenses of its Directors; (v) legal and audit expenses; (vi) custodian and
transfer agent fees and expenses; (vii) expenses incident to the redemption of its shares; (viii) expenses
incident to the issuance of its shares against payment therefor by or on behalf of the subscribers thereto;
(ix) fees and expenses, other than as hereinabove provided, incident to the registration under federal securities
laws of shares of the Fund; (x) expenses of printing and mailing reports, notices and proxy materials to
shareholders of the Fund; (xi) except as noted above, all other expenses incidental to holding meetings of the
Fund's shareholders; and (xii) such extraordinary non-recurring expenses as may arise, including litigation
affecting the Fund and any obligation which the Fund may have to indemnify its officers and Directors with
respect thereto. Any officers or employees of OFI or any entity controlling, controlled by or under common
control with OFI, who may also serve as officers, Directors or employees of the Fund shall not receive any
compensation from the Fund for their services.

5.    Compensation of OFI.

         The Fund agrees to pay OFI and OFI agrees to accept as full compensation for the performance of all
functions and duties on its part to be performed pursuant to the provisions hereof, a management fee computed on
the total net assets of the Fund as of the close of each business day and payable monthly at the annual rate of
0.30% of average annual net assets.

6.    Use of Name "Oppenheimer."

         OFI hereby grants to the Fund a royalty-free, non-exclusive license to use the name "Oppenheimer" in the
name of the Fund for the duration of this Agreement and any extensions or renewals thereof. Such license may,
upon termination of this Agreement, be terminated by OFI, in which event the Fund shall promptly take whatever
action may be necessary to change its name and discontinue any further use of the name "Oppenheimer" in the name
of the Fund or otherwise. The name "Oppenheimer" may be used or licensed by OFI in connection with any of its
activities or licensed by OFI to any other party.

7.    Portfolio Transactions and Brokerage.

         (a) OFI is authorized, in arranging the Fund's portfolio transactions, to employ or deal with such
members of securities or commodities exchanges, brokers or dealers, including "affiliated" broker dealers (as
that term is defined in the Investment Company Act) (hereinafter "broker-dealers"), as may, in its best judgment,
implement the policy of the Fund to obtain, at reasonable expense, the "best execution" (prompt and reliable
execution at the most favorable security price obtainable) of the Fund's portfolio transactions as well as to
obtain, consistent with the provisions of subparagraph "(c)" of this paragraph "7," the benefit of such
investment information or research as may be of significant assistance to the performance by OFI of its
investment management functions.

         (b) OFI shall select broker-dealers to effect the Fund's portfolio transactions on the basis of its
estimate of their ability to obtain best execution of particular and related portfolio transactions. The
abilities of a broker-dealer to obtain best execution of particular portfolio transaction(s) will be judged by
OFI on the basis of all relevant factors and considerations including, insofar as feasible, the execution
capabilities required by the transaction or transactions; the ability and willingness of the broker-dealer to
facilitate the Fund's portfolio transactions by participating therein for its own account; the importance to the
Fund of speed, efficiency or confidentiality; the broker-dealer's apparent familiarity with sources from or to
whom particular securities might be purchased or sold; as well as any other matters relevant to the selection of
a broker-dealer for particular and related transactions of the Fund.

         (c) OFI shall have discretion, in the interests of the Fund, to allocate brokerage on the Fund's
portfolio transactions to broker-dealers other than affiliated broker-dealers, qualified to obtain best execution
of such transactions who provide brokerage and/or research services (as such services are defined in Section
23(e)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) for the Fund and/or other accounts for which OFI and its
affiliates exercise "investment discretion" (as that term is defined in Section 3(a)(35) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934) and to cause the Fund to pay such broker-dealers a commission for effecting a portfolio
transaction for the Fund that is in excess of the amount of commission another broker-dealer adequately qualified
to effect such transaction would have charged for effecting that transaction, if OFI determines, in good faith,
that such commission is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and/or research services provided by
such broker-dealer, viewed in terms of either that particular transaction or the overall responsibilities of OFI
and its investment advisory affiliates with respect to the accounts as to which they exercise investment
discretion. In reaching such determination, OFI will not be required to place or attempt to place a specific
dollar value on the brokerage and/or research services provided or being provided by such broker-dealer. In
demonstrating that such determinations were made in good faith, OFI shall be prepared to show that all
commissions were allocated for the purposes contemplated by this Agreement and that the total commissions paid by
the Fund over a representative period selected by the Fund's Directors were reasonable in relation to the
benefits to the Fund.

         (d) OFI shall have no duty or obligation to seek advance competitive bidding for the most favorable
commission rate applicable to any particular portfolio transactions or to select any broker-dealer on the basis
of its purported or "posted" commission rate but will, to the best of its ability, endeavor to be aware of the
current level of the charges of eligible broker-dealers and to minimize the expense incurred by the Fund for
effecting its portfolio transactions to the extent consistent with the interests and policies of the Fund as
established by the determinations of its Board of Directors and the provisions of this paragraph "7."

         (e) The Fund recognizes that an affiliated broker-dealer (i) may act as one of the Fund's regular
brokers so long as it is lawful for it so to act; (ii) may be a major recipient of brokerage commissions paid by
the Fund; and (iii) may effect portfolio transactions for the Fund only if the commissions, fees or other
remuneration received or to be received by it are determined in accordance with procedures contemplated by any
rule, regulation or order adopted under the Investment Company Act for determining the permissible level of such
commissions.

8.    Duration.

         This Agreement will take effect on the date first set forth above. Unless earlier terminated pursuant to
paragraph 9 hereof, this Agreement shall remain in effect until two years from the date of execution hereof, and
thereafter will continue in effect from year to year, so long as such continuance shall be approved at least
annually by the Fund's Board of Directors, including the vote of the majority of the Directors of the Fund who
are not parties to this Agreement or "interested persons" (as defined in the Investment Company Act) of any such
party, cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on such approval, or by the holders of a
"majority" (as defined in the Investment Company Act) of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund and by
such a vote of the Fund's Board of Directors.

9.    Termination.

         This Agreement may be terminated (i) by OFI at any time without penalty upon giving the Fund sixty days'
written notice (which notice may be waived by the Fund); or (ii) by the Fund at any time without penalty upon
sixty days' written notice to OFI (which notice may be waived by OFI) provided that such termination by the Fund
shall be directed or approved by the vote of a majority of all of the Directors of the Fund then in office or by
the vote of the holders of a "majority" (as defined in the Investment Company Act) of the outstanding voting
securities of the Fund.

10.   Assignment or Amendment.

         This Agreement may not be amended without the affirmative vote or written consent of the holders of a
"majority" of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund, except to the extent permitted under the Investment
Company Act, and shall automatically and immediately terminate in the event of its "assignment," as defined in
the Investment Company Act.

11.   Disclaimer of Shareholder Liability.

         OFI understands that the obligations of the Fund under this Agreement are not binding upon any Director
or shareholder of the Fund personally, but bind only the Fund and the Fund's property. OFI represents that it has
notice of the provisions of the Limited Liability Company Agreement of the Fund disclaiming Director and
shareholder liability for acts or obligations of the Fund.

12.   Definitions.

         The terms and provisions of this Agreement shall be interpreted and defined in a manner consistent with
the provisions and definitions of the Investment Company Act.



         IN WITNESS  WHEREOF,  the parties hereto have executed this Agreement as of the date first set forth above
in one or more separate counterparts.

NO. 204 RECEIVED NYSCEF: 06/01/2017 SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK COUNTY OF NEW YORK: COMMERCIAL PART 48 ----------------------------------------x BLACK DIAMOND CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, L.L.C., BO IAP HOLDINGS LLC, and GSC PARTNERS COO FUND IV, LTD., Index No.: 652519/2015 Plaintiffs, Mtn.

OING, J. : Preliminary Statement This action arises out of an alleged repudiation of an agreement to sell ownership interests in defen9ant IAP Global Services, LLC ("IAP"), a limited liability corporation. IAP is a government contractor that provides facilities management and other services internationally. Similar to a corporation, IAP has a board of directors, although dissimilar to a corporation, its owners have direct control rights and can effectively veto a board decision if they obtain 40% ownership, or negative control rights (Second Amended Compl., ~ 1). Plaintiffs', Black Diamond Capital Management, L.L.C., BO IAP Holdings LLC, and GSC Partners COO Fund IV, Ltd. (collectively, "Black Diamond") i lawsuit alleges that several of the defendants, fearful that Black Diamond would obtain negative control rights in IAP, reneged on 2 of 14 [*FILED: NEW YORK COUNTY CLERK 06/01/2017 10:49 AM 2] NYSCEF DOC.

Relief Sought ·Black Diamond moves to compel the production of two email chains from defendants Eaton Vance Corp. and Eaton yance Floating Rate Portfolio (collectively, "Eaton Vance") which were sent during the time period leading up to this litigation and which may impact the issues in this litigation. Eaton Vance asserts that these emails are protected from disclosure as they are attorney-client privileged communications. Factual Background IAP borrowed funds from syndicates of lenders under various loan agreements, with membership of the IAP loan syndicate evolving over time. The interested parties appointed an administrative and ,collateral agent (the "Agent") to administer the facility and the loan's security interest, and, upon the event of a default, to exercise any secured lender rights with respect to the collateral. Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas ("Deutsche Bank"), a non-party, was appointed to serve as the initial Agent on the senior iecured loan. In or around 2013, IAP defaulted on certain loan obligations. On September 3, 2013, Deutsche Bank retained the law firm of Kaye Scholer, LLP ("Kaye Scholer") to represent it in 3 of 14 [*FILED: NEW YORK COUNTY CLERK 06/01/2017 10:49 AM 3] NYSCEF DOC.

("Messersmithn) was the Kaye Scholer partner responsible fdr the engagement. Deutsche Bank, with the help of Kaye Scholer and Messersmith, facilitated a voluntary restructuring of IAP's debts. During the restructuring process, some of the first lien lenders, including Eaton Vance, formed a committee, i.e., ~he Steering Committee, to aid in the restructuring and to coordinate their efforts. In addition to Eaton Vance, the Steering Committee included Invesco Management S.A., Invesco Senior Secured Management, Inc., Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, and defendants Oppenheimer Master Loan Fund, LLC and Oppenheimer Senior Floating Rate Fund (collectively, "Oppenheimern) . Deutsche Bank served as Agent until the restructuring agreement was finalized, effective on July 18, 2014. At that point Cortland Capital Markets Services, LLC ("Cortlandn) assumed the Agent role. Kaye Scholer continued in its representation of the Agent. Under the restructuring agreement, the parties agreed that IAP woulq issue equity, in the form of membership units, to specific lenders 9s consideration for the restructuring of their loans. Eaton Vance, Black Diamond, Oppenheimer, Credit Suisse, and the oth~r·first lien lenders each received equity in consideration for the restructuring, in accordance with their 4 of 14 [*FILED: NEW YORK COUNTY CLERK 06/01/2017 10:49 AM 4] NYSCEF DOC.

No. 008 operating agreement Page 4 of 13 the Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of IAP Global Services, LLC, dated July 18, 2-014. On or about April 20, 2015, Oppenheimer offered for sale its 1,627.38 membership units through a public auction. Black Diamond, whose identity was unbeknownst to Oppenheimer at the time, submitted a bid for all of Oppenheimer's 1,627.38 units (Second Amended Compl., OppenheimerFunds, Inc. ~~ 3-4). Black Diamond asserts that ("OppenheimerFunds") acting as the agent of Oppenheimer, accepted the bid, confirming that the trade was "good," and thus created a binding agreement between the parties (Id., ~ 4). However, on April 27, 2015, OppenheimerFunds contacted Bla~k Diaciond's broker and informed him that Oppenheimer would not sell the shares to Black Diamond (Id., ~ 6) . Oppenheimer instead sold its shares to Eaton Vance, who exercised a right of first refusal to which the trade was alle~edly subject. On or around May 7, 2015 Eaton Vance retained the law firm of Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe, LLP ("Orrick") to represent it in the transfer of Oppenheimer's shares (Christensen 9/29/16 EBT, p. 248). On July 30, 2015 Oppenheimer closed the transfer of shares to Eaton Vance (Id., ~ 7). In the case at bar, Black Diamond argues that· OppenheimerFunds and Eaton Vance convinced Oppenheimer to renege on its agreement, and that they fabricated a right of first 5 of 14 [*FILED: NEW YORK COUNTY CLERK 06/01/2017 10:49 AM 5] NYSCEF DOC.

Motion to Compel In this motion to compel, Black Diamond seeks the production of two sets of emails, which defendant Eaton Vance asserts are protected from disclosure under attorney-client privilege. The first set of contested emails were sent on April 24, 2015 (the "4/24/15 emails") (Kelley Affirm., Ex. I, Privilege Log, No. 29) The authors and re~ipients listed on this email chain are Heath Christensen, Eaton Vance Corp.'s Vice President and Senior Credit Analyst, and two Kaye Scholer attorneys, Messersmith and Kathryn Schmanski, Esq. The 4/24/15 emails consist of "[f]our emails of uninterrupted dialogue concerning the purchase of IAP equity" (Id.). The second set of contested emails were sent on May 11, 2015 (the "5/11/15 emails") and consist of "seven emails of uninterrupted dialogue concerning the purchase of IAP equity" (Id., No. 22). The listed authors and recipients are Schmanski; Amy G. Pasacreta, Esq., an attorney at Orrick; Michael Botthof, head of the operations group at Eaton Vance; and Steve Levielle, an employee in the operations group at Eaton Vance (Id.) Eaton Vance asserts that these two set~ of email communications between itself and Kaye Scholer are privileged for several reasons. First, Eaton Vance argues that Kaye Scholer 6 of 14 [*FILED: NEW YORK COUNTY CLERK 06/01/2017 10:49 AM 6] NYSCEF DOC. NO. 204 INDEX NO. 652519/2015 RECEIVED NYSCEF: 06/01/2017 Index No.: 652519/2015 Mtn Seq. No. 008 Page 6 of 13 represented it in its capacity as a member of the Steering Committee. To support this contention, Eaton Vance points to a Kaye Scholer press release in which Kaye Scholer claims.to have represented both Deutsche Bank and the IAP's lender group in the IAP restructuring (NYSCEF .Doc. No. 187). Christensen similarly contends that Messersmith and Kaye Scholer advised Eaton Vance as an individual lender "throughout the process of the restructuring" (Christensen 9/29/16 EBT, p. 62). Second, Saton Vance argues that its communications with Messersmith and Kaye Scholer post restructuring, but pretransfer, of Oppenheimer's shares are privileged because those communications were that of a prospective client seeking legal advice. In his affidavit, Christensen explains the nature of the relationship as follows: [I] have (always on behalf of Eaton Vance) obtained the legal services of Mr. Messersmith and [Kaye Scholer] before, during and after the IAP restructuring was concluded. All of my dealings with Mr. Messersmith, which have extended across several legal matters and have occurred over several years, have been in the context of an attorney-client relatiortship. He has consistently undertaken to provide me with the legal services I requested on behalf of Eaton Vance. I always understood that he would provide advice consistent with the interests of Eaton Vance. On my side, I further understood that our communications were to be confidential. I have no reason to think that Mr. Messersmith had a different view. (Christensen Aff., ~ 21) (NYSCEF Doc. No. 184). As a result of this alleged longstanding professional relationship with Messersmith, Christensen further explained in 7 of 14 [*FILED: NEW YORK COUNTY CLERK 06/01/2017 10:49 AM 7] INDEX NO. 652519/2015 NYSCEF DOC. NO. 204 RECEIVED NYSCEF: 06/01/2017 Index No.: 652519/2015 Mtn Seq. No. 008 Page 7 of his affidavit that he chose to consult with him transfer of shares. reg~rding 13 the In that regard, he provides: After Oppenheimer honored the [right of first refusal], on or about April 24, 2015, I sought legal assistance from Mr. Messersmith with regard to the transfer of the IAP LLC Interests from Oppenheimer to Eaton Vance. I chose among my various options to contact Mr. · Messersmith because I believed he had the specific legal information I was seeking with regard to the IAP situation at that time. The Plaintiffs' Motion to Compel is directed to my email communications with Mr. Messersmith regarding the transfer of IAP LLC Interests. (Christensen Aff., ~ 20). In further support of its privilege claim, Eaton Vance argu~s that although it had no formal retainer agreement with Kaye Scholer, an attorney-client relationship can, in certain circumstances, encompass preliminary consultation with a prospective client (see Pellegrino v Oppenheimer & Co., Inc., 49 AD3d 94, 99 -[1st Dept 2008]). In response, Black Diamond argues that Eaton Vance was never a client of Kaye Scholer during or after the restructuring and that Eaton Vance has failed to produce evidence of any such attorney-client relationship. In that regard, Black Diamond points to the fact that Eaton Vance has failed to establish that there existed between the parties a fee arrangement, & formal contract or retainer agreement, an informal relationship of representation, an actual representation in one aspect or matter, 8 of 14 [*FILED: NEW YORK COUNTY CLERK 06/01/2017 10:49 AM 8] NYSCEF DOC. NO. 204 INDEX NO. 652519/2015 RECEIVED NYSCEF: 06/01/2017 Index No.: 652519/2015 Mtn Seq. No. 008, Page 8 of 13 or a reasonable belief that Messersmith and Kaye Scholer represented it. Black Diamond also argues that Eaton Vance cannot claim that it was under the impression that Kaye Scholer represented it in its capacity as an individual lender of the Steering.Committee, and that this relationship extended post restructuring. To support that argument, Black Diamond points to the engagement letter signed by Deutsche Bank, the Agent at the time of the restructuring, which shows that the Agent was Kaye Scholer's client, not the Steering Committee (Kelley Affirm., Ex. C). Black Diamond also refers to a letter sent by Messersmith to IAP's attorneys and forwarded to the first lien lenders, including Eaton Vance, which stated that Kaye Scholer represented the Agent (Kelley Affirm., Ex. D) and points to the "Restructuring Support Agreement" in which the first lien lenders acknowledged that Kaye Scholer represented the Agent (Kelley Affirm., Ex. Eat§ 5.01). Black Diamond argues that if Eaton Vance was truly under the impression that Kaye Scholer repres~nted it Eaton Vance would not have retained Orrick in the t transfer of the IAE equity trade with Oppenheimer. Discussion The attorney-client privilege applies to communications made "[f]or the purpose of obtaining legal advice and directed to an attorney who has been consulted for that purpose" (Rossi v Blue 9 of 14 [*FILED: NEW YORK COUNTY CLERK 06/01/2017 10:49 AM 9] NYSCEF DOC. NO. 204 INDEX NO. 652519/2015 RECEIVED NYSCEF: 06/01/2017 Index No.: 652519/2015 Mtn Seq. No. 008 Page 9 of 13 Cross & Blue Shield of Greater N.Y., 73 NY2d 588, 593 [1989) [internal quotations and citations omitted]). The burden of establishing a right of protection based on attorney-client privilege falls upon the party claiming the existence of privilege (Spectrum Sys. Intl. Corp. v Chemical Bank, 78 NY2d 37i, 377 [1991); China Privatization Fund (Del.), L.P. v Galaxy Entertainment Group Ltd., 139 AD3d 449, 449 [1st Dept 2016]). In order to establish attorney-client privilege, the party asserting the privilege must first establish the existence of thi,s requisite professional relationship as that between attorney and client (Ambac Assur. Corp. v Countrywide Home Loans, NY3d 616, 624 [2016)). Inc., 27 Formality is not necessary to create a legal services contract, but the words and actions of the parties must be analyzed to assess whether an attorney-client relationship was formed (Talansky v Schulman, 2 AD3d 355, 358 [1st Dept 2003)). Although an attorney-client relationship can. arise only when "[o]ne contacts an attorney in his capacity as such for the purpose of obtaining legal advic.e or services" (Id. [internal quotations and citations omitted]), a plaintiff's unilateral actions and beliefs are insufficient to form an attorney-client relationship (Jane St. Co. v Rosenberg & Estis, 192 AD2d 451 [1st Dept 1993); ~Pellegrino v Oppenheimer & Co., Inc., 49 AD3d 94, 99 [1st Dept 2008)). When there is nothing in the record to indicate that a law firm either "[a)ffirmatively 10 of 14 [*FILED: NEW YORK COUNTY CLERK 06/01/2017 10:49 AM 10] NYSCEF DOC. NO. 204 INDEX NO. 652519/2015 RECEIVED NYSCEF: 06/01/2017 Index No.: 652519/2015 Mtn Seq. No. 008 Page 10 of 13 led plaintiff to believe it was acting on plaintiff's behalf or knowingly allowed plaintiff to proceed under this misconception" (Jane St. Co. v Rosenberg & Estis, 192 AD2d at 451), a client's belief as to the existence of the professional relationship is not dispositive (Weadick v Herlihy, 16 AD3d 223, 224 2005] [1st Dept [internal citations omitted]). Here, the record demonstrates that Eaton Vance has failed to establish the existence of the requisite attorney-client relationship between itself, and Messersmith and Kaye Scholer. Although Eaton Vance argues that it had a long-standing relationship w~th Messersmith, it fails to provide any evidence of such. Besides the self-serving conclusory assertions made by Christensen in his affidavit, Eaton Vance fails to provide any evidence regarding Kaye S~holer's or Messersmith's perception of the relationship. There is no indication in the record that Kaye Scholer ~nd Messersmith affiimatively led Eaton Vance to believe they were acting on its behalf, or, for that matter, allowed Eaton Vance to proceed under this misconception. In that regard, the press release that Eaton Vance relies on to de~onstrate an attorney-client relationship is simply insufficient to establish Kaye Scholer's belief that it represented Eaton Vance in its capacity as a first lien lender, particularly in the absence of any supplemental affirmation from Messersmith or any Kaye Scholer 11 of 14 [*FILED: NEW YORK COUNTY CLERK 06/01/2017 10:49 AM 11] NYSCEF DOC. NO. 204 RECEIVED NYSCEF: 06/01/2017 Page 11 of Index No.: 652519/2015 Mtn Seq. No. 008 attorney. INDEX NO. 652519/2015 ~n 13 fact, the record is devoid of any explanation from Eaton Vance concerning the absence of such documentary evidence. In any event, even if Eaton Vance believed Kaye Scholer was representing it as part of the Steering Committee during the restructuring process, and not just representing the Agerit, that fact is of no moment. July 18, 2014. Here, the restructuring was finalized on The 4/24/15 emails and 5/11/2015 emails were sent nine and ten months, respectively, after the restructuring. ·Further, Christensen's claim in his affidavit that Eaton Vance sought the advice of Kaye Scholer regarding the transfer of Oppenheimer's IAP shares is inconsistent with, and contrary to, his earlier September 29, 2016 EBT. When asked at his ~eposition if he was aware of any work that Kaye Scholer did that "specifically was directed at Eaton Vance," Christensen responded only in regards to Kaye Scholer representing Eaton Vance in the restructuring, stating, "[I] generally view Kaye Scholer as representing us with respect to IAP [as a member of the first lien lenders]" (Christensen 9/29/16 EBT, pp. 59, 53-58). When asked about when he secured advice from Kaye Scholer, and specifically Messersmith, Christian responded that it was "[t]hroughout the restructuring," the 2014 time-frame, and "[s]incethen" (Id., 63). Thus, although Christensen briefly alludes to some form of post restructuring communication with Messersmith, he makes no mention of the IAP share transaction. 12 of 14 [*FILED: NEW YORK COUNTY CLERK 06/01/2017 10:49 AM 12] NYSCEF DOC. NO. 204 INDEX NO. 652519/2015 RECEIVED NYSCEF: 06/01/2017 Page 12 of Index No.: 652519/2015 Mtn Seq. No. 008 13 Christensen confirmed in his EBT that Orrick was "[Eaton Vance's] outside counsel on the trade documentation" (Id., pp. 248-249) When asked if it was correct that no other lawyers oth~r than Orrick attorneys helped represent Eaton Vance in the transaction with Oppenheimer, Christensen replied "[t]hat's correct" and "[t]hat' s right" (Id., p. 250). In addition, with respect to the 5/11/15 emails, at the time they were sent, Eaton Vance had already retained Orrick to represent it in the IAP share tran~action with Oppenheimer. 'l'hus, Kaye Sc.holer was merely a third party, outside the scope of Orrick and Eaton Vance's attorney-client relationship. The principle is well settled that. communicatiqns made in the presence of third parties, whose presence is known to the client, are not privileged communications and can be disclosed, subject to few exceptions (Ambac. Assur., 27 NY3d at 624 ["[s]tatements made to the agents or employees of the attorney or client ... retain their confidential (and therefore, privileged) character, where the presence of such third parties is deemed necessary .... So too, when one attorney represents multiple clients concerning a matter of common interest"] [internal citations omitted]) Those exceptions are not present in this case as no communications were made by an agent to an attorney, nor was there a common interest amongst clients. As such, the attorney- client privilege does not attach to the 5/11/15 emails sent 13 of 14 [*FILED: NEW YORK COUNTY CLERK 06/01/2017 10:49 AM 13] NYSCEF DOC.

The presence of third-party Kaye Scholer effectively waived the privilege. Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that plaintiff's motion to compel is granted; and it is further ORDERED that defendant Eaton Vance shall produce to Black Diamond the following documents: Numbers 22 & 29. from its privilege log within twenty (20) days after service of a copy of this order with notice of entry. This memorandum opinion constitutes the decision and order ·of the Court. HON. JEFFREY K. OING, J.S.C. JEFFREY K. OING J.~.c. 14 of 14

1. 
Special Risks: Foreign investments may be volatile and involve additional expenses and special risks, including currency fluctuations, foreign taxes, regulatory and geopolitical risks. Emerging and developing market investments may be especially volatile. Eurozone investments may be subject to volatility and liquidity issues.  Investments in securities of growth companies may be volatile.  Mid-sized company stock is typically more volatile than that of larger company stock.  It may take a substantial period of time to realize a gain on an investment in a mid-sized company, if any gain is realized at all. Diversification does not guarantee profit or protect against loss.

As of 4/12/13, the purchase and exchange of Fund shares is restricted, subject to certain exceptions.  Please see the prospectus for further information.

Emerging and developing market investments may be especially volatile. Eurozone investments may be subject to volatility and liquidity issues.  Investments in securities of growth companies may be volatile.  Mid-sized company stock is typically more volatile than that of larger company stock.  It may take a substantial period of time to realize a gain on an investment in a mid-sized company, if any gain is realized at all. Investing significantly in a particular region, industry, sector or issuer may increase volatility and risk.



4. 
Special Risks: Investing in MLPs involves additional risks as compared to the risks of investing in common stock, including risks related to cash flow, dilution and voting rights. The Fund’s investments are concentrated in the energy infrastructure industry with an emphasis on securities issued by MLPs, which may increase volatility. Energy infrastructure companies are subject to risks specific to the industry such as fluctuations in commodity prices, reduced volumes of natural gas or other energy commodities, environmental hazards, changes in the macroeconomic or the regulatory environment or extreme weather. MLPs may trade less frequently than larger companies due to their smaller capitalizations which may result in erratic price movement or difficulty in buying or selling. Additional management fees and other expenses are associated with investing in MLP funds.

The Fund is subject to certain MLP tax risks. An investment in the Fund does not offer the same tax benefits of a direct investment in an MLP. The Fund is organized as a Subchapter “C” Corporation and is subject to U.S. federal income tax on taxable income at the corporate tax rate (currently as high as 35%) as well as state and local income taxes. The potential tax benefit of investing in MLPs depend on them being treated as partnerships for federal income tax purposes. If the MLP is deemed to be a corporation, its income would be subject to federal taxation at the entity level, reducing the amount of cash available for distribution which could result in a reduction of the fund’s value. MLP funds accrue deferred income taxes for future tax liabilities associated with the portion of MLP distributions considered to be a tax-deferred return of capital and for any net operating gains as well as capital appreciation of its investments. This deferred tax liability is reflected in the daily NAV and as a result a MLP fund's after-tax performance could differ significantly from the underlying assets even if the pre-tax performance is closely tracked.

The Fund is classified as a “non-diversified” fund and may invest a greater portion of its assets in the securities of a single issuer.

The Fund is classified as a “non-diversified” fund and may invest a greater portion of its assets in the securities of a single issuer.

To the extent that a Fund obtains leverage through borrowings, there will be the potential for greater gains and the risk of magnified losses.


6. 
Special Risks: Senior loans are typically lower-rated and may be illiquid investments (which may not have a ready market).  The Fund may invest without limit in below-investment-grade securities.  The Fund may invest a variable amount in debt rated below "B." May invest 25% or more of its assets in securities issued by companies in the financial services sector which may be susceptible to economic and regulatory events, and increased volatility.   Foreign investments may be volatile and involve additional expenses and special risks, including currency fluctuations, foreign taxes, regulatory and geopolitical risks.  Fixed income investing entails credit and interest rate risks. When interest rates rise, bond prices generally fall, and the Fund’s share prices can fall. Derivative instruments entail higher volatility and risk of loss compared to traditional stock or bond investments. Leverage (borrowing) involves transaction and interest costs on amounts borrowed, which may reduce performance.


7. 
Special Risks: An investment in the Fund is subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of principal amount invested. Fund returns may not match the return of its respective index, known as non-correlation risk, due to operating expenses incurred by the Fund. The alternate weighting approach employed by the Fund (i.e., using revenues as a weighting measure), while designed to enhance potential returns, may not produce the desired results. Because the Fund is rebalanced quarterly, portfolio turnover may exceed 100%. The greater the portfolio turnover, the greater the transaction costs, which could have an adverse effect on Fund performance.


8. 
Special Risks: An investment in the Fund is subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of principal amount invested. There is no guarantee that the issuers of stocks will declare dividends in the future, or that dividends will remain at their current levels or increase over time. The Fund is classified as a “non-diversified” fund and may invest a greater portion of its assets in the securities of a single issuer. Investing significantly in a particular region, industry, sector or issuer may increase volatility and risk. Fund returns may not match the return of its respective index, known as non-correlation risk, due to operating expenses incurred by the Fund.

Because the Fund is rebalanced quarterly, portfolio turnover may exceed 100%. The greater the portfolio turnover, the greater the transaction costs, which could have an adverse effect on Fund performance.


9. 
This is a new fund with a limited history and an inception date of 10/28/16.


10. 
Special Risks: An investment in the Fund is subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of principal amount invested. The stocks of companies with favorable ESG practices may underperform the stock market as a whole. Fund returns may not match the return of its respective index, known as non-correlation risk, due to operating expenses incurred by the Fund. The alternate weighting approach employed by the Fund (i.e., using revenues as a weighting measure), while designed to enhance potential returns, may not produce the desired results. Because the Fund is rebalanced quarterly, portfolio turnover may exceed 100%. The greater the portfolio turnover, the greater the transaction costs, which could have an adverse effect on Fund performance.
