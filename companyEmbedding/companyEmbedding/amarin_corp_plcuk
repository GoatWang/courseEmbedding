              Still, a chart of the S&P 500 reveals an undercurrent of bullishness, says Lawrence G. McMillan.

              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

              The dollar was narrowly mixed against major rivals in Tuesday trading, leaving a broad index tracking the greenback little changed ahead of a two-day Federal Reserve meeting that could reveal policy maker thinking on a batch of fuzzy economic readings of late.

	Amarin Reports First Quarter 2017 Financial Results




	and Provides Update on Operations




	Prescription Growth Up >50%; Outcomes Study Beyond 80% Complete





	Re-affirms

	Guidance on Full Year Net Product Revenues of between $155 and $165 Million




	Management to Host Conference Call at 8:00 a.m. ET Today



	BEDMINSTER, N.J., and DUBLIN, Ireland, May 3, 2017  Amarin Corporation plc (NASDAQ:AMRN), a biopharmaceutical company focused on the
	commercialization and development of therapeutics to improve cardiovascular health, today announced financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2017, and provided an update on company operations.


	Key Amarin achievements through March 31, 2017 include:


	 




	 


	


	 



	U.S. revenue growth

	: Recognized $34.3 million in net product revenue from Vascepa

	®

	(icosapent ethyl) sales in Q1 2017 compared to $25.3 million
	in Q1 2016, an increase of 36%.




	 




	 


	


	 



	U.S. prescription growth

	: Increased normalized prescriptions for Vascepa by 52% and 58% compared to Q1 2016 based on data from Symphony Health Solutions and IMS Health, respectively.




	 




	 


	


	 



	International development

	: China regulatory authorities approved the Vascepa clinical trial application (CTA) from Amarins partner, Eddingpharm, paving the way for Eddingpharm to commence a clinical trial
	of Vascepa in China before the end of 2017.




	 




	 


	


	 



	R&D progress

	: Our

	REDUCE-IT

	cardiovascular outcomes study, designed to provide data to support a significantly expanded market opportunity for Vascepa, is progressing
	as planned. Our statistical models indicate that in March 2017, the study reached the onset of approximately 80% of the target aggregate number of primary cardiovascular events. The onset of the target final primary cardiovascular event will likely
	be reached near the end of 2017 in this 8,175 patient study that commenced in 2011.




	 




	 


	


	 



	Cash flow

	: Net cash outflow from operations during Q1 2017 was less than $1.5 million, excluding costs for R&D, interest and royalty. The company aims to be net cash flow positive on this basis for the
	full year with continued quarterly variability.




	 




	 


	


	 



	Cash balance

	: As of March 31, 2017, Amarin had a cash balance of $96.1 million compared to $98.3 million at December 31, 2016. The
	March 31

	st

	cash balance includes approximately $13.7 million in net cash proceeds from the January 2017 redemption of debt and simultaneous issuance of $30.0 million face value of
	new debt long-term.




	 


	1





	Historically, Q1 has been our most challenging quarter for revenue growth due to seasonal factors. We are
	pleased that both revenues and prescriptions for Vascepa grew significantly in Q1, as prescription growth exceeded our internal projections. We are

	on-track

	to achieve our full year 2017 product revenue
	guidance of $155 to $165 million, stated John F. Thero, president and chief executive officer. Our expectations are that

	REDUCE-IT

	study results will be reported in

	mid-2018,

	and we are actively planning for expanded promotion based on anticipated positive results from this study. There is a large unmet medical need that we are seeking to address through demonstration of
	positive results in

	REDUCE-IT.

	We believe the efficacy, safety, oral administration and affordable cost of Vascepa position the product for substantial growth, assuming that

	REDUCE-IT

	results are positive.




	Increases in New and Recurring Prescriptions Drive Steady Commercial
	Growth




	During the first quarter, Amarin again experienced substantial prescription growth and continued increase in Vascepa market share,
	particularly among detailed physicians. Overall, approximately 150,000 patients received prescriptions for Vascepa during the quarter, with new prescriptions growing to approximately 5% of the

	non-statin

	lipid
	modifying market and approaching 30% of the prescription

	omega-3

	market. Strong Vascepa growth is driven by positive physician experience in conjunction with our focused message delivery, compelling efficacy
	and safety data, and improved managed care coverage.


	Estimated normalized total Vascepa prescriptions, based on data from Symphony Health Solutions and
	IMS Health, totaled approximately 305,000 and 335,000, respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 2017. These prescription levels represent growth of approximately 52% and 58%, respectively, from prior year levels.


	During the first quarter of 2017, overall wholesaler inventory levels decreased from

	year-end

	2016 levels calculated
	based on estimated days of Vascepa sales on hand. Consequently, we estimate that this decrease in wholesaler inventory levels adversely impacted net product revenue by approximately $2.8 million to $3.1 million for the first quarter of
	2017. During the first quarter of 2016, wholesaler inventory levels adversely impacted net product revenue by approximately $1.2 million to $1.5 million. We believe that changes in channel inventory at these independent wholesalers and
	retail pharmacies are common and impacted by numerous factors, including holiday timing and recent order trends. We also deduce, based on information available to us, that channel inventory levels at the end of the first quarters of 2017 and 2016
	are within ordinary ranges, and that such levels will continue to vary from quarter to quarter.





	REDUCE-IT

	Cardiovascular Outcomes Study




	The

	REDUCE-IT

	cardiovascular outcomes trial continues to progress on
	schedule. Amarin anticipates the onset of the final primary cardiovascular event to occur near the end of 2017, with report of

	top-line

	results and publications in 2018. The projected timing of available data
	from which we can report

	top-line

	results should be easier to estimate after the interim look which, as discussed below, is scheduled to complete in Q3 2017. We currently estimate that we will report results
	of

	REDUCE-IT

	in

	mid-2018,

	assuming the study goes to completion. These estimates reflect our assumptions of the necessary time needed to collect vital data from all
	patients in the study, compile the results, and subject the results to scrutiny of the independent review committees and the

	REDUCE-IT

	operational team.


	 


	2





	The

	8,175-patient

	outcomes study is evaluating whether treatment with
	Vascepa reduces cardiovascular events in patients who despite stabilized statin therapy, have elevated triglyceride levels and other cardiovascular risk factors. The results of this important trial, if successful, could lead to improved medical care
	for tens of millions of patients. Amarin is positioned to be the first company to complete an outcomes study in the population of patients being studied in

	REDUCE-IT.



	The primary endpoint of this global, double-blind study is the time to the first occurrence of a composite of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE).
	Results will be compared between the Vascepa and placebo groups. The study is being conducted under a Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) agreement with the FDA.


	Preparations are underway for a second

	pre-specified

	interim efficacy and safety analysis of

	REDUCE-IT

	by the independent DMC, since we believe that approximately 80% of the primary cardiovascular events occurred in the

	mid-March

	timeframe. The ensuing analysis should
	be completed before the end of Q3 2017. Consistent with the trial design, Amarin continues to believe that the

	REDUCE-IT

	study is most likely to continue to completion of 100% of the target events. We surmise
	this because the efficacy requirements detailed to the DMC for early study stoppage after the 80% interim assessment are high. Unlike the data analysis at the end of the study, the interim analysis and review by the DMC also includes robustness
	thresholds for certain secondary endpoints. There are potential statistical advantages for the study to run to its full term.


	Amarin will remain blinded
	to results of the

	REDUCE-IT

	study until after the study is stopped and the database is locked at either the 80% interim analysis or at the final analysis.




	International Development of Vascepa




	Our
	international initiatives are progressing positively. Our partner for China, Eddingpharm, submitted the clinical trial application (CTA) to the Chinese regulatory authorities in 2016. This CTA was recently approved, enables Eddingpharm to progress
	into the clinical testing phase, and potentially positions Vascepa to be the first prescription grade EPA product to receive drug approval in China. We believe the commercial opportunity in China is large based on the prevalence of
	hypertriglyceridemia, which is estimated to affect 11.9% of the adult Chinese population. Our partner in China is responsible for the conduct and cost of the clinical studies in China. Amarin will provide the clinical trial material for this study.

	three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 was $34.3 million and $25.3 million, respectively. This increase in net product revenue was primarily attributable to increases both in new and recurring prescriptions of Vascepa driven by
	increased sales productivity and supported by expanded managed care coverage.


	In addition, Amarin recognized licensing revenue of $0.3 million and
	$0.2 million in the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, related to agreements for the commercialization of Vascepa outside the United States. Based upon current estimates, Amarin anticipates approximately
	$1.2 million in licensing revenue to be recognized in aggregate during 2017 from existing agreements.

	Cost of goods sold for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 was $8.2 million and
	$6.9 million, respectively. Gross margin on product sales improved to 76% in the quarter ended March 31, 2017 compared to 73% in the quarter ended March 31, 2016. The improvement in gross margin on product sales was primarily driven
	by lower active pharmaceutical ingredient cost.


	Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses in the three months ended March 31, 2017 and
	2016 were $34.2 million and $28.0 million, respectively. The increase in SG&A expenses primarily reflects a $1.7 million increase in

	co-promotion

	fees accrued under our contract with Kowa
	Pharmaceuticals America, Inc., increased promotional activities, and increased legal costs. The

	co-promotion

	fee is calculated based on gross margin on Vascepa product sales. The increase in

	co-promotion

	fees primarily reflects an increase during Q1 2017 compared to Q1 2016 in gross margin on product sales.


	Research and development expenses in the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 were $10.8 million and $13.7 million, respectively. This
	decrease in expense was primarily driven by the timing of

	REDUCE-IT

	expenses.


	Under GAAP, Amarin reported a net
	loss of $20.9 million in the first quarter of 2017, or basic and diluted loss per share of $0.08. This net loss included $3.4 million in

	non-cash

	stock-based compensation expense. Amarin reported a
	net loss of $29.8 million in the first quarter of 2016, or basic and diluted loss per share of $0.16. This net loss included $3.6 million in

	non-cash

	stock-based compensation expense, a
	$1.3 million

	non-cash

	loss on the change in fair value of derivatives.


	Amarin reported cash and cash
	equivalents of $96.1 million at March 31, 2017. Excluding cash flow related to research and development and financing, net cash outflows in the quarter ended March 31, 2017 were approximately $1.4 million. Cash outflows relating
	to research and development in Q1 2017 were approximately $10.4 million. Cash flow from financing-type activities included approximately $13.7 million in net cash proceeds from the previously announced January 2017 redemption of debt and
	simultaneous issuance of $30.0 million face value of new debt long-term. Cash paid for interest and royalties in Q1 2017 was approximately $4.1 million in aggregate.

	As of March 31, 2017, the company had $29.5 million in net accounts receivable ($34.5 million in
	gross accounts receivable before allowances and reserves) and $23.9 million in inventory.


	As of March 31, 2017, Amarin had approximately
	270.7 million American Depository Shares (ADSs) and ordinary shares outstanding, 32.8 million common share equivalents of Series A Convertible Preferred Shares outstanding and approximately 23.5 million equivalent shares underlying
	stock options at a weighted-average exercise price of $3.25, as well as 9.8 million equivalent shares underlying restricted or deferred stock units.

	VASCEPA has been approved for use by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as an adjunct to diet
	to reduce triglyceride levels in adult patients with severe (

	³

	500 mg/dL) hypertriglyceridemia. VASCEPA is under various stages of development for potential use in other indications that have not been
	approved by the FDA. Nothing in this press release should be construed as promoting the use of VASCEPA in any indication that has not been approved by the FDA.



	Forward-looking statements



	This press release contains
	forward-looking statements, including expectations for continued event rates, interim data review, results and related timing and announcements with respect to Amarins

	REDUCE-IT

	cardiovascular outcomes
	study; expectations related to the interim and final outcomes of the

	REDUCE-IT

	study and the anticipated successful completion of the

	REDUCE-IT

	study; and statements
	regarding the potential and therapeutic benefits of Vascepa. These forward-looking statements are not promises or guarantees and involve substantial risks and uncertainties. In particular, as disclosed in filings with the U.S. Securities and
	Exchange Commission, Amarins ability to effectively develop and commercialize Vascepa will depend in part on its ability to continue to effectively finance its business, efforts of third parties, its ability to create market demand for Vascepa
	through education, marketing and sales activities, to achieve increased market acceptance of Vascepa, to receive adequate levels of reimbursement from third-party payers, to develop and maintain a consistent source of commercial supply at a
	competitive price, to comply with legal and regulatory requirements in connection with the sale and promotion of Vascepa and to maintain patent protection for Vascepa. Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those
	described or projected herein include the following: uncertainties associated generally with research and development, clinical trials and related regulatory approvals; the risk that historical

	REDUCE-IT

	event
	rates may not be predictive of future results and related cost may increase beyond expectations; the risk that regulatory reviews may impact the current design of the

	REDUCE-IT

	study or cause a change in
	strategic direction with respect to continuation of the study; the risk that future legal determinations and interactions with regulatory authorities may impact Vascepa marketing and sales rights and efforts; the risk that Vascepa may not show
	clinically meaningful effects in

	REDUCE-IT

	or support regulatory approvals for cardiovascular risk reduction; and the risk that patents may not be upheld in anticipated patent litigation. A further list and
	description of these risks, uncertainties and other risks associated with an investment in Amarin can be found in Amarins filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including its most recent Quarterly Report on Form

	10-Q.

	Existing and prospective investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. Amarin undertakes no obligation to update or revise the
	information contained in this press release, whether as a result of new information, future events or circumstances or otherwise.

About Environmental, Social & Governance Summary (ESG)



GMI ESG Ratings


GMI AGR® Score & Rating






GMI ESG Ratings
Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Flags:  GMI Ratings publishes Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) ratings on over 6,000 companies worldwide. These ratings provide an independent assessment of the sustainable investment value of public companies.  The ESG Ratings model is based on a carefully crafted and applied list of KeyMetrics® that result in an overall ESG concern level as expressed by Red (High Concern), Yellow (Average Concern), and Green (Low Concern) flags.  Unlike traditional ESG risk models, GMI's rating methodology is designed to identify risks most likely to affect equity valuations. Specifically, these ratings reflect actual corporate behaviors rather than policies or affirmations of intent to adhere to best ESG practices. Further, unlike other models with evenly weighted metrics, we assign context-sensitive relative weightings to our key metrics, based on market, regional, ownership or sector differences.  Individual company scores are then assigned as a percentile rank, ranging from 1 (worst ranked) to 100 (best) on the basis of these KeyMetrics® and then converted to the Red, Yellow or Green flag designation.
Company Reports:  In addition to a company's overall risk rating, ESG reports also include an industry rating based on a comparison between the company's risk levels in each ESG component area relative to its industry peers.  Further, the ESG analysis serves as a summary of behavioral events that contributed to the company's overall risk level.

 More About GMI



GMI Accounting and Governance Risk (AGR) Score & Rating
The GMI Accounting and Governance Risk (AGR) Score & Rating is widely recognized as an indicator of the confidence level surrounding a company's management and reported financials.
Scores range from 0 to 100, and correspond to a risk classification for each company ranging from "Very Aggressive" to "Conservative." The AGR Score is a percentile ranking among the approximately 8,000 companies rated by GMI. Through continued back-testing, GMI has demonstrated a strong correlation between its quarterly AGR Score and the likelihood of adverse events, including securities class action litigation, financial restatements, regulatory enforcement actions, and stock price declines.
				Thus, a company's AGR Score can help investors looking to manage risk or enhance investment performance. GMI forensically analyzes the financial reporting and governance practices of over 8,000 North American-based publicly traded companies.
About GMI
GMI is an independent risk research firm which provides a statistically modeled assessment of corporate integrity. Founded in 2002 in direct response to the growing number of scandals, lawsuits and investor losses resulting from fraudulent corporate behavior, the firm identifies potential high-risk company accounting and governance activity, which in turn has been historically correlated to stock price declines, securities class-action litigation, and material financial restatements. The product of GMI's analysis is a unique risk measure - the AGR Score which can be used by investors as a way to more effectively manage corporate risk.

† The Equity Summary Score provided by Thomson Reuters StarMine is current as of the date specified.  There may be differences between the Equity Summary Score analyst count and the number of underlying analysts listed.  Due to the timing in receiving ratings changes into the Equity Summary Score model, the Equity Summary Score analyst count may lag the ratings count displayed by one or more days.  There may also be analyst count variations for symbols with multiple share classes and ADRs.  More details on Equity Summary Score calculation are included in the Understanding and Using the Equity Summary Score Methodology (PDF).As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.  Royalty trusts may have special tax treatment, so you should consult a tax advisor on the potential tax consequences of investing in them.News, commentary and events are from third-party sources unaffiliated with Fidelity.

 Mutual funds 
You could lose money by investing in a money market fund. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Fidelity Investments and its affiliates, the fund’s sponsor, have no legal obligation to provide financial support to money market funds and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the fund at any time.
Before investing, consider the funds' investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.
 
 Life insurance and variable annuities 

Before investing, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the fund or annuity and its investment options. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.

 Workplace savings plans 
Some of the funds and services described on the Fidelity Sites may not be available or appropriate in a workplace savings plan. Check with your employer for information on any investment restrictions associated with your 401(k), 401(a), 403(b), or 457 savings plan, or nonqualified deferred compensation plan at work. Or, if your workplace savings plan is already with Fidelity, call your toll-free retirement benefits line or log on to Fidelity NetBenefits® to find out more about the investment options available to you in your workplace savings plan.
If you hold Fidelity Advisor Fund assets outside of your employer-sponsored retirement plan, accounts with such assets are not included in the list of Fidelity accounts.
Company Stock Funds are not mutual funds and are unmanaged, non-diversified investment options. The value of your investment in the Company Stock Fund is affected by the performance of the company and the overall stock market, as well as the amount and performance of any short term investments held by the fund.
Managed Income Funds, Commingled Pools and individually managed options, such as Strategies, are not mutual funds. Although individual investment contracts purchased for a managed income fund are backed by the issuer of the debt, units of the fund are not guaranteed by the manager, Plan sponsor or insured by the FDIC.
A summary of the benefits provided under a workplace savings plan is contained in the Summary Plan Description for the plan. Full details are provided in the official plan document, which governs the operation of the plan. In the event that the content of a Fidelity Site or any oral representations made by any person regarding the plan conflict with or are inconsistent with the provisions of the governing plan document, the provisions of the governing plan documents are controlling. The information presented on a Fidelity Site is not intended to create, nor is it to be construed to create, a contract between (1) an employer or a Fidelity Entity and (2) any one of the employer’s employees or other plan participants. Each employer reserves the right to amend, modify, suspend, replace or terminate any of its plans, policies or programs, in whole or in part, including any level or form of coverage, by appropriate company action, without the consent or concurrence of persons affected.

Units of the College Savings Plan Portfolios are municipal securities and may be subject to market volatility and fluctuation.
Please carefully consider the Plan's investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses before investing. For this and other information on any 529 College Savings Plan managed by Fidelity, contact Fidelity for a free Fact Kit, or view online. Read it carefully before you invest or send money.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/25/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

History[edit]
Amarin Corporation was founded in 1993[citation needed] or 1999.[4] In 2002, the company suffered losses worth $37 million, 2003 losses exceeded $19 million. [4] As of 2005 it was developing neurology drugs. It developed Miraxion to treat serious hereditary neurodegenerative disease.[4]
In December 2007, Amarin acquired Ester Neurosciences Limited for 8.1 million USD.[5] In 2011 CEO Joe Zakrzewski said that the company would like to first work on building its infrastructure out to commercialize the drug in the United States.[6]
Products and development[edit]
Vascepa[edit]
Amarin's only product is Vascepa, an approved prescription grade Omega-3 fatty acid drug (Ethyl eicosapentaenoic acid) to treat hypertriglyceridemia. Vascepa's clinical-data trials were the MARINE and ANCHOR studies.
In November 2010, Amarin's MARINE study, which was to treat patients with very high triglycerides (>500 mg/dL), showed Vascepa decreased triglycerides. Unlike Vascepa's competitor Lovaza, which can raise median LDL-C from 40% to 50%, Vascepa did not significantly increase the median LDL-C.[7]
In April 2011, Amarin's ANCHOR study which treated patients with high triglycerides (200 mg/dL to less than 500 mg/dL), Vascepa decreased LDL-C. The studies showed that Vascepa reduced triglyceride levels and other lipid and inflammation biomarkers, including Apo-B, non-HDL-C, Total-Cholesterol, VLDL-C, Lp-PLA2, and hs-CRP.[8]
In July 2012, Vascepa (AMR-101) received FDA-approval.[9][10] competing against GlaxoSmithKline's Lovaza.[11] Unlike Lovaza Vascepa was approved for patients with triglycerides of 200 mg/dL to less than 500 mg/dL.[12][13]
On 10/16/2013 after FDA's ADCOM panel had voted 9-2 against recommending to expand Vascepa's label for treatment of cardiovascular disease, shares dropped over 60%.[citation needed] As of 02/01/2015 their stock price had not recovered.[citation needed]
In March 2016, after losing a court case, the FDA agreed to allow some off-label marketing.[14]

History[edit]
Amarin Corporation was founded in 1993[citation needed] or 1999.[4] In 2002, the company suffered losses worth $37 million, 2003 losses exceeded $19 million. [4] As of 2005 it was developing neurology drugs. It developed Miraxion to treat serious hereditary neurodegenerative disease.[4]
In December 2007, Amarin acquired Ester Neurosciences Limited for 8.1 million USD.[5] In 2011 CEO Joe Zakrzewski said that the company would like to first work on building its infrastructure out to commercialize the drug in the United States.[6]
Products and development[edit]
Vascepa[edit]
Amarin's only product is Vascepa, an approved prescription grade Omega-3 fatty acid drug (Ethyl eicosapentaenoic acid) to treat hypertriglyceridemia. Vascepa's clinical-data trials were the MARINE and ANCHOR studies.
In November 2010, Amarin's MARINE study, which was to treat patients with very high triglycerides (>500 mg/dL), showed Vascepa decreased triglycerides. Unlike Vascepa's competitor Lovaza, which can raise median LDL-C from 40% to 50%, Vascepa did not significantly increase the median LDL-C.[7]
In April 2011, Amarin's ANCHOR study which treated patients with high triglycerides (200 mg/dL to less than 500 mg/dL), Vascepa decreased LDL-C. The studies showed that Vascepa reduced triglyceride levels and other lipid and inflammation biomarkers, including Apo-B, non-HDL-C, Total-Cholesterol, VLDL-C, Lp-PLA2, and hs-CRP.[8]
In July 2012, Vascepa (AMR-101) received FDA-approval.[9][10] competing against GlaxoSmithKline's Lovaza.[11] Unlike Lovaza Vascepa was approved for patients with triglycerides of 200 mg/dL to less than 500 mg/dL.[12][13]
On 10/16/2013 after FDA's ADCOM panel had voted 9-2 against recommending to expand Vascepa's label for treatment of cardiovascular disease, shares dropped over 60%.[citation needed] As of 02/01/2015 their stock price had not recovered.[citation needed]
In March 2016, after losing a court case, the FDA agreed to allow some off-label marketing.[14]
