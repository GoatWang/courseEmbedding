What Does “Award-Winning” Really Say About a Marketing Company?
June 28, 2017 by Scott McKelvey 1 Comment The annual Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity wrapped up last week, awarding major ad agencies for their creative excellence. Among the dozens of awards, there are six in the Creative Effectiveness category that “celebrate the measurable impact of creativity.” That’s right. Six.

June 7, 2017 by Scott McKelvey 2 Comments I get newsletters periodically from companies that provide me a service or product – cable/internet, mortgage, utilities, mobile, email, e-commerce sites, etc. For some reason, I don’t unsubscribe to most of them. Some are amusing for their ineptitude. For some, I’m holding out hope that I’ll someday be the recipient of a promotion that actually has value for my family and me. Maybe the marketing nerd in me is hoping to learn something from a newsletter that’s particularly effective and/or clever.
Read more...Does Your Marketing Content Tell People What to Do or Why to Do It?
May 24, 2017 by Scott McKelvey Leave a Comment New research reported in The Wall Street Journal found that “assertive advertising” is a turnoff to the majority of consumers, especially when that assertiveness comes from brands they love. Most of the conclusions from the study, at least from my perspective after reading the WSJ article, were based on the call-to-action.

May 3, 2017 by Scott McKelvey Leave a Comment My wife and I decided to have a stamped concrete patio built. Not an elaborate backyard oasis, but a place where we could relax with a cup of coffee or a glass of wine, and I could teach my daughters the fine art of grilling. We went to a friend of a friend’s house where a stamped concrete patio was built a year ago. The neighbor was very happy with the contractor, and we loved the look.

April 5, 2017 by Scott McKelvey Leave a Comment This is a great time of year to be a sports fan. Opening Day in baseball. National championship games in college basketball after a month of madness. Playoff hockey and basketball are about to get underway. The Masters in golf. Even the NFL Draft is only a few weeks away. When you think about it, is there any more loyal supporter in the world than a sports fan?

March 15, 2017 by Scott McKelvey 1 Comment By now, we as small business owners know you can’t rattle off a list of products, services, features and benefits, call it marketing, and expect people to hire us. There’s too much competition, and people have instant access to too much information. Trust in traditional advertising has eroded after decades of banging people over the head with deceptive sales pitches that insult their intelligence.

March 1, 2017 by Scott McKelvey Leave a Comment When you watch those house flipping shows on TV, you see people spending tens of thousands of dollars on kitchens, bathrooms and additions. High-end counters, cabinets and fixtures. More square footage. But when it comes to home improvements that deliver the highest ROI, guess what project lands at the top of the list without fail, year after year?

February 15, 2017 by Scott McKelvey 1 Comment I don’t believe in absolutes when it comes to marketing. “Every business should be doing this.” “This is always a big mistake.” “This approach always works.” There are exceptions to every rule, including the one about never using jargon in your marketing content.

Here’s how a ransomware attack typically works.

This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

Why REI’s #OptOutside Anti-Black Friday Stand Is a Winner
November 3, 2015 by Scott McKelvey Last week, REI (Recreational Equipment, Inc.) announced that all of its 143 stores would be closed on Black Friday. REI’s 12,000 employees are encouraged to enjoy the outdoors and will receive a paid day off. REI CEO Jerry Stritzke explains…

September 15, 2015 by Scott McKelvey In my former life as a creative director in radio, my first question to a sales rep who asked for a new commercial script was, “What’s the goal of the campaign?” I remember a certain sales rep who liked to respond by saying, “Branding. They just need to get their name out there.” Then I would look at the order to find out the duration of the campaign. Typically, it was scheduled to run anywhere from a couple weeks to couple months.

March 3, 2015 by Scott McKelvey Leave a Comment Legend has it that the origins of the elevator pitch go back to old Hollywood. A screenwriter would follow a studio executive into an elevator and pitch an idea in the time it took for the executive to reach his or her floor.
The elevator pitch has become a popular tool at networking events, conferences and random meetings when people have a limited time to pique someone’s interest in a product, service or themselves. If the elevator pitch is successful, a more in-depth conversation will ensue at some point. If not, you’ll be forgotten.
