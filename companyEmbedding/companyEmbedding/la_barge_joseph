   Joseph LaBarge (1815 - 1899)  

Introduction





    St. Louis, Missouri

Joseph LaBarge was a famous steamboat captain on the  Missouri River. During his fifty-year career, he never lost a boat. LaBarge's  career on the river mirrored the rise and decline of the steamboat industry as  interstate river commerce grew until it was eclipsed by the emerging railroad  industry.

 
 
 Early Years and Education





    Joseph LaBarge

Joseph LaBarge. 
This image shows Joseph LaBarge as a young man.
 [History of Early Steamboat Navigation on the Missouri River, by Hiram Martin Chittenden, 1903, opposite page 1. SHS REF F540 C44 v. 1] 


Joseph LaBarge was born on October 1, 1815, to  Joseph Marie and Eulalie Hortiz LaBarge in St. Louis, Missouri, the second of  seven children. Joseph's parents personified the cultural diversity of early  St. Louis. His father, a French Canadian, immigrated to St. Louis in 1808 and  worked as a fur trader. His mother was the daughter of a Spanish military  attaché who served as secretary to the last two Spanish lieutenant governors of  the Upper Louisiana Territory.




The Steamer Yellowstone

 [Karl Bodmer's North American Prints, edited by Brandon K. Ruud, 2004, page 97. SHS REF 917.8 B6318] 


Joseph grew up on a farm on the outskirts of  north St. Louis. At school he learned to speak English, as his family spoke French,  the primary language used in the Upper Louisiana Territory during his youth. He  spent three years as a student at St. Mary's College in Perry County, Missouri,  before leaving at the age of fifteen to begin working. Bored with his job as a store  clerk, he joined the crew of the steamboat Yellowstone as a clerk. The following spring, LaBarge signed a contract with the  American Fur Company to work as a clerk for $700 for three years. He once again  boarded the Yellowstone and traveled  up the Missouri River to Council Bluffs, Iowa, and spent the next few years  working in the western fur trade.



 


The Age of the Steamboat





    Map of Fur Trading Posts

Map of Fur Trading Posts. 
This map shows the location of fur trading posts located along the Missouri River. LaBarge and other 'mountain steamboat' pilots traveled from St. Louis, Missouri, up the river as far as present-day Montana to deliver items on behalf of the American Fur Company, one of the most powerful and influential fur companies of its time.
 [Courtesy of the National Park Service] 


When overtrapping led to the decline of beavers  in the eastern United States, merchants, fur traders, and fur trappers like Manuel  Lisa and the Chouteau family of St. Louis expanded west up the Missouri  River in search of new, unexploited beaver populations. Trading posts sprang up  along the river in what is now South Dakota, North Dakota, and Montana. Native Americans  brought beaver pelts and buffalo hides to exchange for goods like guns,  blankets, and cloth while fur traders dropped off their furs to be shipped to  St. Louis for market and picked up supplies. The fastest way to ship furs and  travel from the Upper Missouri region to St. Louis was to travel by steamboat,  a new form of transportation developed in the early 1800s, as the  transcontinental railroad did not exist yet.
Prior to the steamboat, travelers used a variety  of boats such as canoes, keelboats, mackinaws, and bullboats to go up and down  the river. These boats were powered by man, wind, or river current, whereas a  steamboat is powered by a steam engine and propelled forward by paddlewheels  mounted on the rear or sides of the boat.




Watching the Cargo

Watching the Cargo.
The painting Watching the Cargo by famed artist George Caleb Bingham depicts crew members guarding the cargo of a steamboat, seen in the distance, which has hit a snag.
 [The State Historical Society of Missouri, Art Collection (1927.0001)] 


Prior to channeling in the twentieth century, the Missouri River was not very deep, so steamboats  were designed with a long, broad hull for operating in shallow water and had  multiple decks with a pilot house on top. The pilot house is where the boat's  wheel, used to steer the boat, was located. The pilot stood at the wheel  watching the river ahead, ready to steer the boat away from any obstacles.  Steamboats required lots of wood to fuel the fire needed to create steam to  power the boat's engine. Steamboats with paddlewheels mounted on the back were  called sternwheelers, while those with paddlewheels on the sides of the boat  were known as sidewheelers.
The captain managed the business affairs of the  boat while the pilot was responsible for navigation. Some captains also served  as pilots; others did not. Captain LaBarge did both. Mark  Twain, who grew up on the Mississippi River in Hannibal, idolized steamboat  pilots, writing, "A pilot, in those days, was the only unfettered and entirely  independent human being that lived in the earth."




 
 

Danger on the River





    Snags

Snags. 
Swiss artist Karl Bodmer accompanied German Prince Maximilian Alexander Philipp of Wied-Neuwied on an expedition up the Missouri River. Bodmer painted and sketched the natural landscape and the animals that inhabited it. He was one of the first artists to bring accurate, colorful images of the American West to American and European audiences.This image depicts the dangers that sunken trees, also known as "snags," presented to steamboats. Pilots relied on memory, nerve, and skill to keep their boats from harm.
 [Karl Bodmer's North American Prints, edited by Brandon K. Ruud, 2004, page 102. SHS REF 917.8 B6318] 


Steamboat pilots like LaBarge confronted a  variety of problems on the river: submerged trees, gravel bars, ice, violent  thunderstorms, and even attacks by Native Americans. If a boat became snagged  on a tree or other obstruction, it could be lost. Pilots constantly watched for  anything that could damage the boat and carefully navigated sharp bends, swift  rapids, and other boats. Over time, an experienced pilot memorized the river  but floods and high water continually reshaped it, creating new obstacles.  Mother Nature, however, was not the only source of concern for steamboat crews.  Both steamboat passengers and crew members had to worry about mechanical  problems, the most serious of which was a boiler explosion.




    Explosion of the Saluda

Explosion of the Saluda. 
Traveling on a steamboat came with its share of dangers. On April 9, 1852, the steamboat Saluda suffered a catastrophic boiler explosion on the Missouri River near Lexington, Missouri. This is an artist's rendering of what the explosion may have looked like.
 [The State Historical Society of Missouri, Photograph Collection (024981)] 


In 1852 the steamboat Saluda suffered a catastrophic boiler explosion as it left  Lexington, Missouri. Dozens of passengers were killed, including LaBarge's  brother and brother-in-law, who were working as pilots on the Saluda. Fire was another worry. Because  they were made of wood, boats could be set on fire and destroyed by a misplaced  cigar or spark. After the passage of the Steamboat Act of 1852, the federal  government began regulating the steamboat industry to help prevent passenger  deaths from accidents such as fires, collisions, and explosions. Captains and  pilots had to earn their licenses, which could be revoked for safety  violations.


 
 

Steamboat Pilot





Pilot's License

Pilot's License. 
This is a photograph of Joseph LaBarge's steamboat license from 1897. Licenses could be revoked or suspended for a variety of things such as faulty equipment, reckless behavior, drunkenness, and sleeping on duty.
 [E. B. Trail Collection, 1858-1965 (C2071), The State Historical Society of Missouri, Manuscript Collection-Columbia] 


LaBarge's first experience piloting a steamboat  occurred in 1833 when passengers on the Yellowstone became ill with cholera. Many of the passengers and crew died, including the  pilot, engineer, and fireman. The boat's captain returned to St. Louis to hire  a new crew, leaving LaBarge in command. When settlers living near the river  heard that the Yellowstone had  experienced a cholera outbreak, they threatened to burn the steamboat unless it  was moved away from their settlement. Without any assistance, LaBarge fired up  the boilers and moved the boat upstream away from harm. After his contract with  the American Fur Company ended, LaBarge began working on steamboats full-time  in various positions and developed a reputation as a skilled pilot.




    John James Audubon

This is a portrait of famed naturalist John James Audubon, who became famous with the publication of his celebrated book Birds of America. In 1843 Audubon traveled up the Missouri River to document animals he had not yet seen. The resulting book was The Viviparous Quadrupeds Of North America. Audubon was one of many celebrities that LaBarge met during his fifty-year career on the Missouri River.
 [Courtesy of the White House Historical Association] 


On August 17, 1842, LaBarge married Pelagie  Guerette. The couple had seven children together: five boys and two girls. The  following year, La Barge served as pilot of the steamboat Omega. Among the passengers was distinguished naturalist and artist  John J. Audubon, who was on his final trip west to study and document American  wildlife.
By 1845 boat traffic on the Missouri River was  growing as steamboats now carried not just furs and supplies but also artists,  settlers, missionaries, Native Americans, miners, explorers, slaves,  scientists, and fur traders, leading some to call it the "Highway of the  Plains." Some of the steamboats that carried passengers became more luxurious,  while others remained devoted to hauling cargo. In 1846 LaBarge purchased his  first steamboat, the General Brooks,  for $12,000—the rough equivalent of over half a million dollars today. He sold  it the next year and built a new steamboat, the Martha. Over the years, LaBarge owned or leased a number of boats.




    Steamboat Log

Steamboat Log. 
Some steamboat pilots relied on more than memory and skill. Edmund Gray was a steamboat captain on the Mississippi River. He recorded detailed observations of the river and steering directions in a ledger that is called a pilot's log.
 [Edmund Gray Papers, 1831-1955 (C3611), The State Historical Society of Missouri, Manuscript Collection-Columbia] 


Like many steamboat captains, LaBarge often  contracted with the American Fur Company to transport passengers and freight up  the river; other times he worked for the federal government, or even chose to  work for himself. No matter the job, LaBarge met a wide variety of people on board  his boat.
In 1851 LaBarge piloted the steamboat St. Ange up the Missouri to Fort Union  with Father Pierre De Smet, a famous Catholic missionary, as one of his  passengers. That same year, at the age of thirty-six, LaBarge decided to retire.  His retirement was short-lived, however, and he had the honor of transporting  Abraham Lincoln, not yet president, on one of his boats during Lincoln's 1859  visit to Council Bluffs, Iowa. In 1861 LaBarge and some partners founded  LaBarge, Harkness & Company, whose main rival was the American Fur Company.



 
 

Civil War Years

 [St. Louis Tri-Weekly Republican, October 21, 1862, Page 4] 


During the Civil War, Captain LaBarge remained  loyal to the Union. On one occasion, his life was threatened when a group of  Southern sympathizers traveling on LaBarge's steamboat cheered for Confederate  President Jefferson Davis while leaving St. Joseph for Leavenworth, Kansas.  Thinking LaBarge was disloyal, a group of Leavenworth residents threatened to  hang him when the steamboat arrived, but he was warned in time by his friend  Alexander Majors, one of the cofounders of the Pony Express.

 
 



De Smet

[James T. Thorp Scrapbooks, 1840-1955 (C1429), The State Historical Society of Missouri, Manuscript Collection-Columbia] 




On another occasion, Confederate general John S.  Marmaduke seized LaBarge, his crew, and his steamboat at Boonville and forced  him to transport Sterling  Price, another Confederate general who was ill, to Lexington, Missouri. The  episode got LaBarge into trouble with Union authorities, but he continued to  operate on the river for the rest of the war.
In 1862 LaBarge, who was piloting his boat the Emilie, encountered an American Fur  Company boat, the Spread Eagle. The  two raced to see which boat could go the fastest. When the captain of the Spread Eagle discovered he was going to  lose, he rammed his boat into the Emilie.  Angered by such reckless action, LaBarge threatened to shoot the other captain  unless he stopped his engines, which he promptly did. The Emilie was badly damaged, and the captain of the Spread Eagle later lost his pilot's  license due to his irresponsible behavior.




    Emilie LaBarge

Emilie LaBarge. 
This photograph shows steamboats along the waterfront in St. Louis. One of them is the Emilie LaBarge, one of many steamboats that Joseph LaBarge built and piloted during his career. It was the second boat named after his daughter Emilie; the first was simply known as Emilie.
 [James T. Thorp Scrapbooks, 1840-1955 (C1429), The State Historical Society of Missouri, Manuscript Collection-Columbia] 


The following year, LaBarge contracted with the  federal government to transport goods promised to Native Americans upriver to  Fort Pierre, Dakota Territory. Upon arrival, the government officials in charge  of distribution did not give the Sioux Indians all of their goods. Angered by the  agents' deception, the Sioux followed LaBarge's steamboat over six hundred  miles, shooting at passengers. At a place called Tobacco Garden in what is now  North Dakota, 1,500 Sioux waited to ambush the boat, but were repelled by the  crew. The remaining goods were stored in an American Fur Company warehouse at  Fort Union, Dakota Territory, and were to be picked up the next year by  LaBarge. When he returned to pick up the goods, LaBarge discovered the American  Fur Company had sold them, leaving him with a $20,000 loss. Within a short  period, LaBarge, Harkness & Company went out of business, leaving LaBarge  $100,000 in debt.


 
 

End of an Era





    Railroads in 1890

Railroads in 1890. 
This map illustrates the growth and expansion of railroads across the United States by 1890. After 1869, railroads quickly became the primary method of passenger and freight transportation in America. Steamboats continued to operate, but in much smaller numbers each year.
 [American Railroads: Their Growth and Development, by Association of American Railroads, 1951] 


LaBarge continued to work as a captain and  pilot, but by the 1860s the golden age of the steamboat was over. In 1869 the  first transcontinental railroad in the United States was completed, connecting  Council Bluffs, Iowa, to San Francisco, California. A new era of transportation  began as additional rail lines were built, stretching like a spider web across  America and making cross-country travel faster and easier. Companies could ship  freight between cities and states much more quickly and reliably than ever  before for less money. Thirty years later, the steamboat industry had almost  disappeared from the Missouri River.


 
 

Death & Legacy





    Joseph LaBarge

 [St. Louis Republican, January 9, 1898, Page 8] 


In 1885 Captain LaBarge retired from the river. A  year later, a St. Louis Board of Trade report stated, "The business on this  river [the Missouri] has been more affected by railroad competition, than any  other river in the West. Steamboats could not compete with a railroad on either  bank, and where in 1866 there were in active service seventy-one Steamers,  there are now but seven Steamers and three Tow boats, and these ply only  between St. Louis and Kansas City."
LaBarge worked for the city of St. Louis from  1890 to 1894 and then took a job with the federal government compiling a list  of steamboat wrecks on the Missouri River. After an unsuccessful surgery on a neck  tumor, Joseph LaBarge died of blood poisoning on April 3, 1899, in St. Louis.  He is buried in Calvary Cemetery. LaBarge Rock, a natural rock feature overlooking  the Missouri River in Chouteau County, Montana, is named in his honor.

What are analysts saying about Spark Therapeutics stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Spark Therapeutics stock: 
1. Chardan Capital analysts commented, "We continue to expect ENDP shares to be range-bound in the near to medium term. Our recent analysis of ENDP’s additional unfunded mesh liability and discussion with a legal expert familiar with mass tort/product liability defense ligation supports our view ENDP will remain highly levered (in the 4s) and the company’s turnaround will take several years. While we view any of our potential settlement scenarios for the company’s additional unfunded mesh liability to be manageable, we believe continued pricing pressure in ENDP’s US generics base business, need for additional advertising and promotion spend to support Xiaflex growth and inability to grow through meaningful acquisitions leave ENDP little room for error." (7/24/2017)
2. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Spark Therapeutics, Inc. offers gene therapy. The Company's product candidate consist of SPK-RPE65, SPK-CHM, SPK-FIX which are in different clinical phases, for the treatment of additional blinding conditions, hematologic disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. Spark Therapeutics, Inc. is based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.   " (7/19/2017)
3. Cantor Fitzgerald analysts commented, "2017 – Year of First Gene Therapy Approval in U.S.? Management reiterated its confidence in filing its rolling BLA in early 2017, and highlighted that the company has completed the necessary manufacturing runs to support its submission. Outstanding items for the filing include finalization of stability testing and CMC module write-up. We believe the timing of the filing could lead to the first approved gene therapy in the U.S. this year and remind investors that the FDA previously amended its granted orphan designation for voretigene neparvovec to cover inherited retinal diseases caused by biallelic RPE65 mutations." (2/23/2017)
4. Stifel Nicolaus analysts commented, "Management's 4Q16 earnings announcement/call contained minimally-incremental insight on many of the data catalysts still anticipated for 1H17. We believe management's commentary around the current state of pre-commercialization activities for voretigene neparvovec (VN) ' including directionally positive feedback on both the access and reimbursement fronts ' should ameliorate some of the near-term concerns of those investors anticipating pricing/reimbursement to potentially represent a source of headline risk. We believe anticipation around a number of key near-term data catalysts ' including early-FY17 SPK-7001 data in choroideremia, updated early-April SPK-9001 data in hemophilia B, and preliminary mid-FY17 SPK-8011 data ' should keep ONCE shares at the forefront of relevancy over the coming months. Estimates largely unchanged." (2/23/2017)
