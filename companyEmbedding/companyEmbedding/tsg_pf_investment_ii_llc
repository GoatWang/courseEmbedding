About Peet's Coffee & Tea


      Peet's Coffee & Tea is a U.S. specialty coffee company founded by Alfred 
      Peet in 1966 in Berkeley, CA. Mr. Peet grew up in the coffee trade and 
      moved to America from Holland after World War II. Mr. Peet’s coffee 
      style was unlike anything Americans had ever tasted before - small 
      batches, fresh beans and a superior quality roast that is rich and 
      complex. Alfred Peet's influence of the artisan coffee movement inspired 
      a new generation of coffee entrepreneurs, including the founders of 
      Starbucks. Today, Peet’s Coffee upholds its commitment to high quality 
      and freshness by sourcing the world’s best beans, roasting in small 
      batches, and maintaining a strict standard of freshness through its 
      unique direct store delivery network. Peet's continues to grow its 
      business through its retail, grocery and e-commerce channels while 
      maintaining the premium quality of its coffee. Peet’s is a private 
      business owned by JAB Holding Co. For more information visit www.peets.com.

Direct Capital Invests in Transaction Services Limited
                    29/01/2010

Direct Capital, through its Direct Capital IV and Pohutukawa II funds, has invested $24 million to acquire a 49% interest in Transaction Services Limited, Australasia’s largest third party recurring payment processing company.Operating under the brands Debitsuccess and FFA Paysmart, Transaction Services manages the payment processing function for clients in a wide range of industries including health and fitness facilities, sports clubs, property management companies, maintenance providers, home service providers, and insurance companies.The Transaction Services model allows its clients customers to pay for goods or services on any frequency and over any time period, giving them the ability to match their cash flow with their payment commitments, without the penalty of incurring interest costs.As a part of its service offering the group companies include a debt collection service and a call centre to handle customer queries relating to their financial contractual relationship with their suppliers.As a combined offering the companies clients experience considerable cost savings when outsourcing this component of their business, freeing up their time to deal with other aspects of their businesses.The company recently launched its Online Management Gateway product which allows businesses to incorporate a direct debit facility into their websites, offering greater flexibility in the way online payments are completed.The investment in Transaction Services is the first investment from the Direct Capital IV and Pohutukawa II funds, both of which completed fund raising in 2009. Combined, the funds raised $325 million, well above the firm’s initial target of $250 million.“When we launched Direct Capital IV we were conscious that the fund raising environment was very difficult”, commented managing director, Ross George. “But we were confident that our investors understood that the next three to four years would be an exceptional period for investing in private companies as the economy emerges from recession”.“In good economic periods it’s expensive for companies to grow market share but in tough economic conditions market share is well and truly up for grabs. Companies that are well-capitalised have a unique opportunity to grow in this market and we can provide that capital”.“Direct Capital IV will be a continuation of what we have been doing for 15 years now, investing in well-established private companies and providing them capital to grow, facilitating a change of ownership from an older owner to their management, funding an acquisition of complementary business, or investing in and helping a company through to a share market listing.”With an impressive track record, Transaction Services is an ideal investment for Direct Capital IV. Transaction Services was established in 1994 and annually processes more than 13 million transactions on behalf of over 2,000 clients, from their 500,000 customers in New Zealand and Australia.Of the investment by Direct Capital, Transaction Services’ managing director Allan Dickinson commented “Transaction Services has achieved excellent growth over the last five years and looks forward to continuing that growth with Direct Capital as a shareholder”.

GREENWICH, Conn., Sept. 18, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- Catterton Partners, the leading consumer-focused private equity firm, today announced that it has closed its seventh buyout fund, Catterton Partners VII, L.P., as well as its second growth fund, Catterton Growth Partners II, L.P.  With the closing of these two funds, which include a combined $2.1 billion of Limited and General Partner commitments, Catterton now has over $4.0 billion under active management focused on growing well-positioned consumer companies.  
Both funds were significantly over-subscribed.  To help accommodate the investor demand, Catterton Partners VII increased its hard cap from $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion.  Catterton Growth Partners II, which was raised in just three months, also increased its hard cap, from $350 million to $400 million.  Both funds received continued strong support from existing investors and also attracted new investors.  The broad LP base consists of leading global public pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, insurance companies, endowments, foundations, and family offices.  
Consistent with Catterton's proven investment strategy, both funds will target control-oriented investments in high growth consumer companies in attractive categories.  Catterton Partners VII will target companies with enterprise values typically from $100 million to more than $1 billion.  Similar to the first Growth fund, Catterton Growth Partners II will target companies with enterprise values that are generally less than $100 million.
"We are pleased to have closed two new funds at levels that exceeded our expectations," said J. Michael Chu, Co-Managing Partner of Catterton Partners.  "Over the last 24 years, Catterton has built a leading franchise in consumer investing.  The great success we have enjoyed since our inception would not be possible without the support of our limited partners and the outstanding work of the management teams with whom we partner.  Our ability to close these funds in a short period of time is a testament to our strategy and solidifies our leadership in consumer-focused investing.  We look forward to continuing to leverage our expertise to help high-growth consumer companies realize their full potential."
"We were honored to earn the overwhelming support of investors in these two funds, which surpassed our targets," said Scott A. Dahnke, Co-Managing Partner of Catterton Partners.  "Catterton is well known for building market-leading consumer growth companies, powered by strong brands with deep consumer appeal.  We will continue to pursue the strategy our firm has followed since our inception: partnering with management teams of well-positioned consumer companies to build outstanding brands.  We look forward to continued success and to delivering strong returns in Fund VII and Growth Fund II."   
Fund VII has already completed three investments in Primanti Brothers, PIRCH and CorePower Yoga.  Growth Partners II has already completed its first investment in Snap Kitchen.   
The final close of these two funds follows a very active 18 months in which Catterton exited 11 portfolio companies and completed 12 new investments.  Recent exited investments include Plum Organics, MonoSol, Heartland RV, and O.N.E Coconut Water.  In addition, three of Catterton's portfolio companies completed successful IPOs, including Restoration Hardware, Bloomin' Brands Inc., and Noodles & Company.  Over the past year, the firm also expanded its deep team of investment and operating professionals and now has 18 investment and operating partners and 42 investment professionals, arguably the largest and most experienced team in the middle market.
Catterton's previous buyout fund, Catterton Partners VI L.P., closed in June 2006 with $1 billion in commitments.  Its previous growth fund, Catterton Growth Partners, L.P., closed in April 2008 with $316 million in commitments.
