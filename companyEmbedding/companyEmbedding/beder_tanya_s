FINANCIAL ENGINEERING
The Robert W. Kolb Series in Finance is an unparalleled source
of information dedicated to the most important issues in modern
finance. Each book focuses on a specific topic in the field of
finance and contains contributed chapters from both respected
academics and experienced financial professionals. As part of the
Robert W. Kolb Series in Finance, Financial Engineering aims to
provide a comprehensive understanding of this important discipline
by examining its fundamentals, the newest financial products, and
disseminating cutting-edge research.
A contributed volume of distinguished practitioners and
academics, Financial Engineering details the different
participants, developments, and products of various
marketsfrom fixed income, equity, and derivatives to foreign
exchange. Also included within these pages are comprehensive case
studies that reveal the various issues associated with financial
engineering. Through them, you'll gain instant insights from the
stories of Countrywide (mortgages), Société
Générale and Barings (derivatives), the Allstate
Corporation (fixed income), AIG, and many others. There is also a
companion website with details from the editors' survey of
financial engineering programs around the globe, as well as a
glossary of key terms from the book.
Financial engineering is an evolving field in constant revision.
Success, innovation, and profitability in such a dynamic area

                           "A comprehensive guide to the essential aspects of financial engineering Divided into four informative parts, this resource
                              puts financial engineering in perspective and gives readers a better understanding of how it can be applied in real-world
                              situations. Readers will gain familiarity with the different players, developments, and products of various markets-from fixed
                              income, equity, and derivatives to foreign exchange-and learn about the role financial engineering has played in each one.
                              Financial engineering is widely accepted around the globe, and this book has the information and insights that will allow
                              readers to enhance their understanding of such a complex field. Part of the Robert W. Kolb Series in Finance, this book will
                              be the essential guide to this complex and ever-evolving topic. Tanya S. Beder (New York, NY) is currently Chairman of SBCC
                              in New York. She has written numerous articles in the financial area that have been published. Cara M. Marshall (Port Jefferson,
                              NY) co-founded Marshall, Tucker & Associates, which has served the financial services industry since the 1980s as a derivatives
                              consulting and financial engineering firm. Robert W. Kolb (Chicago, IL) is the Frank W. Considine Chair of Applied Ethics
                              and Professor of Finance at Loyola University, Chicago."--

FINANCIAL ENGINEERING
The Robert W. Kolb Series in Finance is an unparalleled source
of information dedicated to the most important issues in modern
finance. Each book focuses on a specific topic in the field of
finance and contains contributed chapters from both respected
academics and experienced financial professionals. As part of the
Robert W. Kolb Series in Finance, Financial Engineering aims to
provide a comprehensive understanding of this important discipline
by examining its fundamentals, the newest financial products, and
disseminating cutting-edge research.
A contributed volume of distinguished practitioners and
academics, Financial Engineering details the different
participants, developments, and products of various
marketsfrom fixed income, equity, and derivatives to foreign
exchange. Also included within these pages are comprehensive case
studies that reveal the various issues associated with financial
engineering. Through them, you'll gain instant insights from the
stories of Countrywide (mortgages), Société
Générale and Barings (derivatives), the Allstate
Corporation (fixed income), AIG, and many others. There is also a
companion website with details from the editors' survey of
financial engineering programs around the globe, as well as a
glossary of key terms from the book.
Financial engineering is an evolving field in constant revision.
Success, innovation, and profitability in such a dynamic area
require being at the forefront of research as new products and
models are introduced and implemented. If you want to enhance your
understanding of this discipline, take the time to learn from the
experts gathered here.

All your photos, together at last    
    
    



Free unlimited photo storage    
    
    



Your Prime membership comes with free unlimited photo storage through Prime Photos, which lets you securely save as many photos as you like and see them on your phone, computer, or tablet. You can share this Prime benefit and give free photo storage to up to five family members or friends. Collect photos together with your invited family and friends in the Family Vault and store memories from everyone in one safe place. New photo search technology makes it easy to find specific photos by searching for things like “sunset” or “Seattle,” and your photos are organized automatically so it’s easy to find and enjoy them.
