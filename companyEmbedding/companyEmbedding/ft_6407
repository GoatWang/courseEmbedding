Item #: MPR-215F-PA


		The MPR Series Biomedical Refrigerator and Freezer Combinations from Panasonic are designed for specific vaccine and biological storage applications, making them ideal for clinics, hospitals, pharmacies, clinical labs, and medical offices. The MPR-215F-PA combines high performance refrigeration with advanced control and alarm monitoring systems as well as energy efficient and cost-effective cabinet design. All housed within one unit, the refrigerator uses fan-forced air circulation (cycle defrost) to keep the inner refrigerated cabinet at an average temperature of +4°C while the freezer uses direct cooling (manual defrost) to cool the inner freezer cabinet down to temperatures as low as -30°C. This space-saving refrigerator with freezer features two separate compressors (one for each section), a microprocessor controller, two access ports (one for each section), casters, remote alarm contacts, and key locks. The MPR Series Biomedical Refrigerator and Freezer Combos have all the right features for even the strictest applications including: advanced temperature controls, precise uniformity, temperature stability, energy savings, and accurate alarms and monitoring.

			Refrigeration Systems: Separate refrigeration systems and compressors allow differential control of individual refrigerator and freezer compartments. The freezer system maintains temperatures as low as -30°C, while the refrigerator system allows for temperatures between 2°C to 8°C.

			Cycle Defrost: Unique cycle defrost (refrigerator only) initiates only as required and maintains internal temperature uniformity without fluctuations

			Microprocessor Controls: Comprehensive set point, alarm, monitoring and diagnostic functions are maintained by Panasonic-built microprocessor controller with digital display of all critical functions.

			Validated Storage: MPR refrigeration systems are designed to meet regulatory guidelines for vaccine and biologicals storage. Therefore, it assures product safety during storage

                    My favorite places to take family and friends, and I encourage my clients also is to take in, the Alamo, walk around it, read about it, and then go across the street, down some steps to the San Antonio River.   I love this area, good food, good music, some pretty good jazz,  good shopping and lots of flavor of San Antonio.  If you want to take a day trip around the historical missions,  rent a bike and take a ride.   So much history of this area surrounds these missions and they are fun to visit and a great day trip on the bike, or an afternoon in a car. Of course the Majestic Theater and the new Tobin Center of Performing Arts should be at the top of your list to visit.

                    Buying the right home can be very challenging these days.  How's it working for you?  In my past experience, what I've found is that most agents just don't have a plan to help their buyers.  
My technique may be a little different, but my buyers ALWAYS find exactly what they've been dreaming about.  How?  I take the time and sit down with you and your family and really get to know you during a consultation.  I will only show you properties that matches what you want.  I will negotiate aggressively on your behalf.  I will help make the process as stress free as possible.  Hire me and you'll recognize that I do so much more than the average agent!

                    San Antonio is a great town with a diverse population. There is something here for everyone. If you are a foodie, you should check out the hot new restaurants in Southtown. Love craft beer and live music, check out the Alamo Beer Company. Love local fare, you have to head out to the Pearl Market at the Pearl Brewery. Want to immerse yourself in the culture, set your sights on Market Square. Lastly, San Antonio has the River Walk once described as the American Venice! On the River Walk one can take a river boat tour, grab a margarita at one of the many restaurants that line the river, ghost hunt at the historic Menger, visit the Alamo where Davy Crockett and the Texian Army took their last stand against Santa Anna and so much more. Once you get here you'll never want to leave, trust me, I'm a transplant!

Roche Holding AGPositive Phase III Results of Genentech’s Actemra (Tocilizumab) for the Treatment of Giant Cell Arteritis Published in New England Journal of MedicineTwitterFacebookLinkedInGooglePlusRedditPinterestUrlJul 26 2017 22:06 BSTSource: Business Wire


Fifty-six percent of patients treated with subcutaneous Actemra
        weekly with a steroid taper phase achieved steroid-free disease
        remission at one year, versus 14 percent in the placebo plus 26-week
        steroid taper group

1



Actemra is the first FDA-approved treatment for adults with giant
        cell arteritis (GCA), which has had no new treatments in more than 50
        years



SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jul. 26, 2017--
      Genentech, a member of the Roche Group (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY),
      announced today that data from the Phase III GiACTA study, which
      evaluated Actemra® (tocilizumab) in adult patients with GCA,
      were published in the July 27, 2017 issue of the New England Journal
      of Medicine.
    

      The primary endpoint of the study was met; Actemra combined with a
      26-week steroid taper regimen showed superiority in achieving sustained
      remission at 52 weeks (56 percent [Actemra-weekly group; p<0.0001] and
      53.1 percent [Actemra-biweekly group; p<0.0001]) compared to placebo
      combined with a 26-week steroid taper regimen (14 percent).1

      The study also met its key secondary endpoint, demonstrating that
      Actemra combined with a 26-week steroid taper regimen showed superiority
      in achieving sustained remission at 52 weeks (56 percent [Actemra-weekly
      group; p<0.0001] and 53.1 percent [Actemra-biweekly group; p=0.0002])
      compared to placebo combined with a 52-week steroid taper regimen (17.6
      percent).1

      No new safety signals were observed1 and the safety profile
      of the Actemra groups was generally consistent with the documented
      safety profile of Actemra in other indications.
    

      “The publication of these Phase III results in the New England
      Journal of Medicinevalidates the significance of our considerable
      basic and clinical autoimmune disease research in medical practice,”
      said Sandra Horning, M.D., chief medical officer and head of Global
      Product Development. “The data from GiACTA supported the FDA approval of
      the first new treatment option for patients with GCA in more than 50
      years, and we are committed to continuing to explore new treatment
      options for autoimmune diseases with significant unmet medical need.”
    

      In May 2017, the FDA approved Actemra subcutaneous injection for the
      treatment of GCA. Actemra is the first therapy approved by the FDA for
      the treatment of adult patients with GCA. This is the sixth FDA approval
      for Actemra since the medicine was launched in 2010.
    

About the GiACTA study


      GiACTA is a Phase III, global, randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled trial investigating the efficacy and safety of
      subcutaneous Actemra as a novel treatment for GCA. It is the first
      successful clinical trial ever conducted in GCA and the first to use
      blinded, variable-dose, variable-duration steroid regimens. The
      multicenter study was conducted in 251 patients across 76 sites in 14
      countries. The primary and key secondary endpoints were evaluated at 52
      weeks.
    

      Data from the Phase III GiACTA study in patients with GCA showed:
    


        Actemra, initially combined with a six-month steroid (glucocorticoid)
        regimen, more effectively sustained remission through 52 weeks (56
        percent in the Actemra weekly group and 53.1 percent in the Actemra
        biweekly group) compared to placebo combined with a 26-week steroid
        taper (14 percent) (p<0.0001).1

        Actemra, initially combined with a six-month steroid (glucocorticoid)
        regimen, more effectively sustained remission through 52 weeks (56
        percent in the Actemra weekly group and 53.1 percent in the Actemra
        biweekly group) compared to placebo combined with a 52-week steroid
        taper (17.6 percent).
      

        Fewer patients reported serious adverse events (SAEs) in the Actemra
        weekly (15 percent) and biweekly groups (14.3 percent) than in the
        placebo combined with a 26-week steroid taper regimen (22 percent) and
        placebo combined with a 52-week steroid taper regimen groups (25.5
        percent).1


About Giant Cell Arteritis


      GCA, also known as temporal arteritis (TA), affects an estimated 228,000
      people over the age of 50 in the United States, and the disease is two
      to three times more likely to affect women than men.2,3 GCA
      is often difficult to diagnose because of the wide and variable spectrum
      of signs and symptoms. GCA can cause severe headaches, jaw pain and
      visual symptoms and if left untreated, can lead to blindness, aortic
      aneurysm or stroke.3 Treatment to date for people with GCA
      has been limited to high-dose steroids that play a role as an effective
      ‘emergency’ treatment option to prevent damage such as vision loss.3
      Due to the variability of symptoms, complexity of the disease and
      disease complications, people with GCA are often seen by several
      physicians including rheumatologists, ophthalmologists and neurologists.
    

About Actemra


      Actemra is the first humanized interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor antagonist
      approved for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely
      active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who have used one or more
      disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), such as methotrexate
      (MTX), that did not provide enough relief. The extensive Actemra RA IV
      clinical development program included five Phase III clinical studies
      and enrolled more than 4,000 people with RA in 41 countries. The Actemra
      RA subcutaneous clinical development program included two Phase III
      clinical studies and enrolled more than 1,800 people with RA in 33
      countries. In addition, Actemra is also used as an IV formulation for
      patients with active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (PJIA)
      or systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA) two years of age and
      older. Actemra is not approved for subcutaneous use in people with PJIA
      or SJIA. It is not known if Actemra is safe and effective in children
      with PJIA or SJIA under two years of age or in children with conditions
      other than PJIA or SJIA.
    

      Actemra is intended for use under the guidance of a healthcare
      practitioner.
    

Important Safety Information


Actemra can cause serious side effects. Actemra changes
      the way a patient’s immune system works. This can make a patient more
      likely to get infections or make any current infection worse. Some
      people taking Actemra have died from these infections.

Actemra can cause other serious side effects. These include:
