    What is Flexible Premium Adjustable Life Insurance?




























Flexible premium adjustable life insurance allows the most flexibility of the types of whole life insurance in regards to both investment and monthly premiums.






Whole life insurance is different from term as beneficiaries receive payment no matter what age the policy holder passes away.






The amount that a flexible premium adjustable life insurance policyholder pays in ultimately affects how much income she or he will earn from the life insurance policy.

Flexible premium adjustable life insurance is a type of whole life insurance policy that offers individuals the greatest amount of flexibility in terms of their investment choice and monthly premiums. It provides both a death benefit and an investment vehicle. Many individuals opt for such a policy because it provides a form of forced savings for retirement, while also protecting dependents in the event of premature death. 
The first key to understanding this type of insurance is understanding whole life insurance policies. Whole life policies are distinct from term life because the death benefit on a whole life policy is paid no matter when the insured dies. With term policies, the death benefit is paid only during a set period; for example, for his beneficiaries to collect the death benefit on a 30-year term, the insured would have to die within the 30-year period that the policy was active. 
With a whole life policy, premium payments continue for life and the death benefit is paid no matter when the insured dies. Premiums for this type of policy are generally more expensive than those for a term policy. They are also more expensive because the insured pays another fee, over and above the cost of insurance, which is invested in various types of investment vehicles.  


The payments are invested in one of two ways: the investor may have control over the investments and receive a variable rate of return, or he may have no control over the investment and receive a fixed rate of return. In other words, an investor with a variable policy pays extra premiums that are invested, and then gets to direct the course of that investment, ideally growing his policy, and the amount he is eventually paid. An investor with a fixed rate policy, on the other hand, pays extra premiums in and earns a fixed rate of return, while the insurance company invests those premiums. 
A flexible premium adjustable life insurance policy is an alternative fixed rate policy that gives investors greater freedom. Instead of paying the same premiums every month, the insured can choose to pay within a range. The amount he pays in ultimately affects how much income he will earn from the life insurance policy. 
He also has discretion to direct the investment of his money within the terms of the policy. The money eventually paid out to him in the form of withdrawals or dividends fluctuates based both on how much he paid on a monthly basis and based on how well his investments perform. Some policies may contain a guaranteed minimum rate of return when a policy is purchased, as long as a minimum amount of premiums are paid.

Make sure the financial strength rating is high according to A.M. Best. They rate the best insurance companies. Only 3 percent out of the 3,000 insurances companies in the U.S. have an A+ superior rating. So find one of those, because legally, life insurance companies can wait six months to pay out a death benefit and the average one waits 4.7 months. Also make sure that you are getting what you want out of the program. Lump sum or monthly installments? Income replacement or final expenses? All good things to consider. I would recommend a straight whole life policy that gets locked in at a young age to take care of final expenses and some term with a high face amount to cover your liabilities.

I had an ordinary whole life level premium plan for $750K. My agent passed away and in the fourth year his 'replacement' called to say they had a new and better deal for me. It was called flexible premium adjustable life insurance. The only description he provided was that it provided a surplus or reserve premium to be invested in a variety of capital gain and income producing vehicles.
I told him to leave my original policy untouched, but he could write an additional policy to reach total $1 million. 
Instead, he rewrote entire policy for the "better" policy and collected a $10K commission. I did not know these details until 20 years later, because the new policy was mailed
                            


                                 to the trustee of the family trust who was named the beneficiary. 
The trustee received the policy and simply placed it in our trust file. It was uncovered only 20 years later when we were told premiums had reached a level twice what we had been paying ($21K/year).
In the course of our subsequent communication with the insurer, they admitted a significant error in calculation of the premiums from 20 years ago.
They are now recalculating and, you can imagine, things are a bit tense around here. I guess I should have had the decency to die younger, but at 87 I am now in something of a bind. I can't pay current $44K out of social security.

When shopping for life insurance, it's basically the same thing as shopping around for any product or service - you compare rates and coverage from different life insurance companies.When we had our first child, I started getting life insurance quotes online to see what was available. One site was a good resource. It gave me rates, companies, and coverage options, and by getting a few quotes from three or four companies, I began to learn generally what a good price for certain coverage was. They also have tons of articles, but let's face it: you can't get specific prices without picking what specific coverage you want.Good luck, Alchemy. Hope this helps a bit in your search.

How do I tell if I am paying a good price for life insurance?  If buying life insurance is anything like buying automobile insurance, then prices can vary widely.  I am getting married soon, and I want to buy a motorcycle.  The only way my fiancée will let me have a motorcycle is if I buy some type of life insurance.  Riding bikes can be dangerous in Arizona, and we have a two-year-old daughter so I can agree with her point of view.  My only problem is I don’t know where to start shopping.  Does anyone have any good advice for a relatively young person shopping for life insurance?

Are premiums for a charitable gift of life insurance tax deducible, payable in a lump-sum only, and taxable to the charity after the gift is made?

     THE LINCOLN NATIONAL LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY
     DESCRIPTION OF ISSUANCE, TRANSFER AND REDEMPTION PROCEDURES FOR
     LINCOLN LIFE FLEXIBLE PREMIUM VARIABLE LIFE ACCOUNT K
      Pursuant to Rule 6e-3(T)(b)(12)(iii)
      And to Rule 6e-3(T)(b)(13)(v)(B)

This document describes the administrative procedures to be used by The Lincoln 
National Life Insurance Company ("Lincoln Life") in the issuance of its         
flexible premium variable life policy ("Policylt"), the transfer of assets held 
thereunder, and the redemption by Owners of their interests in the Policy.      

I.  UNDERWRITING AND ISSUE                                                      

A.  Application Process                                             

Purchase of the Policy normally begins with the application process.            
In this process, the applicant completes and signs an application that          
has been filed and approved by the State Insurance Department. The              
application contains questions on the identity and health of the                
proposed insured, as well as other information used in the                      
underwriting and issue process. The application is also signed by the           
agent, who is a licensed representative of Lincoln Life. In some                
circumstances involving groups of individuals related by association,           
employer, or some other affiliation, a shortened form of the                    
application may be used; such form contains fewer questions and the             
underwriting is either done on a "simplified issue" or a "guaranteed            
issue" basis.                                                                   

The application may be submitted to Lincoln Life with or without a              
premium payment (there are restrictions as to the maximum Specified             
Amount that may be applied for when premium is accepted with the                
application). When premium is accepted with the application, a                  
Conditional Receipt is given to the applicant.                                  

B.  Underwriting Process                                            

The underwriting process consists of a thorough review of the                   
information contained in the application. In addition to this                   
information, the underwriting procedures establish certain other                
underwriting requirements that must be met for various age and                  
Specified Amount combinations. Such additional requirements would               
include any or all of such items as follows: inspection reports (by             
telephone or in person), Medical Information Bureau reports, Attending          
Physician Statements, Motor Vehicle Reports, and various levels of              
physical examination by paramedical or medical personnel. The                   
underwriting process results in an evaluation by the underwriter of             
the nature and degree of mortality risk associated with the proposed            
insured. The underwriter assigns a classification ranging from                  
"preferred" to "declined," depending on the health, avocations and              
other criteria of the proposed insured. Table ratings and temporary or          
flat extra...premiums are used when appropriate. Insureds are also              
classified on the basis of their tobacco use.                                   

C. Issue Process                                                      

The issue process consists of "building" the policy on the computer             
system that issues and administers the Policy, as well as the printing          
and assembling of the policy itself. The underwriting class assigned            
by the underwriter is reflected in the Cost of Insurance Charges used           
in the policy. The policy reflects the Specified Amount, beneficiary,           
and other relevant information contained on the application. The                
policy is normally delivered by the agent to the applicant or owner;            
if no premium was accepted with the application, the premium is                 
normally collected when the policy is delivered. In cases where the             
premium is to be paid by the proceeds of a surrender of an existing             
life insurance policy, the proceeds are normally paid directly to               
Lincoln Life by the other insurance company.                                    

The minimum Specified Amount that may be issued is $50,000; there is no stated  
maximum Specified Amount allowable. Issue ages for the primary                  
insured may be from 0 to 80 inclusive.                                          

D.  Increases in specified Amount                                     

The owner may apply for increases to the Specified Amount. The underwriting and 
issue processes for such increases are analagous to those used for new issues,  
except that if sufficient net cash surrender value exists in the policy to fund 
the new surrender charges and monthly deductions associated with the increase,  
no additional premium will be required for the increase.                        

E.  Reinstatements                                                    

Policies that lapse due to insufficient premium payments or insufficient policy 
value may be reinstated within 5 years of the date of lapse. An application     
similar to that required for new issue is required and the proposed insured must
qualify for the same underwriting class as originally issued. Premiums          
sufficient to make the next two Death Benefit Guarantee Monthly Premiums (if the
net cash surrender value is negative) or else the next two monthly deductions   
are required to reinstate the Policy. The period from lapse to reinstatement    
becomes a period of noncoverage.                                                

II.  PREMIUM PROCESSING                                                         

A.  Initial Premium                                                   

Premiums may be paid annually, semi-annually, quarterly, or monthly             
Automatic Bank Check. The minimum initial premium required to place the Policy  
in force is the first modal premium (annual, semiannual, quarterly) or, for     
Automatic Bank Check policies, the Death Benefit Guarantee Monthly Premium      
(Minimum Premium) for the first two months of coverage. (The                    
Minimum Premium is based on the age, sex, classification, Specified Amount, and 
number and amounts of any riders on the Policy. State insurance laws            
may prohibit unfair discrimination among insureds but recognize that            
premiums may be based upon factors such as age, sex, health, and                
occupation.) Subject to the Minimum Premium requirements for the first          
policy year and subject to Federal maximum premium limitations, premiums are    
flexible and may be paid at any time and in any amount.                         

1   

P-->EX-99.72nd�Page�of�7TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�2nd
Initial premiums are paid: 1) with the application, or 2) upon delivery of the  
policy, or 3) by proceeds of surrender of a policy issued by another company.   
All net premiums received prior to the Record Date (generally a date within     
three business days of the later of the date the last requirement is received or
the date of underwriting approval) are allocated to the General Account as of   
the later of the Policy Date or the date the premium is received. Interest is   
credited to policy values from the date of allocation to the General Account    
until the Record Date; the day after the Record Date, the value in the General  
Account is reallocated to each of the funds and the General Account according to
the instructions of the individual (contained in the application or a supplement
to the application or any other suitable form). In cases where the initial      
premium is received later than the Policy Date, the amount credited to the      
General Account is net of Monthly Deductions (Cost of Insurance and Monthly     
Charge) for monthly anniversaries preceding the date of receipt.                

B.  Minimum Premiums/Planned Periodic Premiums                        

The owner must pay sufficient premium to keep the Policy in force at all times. 
During the first policy year, the Minimum Premium must be paid each month.      
During the second and third policy year, payment of the Minimum Premium is      
required only if the net cash surrender value is negative or if the owner wishes
to keep the Death Benefit Guarantee (the guarantee that the Policy will stay in 
force despite negative cash surrender value). After the third policy year, the  
owner must maintain sufficient net cash surrender value to meet monthly         
deductions; whenever net cash surrender value is insufficient to meet those     
deductions, the policy will enter into a 61 day grace period. During the grace  
period, the owner must make a premium payment sufficient for two months, monthly
deductions, or the Policy will lapse at the end of the grace period.            

Each owner also elects a planned periodic premium to be paid on a regular basis,
e.g. quarterly; the planned premium is the amount normally billed periodically. 
The owner is not required to pay the planned premium as such and may pay greater
or smaller amounts at any time, subject to minimum and maximum limitations. The 
planned periodic premium may be changed at any time by written request of the   
owner. Planned premiums received prior to the Record Date are allocated to the  
General Account in the same fashion as the initial premium; premiums received   
after the Record Date are allocated to the General Account and each of the funds
according to the most recent allocation instructions provided by the owner.     

C.  Loan Repayments                                                   

Whenever a loan is outstanding on the Policy, the owner may make payments to    
reduce the outstanding balance of the loan. The payments reduce the outstanding 
loan balance by the amount of the loan repayment plus any unearned interest on  
that amount. The total amount of loan reduction is immediately allocated to the 
General Account and the funds according to the most recent premium allocation   
instructions provided by the owner.

P-->EX-99.73rd�Page�of�7TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�3rd
D.  Unscheduled Payments                                              

Unscheduled payments are payments that are received by Lincoln Life but do not  
match the planned periodic premium billed to the owner. If such payments are    
designated as premium payments, they are allocated in the same fashion as       
planned premiums. If the payments are not designated as premium payments, they  
are first applied to repay any outstanding loan on the Policy and any excess is 
then applied as an unscheduled premium.                                         

E.  Excess Premiums                                                   

Excess premiums can occur when a premium payment causes total premiums paid to  
exceed the maximum Federal premium limitation under section 7702 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Also, when the owner has given Lincoln Life   
instructions not to allow the Policy to become a Modified Endowment Contract    
under section 7702(A) of the IRC of 1986, as amended, excess premiums can result
when a premium payment causes total premiums paid to exceed the 7-pay           
limitation. In either case, Lincoln Life allocates as much premium as possible  
to the Policy; any excess is then applied first to the repayment of any         
outstanding loan on the Policy, and any further excess is refunded to the owner.
An exception occurs when premiums in excess of the 7-pay limitation or in excess
of the maximum Federal premium limitation are received within 15 days of the    
policy anniversary and the owner has instructed Lincoln Life to hold the premium
until it may be paid into the policy on the next policy anniversary.            

III.  Redemptions                                                               

A.  Surrenders                                                        

The owner may surrender the Policy in whole or in part at any time. Partial     
surrenders are accomplished by requesting in writing a reduction in the         
Specified Amount of the Policy; such reduction will result in partial Surrender 
Charges being deducted from Policy Value. The deduction will be made from the   
General Account and the funds in proportion to the value in each account. The   
partial Surrender Charge consists of the Contingent Deferred Sales Charge and   
the Contingent Deferred Administrative Charge. The remaining Surrender Charge is
reduced by the amount of this deduction from Policy Value. In determining the   
amount of the Surrender Charge, decreases are allocated first to the most recent
increase, then to the next most recent increase, and so forth.                  

Full surrender is accomplished by requesting full surrender in writing on a form
suitable to Lincoln Life and results in the full Surrender Charge being deducted
from surrender proceeds. The full value in the General Account and each of the  
funds is deducted from each account and the Surrender Charge is deducted from   
the total of those amounts; the remaining net cash surrender value is paid to   
the owner. For surrenders in the first two policy years, a calculation is       
performed to determine whether any excess sales load has been deducted in the   
surrender process; if so, the excess sales load is added to the amount of       
surrender proceeds otherwise calculated and the total is paid to the owner.     

3     

P-->EX-99.74th�Page�of�7TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�4th
B.  Lapse                                                           

If the owner fails to make required premium payments and the 61 day grace period
expires, the policy will lapse. In this case, the surrender Charge and any due  
and unpaid monthly deductions are deducted from the Policy Value. The full value
in the General Account and each of the subaccounts is deducted from each account
and the Surrender Charge and other amounts due are deducted from the total of   
those amounts. For lapses in the first two policy years, a calculation is       
performed to determine whether any excess sales load has been deducted in the   
lapse process; if so, the excess sales load is refunded to the owner.           

C.  Withdrawals                                                       

After the first policy year, the owner may make withdrawals from the Policy     
Value once per policy year. The maximum withdrawal is 20% of the net cash       
surrender value for each policy year when the Surrender Charge is greater than  
zero; however, as a current practice, the 20% limitation is not enforced for    
policy years following the tenth policy anniversary. The amount withdrawn is    
subject to withdrawal charges (see below). The total amount of the withdrawal is
deducted from the General Account and each of the funds in proportion to the    
value in each account, unless the owner has given special instructions to deduct
the amount in some other fashion and Lincoln Life has agreed to do so.          

At any time that the Surrender Charge is greater than zero, withdrawals incur a 
withdrawal charge which is currently 3% of the withdrawn amount; at other times,
the withdrawal charge is currently $10. The withdrawal charge is guaranteed not 
to exceed the greater of $25 or 5% of the withdrawn amount when the Surrender   
Charge is greater than zero, and guaranteed not to exceed $25 at other times.   
The withdrawal charge consists of a processing fee and a possible early         
withdrawal penalty. The processing fee is currently $10 (guaranteed not to      
exceed $25) and the balance of the withdrawal charge (if any) constitutes the   
early withdrawal penalty. The remaining Surrender Charge is reduced by the      
amount of any early withdrawal penalty.                                         

Withdrawals may affect the death benefit under the Policy. If the death benefit 
option is type 1, any withdrawal reduces the Specified Amount by an equal       
amount. In contrast, if the death benefit option is type 2, withdrawals do not  
affect the Specified Amount. If the policy value is such that the death benefit 
is determined by using one of the IRC-required percentages, any withdrawal may  
reduce the death benefit by as much as the applicable percentage times the      
amount of the withdrawal.                                                       

D.  Loans                                                             

At any time, the owner may borrow amounts up to the total net cash surrender    
value. Any amount borrowed bears interest of 6.0% in advance (6.38% annual      
effective rate) and is credited a current interest rate no less than 4.0%.      
Interest may be paid in cash or added to the loan, in which case the total      
loaned amount is charged and credited interest as described above. The          
total amount loaned is transfered from the General Account and each of the      
funds in proportion to the value in each account, unless the owner has given    
special instructions to deduct the amount in some other fashion and Lincoln     
Life has agreed to do so; the amount of the loan is paid to the owner and       
the amount of the loan reduces the net cash surrender value.

E.  Death Benefits                                                    

The Policy provides for the payment of the Death Benefit as defined in the      
policy form upon the death of the insured. Two death benefit types are          
available: type 1 pays the specified amount of the policy and type 2 pays the   
specified amount of the policy plus the policy value. Under each death benefit  
type, the actual death benefit may be larger if required under section 7702 of  
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Death   benefit proceeds are     
reduced by the amount of any outstanding loan.                                  

The exact amount of the death benefit is determined as of the date of the       
insured's death. Effective that day, the policy value in the General   Account  
and each of the funds is valued and the results are used in the calculation of  
the actual death benefit. Interest is paid on the death benefit from the date of
death until actual payment to the beneficiaries.                                

F.  Accelerated Death Benefits                                        

The owner may elect to attach the Accelerated Death Benefit Rider to the Policy.
If benefit claims occur under this rider, a lien is placed against the Policy   
equal in amount to the benefit paid (increased with interest in arrears until   
the date of death). The payment of the benefit has no effect on the policy      
value in the General Account and in each of the funds. When the death benefit   
is calculated, the amount of the lien (plus interest) is deducted from the      
death proceeds under the terms of the rider.                                    

III.  Refund Procedures                                                         

A.  Declines and Not-Taken-Outs                                       

In cases where the application is declined by Lincoln Life or the policy is     
Not-Taken-Out by the owner, all monies received are refunded to the owner       
without interest; such monies would not have been invested in any of the        
underlying funds, so no investment experience is possible.                      

B.  Free Look Procedures                                              

The Policy contains a Free Look provision that allows the owner to cancel the   
Policy and receive a full refund of premiums paid. The Free Look period extends 
to the latest of: 10 days from receipt of the Policy, 45 days from the signing  
of Part 1 of the application, or 10 days from the mailing or personal delivery  
of the Notice of Withdrawal Right. Where state insurance regulations so require,
the Free Look period may be extended to meet such requirements. If the owner    
exercises the Free Look privilege, all policy value is removed from the General 
Account and each of the funds and the full amount of all premiums paid is       
refunded, without interest or investment experience.                            

C.  Suicide                                                           

The Policy contains a suicide provision that limits Lincoln Life's liability if 
the insured commits suicide within two years of the issue of the Policy and     
again within two years of any reinstatement or any increase in Specified Amount.
If it is determined that the insured committed suicide within two               

5     

P-->EX-99.76th�Page�of�7TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�6th
years of initial policy issue, all policy value is removed from the General     
Account and each of the funds and an amount (without interest or investment     
experience) equal to the following is paid to the owner or beneficiary: all     
premiums paid, minus any policy loan, plus any unearned loan interest, minus any
prior withdrawals, and minus the cost of any riders. Similarly, if suicide      
occurs within two years of any reinstatement, an amount similarly calculated    
(except that only premiums paid since the date of reinstatement are refunded)   
is paid. If suicide occurs within two years of any increase in specified        
Amount (and after two years from policy issue), the death benefit for the       
original Specified Amount is processed normally and any Cost of Insurance       
Deductions made for the increased Specified Amount are added to the death       
benefit proceeds (the death benefit of the increased Specified Amount is not    
paid).                                                                          

D.  Incontestibility                                                  

The Policy contains a Contestibility provision that allows Lincoln Life to      
contest the validity of the Policy based on representations made in the         
application, any supplement to the application, or any application for increase 
in Specified Amount or any reinstatement application.                           

E.  Incorrect Age or Sex                                              

If there is a mistake in the age or sex of the insured that is determined, while
the insured is still living, the age and sex are corrected and an adjustment is 
made to the policy values accordingly. If the mistake is determined in the      
process of settling the death claim, the death benefit is adjusted to that      
amount that would be purchased by the most recent cost of insurance at the      
correct age and sex.                                                            

IV.  Transfers                                                                  

A.  Transfers From the General Account to the Separate Account      

The owner may request to transfer amounts from the General Account to the       
Separate Account at any time. The maximum amount transferrable from the General 
Account is 20% of the policy value in the General Account in any twelve         
consecutive months. However, this limitation is currently waived for the first  
six policy months. Amounts transferred from the General Account are paid into   
each of the funds according to the instructions of the owner. Telephone         
transfers are permitted if the owner has completed the necessary telephone      
transfer authorization form and correctly identifies himself (based on          
information contained in the authorization form) prior to making the transfer   
request. Transfers may be made by other persons who can provide the required    
authorization information. Transfers are subject to a transfer charge of as much
as $10; under current practice, the transfer charge is $0.                      

    B.  Transfers Between Funds and From the Separate Account to the General
Account                                                     

The owner may request to transfer amounts between the funds or from the Separate
Account to the General Account. A maximum of twelve~transfers is permitted per  
year (including transfers from the General Account to the                       

6     

P-->EX-99.7Last�Page�of�7TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�7th
Separate Account). Amounts transferred between funds are redeemed from one fund 
and purchased into the requested fund as of the day the request is received.    
Telephone transfers are permitted, as described in the preceding section.       

C.  Transfer Privilege Under Rule 6e-3(T)(b)(v)(B)                    

At any time in the life of the Policy, the owner may transfer 100% of the value 
in the funds to the General Account. By so doing, the owner  effectively        
eliminates the investment risks associated with the underlying funds and causes 
the Policy to benefit from a guaranteed minimum interest crediting rate of 4%.  
Accordingly, the death benefit and policy values of  the Policy will no longer  
depend on the investment experience of the  Separate Account. On the date of    
transfer of all values to the General Account, the death benefit,               
net-amount-at-risk, and policy values require no special adjustments.
