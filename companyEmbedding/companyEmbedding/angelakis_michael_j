Michael J. Angelakis, who helped steer Comcast through its acquisition of NBCUniversal and also was instrumental in the attempt to take over Time Warner Cable, is leaving his post as chief financial officer to lead a new Comcast-backed company with $4 billion in firepower for strategic investments.The unexpected management shake-up was announced on Tuesday, and Comcast said that it was starting a search for a new chief financial officer immediately. Mr. Angelakis will remain in his position until a successor is found and later continue to work as a senior adviser to Comcast.The media conglomerate’s proposed $45 billion deal for Time Warner Cable remains in regulatory limbo.Widely respected inside and outside of the company, Mr. Angelakis, 50, joined Comcast in 2007 and oversaw corporate development, strategic planning, investor relations and other financial and administrative areas.

Brian L. Roberts, Comcast’s chief executive, said that Mr. Angelakis had “helped transform Comcast into the media and technology company that we are today.”The transition has been in the works for quite some time. Several months ago, Mr. Angelakis told Mr. Roberts that he was interested in setting up his own company. Mr. Roberts responded by suggesting that Comcast should not only invest with him but act as the sole investor. "I’ve seen my father and John Malone keep the entrepreneurial spirit going as they built their companies,” Mr. Roberts said. “That is something that has worked extremely well in the past for Comcast and we want to keep this a strong part of our culture."Mr. Angelakis did not present Comcast executives with an offer to leave for another company, executives said.“As we enter the final phase of the Time Warner Cable transaction, this is a great time to begin a transition, and I am excited to start this new entrepreneurial company,” Mr. Angelakis said.

Mr. Angelakis will help with the transition to the new chief financial officer and will help start the integration process for Time Warner Cable, if the deal is approved. Last week, Comcast said it expected government regulators to complete their review of the deal in the middle of the year. Previously, Comcast had expected the deal to close in early 2015.“As we enter the final phase of the Time Warner Cable transaction, this is a great time to begin a transition, and I am excited to start this new entrepreneurial company,” Mr. Angelakis said.Before starting at Comcast, Mr. Angelakis was a managing director at Providence Equity Partners, a global private equity firm. He also is the deputy chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia and a trustee at Babson College.Comcast decided to make the announcement on Tuesday because it was starting the public search. “It is a real loss for Comcast to see someone as talented as Mike decide that it is time to move on,” said Craig Moffett, an analyst with Moffett Nathanson Research.

Comcast Corporation Names Michael J. Angelakis Co-Chief Financial Officer (NASDAQ:CMCSA)



































 










November 28, 2006


Comcast Corporation Names Michael J. Angelakis Co-Chief Financial Officer
PHILADELPHIA, Nov. 28 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Comcast Corporation
(Nasdaq: CMCSA, CMCSK), the nation's leading provider of cable, entertainment
and communications products and services, announced today that it has named
Michael J. Angelakis to serve as the Company's new Co-Chief Financial Officer.
Angelakis is currently a Managing Director of Providence Equity Partners, one
of the leading private equity firms investing in communications and media
companies around the world.
    The announcement follows a search process that was undertaken when Comcast
Co-CFOs Lawrence Smith and John Alchin informed the Company at the end of 2005
that, as they approached retirement age, they were considering stepping down
as Co-CFOs in 2007.  The hiring of Angelakis allows the Company to implement a
seamless CFO transition, with Smith stepping down as Co-CFO at the end of the
first quarter, but remaining an advisor to the Company. Alchin will continue
to serve as Co-CFO through the end of 2007, and also will remain as an
advisor.  Angelakis is expected to join the Company at the end of the first
quarter of 2007 as Co-CFO and to become CFO in 2008.
    "Mike Angelakis has an outstanding background in media, finance,
management and deal making," said Brian L. Roberts, Chairman and CEO of
Comcast Corporation.  "Providence Equity's track record in media investing is
best in class, and Mike has played an integral role in that success for the
past seven years.  In addition, Mike's experience working with and serving on
the boards of directors of various cable and media companies make him a
perfect fit to help lead Comcast.  We are delighted that he has decided to
join us."
    "I am very excited to be joining Brian and the rest of the talented team
at Comcast, which is one of the most dynamic companies in the Fortune 100,"
said Angelakis. "Providence Equity Partners is an outstanding firm and I have
appreciated the opportunity to work closely with my partners for the past
seven years.  This is an exciting time in the media industry and Comcast's
business has incredible momentum. I am looking forward to working with my new
colleagues to help build on what Comcast has already accomplished and to take
advantage of the great opportunities that lie ahead."
    "Mike Angelakis is a major talent who has made an important contribution
to the growth and success of our firm," said Jonathan M. Nelson, Chief
Executive Officer of Providence Equity Partners.  "We are sorry to see Mike
leave but pleased that he is joining a company with which we have a close
long-term relationship and several co-investments.  Mike was a cable operator
when he joined us and we understand his desire to return to an operating role,
especially at such a great company."
    Roberts also lauded the service of Smith and Alchin.  "Larry and John have
both been true partners in the growth and success of Comcast for more than 15
years," said Roberts.  "They are incredibly talented and it is totally in
keeping with their commitment to Comcast that they played an integral role in
recruiting Mike and have agreed to help make the CFO transition so smooth."
    Providence Equity Partners has made investments in more than 100 companies
located in more than 20 countries and currently manages over $9 billion.
Angelakis serves on the boards of Bresnan Communications, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer
Inc. and Northland Cable Networks, LLC, and is on the Executive Committee of
The YES Network.
    Before joining Providence Equity Partners in 1999, Angelakis was President
and Chief Executive Officer of State Cable TV Corporation and Aurora
Telecommunications LLC.  Before that, he was a Vice President at Manufacturers
Hanover Trust Company, where he oversaw one of the bank's media and
communications portfolios.  Angelakis is a graduate of Babson College and the
O/P Management Program at the Harvard Business School.
    Comcast was assisted in the search by Howard Fischer Associates.

PHILADELPHIA--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Comcast 
      Corporation announced today that it has entered into an agreement 
      with the Company’s Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, Michael 
      J. Angelakis, to establish a new, strategic company that will focus 
      on investing in and operating growth-oriented companies, both 
      domestically and internationally.
    


      “This is a time of tremendous change and opportunity in our core 
      technology and media industries, as well as in adjacent business areas. 
      We believe the ability to establish entrepreneurial ventures that 
      partner with and participate in the growth of innovative companies can 
      be an important driver of strategic and financial value creation for our 
      company,” said Brian L. Roberts, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of 
      Comcast.
    

      “As Comcast approaches the completion of the Time Warner Cable merger 
      and related transactions, and the integration plans are well advanced, 
      Michael is ready and excited to turn his attention to the next phase of 
      his career and relationship with Comcast,” Mr. Roberts added.
    

      Mr. Angelakis will serve as the Chief Executive Officer of the new 
      company and bring his strengths of investing in and operating companies, 
      with benefits accruing to Comcast shareholders. He will lead this new 
      company with a mandate and the resources to pursue new areas of growth 
      and diversification for Comcast.
    

      The new company will have total capital commitments of up to $4.1 
      billion, of which $4.0 billion will be invested by Comcast, at least $40 
      million will be invested personally by Mr. Angelakis, with the remainder 
      coming from other senior members of the new company’s management team. 
      This new company will have an exclusive, 10-year partnership with 
      Comcast as sole outside investor.
    

      Comcast will immediately commence a search for a successor Chief 
      Financial Officer, and following the appointment of the new CFO, Mr. 
      Angelakis will then serve as a Senior Advisor to Comcast. Mr. Angelakis 
      will assist with the transition to the new CFO and begin the integration 
      process for the Time Warner Cable and related transactions.
    

      “I am thrilled that Michael will be leading this new initiative. His 
      broad and deep experience in a variety of leadership roles within 
      different industries will be a tremendous asset to the new company. He 
      is an extraordinary leader and strategic partner, and has helped 
      transform Comcast into the media and technology company that we are 
      today,” said Mr. Roberts. “His work to structure the NBCUniversal and 
      Time Warner Cable transactions has been invaluable in laying the 
      successful financial groundwork for Comcast. In the past, Comcast has 
      made substantial investments in companies like QVC, Comcast Cellular and 
      SpectrumCo, which have generated tremendous strategic and shareholder 
      value. I couldn’t be more excited about the future and Michael’s role in 
      building this new company.”
    

      “As we enter the final phase of the Time Warner Cable transaction, this 
      is a great time to begin a transition and I am excited to start this 
      new, entrepreneurial company,” said Mr. Angelakis. “Our industry is 
      dynamic and I am very excited and optimistic about the many 
      opportunities available to Comcast. Comcast is a remarkably 
      well-positioned company and it has been an honor to serve as the 
      Company's Vice Chairman and CFO. I look forward to closing the Time 
      Warner Cable and related transactions and commencing the integration 
      process. As part of our new company, I am very pleased to continue the 
      partnership with my current colleagues and to contribute to Comcast’s 
      future growth and success."
    

      Mr. Angelakis is the Deputy Chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of 
      Philadelphia and is a Trustee of Babson College. Prior to joining 
      Comcast, Mr. Angelakis was a Managing Director and Member of the 
      Investment and Management Committees at Providence Equity Partners, one 
      of the leading, global private equity firms investing in technology, 
      media and communications companies. Before joining Providence Equity 
      Partners in 1999, Mr. Angelakis was President and Chief Executive 
      Officer of State Cable TV Corporation and Aurora Telecommunications. He 
      also served as a Vice President of Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company 
      in New York, where he oversaw one of the bank’s media and communications 
      portfolios. Additionally, Mr. Angelakis spent several years in London 
      developing Manufacturers Hanover’s acquisition finance and merchant 
      banking activities throughout Western Europe.
    

      A more detailed description of the arrangements between Mr. Angelakis 
      and Comcast is set forth in Comcast’s Current Report on Form 8-K to be 
      filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The binding agreement 
      for the arrangements will be attached to that filing.
