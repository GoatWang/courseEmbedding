About MoSys



















MoSys, Inc. is a fabless semiconductor company enabling leading equipment manufacturers in the networking and communications markets to support the continual increase in Internet users, data and services.













Company Overview



The company’s solutions eliminate critical data throughput and access bottlenecks in leading edge applications to deliver speed and intelligence on line cards and systems with aggregate rates above 100 Gigabits per second (Gbps). The resulting solutions improve performance and features while reducing system level power, area, pin count and economics.

Manufacturing & Reliability



MoSys is an ISO 9000 certified IC manufacturer, and its Bandwidth Engine product has been qualified to meet carrier-grade reliability requirements.




        Read More    












Key Markets



The massive increase in number of users, amount of data per user and more complex, real-time bandwidth-intensive services, such as video-on-demand, Internet protocol TV, peer-to-peer, Cloud Computing, Web 2.0 applications, and 3G/4G, are spurring the demand for higher data throughput.
Service providers need innovative new technologies to manage quality of service and network security in addition to expanded monitoring, measurement and administration functions to satisfy high expectations in user experience. This means routers, switches, and communications equipment must support aggregate data rates in the 100s of Gbps with increased data processing per packet. In order to meet these requirements, data access and throughput bottlenecks between data processing elements and memory need to be solved.
MoSys® Bandwidth Engine family of ICs, with its combination of serial I/O, high-speed memory, efficient access, and intelligent offload drastically increases data accesses per second, removing these bottlenecks.
Programmable Search Engine (PSE) ICs further leverage the company’s proven serial interface technology and high-density integrated memory, adding a processor engine architecture to enable customizable search, security, and data analysis functions for networking, security, and data center applications.
LineSpeed™ 100G PHY products are optimized to enable higher-density, lower-power data path connectivity as electrical interface rates transition from 10Gbps to 25Gbps, which is necessary to support high density 10, 25, 40, and 100G electrical and optical Ethernet and Optical Transport Network (OTN) interfaces.
When LineSpeed PHYs are combined with the packet processing offload capabilities of the Bandwidth Engine family and/or the integrated processing engine capability of Programmable Search Engine, MoSys solutions are enabling speed, density and intelligence in the network.

MoSys, Inc. Reports First Quarter 2017 Financial Results




















May 11, 2017 16:05 ET

 | Source: MoSys, Inc.





SANTA CLARA, Calif., May  11, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MoSys, Inc. (NASDAQ:MOSY), today reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017.   First Quarter 2017 Financial ResultsTotal net revenue for the first quarter of 2017 was $1.2 million, compared with $1.4 million in the previous quarter and $1.5 million in the first quarter of 2016. Product revenue in the first quarter was $1.0 million, consistent with the fourth quarter of 2016, and compared with $1.1 million in the year-ago period.Gross margin for the first quarter of 2017 was 50 percent, compared with 57 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016 and 41 percent for the first quarter of 2016.Total operating expenses on a GAAP basis for the first quarter of 2017 were $4.8 million, compared with $15.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, which included a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $9.9 million, and $7.4 million in the year-ago period.In February 2017, the Company effected a 1-for-10 reverse stock split of its common stock. All share and per share amounts in this press release have been adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split for all current and prior periods.GAAP net loss for the first quarter of 2017 was $4.4 million, or ($0.66) per share, compared with a net loss of $14.5 million, or ($2.18) per share, in the previous quarter and a net loss of $6.9 million, or ($1.05) per share, for the first quarter of 2016. Non-GAAP net loss for the first quarter of 2017 was $4.2 million, or ($0.63) per share, which excludes intangible asset amortization and stock-based compensation expenses. A reconciliation of GAAP results to non-GAAP results is provided in the financial statement tables following the text of this press release.Management Commentary“First quarter 2017 product revenue was primarily comprised of ongoing shipments of our Bandwidth Engine® 2 ICs, with the majority of those shipments to our lead IP security appliance customer. We have a reliable volume forecast from this customer for the remainder of this year, and are working to confirm order commitments from our other top customers,” commented Len Perham, MoSys’ President and CEO. “During the first quarter, we won our first Bandwidth Engine 3 design-in with a leading networking equipment supplier in China, and received our first pre-production order from this customer. We also secured additional Bandwidth Engine 2 design-ins with multiple customers for next-generation video applications.“After the close of the quarter, as previously announced, we revised our operating plan and began implementing our cost reduction initiatives. We expect to realize significant operating cost savings from these actions, and believe these expense reductions will position us to maintain ongoing operations and preserve cash until such time that our past design wins ramp more materially.”Mr. Perham further commented, “Although we are now running a leaner organization, we remain confident that we have the necessary resources and personnel to fully support the current needs and firm orders of our customers. In addition, we remain focused on carefully managing operating costs and expanding our portfolio of design wins, while continuing to explore strategic alternatives and asset monetization strategies to ensure our viability and provide value to our stockholders.”Financial Results Conference CallThe Company will not be hosting a conference call or webcast in conjunction with today’s release of its first quarter results.Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures To supplement MoSys’ consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, MoSys uses non-GAAP financial measures that exclude from the statement of operations the effects of non-cash goodwill impairment, restructuring, stock-based compensation and intangible asset amortization charges. MoSys’ management believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is useful to investors and other interested persons because they are one of the primary indicators that MoSys’ management uses for planning and forecasting future performance. MoSys’ management believes that the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures that exclude these items is useful to investors because management does not consider these charges part of the day-to-day business or reflective of the core operational activities of the Company that are within the control of management or that would be used to evaluate management’s operating performance.Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP results, which is provided in a table below the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by the Company should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations to those financial statements should be carefully evaluated. The non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. For additional information regarding these non-GAAP financial measures, and management’s explanation of why it considers such measures to be useful, refer to the Form 8-K dated May 11, 2017 that the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.Forward-Looking StatementsThis press release may contain forward-looking statements about the Company, including, without limitation, anticipated benefits and performance expected from its IC products and the Company’s future markets and future business prospects. Forward-looking statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties.
