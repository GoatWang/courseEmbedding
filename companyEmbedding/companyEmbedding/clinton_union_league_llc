	Explanation of Responses:








	(


	1) 





	The price reported in Column 4 is a weighted average price. These shares were purchased in multiple transactions at prices ranging from $1.03 to $0.9562, inclusive. The Reporting Persons undertake to provide to Imation Corp., any security holder of Imation Corp., or the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission, upon request, full information regarding the number of shares purchased at each separate price within the ranges set forth herein.







	(


	2) 





	The securities reported herein may be deemed to be indirectly beneficially owned by Mr. George E. Hall ("Mr. Hall"), which securities are directly held by: (i) GEH Capital, Inc., which is indirectly owned by Mr. Hall and (ii) Clinton Relational Opportunity Master Fund, L.P. ("CREL") and Clinton Special Opportunities Master Fund Ltd. ("CSO"), of which Clinton Group, Inc. ("CGI") is also deemed to be the indirect beneficial owner of such securities by virtue of its position as investment manager of CSO and its ownership of Clinton Union League, LLC, which serves as the investment manager of CREL. Mr. Hall serves as the Chief Executive Officer of CGI.







	(


	3) 





	For purposes of Rule 16a-1(a)(2) of the 1934 Act, each of the Reporting Persons disclaim beneficial ownership of such securities, and this report shall not be deemed an admission that any Reporting Person is the beneficial owner of the securities for the purpose of Section 16 or for any other purpose, except to the extent of such Reporting Person's pecuniary interest therein. Mr. Joseph A. DePerio ("Mr. DePerio") is an employee of CGI and serves as a member of the board of directors of the Issuer. Mr. DePerio submits his Section 16 filings independent of CGI. Each Reporting Person disclaims beneficial ownership of any and all securities beneficially owned by Mr. DePerio.







	(


	4) 





	The price reported in Column 4 is a weighted average price. These shares were purchased in multiple transactions at prices ranging from $0.99 to $0.98, inclusive. The Reporting Persons undertake to provide to Imation Corp., any security holder of Imation Corp., or the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission, upon request, full information regarding the number of shares purchased at each separate price within the ranges set forth herein.










	Remarks:



	Because Mr. DePerio, an employee of CGI, serves as a member of the board of directors of the Issuer, each of the Reporting Persons may be deemed to be a director by deputization.

Donald Trump outlined his national security proposals during a speech from Lincoln Hall at the Union League of Philadelphia.The Republican presidential nominee said he is proposing "a new foreign policy" focused on advancing U.S. interests, building regional stability and easing global tensions. He said he wants "a stable, peaceful world with less conflict and more common ground."As part of his 10-point plan, Trump said he will build an active Army of about 540,000, build a state-of-the-art missile defense system and ask the nation's generals to present a plan within 30 days of taking office to defeat and destroy ISIS. His plan will also substantially expand the U.S. defense arsenal of submarines and ships.MORE ON DONALD TRUMPPHOTOS: Donald Trump returns to PhillyIn Philadelphia, Trump supporters tout his 'realistic vision' for national securityTwitter pounces on Donald Trump for 'Phillies' typo"Our actions in the Middle East will be tempered by realism," Trump said, blaming the strategies by President Barack Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for creating "power vacuums that are filled by terrorists."While he criticized the Obama's administration's treaty with Iran, claiming it will result in that country's rise to a nuclear power, Trump said he is willing to work with new allies."We should work with any country that shares our goal of destroying ISIS and defeating radical Islamic terrorism," he said.He also proposed eliminating "sequester" military cuts enacted in 2011 and enhancing the country's sea-based missile defense. And Trump said he will combat terrorist groups on military fronts, as well as through cyber- and ideological-warfare.The United States must convince its enemies that "our way of life is the best in the world ... Just like we did against communism in the Cold War," Trump said.The speech came several hours before Trump will appear on a "commander-in-chief" forum broadcast by NBC.Trump was about 10 minutes into his speech before he mentioned Clinton by name, attacking her for emails she sent and received as secretary of state. Trump claimed Clinton staffers "acid-washed" electronic files and smashed old phones with hammers to protect her."She put her emails on a private server to protect her pay-for-play policies in the U.S. State Department," Trump said later.It wasn't among the proposals published by his campaign, but Trump also said that as president he would ensure all NATO members will pay their fair share to police the world."They will do it. They will be happy to do it," Trump said.He continued: "I will be respectful in asking countries, such as Germany, Japan, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, to pay more for the security we provide them, and they will fully understand. They are economic behemoths."Just prior to his speech, the Trump campaign released a statement from Rep. Scott Perry, R-4th, whose district covers Harrisburg and portions of south central Pennsylvania, including York and Hanover. Perry said:"With Donald Trump receiving the endorsement of 88 retired generals and admirals, the American people know that he's ready to lead our nation on day one as commander-in-chief. He's the only candidate focused on eliminating the threat of ISIS, strengthening U.S. preparedness and restoring our military capabilities. In a Clinton administration our military resources will continue to be depleted just as they've been by President Obama over the past eight years."Trump has faced sharp criticism regarding his foreign policy acumen, as opponents question whether he has the temperament to handle the country's nuclear arsenal and make sound judgments on international issues. The Hillary Clinton campaign cited this criticism in a statement released before his appearance."Trump has demonstrated he is fundamentally unprepared to lead our country by saying he knows more about ISIS than our generals and by picking fights with our allies across the globe," said Corey Dukes, director of Clinton's Pennsylvania campaign. A group of veterans protested outside the Union League, a traditionally Republican club on South Broad Street in Center City that formed in 1862 as a patriotic society to support the Union and the policies of President Abraham Lincoln. The speech marked the second time in six days that Trump has campaigned in Philadelphia. He held a roundtable discussion on Friday with several black community leaders.Trump received some good news on Tuesday — a CNN poll shows him leading Clinton by two percentage points.

history
 The Credit Union was founded in 1948 by Ralph Bathanti in the living room of his home on Parker Street in Detroit. The first year financials showed assets of $7,100 and 175 members. In 1955, the Credit Union's first official office was established on Van Dyke in Detroit. Mr. Bathanti managed the office and two employees. In 1961, times were good for Motor City. Assets had reached $1.5 million and membership was 3,900. The new corporate offices moved to a larger facility on the corner of Nevada & Van Dyke. In April 1991, construction began on the new corporate office in Clinton Township, our current location.

Now in 2016, with assets of $141 million and 16,550 members, we are proud that our members trust us as their primary financial institution. We have offices in Clinton Township, Roseville, Detroit and Warren.BBB RatingA+BBB Rating and Accreditation information may be delayed up to a week.BBB Accredited businesses follow the BBB Code of Business Practices and pay a fee for accreditation review and monitoring.
