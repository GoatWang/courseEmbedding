Metaldyne Corp.

Finance
Mergers and acquisitions




						
						
						Mark Blaufuss, CFO and treasurer, Metaldyne Performance Group Inc.
					

Metaldyne Performance Group Inc.
Claim to fame: Worked as part of the team that rolled three major companies into a $3.1 billion corporation.
Age: 47Imagine blending three $1 billion companies into a single entity, relying on people who don't know you or each other — all of whom are concerned about keeping their jobs. Oh, and you've got four months to get it done. Go. That daunting task is what Metaldyne Performance Group Inc. CFO and Treasurer Mark Blaufuss faced when private equity group American Securities tasked him with stitching together Metaldyne, HHI Group Holdings LLC and Grede Holdings LLC last fall.  American Securities, which owned Plymouth-based Metaldyne and HHI, of Royal Oak, set the merger in motion after purchasing Southfield-based Grede in June 2014. The new company, a $3.1 billion metal-forming powerhouse based in Plymouth, is a Tier 1 auto supplier that produces engine, steering and suspension components. "I really had to quarterback through that whole thing," said Blaufuss, who considers shepherding the organization through the merger his biggest contribution as a CFO. "I had to work with people I never met before and say, 'OK, we're going to work shoulder to shoulder and work through this process.' " American Securities named Blaufuss, who took part in an April planning meeting, CFO of what would become Metaldyne Performance Group in August. In December, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission gave its blessing for the new company's initial public offering. In addition to satisfying the SEC, Blaufuss and other executives went on a nine-day road show — meeting with more than 60 potential investors in eight cities. Then, there were the internal hurdles, which included building trust with colleagues. "The biggest challenge to work through was the cultural concerns," said Blaufuss.  He's seen those concerns firsthand. He now oversees two former peers at HHI and Grede.  Those CFOs possessed knowledge crucial to the merger. And, with all three companies running lean, everyone on the three finance teams had to be on board — working nights and weekends — to get the job done. "(I had) to make sure everyone wasn't worried about if they were going to have a job and what that (job) was going to be," Blaufuss said. "I am proud to say we ended up with a world-class organization that successfully executed our transformation, and with no turnover." Although the merger is done, working side by side with colleagues in all departments and understanding their needs and motivations is still the best way to help the organization, Blaufuss said. "You must be able to work with the sales people, the human resources people," Blaufuss said. "Everybody does something that influences the financial results of the company. Their goals may not be in line with other constraints you need to work within." Bringing in data that demonstrates what's best for the company is a way to settle disputes between people in different company functions, Blaufuss said. "Data-based decisions tend to defuse a lot of the emotions," he said. Outside work, Blaufuss, along with his family, supports various religious charities, including the Mack Avenue Community Church in Detroit and Ele's Place, which provides counseling and support for grieving children in Ann Arbor, Lansing, Grand Rapids and Flint. Blaufuss also supports the Spartan Fund, which helps student athletes at Michigan State University achieve academic and athletic goals.
