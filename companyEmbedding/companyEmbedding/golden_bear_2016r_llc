â€œSediment on streets is one of the #1 problems in a construction areaâ€
– Craig Benson, M.S. (Region 1 IECA Board of Directors)
At Golden Bear Services our main focus is to address this ongoing problem with the implementation of Track-Out Devices. Our Rattle Products effectively remove dirt and debris from vehicle tires before they track sediment onto public roadways.
Our Rattle Products:

Knock a vehicles tires from one ridge of angle iron to another thus causing sediment to forcefully be removed
Have ridges placed at such a distance so that a tires only points of contact are with angle iron, causing tire treads to open and further release sediment build up
Are constructed 100% from steel in order to withstand the strain of heavy vehicles driving on top of them on a regular basis
Are 100% recyclable, if a unit is beyond repair because it was damaged by improper use than that unit can be melted down and re-purposed




Rattle Grate vs. Rock Pad
Golden Bear Services believes track-out devices have many intrinsic advantages that rock pad, today’s standard track out solution, do not share. Rattle Grate have a long life span and can be used for multiple years on a single job site without losing its effectiveness; whereas, rock pad must be replaced and additional rock added once its effectiveness is inevitably lost. Rattle Grate Actively removes dirt from vehicle tires by opening their treads and knocking the sediment out along a series of ridges; rock pad Passively removes dirt from vehicle tires by sediment attaching to the surface of rocks as the tires pass over it. When a construction site no longer needs Rattle Grate it is picked up and placed at another construction site to continue use; when Rock Pad is no longer needed it is picked up, dumped into a land fill, and more rock must be quarried from the ground.
Local regulators in Southern California realized that rock pads were only minimally effective and had to be replenished from time to time. They focused on track-out devices, found them to be the most effective method of track-out control, and now there are virtually zero construction sites in Los Angeles Metropolitan that do not use track-out devices.

Sample Assessments Agreed-Upon Procedures





 


We have performed the procedures enumerated in Attachment A, which were agreed to by the addressees of this report (the “Specified Parties”), solely to assist the Issuer in evaluating the accuracy of certain information with respect to a pool of residential property assessed clean energy (PACE) assessments (the “Assessments”) relating to the Issuer’s securitization transaction.  This agreed-upon procedures engagement was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.  The sufficiency of the procedures is solely the responsibility of the Specified Parties.  Consequently, we make no representation regarding the sufficiency of the procedures described in Attachment A, either for the purpose for which this report has been requested or for any other purpose.


The procedures performed and our associated findings are included in Attachment A.


For the purpose of the procedures described in this report, Natixis Securities Americas LLC (the “Initial Purchaser”), on behalf of the Issuer, provided us with:

relating to each Sample Assessment (as defined in Attachment A),

Attachment A
 
 
 
 





 

 
Procedures performed and our associated findings
 





1.


As instructed by the Initial Purchaser, on behalf of the Issuer, we randomly selected a sample of 100 Assessments from the Data File (the “Sample Assessments”).  For the purpose of this procedure, the Initial Purchaser, on behalf of the Issuer, did not inform us as to the basis for how they determined the number of Sample Assessments they instructed us to randomly select from the Data File.










2.


For each Sample Assessment, the Initial Purchaser, on behalf of Issuer, instructed us to perform the following procedures:










a.


We compared the Sample Characteristics listed on Exhibit 1 to Attachment A, as shown on the Data File, to the corresponding information located on the Source Documents, subject to the instruction provided by the Program Administrator, on behalf of the Issuer, that is stated in the notes to Exhibit 1 to Attachment A.  The Source Document that we were instructed by the Program Administrator, on behalf of the Issuer, to use for each Sample Characteristic is shown on Exhibit 1 to Attachment A.  All such compared information was in agreement.










b.


We observed that the corresponding Assessment Notice contained a signature in the signature section of the Assessment Notice.  We performed no procedures to determine the validity of the signature contained on the Assessment Notice.
