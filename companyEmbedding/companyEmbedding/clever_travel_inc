About The Clever Travel Companion
How do you keep your valuables safe, no matter where you go or what you do?
We at the Clever Travel Companion love to travel! We have been to many parts of the world, backpacking, going by train, bus, car and even on foot. We have been to Asia, riding the Tran Siberian train from Moscow to Beijing, driving through Mexico and across the US, inter railing in Europe, gone by bus from London to Cape Town, South Africa, worked in hotels in France and studied in Spain, just to mention a few of our trips. Most of the time we have felt and been perfectly safe. Most people, no matter where you go are friendly and helpful and wish you no harm.
However, sometimes there are dangers and there are thieves and pickpockets waiting for happy go lucky travelers with pockets full of cash. We have had our money stolen (even out of a money belt) a few times and lost our passports too. We always thought that as seasoned travelers we knew what we were doing and would never get robbed. But for crafty pickpockets we were no match... Other times we had no one to blame but ourselves. Carelessness, tiredness or something or other simply led to stuff going missing: a passport disappeared somewhere between Malaga and Barcelona, a wallet went missing on the train to Paris and somewhere on a desert road in Africa is a Swedish drivers license laying, all by its sad self.
Losing a passport or credit card is rarely the end of the world, they are replaceable, but it is a huge hassle and really makes a serious dent in your travel plans. Getting a new passport overseas takes time and money - time you would rather spend sightseeing or laying on the beach with a ginormous umbrella drink. To all of a sudden have to spend time, and money, replacing your valuables is annoying as hell. Even if you have travel insurance.
Getting a new passport out of Quito? How do you do that when your flight leaves in a few hours? All your cash is gone? Someone stole it? As well as your credit cards? How on earth do you explain that to the cab driver, who by the way speaks no English and you speak no Chinese, as you speed along the roads of remote Gueilling? If you find yourself somewhere off the beaten track, with no access to consulates or other helpful parties, losing your valuables is a major problem. But even in a major city, why even risk having to spend time replacing passports or having money wired from your 'I told you so' parents back home, when all you want to do is enjoy the town?
So, in order to make sure travelers always keep their most important documents and money safe, and enjoy a hassle free trip, we started The Clever Travel Companion. The Clever Travel Companion makes anti-theft products that help travelers keep their belongings safe at all times and ensures a fun and safe trip, no matter where you go. 
The first product we launched was our line of men's and women's underwear with pockets. The pockets are just the right size for your passport and comfortably fits cash, credit cards and other travel documents too. No one will ever know where you are hiding your credit cards or your passport and you will protect yourself from theft, loss and pickpocketing.
After the initial success with the underwear with pockets we decided to expand the product line. The Clever Travel Companion now also sells long johns with pockets for all those traveling to cold destinations. After all, skiers also need somewhere to stash their money and credit cards whilst out on the slopes. Two other new additions to the product line are t-shirts and tank tops with a pocket on the stomach area. The pocket naturally fits credit cards, passports and cash perfectly. Wearing a sweater or shirt on top of the t-shirt or tank top makes the pocket completely invisible and your valuables completely safe! Seriously, no pickpocket, no matter how smart will ever know where you are hiding you valuables with the Clever Travel Companions patent pending products with secret pockets! Oh, and of course, it is virtually impossible to mislay your stuff because lets face it, anyone can forget a wallet, purse, fanny pack or money belt somewhere but who takes off their clothing just anywhere in the middle of the day?
The Clever Travel Companion will be adding new products all through the year, so please check back. Of course you can also find us on Facebook and Twitter. If you want to know more before buying, check out what others had to say about the Clever Travel Companion's products.
Thank you for stopping by the Clever Travel Companion! Have a great trip and be safe!

Is It Safe To Shop On The Clever Travel Companion?
The Clever Travel Companion is built on Shopify's web store and they have excellent safety features built in to the system. The payment is handled by Pay Pal, and they are pretty well known across the world for having excellent security. Both Shopify and PayPal are large, well known companies who take security extremely seriously. So you need not worry!
 

What kind of payment do you accept?
We accept American Express, Master Card, Visa, Discover, and Paypal.
 
How do gift cards work?
When you buy a gift card you will be sent an electronic code that you simply give to whomever you are offering the gift card. The recipient then enters that code at checkout and the amount will be deducted from the order. All gift card codes can only be used once. Gift cards have no expiration date.
 
I changed my mind. Can I return my purchase?
You are always welcome to return your purchase of t-shirts and tank tops within ten days of receiving your order. We can not accept returns of underwear as they can not be resold. No returns on sale items. To return t-shirts or tank tops simply send an email to: returns@clevertravelcompanion.com and we will send you a return authorization straight away. We can only accept returns of unworn, unused, unwashed products in their original, resealed, whole packaging. We can not accept returns of items without packaging or in torn, unsightly packaging. We will issue a full refund as soon as we receive the product. We can not refund shipping costs. Please allow a couple of days for the transaction to complete. 
Please DO NOT return any items without a return authorization. Please DO NOT return any items to the address on your delivered box/envelope. We DO NOT accept returns without a proper return authorization as they do not reach us without proper labeling. Returns without the proper return authorization do not reach us and we can not refund any money for such returns as we do not receive the products.
 
 What if I am not happy with my purchase?
If you are not happy, we are not happy. If there is something wrong with your purchase, please send us an email at product@clevertravelcompanion.com and let us know what is up and we will do everything we can to make it right.
 
What can I fit in my pockets?
The pockets are just the right size for a passport. So passports are the largest documents that can easily fit unfolded. Money, credit cards fit with ease.
 
How do I wash my pocket products?
The recommendations are to wash them warm and tumble dry low, and even better hand dry. As with every garment, the less tumble drying you do, the longer they last.
 
Will my clothing with pockets shrink?
Yes, a little bit. The colder you wash your clothes and if you don't tumble them they will shrink less. They will also last longer.
 
I don't like the colors you offer, will you add others?
We are always adding and changing colors. We would love to know which colors you would prefer! Please send us an email at info@clevertravelcompanion.com or talk to us on FaceBook or Twitter.
 
What will you do with my email address once I have ordered?
Your personal details are safe with the Clever Travel Companion. When you place an order, we need your name, address, email address and credit card information in order to process and ship your order. We will never sell or pass this information on to anyone. The Clever Travel Companion will only, with your permission, send you very occasional emails with product updates.
 
Do you sell wholesale?
Sure do, send us an email info@clevertravelcompanion.com and we will be happy to see what we can do for you.

What districts are saying



‘‘

								Clever's innovative thinking enables us to continue to evolve as an educational institution. New solutions, like Clever Badges, allow teachers to eliminate procedures that were time-wasting and frustration producing.
							


											Cleon Franklin
											Shelby County Schools
										





‘‘

								What's not to like about Clever? It's a great product that streamlines credentials. It's easier for district staff, easier for teachers, and easier for students. A+!
							


											Nathan Seaton
											Owensboro Independent School District
										





‘‘

								Thanks to Clever, we will be able to allocate at least 1 FTE and more than 1,000 hours back to teaching and learning this year.
							


											Naressa Cofield
											Choice Foundation
										





‘‘

								Clever saves our IT folks a tremendous amount of time since they have many fewer data feeds to set-up manually. I wish every educational program would get on board and join Clever so we could truly no longer need to make roster changes manually ever again!
							


											Josh Shaw
											Baltimore City Public Schools
										





‘‘

								Our teachers love it. It’s an absolute dream for them because they don’t have to manage that sign-in process. The kids are always connected to their accounts, and as soon as the kid boots up the device, they’re authenticated. Then it’s just one click for them to access their apps without any issues at all.
							


											Mark Irwin
											Sunnyside Unified School District
										





‘‘

								Clever came up with a process and a solution that meet the needs of school districts across the country. Schools can send relevant information to Clever securely, and vendors have access to the information in a secure manner. Clever is incredibly innovative and  provides a uniquely high industry ROI since it results in cost-savings.
