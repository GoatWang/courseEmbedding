I just read about Karen's passing today.  I'm so sorry and sad to hear about it.  We were very close friends many years ago when Chad was a young child.  We worked together at K-Mart South and were with each almost daily, going to do something.  I have thought about her often through the years.  She was always so pretty and sweet with a "irony" sense of humor.  Even though I have not seen her in years this makes me really miss her.  My best to Brenda, Kristy, and Chad.

We went to the Muncie Boys' Club's Valentine Party and were name prince and princess.  We had our picture in the Muncie paper.  Karen moved away sometime later and I never saw her again, but I still have that memory.
