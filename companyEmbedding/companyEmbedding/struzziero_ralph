Mr. Struzziero is also currently a director of Automobile Club of Southern California, a travel club and property and casualty insurer in California, AAA of Northern New England, a travel club serving Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont, and Auto Club Enterprise, a holding company of these two companies. Mr. Struzziero previously served on the Board of Directors of Prism Medical Ltd., a publicly traded corporation on the TSX Venture Exchange in Canada and manufacturer and distributor of moving and handling equipment for the mobility challenged, from July 2011 until its sale in August 2016, and Downeast Energy Corp., a privately-held company that provides heating products and building supplies, from January 2001 until its sale in April 2012.
Mr. Struzziero has extensive experience in the staffing industry. The Board believes this gives Mr. Struzziero, in his capacity as lead independent director, a unique insight among the non-employee directors relating to Kforce's business and operations.
