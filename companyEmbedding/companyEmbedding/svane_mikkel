‘It’s a hard slog but it’s worth it’—14 startup tips from Mikkel Svane, Founder and CEO, Zendesk

The story of Zendesk from startup to IPO is well captured in the 200-page book, ‘Startup Land: How three guys risked everything to turn an idea into a global business,’ by Mikkel Svane, Founder and CEO.“We succeeded because we worked hard, we cracked some problems early, and we didn’t give up when the weather changed,” begins Mikkel. He shares some of the lessons learned along their journey, but cautions that there is no clear-cut recipe. “There is no formula for success, the world moves too fast for any formula to last,” he warns.Here are my key takeaways from the book, for startup founders and aspiring entrepreneurs. See also my review of the books Startup of You by LinkedIn Founder Reid Hoffman and Things a Little Bird Told Me: Confessions of the Creative Mind by Twitter Co-founder Biz Stone.








 Believe in what you do—even if the path ahead is unclear

Mikkel and his team loved creating useful things for people, products which simplified difficult tasks. The team found motivation and meaning in bringing clean design to the industry. Though they were initially far from Silicon Valley, they founded their company in a tiny loft in Copenhagen, believing that they could still bring change and value to the customer support industry.The path ahead was not just unclear but also unpredictable and even seemed precarious for the co-founders. The steps ahead were confusing and even unstable, but the team stuck together. “Startups are fragile,” Mikkel cautions. When you are charting really new territory, the journey can be “fascinating and terrifying at the same time.” Sometimes you have to trust your intuition, and sometimes you go against it and trust whatever is ahead of you.


 Boring is sexy

Zendesk wanted to improve the way customer service was done and the way customer service products were sold (in the pre-SaaS era), at a time when customers bought software without fully seeing it or testing it, and took 12-18 months to make it work after much sweat and complications. Much of it revolved around telephone-based call centres.Mikkel and team came up with a less expensive solution that could be delivered over the web and was easier to use. “Sexy stuff sometimes happens when you make mundane things easy and accessible. Boring is sexy,” he explains.


 Perseverance

“There are no shortcuts. You have to constantly take the hard route,” says Mikkel. The route is not straight forward either, it can be a “meandering, up-and-down and back-and-forth journey.”“Nothing that is worthwhile is easy. And nothing is more fun,” he says. There will also be asymmetry and unevenness between co-founders in terms of how much work each puts in at different stages of the journey.

 Timing is everything

Zendesk started off by using terms such as ‘love your help desk’ and ‘tender loving customer care’ at a time when such ideas were totally new. The rise of the web gave them a chance to show this could work for customers around the world. Fortunately, the SaaS trend would pick up and validate this model, and consumer internet trends began to sweep through enterprises.
The issue of timing would also surface in a different way years later. Just before Zendesk’s IPO in 2014, valuations of SaaS companies began to drop—but they went ahead with their IPO anyway without postponing it.

 Starting part-time is OK but challenging

You don’t have to quit everything to begin work on a startup. Mikkel and his team had consulting jobs which kept the money flowing in; this helped build and market the first version of their product (see my review of the related book, Originals by Adam Grant). Some co-founders expected to be paid while working on the startup, others didn’t.
“People can live with different risk profiles. You have to accept that and not let that come between you,” Mikkel advises. “Keeping everyone committed was a nightmare. This was the biggest challenge of doing a startup,” he recalls.

 Get the pitch right

When Zendesk first decided to pitch at for a TechCrunch conference, they didn’t get the story right. They were used to having the product speak for itself, but to scale to a wider audience they had to explain the domain, the problem, their product, and its benefits. To appeal to investors, they would also have to go beyond the ‘low-hanging fruit’ to the broader market.


 The soul of the company is more important than investor funds

The first potential investor in Zendesk made all kinds of demands on the founding team and seemed to be trying to weaken them so as to get a better negotiating position. Great investors build unique relationships with founders and retain them as leaders, but bad investors try work around the founders; amateur investors are shortsighted and only want to improve their own position, cautions Mikkel.They turned away this investor, and instead raised money from family and friends. It is important to set their expectations appropriately, and pitch the opportunity as a lottery ticket without influence on the company, Mikkel advises.


 Build relationships with good investors and lawyers

“Working with a VC is almost like entering into a marriage. It’s a long-term proposition, and you lose the complete control you once had over your own destiny,” says Mikkel. Fortunately for Zendesk, they found a good Series A investor in Devdutt Yellurkar, partner at Charles River Ventures.Though they rejected his first offer, he kept the door open for them to re-open negotiations; the conditions included a move to the US for the founding team. “We definitely had more ideas and vision than we had resources and capacity. But that’s the charm of an early startup. There’s no ceiling for your ambitions,” recalls Mikkel.
But dilution of stakes is part of the scale game, and this should be done in a manner acceptable to all. Founders have to open up completely to investors to earn their trust, and learn about the investors’ strategy and portfolio. You also need to learn how to “love and live with lawyers,” advises Mikkel.

 Build good customer relationships

Customer support is built from the inside of a company, right from culture to communication. Building a good relationship is more important than just hard-sell. Call customers proactively even before there is a problem.Customers expect empathy, transparency, a human face, and multi-channel connection. Go from mere responses to engaging conversations. Handcrafted emails (even with spelling mistakes!) seem to draw more responses than templatised emails. For male audiences, a female persona gets more responses.
“Companies need to face the new realities of the customer economy,” Mikkel urges. Customer service is now a very public experience thanks to the Internet and social media; it is no longer just about one transaction, and it no longer happens in a vacuum.Customers share their good and bad stories with the whole world; a good customer experience turns them into promoters. “A good relationship has to be earned every day. Customers who leave teach you about who you are, but also who you are not,” says Mikkel.

 From idealist to realist: learn from mistakes

If customers rant about bad service, it actually shows they have much passion for your product that they care to give feedback about it. Zendesk once increased its prices in an inappropriate manner and drew flak and bad press; the CEO apologised for the mistreatment. They even made T-shirts out of the critical comments as reminders of customer centricity; the T-shirts are still worn today.


 Scale: build a team, office and culture

“One of the great things about building a smart team is that it forces you to grow yourself,” says Mikkel. The general practice is ‘Hire for attitude, train the skills.’ Designing the office space is also a challenge. “It’s hard to balance ego and humility, to balance a desire for quality with a desire for simplicity, and balance modesty with the needs for attracting talent,” he explains.Get feedback but not all decisions have to be democratic when it comes to office design. Graffiti, games and pets sound cool but they have their own issues as well. “And finally, kiss your office space goodbye. You’ll move within a few years,” jokes Mikkel.
“We were looking for people who could interact in a semi-crazy environment and have fun. We didn’t want new hires to come with lots of demands,” he says. Hire people who are multi-talented, adventurous, open-minded, curious, frank, diverse, and have traveled a lot.Team members should respect, trust and like each other—that sounds banal but true and tough to implement. Scandinavians are generally modest people, so the hiring process was a bit of culture shock due to the American propensity for bravado, grandiosity, and exaggeration in resumes and interviews!Management structures keep changing as the company grows, and sometimes you also have to let go of people who have been with you for a long while but are not the best in scale stage. “Hiring people who are way smarter than you and who have a lot more experience is actually really hard. And it’s something you have to learn,” says Mikkel.
Founders also have to become more “official and upstanding” and not just their goofy selves. They have to more carefully watch what they say in full public glare. “Unless you are Steve Jobs, CEOs are not supposed to allude to recreational drug use,” Mikkel jokes.

 Give back to the community

“We believe in the concept of an urban campus,” says Mikkel. Employees are encouraged to eat outside and support local eateries (it initially used to provide free meals). The company helps improve the quality of the neighbourhood as well. For example, after the IPO, 200 employees of the San Francisco office took to the streets to clean up the place.
Parts of the world like Silicon Valley have more mobility, risk-taking culture, and a willingness to keep trying things till they succeed. It is important to spread such elements to other ecosystems as well.

 The IPO is a goal—and a new beginning

Seven years after being founded in Copenhagen, Zendesk went public on 15 May, 2015 on the New York Stock Exchange. The process is a distraction and diversion—but also matures and strengthens the company, recalls Mikkel. Founders must win the confidence of investors, who are looking for the passion and people behind the business.“The IPO was just the first step in our journey to becoming a next-generation enterprise software company,” says Mikkel. The IPO also affects the employees who build lives around the stock price.


 Failure is tough—but start over again

In the 1990s, inspired by the growth of the Internet in the US after a California trip, Mikkel launched his first startup: a web portal in Denmark called Forum.dk. The portal was sold to a newspaper, and a company was started around the product (called by a rather unfortunate name, Caput!). The startup literally went kaput after the dot-com bust of 2001.“Failure is not something to be proud of. But failure is something you can recover from,” says Mikkel. “My first failure was so tough because I had no perspective. I was ripped out of the reality I knew and thrown into a new reality,” he says. It was terrible not to be able to pay bills, to fire people, and not deliver on customer promises—but Mikkel found new colleagues to move on and eventually found Zendesk.
“If you are building a company or thinking about building a company, never forget that relationships are the most important building block. It’s the only way to build a lasting business—and a fantastic life,” Mikkel sums up.

History[edit]
Zendesk was founded in 2007 by Mikkel Svane, Morten Primdahl, and Alexander Aghassipour. The company was started in a loft located in Copenhagen, Denmark.[5] The three men were working in customer service solutions and found several problems with customer tracking and incident reporting software. This prompted them to create an alternative that would be simple and intuitive to use.[6] In June 2008, Zendesk received US$ 500,000 in seed funding from angel investor Christoph Janz.[7] In 2009, following a $6 million series B funding from Charles River Ventures and Benchmark Capital,[8] the company moved to San Francisco to establish its headquarters. In April 2014, Zendesk acquired Zopim Technologies Pte Ltd, a Singapore-based provider of live chat software.[9] Zendesk would eventually turn this software into Zopim Premium Live Chat.[10] In May 2014, Zendesk became a publicly-traded company, debuting with an IPO price of $9 per share.[11] On October 13, 2015, Zendesk acquired We Are Cloud SAS for $45.0 million.[12] We Are Cloud is the maker of BIME Analytics software, the technology that Zendesk now uses to power its customer data platform.[13]
Products and technology[edit]
Product families[edit]
Zendesk's family of products[14] represent the shift the company has made from a single customer service product to a unified consortium of products that are all focused on improving customer relationships.[15] The products help organizations better understand their customers, improve communication, and offer support where and when it is most needed.[15] All of the products in the Zendesk family work closely together through a common user interface and are being developed to provide a single login and a shared customer data platform. The family includes: Support, Guide, Connect, Explore, Help Center, Chat, Talk, and Message.[14]
The software is written in Ruby on Rails, and is notable for its ability to integrate with dozens of content management systems, customer relationship management tools, and web apps.[16][17] The platform is available for mobile and tablet.[18] In 2011 the firm founded the Networked Help Desk initiative to create an open standard for sharing information between separate customer support applications.[19] In December 2013, the firm announced integrations with SurveyMonkey and MailChimp to support the launch of surveys and email campaigns from within Zendesk.[20]
Support[edit]
Zendesk Support is a system for tracking, prioritizing, and solving customer support tickets.[21] It puts all customer information in one place so that everything is in a single location.[22] Zendesk Support is designed to be flexible because no two businesses are exactly alike. It configures any workflow, from the simplest to the most complex, while providing clear visibility into customer interactions. This is important because personalized service requires greater context. Using customer analytics and machine learning capabilities, Zendesk customers can better understand and predict customer satisfaction, measure performance, and uncover actionable insights across their data.[23]
Guide[edit]
Zendesk Guide provides machine learning powered, self-service customer support. Through the use of a combination of the Zendesk API, Web Widget, and Mobile SDK as Zendesk Embeddables, Guide allows companies to deliver intelligent, contextual customer service responses on whatever app or website a customer is using. Guide features the Answer Bot (an AI assistant) and the Knowledge Capture App (an agent-focused content creation app).[24]
Connect[edit]
Zendesk Connect is customer intelligence software built for targeted campaigns and proactive engagement.[25] Connect allows businesses to get to know their customers by collecting customer data from across the Zendesk family of products and providing a complete timeline of events and conversations.
By creating segments of customers based on behavior or profile, identifying trends, or triggering targeted campaigns, it works to get the right message to the right customers. As a result, use of the software can build loyalty and trust. A proactive heads up about issues or a well-timed tip for newbies may deliver assistance before customers know they need it. Zendesk CEO Michael Svane stated, "it provides predictors of where a relationship might move."[25]
Explore[edit]
Zendesk Explore, formerly BIME Analytics, provides analytics to measure and understand the entire customer experience.[26] The product works to make teamwork more efficient by measuring team performance and workload capacity. It has the ability to learn how customers use a business' website, products, or support channels. By analyzing data from every step of a customer's journey, Explore helps understand and improve each customer experience.
The easy-to-use interface and interactive drill-ins surface valuable insights that customers ask for most. By enabling them to create custom metrics, reports, and dashboards, and even perform data joins without SQL, data gets turned into meaningful analyses. Zendesk SVP of Product, Adrian McDermott explained it as "everyman business intelligence” –  taking information from Zendesk products and third-party data to get everything in one place.[26]

Chat (Formerly Zopim)[edit]
Zendesk Chat (formerly Zopim) is an online marketing, live chat support and web analytics product that is offered as a SaaS (Software-as-a-service) model. The product enables companies to chat with visitors in real-time on their websites.[27] A website owner must embed the Zendesk Chat widget into their website's HTML code. Then they can chat with their visitors via the dashboard control panel.[28]
Zopim was founded in 2008 by Royston Tay, Wenxiang Wu, Yang Bin Kwok and Lim Qing Ru.[29] The idea for Zopim live chat emerged while the founders were studying together at Stanford on the NUS Overseas College Program in 2008.[30]
In 2010, Zopim incorporated as a private company and launched its freemium pricing model. They also received seed funding and investment from Media Development Authority’s (MDA) i.JAM program, SPRING Singapore and NUS.[29][31] At that time it was listed in Asia’s Top 10 Apps at Accelerate 2010.[32]
In 2014, Zopim was acquired by Zendesk Inc.[33][34][35]
In February 2015, Zopim moved to a new office in Singapore that also functions as Zendesk’s Asia-Pacific Headquarters.[36][37]
In March 2015, Zendesk formed a partnership with Facebook’s new Businesses on Messenger product.[38] Zopim live chat was the technology powering Businesses on Messenger.[39][40]
In April 2015, Zopim introduced a Premium plan which offers support team leaders workforce management tools on top of the regular chat reports and metrics.[41] Later it was named best Live Chat Software in the Cloudswave Awards 2015.[42] Also in October 2015, TalentLMS has released an update to the Learning Management System that allowed for integration between the two. When integrated, Zopim is to be utilized as means of communication between the learners and the instructional designer [43] On October 26, 2016, Zopim was renamed to Zendesk Chat, aligning with the Zendesk family of products.[44]
Talk[edit]
Zendesk Talk is a cloud-based call center software that can immediately get customers in touch with a company representative via any Internet-connected device.[45] Since it is built right into the Zendesk Support ticketing system, Talk gives customer service teams the ability to provide phone support from the same platform they utilize to manage all of their other channels. They have access to customer history, automatic ticket creation, and call recording, which means agents can focus on conversations with the customers instead of navigating workflow.[15][46]
Talk offers flexible IVR, group routing, and real-time queue monitoring to avoid bottlenecks. With analytics that deliver insight into what is happening, support teams can are equipped to provide flexible, powerful support as businesses evolve.[46] Talk allows businesses to create phone numbers and forward calls to customer representatives’ devices, forgoing the need for physical call centers.[47]
Message[edit]
This digital communications channel gives businesses the opportunity to reach and market to a new generation of customers. Zendesk Message is a messaging software that helps companies engage customers on their favorite messaging apps, like Facebook and Twitter. Using Zendesk Message, businesses can blend human agents with bots to increase efficiency.[10]
Inbox[edit]
Inbox allows Zendesk customers to collaborate on a marketing campaign or any other influx of emails, with the ability to add private notes and follow key conversations.[48]
Embeddables[edit]
Embeddables allows companies to build customer support functions into mobile and web applications.[49] This includes a mobile Software Development Kit, which lets companies offer self-service via Help Center. With embeddables users are able to create support tickets or chat real-time with a Help Center representative through their preferred mobile apps or online sites. This eliminates the need to leave the app for a third-party help center.[50] The tech support process is part of the native experience on the site or application.[51]
Relate[edit]
Relate is Zendesk’s online publication, featuring editorial content dedicated to customer service and business relationships. It connects the business side of what Zendesk does –  create software for improving customer interactions –  to the more general human desire for better relationships.[52] Relate has also been adopted as the branding name for Zendesk conferences, which specialize in customer service case studies, brand relationships and engagement, and industry changes.[53][54]

Philanthropy[edit]
Zendesk Neighbor Foundation[edit]
Zendesk’s headquarters is located in the Tenderloin neighborhood of San Francisco and has made several philanthropic initiatives and charitable donations to the area. The Zendesk Neighbor Foundation, a nonprofit organization started by Zendesk, launched $1 million in funding for local charities working on social issues.[62] In 2015, Zendesk Neighbor Foundation donated $100,000 to St. Anthony’s Tenderloin Technology Lab.[63] Since then, the Foundation has also expanded to the communities of Melbourne, Australia;[64] London, England;[65] and Madison, Wisconsin,[66] where the company has made $100,000+ donations per community to Boys and Girls Clubs, public libraries, employment workshops, Autism organizations, and other local non-profits.
Link-SF, Copenhelp and Link-Dane[edit]
Aside from monetary contributions, Zendesk has also used its technology to develop Link-SF. Link-SF is an app that helps homeless people find shelter, food, medical care, technology access, and hygiene services.[67][68][69] Subsequent to Link SF, Zendesk launched two similar apps: Copenhelp (for Copenhagen)[70] and Link-Dane (for Madison, Wisconsin).[71]
Other Initiatives[edit]
Zendesk joined over 100 companies in filing an Amicus Brief opposing Executive Order 13769. [72]

History[edit]
Zendesk was founded in 2007 by Mikkel Svane, Morten Primdahl, and Alexander Aghassipour. The company was started in a loft located in Copenhagen, Denmark.[5] The three men were working in customer service solutions and found several problems with customer tracking and incident reporting software. This prompted them to create an alternative that would be simple and intuitive to use.[6] In June 2008, Zendesk received US$ 500,000 in seed funding from angel investor Christoph Janz.[7] In 2009, following a $6 million series B funding from Charles River Ventures and Benchmark Capital,[8] the company moved to San Francisco to establish its headquarters. In April 2014, Zendesk acquired Zopim Technologies Pte Ltd, a Singapore-based provider of live chat software.[9] Zendesk would eventually turn this software into Zopim Premium Live Chat.[10] In May 2014, Zendesk became a publicly-traded company, debuting with an IPO price of $9 per share.[11] On October 13, 2015, Zendesk acquired We Are Cloud SAS for $45.0 million.[12] We Are Cloud is the maker of BIME Analytics software, the technology that Zendesk now uses to power its customer data platform.[13]
Products and technology[edit]
Product families[edit]
Zendesk's family of products[14] represent the shift the company has made from a single customer service product to a unified consortium of products that are all focused on improving customer relationships.[15] The products help organizations better understand their customers, improve communication, and offer support where and when it is most needed.[15] All of the products in the Zendesk family work closely together through a common user interface and are being developed to provide a single login and a shared customer data platform. The family includes: Support, Guide, Connect, Explore, Help Center, Chat, Talk, and Message.[14]
The software is written in Ruby on Rails, and is notable for its ability to integrate with dozens of content management systems, customer relationship management tools, and web apps.[16][17] The platform is available for mobile and tablet.[18] In 2011 the firm founded the Networked Help Desk initiative to create an open standard for sharing information between separate customer support applications.[19] In December 2013, the firm announced integrations with SurveyMonkey and MailChimp to support the launch of surveys and email campaigns from within Zendesk.[20]
Support[edit]
Zendesk Support is a system for tracking, prioritizing, and solving customer support tickets.[21] It puts all customer information in one place so that everything is in a single location.[22] Zendesk Support is designed to be flexible because no two businesses are exactly alike. It configures any workflow, from the simplest to the most complex, while providing clear visibility into customer interactions. This is important because personalized service requires greater context. Using customer analytics and machine learning capabilities, Zendesk customers can better understand and predict customer satisfaction, measure performance, and uncover actionable insights across their data.[23]
Guide[edit]
Zendesk Guide provides machine learning powered, self-service customer support. Through the use of a combination of the Zendesk API, Web Widget, and Mobile SDK as Zendesk Embeddables, Guide allows companies to deliver intelligent, contextual customer service responses on whatever app or website a customer is using. Guide features the Answer Bot (an AI assistant) and the Knowledge Capture App (an agent-focused content creation app).[24]
Connect[edit]
Zendesk Connect is customer intelligence software built for targeted campaigns and proactive engagement.[25] Connect allows businesses to get to know their customers by collecting customer data from across the Zendesk family of products and providing a complete timeline of events and conversations.
By creating segments of customers based on behavior or profile, identifying trends, or triggering targeted campaigns, it works to get the right message to the right customers. As a result, use of the software can build loyalty and trust. A proactive heads up about issues or a well-timed tip for newbies may deliver assistance before customers know they need it. Zendesk CEO Michael Svane stated, "it provides predictors of where a relationship might move."[25]
Explore[edit]
Zendesk Explore, formerly BIME Analytics, provides analytics to measure and understand the entire customer experience.[26] The product works to make teamwork more efficient by measuring team performance and workload capacity. It has the ability to learn how customers use a business' website, products, or support channels. By analyzing data from every step of a customer's journey, Explore helps understand and improve each customer experience.
The easy-to-use interface and interactive drill-ins surface valuable insights that customers ask for most. By enabling them to create custom metrics, reports, and dashboards, and even perform data joins without SQL, data gets turned into meaningful analyses. Zendesk SVP of Product, Adrian McDermott explained it as "everyman business intelligence” –  taking information from Zendesk products and third-party data to get everything in one place.[26]

Chat (Formerly Zopim)[edit]
Zendesk Chat (formerly Zopim) is an online marketing, live chat support and web analytics product that is offered as a SaaS (Software-as-a-service) model. The product enables companies to chat with visitors in real-time on their websites.[27] A website owner must embed the Zendesk Chat widget into their website's HTML code. Then they can chat with their visitors via the dashboard control panel.[28]
Zopim was founded in 2008 by Royston Tay, Wenxiang Wu, Yang Bin Kwok and Lim Qing Ru.[29] The idea for Zopim live chat emerged while the founders were studying together at Stanford on the NUS Overseas College Program in 2008.[30]
In 2010, Zopim incorporated as a private company and launched its freemium pricing model. They also received seed funding and investment from Media Development Authority’s (MDA) i.JAM program, SPRING Singapore and NUS.[29][31] At that time it was listed in Asia’s Top 10 Apps at Accelerate 2010.[32]
In 2014, Zopim was acquired by Zendesk Inc.[33][34][35]
In February 2015, Zopim moved to a new office in Singapore that also functions as Zendesk’s Asia-Pacific Headquarters.[36][37]
In March 2015, Zendesk formed a partnership with Facebook’s new Businesses on Messenger product.[38] Zopim live chat was the technology powering Businesses on Messenger.[39][40]
In April 2015, Zopim introduced a Premium plan which offers support team leaders workforce management tools on top of the regular chat reports and metrics.[41] Later it was named best Live Chat Software in the Cloudswave Awards 2015.[42] Also in October 2015, TalentLMS has released an update to the Learning Management System that allowed for integration between the two. When integrated, Zopim is to be utilized as means of communication between the learners and the instructional designer [43] On October 26, 2016, Zopim was renamed to Zendesk Chat, aligning with the Zendesk family of products.[44]
Talk[edit]
Zendesk Talk is a cloud-based call center software that can immediately get customers in touch with a company representative via any Internet-connected device.[45] Since it is built right into the Zendesk Support ticketing system, Talk gives customer service teams the ability to provide phone support from the same platform they utilize to manage all of their other channels. They have access to customer history, automatic ticket creation, and call recording, which means agents can focus on conversations with the customers instead of navigating workflow.[15][46]
Talk offers flexible IVR, group routing, and real-time queue monitoring to avoid bottlenecks. With analytics that deliver insight into what is happening, support teams can are equipped to provide flexible, powerful support as businesses evolve.[46] Talk allows businesses to create phone numbers and forward calls to customer representatives’ devices, forgoing the need for physical call centers.[47]
Message[edit]
This digital communications channel gives businesses the opportunity to reach and market to a new generation of customers. Zendesk Message is a messaging software that helps companies engage customers on their favorite messaging apps, like Facebook and Twitter. Using Zendesk Message, businesses can blend human agents with bots to increase efficiency.[10]
Inbox[edit]
Inbox allows Zendesk customers to collaborate on a marketing campaign or any other influx of emails, with the ability to add private notes and follow key conversations.[48]
Embeddables[edit]
Embeddables allows companies to build customer support functions into mobile and web applications.[49] This includes a mobile Software Development Kit, which lets companies offer self-service via Help Center. With embeddables users are able to create support tickets or chat real-time with a Help Center representative through their preferred mobile apps or online sites. This eliminates the need to leave the app for a third-party help center.[50] The tech support process is part of the native experience on the site or application.[51]
Relate[edit]
Relate is Zendesk’s online publication, featuring editorial content dedicated to customer service and business relationships. It connects the business side of what Zendesk does –  create software for improving customer interactions –  to the more general human desire for better relationships.[52] Relate has also been adopted as the branding name for Zendesk conferences, which specialize in customer service case studies, brand relationships and engagement, and industry changes.[53][54]

Philanthropy[edit]
Zendesk Neighbor Foundation[edit]
Zendesk’s headquarters is located in the Tenderloin neighborhood of San Francisco and has made several philanthropic initiatives and charitable donations to the area. The Zendesk Neighbor Foundation, a nonprofit organization started by Zendesk, launched $1 million in funding for local charities working on social issues.[62] In 2015, Zendesk Neighbor Foundation donated $100,000 to St. Anthony’s Tenderloin Technology Lab.[63] Since then, the Foundation has also expanded to the communities of Melbourne, Australia;[64] London, England;[65] and Madison, Wisconsin,[66] where the company has made $100,000+ donations per community to Boys and Girls Clubs, public libraries, employment workshops, Autism organizations, and other local non-profits.
Link-SF, Copenhelp and Link-Dane[edit]
Aside from monetary contributions, Zendesk has also used its technology to develop Link-SF. Link-SF is an app that helps homeless people find shelter, food, medical care, technology access, and hygiene services.[67][68][69] Subsequent to Link SF, Zendesk launched two similar apps: Copenhelp (for Copenhagen)[70] and Link-Dane (for Madison, Wisconsin).[71]

History[edit]
Zendesk was founded in 2007 by Mikkel Svane, Morten Primdahl, and Alexander Aghassipour. The company was started in a loft located in Copenhagen, Denmark.[5] The three men were working in customer service solutions and found several problems with customer tracking and incident reporting software. This prompted them to create an alternative that would be simple and intuitive to use.[6] In June 2008, Zendesk received US$ 500,000 in seed funding from angel investor Christoph Janz.[7] In 2009, following a $6 million series B funding from Charles River Ventures and Benchmark Capital,[8] the company moved to San Francisco to establish its headquarters. In April 2014, Zendesk acquired Zopim Technologies Pte Ltd, a Singapore-based provider of live chat software.[9] Zendesk would eventually turn this software into Zopim Premium Live Chat.[10] In May 2014, Zendesk became a publicly-traded company, debuting with an IPO price of $9 per share.[11] On October 13, 2015, Zendesk acquired We Are Cloud SAS for $45.0 million.[12] We Are Cloud is the maker of BIME Analytics software, the technology that Zendesk now uses to power its customer data platform.[13]
Products and technology[edit]
Product families[edit]
Zendesk's family of products[14] represent the shift the company has made from a single customer service product to a unified consortium of products that are all focused on improving customer relationships.[15] The products help organizations better understand their customers, improve communication, and offer support where and when it is most needed.[15] All of the products in the Zendesk family work closely together through a common user interface and are being developed to provide a single login and a shared customer data platform. The family includes: Support, Guide, Connect, Explore, Help Center, Chat, Talk, and Message.[14]
The software is written in Ruby on Rails, and is notable for its ability to integrate with dozens of content management systems, customer relationship management tools, and web apps.[16][17] The platform is available for mobile and tablet.[18] In 2011 the firm founded the Networked Help Desk initiative to create an open standard for sharing information between separate customer support applications.[19] In December 2013, the firm announced integrations with SurveyMonkey and MailChimp to support the launch of surveys and email campaigns from within Zendesk.[20]
Support[edit]
Zendesk Support is a system for tracking, prioritizing, and solving customer support tickets.[21] It puts all customer information in one place so that everything is in a single location.[22] Zendesk Support is designed to be flexible because no two businesses are exactly alike. It configures any workflow, from the simplest to the most complex, while providing clear visibility into customer interactions. This is important because personalized service requires greater context. Using customer analytics and machine learning capabilities, Zendesk customers can better understand and predict customer satisfaction, measure performance, and uncover actionable insights across their data.[23]
Guide[edit]
Zendesk Guide provides machine learning powered, self-service customer support. Through the use of a combination of the Zendesk API, Web Widget, and Mobile SDK as Zendesk Embeddables, Guide allows companies to deliver intelligent, contextual customer service responses on whatever app or website a customer is using. Guide features the Answer Bot (an AI assistant) and the Knowledge Capture App (an agent-focused content creation app).[24]
Connect[edit]
Zendesk Connect is customer intelligence software built for targeted campaigns and proactive engagement.[25] Connect allows businesses to get to know their customers by collecting customer data from across the Zendesk family of products and providing a complete timeline of events and conversations.
By creating segments of customers based on behavior or profile, identifying trends, or triggering targeted campaigns, it works to get the right message to the right customers. As a result, use of the software can build loyalty and trust. A proactive heads up about issues or a well-timed tip for newbies may deliver assistance before customers know they need it. Zendesk CEO Michael Svane stated, "it provides predictors of where a relationship might move."[25]
Explore[edit]
Zendesk Explore, formerly BIME Analytics, provides analytics to measure and understand the entire customer experience.[26] The product works to make teamwork more efficient by measuring team performance and workload capacity. It has the ability to learn how customers use a business' website, products, or support channels. By analyzing data from every step of a customer's journey, Explore helps understand and improve each customer experience.
The easy-to-use interface and interactive drill-ins surface valuable insights that customers ask for most. By enabling them to create custom metrics, reports, and dashboards, and even perform data joins without SQL, data gets turned into meaningful analyses. Zendesk SVP of Product, Adrian McDermott explained it as "everyman business intelligence” –  taking information from Zendesk products and third-party data to get everything in one place.[26]

Chat (Formerly Zopim)[edit]
Zendesk Chat (formerly Zopim) is an online marketing, live chat support and web analytics product that is offered as a SaaS (Software-as-a-service) model. The product enables companies to chat with visitors in real-time on their websites.[27] A website owner must embed the Zendesk Chat widget into their website's HTML code. Then they can chat with their visitors via the dashboard control panel.[28]
Zopim was founded in 2008 by Royston Tay, Wenxiang Wu, Yang Bin Kwok and Lim Qing Ru.[29] The idea for Zopim live chat emerged while the founders were studying together at Stanford on the NUS Overseas College Program in 2008.[30]
In 2010, Zopim incorporated as a private company and launched its freemium pricing model. They also received seed funding and investment from Media Development Authority’s (MDA) i.JAM program, SPRING Singapore and NUS.[29][31] At that time it was listed in Asia’s Top 10 Apps at Accelerate 2010.[32]
In 2014, Zopim was acquired by Zendesk Inc.[33][34][35]
In February 2015, Zopim moved to a new office in Singapore that also functions as Zendesk’s Asia-Pacific Headquarters.[36][37]
In March 2015, Zendesk formed a partnership with Facebook’s new Businesses on Messenger product.[38] Zopim live chat was the technology powering Businesses on Messenger.[39][40]
In April 2015, Zopim introduced a Premium plan which offers support team leaders workforce management tools on top of the regular chat reports and metrics.[41] Later it was named best Live Chat Software in the Cloudswave Awards 2015.[42] Also in October 2015, TalentLMS has released an update to the Learning Management System that allowed for integration between the two. When integrated, Zopim is to be utilized as means of communication between the learners and the instructional designer [43] On October 26, 2016, Zopim was renamed to Zendesk Chat, aligning with the Zendesk family of products.[44]
Talk[edit]
Zendesk Talk is a cloud-based call center software that can immediately get customers in touch with a company representative via any Internet-connected device.[45] Since it is built right into the Zendesk Support ticketing system, Talk gives customer service teams the ability to provide phone support from the same platform they utilize to manage all of their other channels. They have access to customer history, automatic ticket creation, and call recording, which means agents can focus on conversations with the customers instead of navigating workflow.[15][46]
Talk offers flexible IVR, group routing, and real-time queue monitoring to avoid bottlenecks. With analytics that deliver insight into what is happening, support teams can are equipped to provide flexible, powerful support as businesses evolve.[46] Talk allows businesses to create phone numbers and forward calls to customer representatives’ devices, forgoing the need for physical call centers.[47]
Message[edit]
This digital communications channel gives businesses the opportunity to reach and market to a new generation of customers. Zendesk Message is a messaging software that helps companies engage customers on their favorite messaging apps, like Facebook and Twitter. Using Zendesk Message, businesses can blend human agents with bots to increase efficiency.[10]
Inbox[edit]
Inbox allows Zendesk customers to collaborate on a marketing campaign or any other influx of emails, with the ability to add private notes and follow key conversations.[48]
Embeddables[edit]
Embeddables allows companies to build customer support functions into mobile and web applications.[49] This includes a mobile Software Development Kit, which lets companies offer self-service via Help Center. With embeddables users are able to create support tickets or chat real-time with a Help Center representative through their preferred mobile apps or online sites. This eliminates the need to leave the app for a third-party help center.[50] The tech support process is part of the native experience on the site or application.[51]
Relate[edit]
Relate is Zendesk’s online publication, featuring editorial content dedicated to customer service and business relationships. It connects the business side of what Zendesk does –  create software for improving customer interactions –  to the more general human desire for better relationships.[52] Relate has also been adopted as the branding name for Zendesk conferences, which specialize in customer service case studies, brand relationships and engagement, and industry changes.[53][54]

Philanthropy[edit]
Zendesk Neighbor Foundation[edit]
Zendesk’s headquarters is located in the Tenderloin neighborhood of San Francisco and has made several philanthropic initiatives and charitable donations to the area. The Zendesk Neighbor Foundation, a nonprofit organization started by Zendesk, launched $1 million in funding for local charities working on social issues.[62] In 2015, Zendesk Neighbor Foundation donated $100,000 to St. Anthony’s Tenderloin Technology Lab.[63] Since then, the Foundation has also expanded to the communities of Melbourne, Australia;[64] London, England;[65] and Madison, Wisconsin,[66] where the company has made $100,000+ donations per community to Boys and Girls Clubs, public libraries, employment workshops, Autism organizations, and other local non-profits.
Link-SF, Copenhelp and Link-Dane[edit]
Aside from monetary contributions, Zendesk has also used its technology to develop Link-SF. Link-SF is an app that helps homeless people find shelter, food, medical care, technology access, and hygiene services.[67][68][69] Subsequent to Link SF, Zendesk launched two similar apps: Copenhelp (for Copenhagen)[70] and Link-Dane (for Madison, Wisconsin).[71]

Mr. Marc Cabi, you may begin your conference.
Marc Cabi
Thank you, Rob, and welcome to our first quarter 2017 earnings call. We are pleased to report our financial results for the quarter. Joining me on the call today are Mikkel Svane, Founder, CEO and Chair of the Board; and Elena Gomez, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we get into the results, let me pass along a few reminders. Our shareholder letter is available at investor.zendesk.com, it details our full results and commentary.
During the course of today's call, we may make forward-looking statements, such as statements regarding our future financial performance, product development, growth prospects, ability to attract and retain customers and our ability to compete effectively. The assumptions, risks and factors that could affect our actual results are contained in our earnings press release and in the Risk Factor section of our prior and subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-Q and our upcoming Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
We undertake no obligation to update these statements after today's presentation, or to conform these statements to actual results or to changes in our expectations, except as required by law. Please refer to today's earnings release for more information regarding forward-looking statements.
During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute or in isolation from our GAAP financial information. You could find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliations with the comparable GAAP financial measures in today's earnings press release, shareholder letter and for certain non-GAAP financial measures for prior periods in the earnings press releases for such prior periods, all of which are available on our investor website.
With this brief introduction, I would like to turn the call over to Mikkel.
Mikkel Svane
Alright, prefect. Thank you, Marc, and good evening, good afternoon, everybody. Along with completing a first - solid first quarter of results, we also made major progress across our long term growth opportunities in new products, in industry integrations and in international expansion. You can read much more about that in our Shareholder letter.
We believe we are in a good position for 2017 to maintain the strength of our transactional business as we continue our enterprise class business. Here I would particularly like to highlight our recent progress in expanding our product family.
Just this week we launched Zendesk Guide. It's a new smart knowledge base solution and evolution of our current help center functionality that is part of our call center product but comes with new features, new functionality and new capabilities and of course opens additional monetization opportunities for us. Guide capitalizes on the desires of consumers of customer today to help themselves. And we do that by giving them a smart self-service support solution powered by machine learning.

Also today, we are announcing our acquisition of Outbound and welcoming the full team in the Zendesk family. Outbound believes that customers today experiences and expect communication to build around them not being built around the business or the business department. Outbound focuses on making those types of communication much more relevant at a time where customers are updated with messages from brands.
By using Outbound, businesses can automate and deliver relevant messages across web across e-mail and mobile channels and can measure of the effectiveness of those messages shifting the focus from the quality of messages delivered to the to the quality of customer attractions. So Outbound really complements our vision for Zendesk Connect, which we have about on earlier calls.
With Connects, we're working on making communication with customers much more proactive and predictive throughout the customer experience. We learned a lot from our own customers who are already using Outbound and we decided that working to combine Outbound and Connect into a single product would offer our customers the best experience and that is now quickly realize our regional vision for Connect. So we'll be working on an integrated product while we continue to offer Outbound to new customers and support its current customers.
It's been almost exactly one year to the day today since Elena, Bryan. Elena, our CFO; Bryan, our CRO, Chief Revenue Officer; and Tom, our CIO joined Zendesk and joined the management team.
Over the past four months, we have invested, we have laid the ground work for future success and we have today the team, the product portfolio, the customer base and the rapid pace of innovation in place for successful year and to keep us on cause to reach out $1 billion revenue target in 2020. Our financial outlook for full-year 2017 reflects our strong position and remains strong. We expect revenue to be in the range of $417 million to $425 million for the full year.
None of the opportunities that we have ahead of us would be possible without our customers and without our employees. We ended the first quarter with more than 100,000 paid customer accounts, it's a great milestone for us and we also have more than 1,700 employees worldwide. I would like to thank all of them our customers, our employees, you guys for the continued support and for making contributions toward our growth.
And with that, back to Marc.

Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from line of Bhavan Suri from William Blair. Your line is open.
Bhavan Suri
Thank you. Hey, guys, do you hear me, okay.
Mikkel Svane
We can. Hi, Bhavan.
Bhavan Suri
Great, hi, and congratulation. Before I jump on the financial, I just have a quick question for Mikkel on Zendesk guide. As you look at that product, is there specific segments that you're targeting and how should we think about the ASP lift the product could have? It seems like an extension of your core help center offering, but inclusion of AI, so where do you see these are playing out alongside the core also we like get sort of how that's position not just as a product but also which customers you target [ph].
Mikkel Svane
So we will retain some very basic help center capabilities across support products, but we will focus all our investments and the continued kind of development of these capabilities in the guide product. That makes a lot of sense for many different reasons. It will also help us much better towards our customers kind of produce the value statements then makes it obvious for them while guide, actually and why self-service and why providing smart self-service options makes a lot of sense for that business.

So it really helps us focus our value statements, our value proposal around that product and of course add some monetization opportunity all to all across customer. The option of kind of these kind of self-service capabilities are very broad across our customer base, whether you work with technical support or whether you work with consumer support, you want to give this seamless customer experience where you almost predictive in your capabilities to kind of provide the wide answer to the customer. So it's a very broad opportunity and we look very much forwards testing it with new customers.
And move on from a revenue perspective obviously with all of our products we launch and let them evolve over time, but there will be some difference subscription models around guide and especially how AI and ML work within the guide product for self-service and delivering correct answers which will elaborate a little bit more on as we go forward. But there are lots of good subscription opportunities as the product evolves.
Bhavan Suri
Got it. That's really helpful. And then a quick follow-up for me, it's been a little bit of time now since you have changed subscription package pricing, can you speak to how that impacted sort of average seat count for customer, you know that gone up and sort of could you just remind where average seat counts are?Thank you.
Mikkel Svane
So we haven't really described average seat counts because of the large customer base with the long tail. What I would say is that in general, we are beginning to do more and more with larger companies and larger opportunities within either existing customer or new customers. So we would expect our average to move up over time based on that activity. But again averages are really difficult to kind of certain. In Q1 specifically we highlighted this in the letter, it's a very transactional more of an SMB small business kind of quarter, and so that kind of plays out in those results.
Bhavan Suri
Great. That's really helpful, guys. Thanks for my questions there and nice job.
Mikkel Svane
Thank you, Bhavan.

Your next question comes from the line of Jesse Hulsing from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Jesse Hulsing
Yeah. Thank you. I wanted to touch a little bit on the enterprise or big or bigger customer part of your business. The mix was flat quarter-over-quarter at 34% and that's somewhat backwards looking. I'm curious, what are you seeing on the enterprise side and I know you guys went through some sales hashed and rehashed that multiple times about how do you feel about where the sales organization that as you as you finish up the first quarter and get into the second quarter.
Elena Gomez
Jesse, I can take that. So we feel very confident that the majority of the sales reorganize behind us and Brian done a nice job of retaining the top talent that we have. In terms of the new talent that is being onboard and obviously that takes some time to ramp, but we continue to feel that our pipeline is showing good signs of larger deals and we think of those as you know seasonally to show up more in the back half of the year.
Jesse Hulsing
Got it. And can you update us on your unicorn concentration I guess you want to call it that one of your software peers have some issues this week with Uber starting to end source part of their provided functionality. Are you seeing anything similar and do you see that as any sort of risk to your business? Thank you.
Mikkel Svane
So, we haven't really updated percentage of revenue that comes from so-called unicorn is only because we need a finite list to compare against to create that revenue number and the Wall Street Journal it has created a new list for us to compare against. With certain customers different companies including ourselves have to contend with the fact that once in a while they build in some futures that they might have taken from outside. But we feel very confident with our large customers in that category that we have really good working relationships with them and will participate in their future growth.

Jesse Hulsing
Thank you, Mike.
Mikkel Svane
Thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of Stan Zlotsky from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Stan Zlotsky
Hey, guys. Thank you so much for taking my question. So maybe just to start off, as you went through Q1 and the results came together, did anything surprise you either positive or negative is to how that the results came together in the quarter?
Elena Gomez
We had a really nice pickup at the end of the quarter as it relates to our low transactional business which was obviously great news, but other than that no major surprises for us.
Stan Zlotsky
Got it. Thank you. And maybe just small follow-up the 115% retention what was a pretty good result in line with what we saw in Q4. What is driving your up-sell now and in addition to that if you were to strip that up-sell, how has your gross retention rate been trending in recent quarters? That's it for me. Thank you.
Elena Gomez
Yes. So the majority of our expansion continues to come from existing installs adding more agents as well as moving up to a different plan. But we are starting to see with multiproduct more cross sell, our customers as our customers are adopting more of our products and we'll continue to see that move. In terms of our retention, I can tell you that our churning contraction combine has remained steady.
Stan Zlotsky
Perfect. Thank you very much.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Brendan Barnicle from Pacific Crest. Your line is open.
Brendan Barnicle
Thank you. I just wanted to follow-up on kind of the customer - kind of - type of customer you guys are seeing, if I look at the average kind of revenue per customer, the trend lines there are still growing, but at a slower pace than we've seen in the past. Should we look at that as new customers that you're on-boarding are smaller, walk us through what you're seeing relative of the type of customer that you're adding in the quarter and what type of trends you're seeing there I would assume with higher multi-product that has you could start to see that grow and maybe start accelerate, but walk or what you're seeing on the type of customers you're on boarding here and then uptake of multiple products?
Mikkel Svane
Thanks Brendan.I'll start would be answered here and then we'll get some additional comments. But when you look at our customer count, it really is something that we need to continue to grow but we're looking at the value of those customers more than just the count of customers, so it's quality versus quantity from a customer comp perspective. If you were to kind of look, we do have a seasonal pattern where in the first quarter we have a lot more customer count generated from the SMB space. And as we go through the year, the customer will tilt toward more enterprise type or larger organizations, so that definitely plays a role.
There is a big focus internally in 2017 to have our existing customers existing customers adopt additional products. We'll talk a little bit more about that specifically at our Analyst Day next week or I guess it's in week and half. And so but that is a large focus, Bryan's team this year is to make sure that we educate our customers on all of our products that are becoming available to them.
Brendan Barnicle
Helpful thanks.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Samad Samani from Stevens. Your line is open.
Samad Samani
Hi there, thanks for taking my questions. First maybe just one on guidance, if you think about for 2Q the implied midpoint is just below 35% year-over-year and for the year it's fairly close as well, and then when think about your 2020 target effectively requires you to stay around this growth level pretty consistently for the next few years. How should we get comfortable around that given the detail that we've seen? And then I have a follow-up.

Elena Gomez
Yeah, I think a couple things, we think about that a lot, and I think that the key is as we move up market or our business is starting to show more signs of seasonality that you see with enterprise like buyers, so that's one thing to think about within the context of the year. I also think that as we build out more products in our multiply product goal that will be a key lever to our growth to 2020, which we have not really had a history of so far.
Samad Samani
Gotcha. And then I guess maybe if I could ask what type of visibility do you have into guidance and that's my last question? Thank you.
Elena Gomez
The way we approach guidance is really looking at the transactional business as far as which is highly predictable and we place a high probability around that and in terms of sort of the larger installs given there's more tolls to cross to get those deals over the finish line, we place a lower probability overtime you know and we'll get more history with that and be more precise, but at the moment that's how we approach guidance.
Samad Samani
Great, appreciated taking my questions.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Derrick Wood from Cowen and Company. Your line is open.
Derrick Wood
Great, thanks. So you guys are scaling customers very healthy clip, you guys support a lot of API calls into the platform that requires a lot of cloud infrastructure, and I know when Tom came a year ago one of the things he was going to work on was building up availability and security on the infrastructure, just wondering kind of where you guys stand today on that, and I think there were some kind of uptime challenges last year, and maybe ongoing, but are you feeling like that's mostly behind you just trying to get a sense for where you are on that effort?
Mikkel Svane
When I think uptime unable abilities never behind you, like we are in a transition moving to cloud infrastructure from our own data centers, and we have definitely accelerated some of these projects to really take benefit and take advantage of the some of the advantages that we can find in the cloud infrastructure, because we are incredibly mature today. So definitely matured and definitely accelerated that part of the process and we believe that's one of the things we really owe to our customers is to provide them with an excellent environment, that they can depend on and then some of the challenges that we've had is basically over some of last year like it's - like it's not good enough. And we didn't live up to our own promise to our customers and we have accelerated some investments and some of our products to make sure that we will do what's best for our customers and provide them with best of class infrastructure and reliability.
Elena Gomez
I would just add that in the shareholder letter we talked a little bit about gross margin and the fact that this investment in the year where we have both a Colos strategy and moving to and AWS that that will put some tax on our gross margin, but as Mikkel said it's the right thing to do in particular as we move up market, so just stay tuned for that.
Mikkel Svane
Yeah, so the bottom line on gross margin is, we don't normally guide to gross margin, but in 2017 gross margin will continue to have a slight penalty as a result of the hybrid investment that's occurring, and once we're through that transition we'll see gross margin improve.
Derrick Wood
Great. And with the acquisition of outbound and combined that with Connect. Are you going to go after a different type of user more of a marketing person or is the idea to turn a customer service agent more into a marketer?
Mikkel Svane
Well, I think what is already happening is that we're talking to more and more different buyers in our customer base, because I really supporting the customer experience is not just the responsibility of this department of that department, it's really a responsibility across the organization. So we already in the process of talking to more buyers and then the Connect product with outbound is definitely also outside of the kind of a call traditional customer service buyer so that will continue to push us in that direction.

But I think more interesting is that what we see with kind of a new generation of businesses and also new kind of innovative groups within some of the larger enterprises, but if think very differently about this and they think of how to nurture the customer experience, and really nurturing the customer lifetime happen through a different momentum and a different way of doing business than think about your traditional sales marketing and customer service, operating mode. So these are really the new type of customers we are gathering for and we see a tremendous amount of growth in that market.
Derrick Wood
Great, thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Phil Winslow
Hi, guys, thanks guys for taking my questions, just a couple questions. First one back on the velocity business, earlier you mentioned an uptick that saw towards the end of the quarter, that's something I know that you'd see seasonally and then we think about just had transactional business over the course of the quarter versus the trends that you'd seen over the past few, any changes there than just one quick follow-up for Mikkel.
Elena Gomez
I think I'm to be honest, I think that has a lot to do with some of the focus that Bryan has brought in on the operational side of the business, he is just making it easier for our sales reps to focus on time with the customer and selling. So I think that's starting to pay off, so that's good news because we expect to see that to continue.
Phil Winslow
Got it. And then Mikkel as far as the new products obviously you've commented on Connect plus outbound, but we look at it to explore for example, et cetera, how should we expect these to roll out and then sort of how do you think about just your expectations for uptick of some of these new services within the base?
Mikkel Svane
Well we haven't we announced - we haven't announced a general availability date for the new Connect products yet, but we will doing this year and you will hear more about explorer later this year. We are excited to get these products out. We are excited it changes our conversation with customers, it helps us having some more broader conversation and we can already see how you know that how people are think about this and brand goes beyond just talking about customer, traditional customer support. So it's exciting like from a bookings revenue perspective this year we have it's a lot about the additional products is Chad and talk for us to really sell this year, Chad is doing really well, target still in its early innings, but like with tremendous amount of momentum really becoming the preferred solution for our own customers. So bookings wise revenue impact wise these are really the product for this year that we're focusing on.
Phil Winslow
Got it, make us.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Tom Roderick from Stifel. Your line is open.
Tom Roderick
Hi guys, thanks for taking my question. I want to talk a little bit about your support and interacting here with the AWS Connect product and you've got - you've certainly got some experience now under your belt with that, can you guys really talk a little bit about just how what integration has gone, how feedback it's coming from my customers, anything you can say about that that certainly an interesting partnership there? Thanks.
Mikkel Svane
So we spent time with the team at AWS Connect prior to its launch, they will be one of you know the 35 plus CTI vendors we integrate with. What's interesting is AWS Connect comes at a time when we've also seen you know some of the traditional on prim players having more financial difficulties. So it is very probable from my perspective that you know it could allow for some more acceptance of SAS in the traditional call center world that's normally been on prim oriented, too early to tell you know how quickly that kind of trend plays out, but I would think that AWS Connect is a good product that could propelled some of that momentum forward. We view all of those products as extremely important as part of our partner programming within the top category, but we will also continue do have our own talk solution, some customers want to have that one vendor approach.

Tom Roderick
Got it, good. Helpful. And last question from me, just thinking about the international revenue still sticking right around 46% of revenues, as you look at some of the or more recent offices you've opened up whether it's APAC or France or investment you've been making over in international regions. Any particular international territories you'd point out having some extra momentum of places that you're - that you'd like to put additional resources to accelerate things.
Mikkel Svane
Well, we generally open up new countries within geographies, and so last year within Asia-Pac we spent time opening up and investing a little bit more in India and Japan and seeing some very good early returns off a small base in both of those countries. We've done really well in Brazil, while Brazil's been having a tough economy over the last two three years, that team is now expanding into the Spanish speaking countries within Latin and so Mexico is kind of on their target list in their seeing good reception there.
And then in Europe you know we have a very strong presence in northern Europe less so in southern Europe, and there's a huge opportunity for that vendors team to be more visible in France and other southern European countries, so that's kind of the effort you'll see from us in 2017 in Europe.
Tom Roderick
That's great color Thank you Mikkel.

Your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
Kash Rangan
Hey guys thanks for taking my question, I just had a question on the long term financial goals for 2020 billion dollars in revenue that would imply that from fiscal 2017 updated guidance of the company, it's a grow lot of 32%, 33% type CAGR it's more or less in line with what we experienced in Q1, as the numbers get larger, how comfortable do you feel that you can hold these growth rates. And also secondly curious how you're thinking about field sales capacity growth rate for this year? That's it from me. Thank you.
Elena Gomez
So, I would comment you know Kash, we definitely look at the long term growth and understand the CAGR and really the key is, we're early in our multiproduct strategy, and we believe we had - have a set of solutions for our customers will serve them in their transformation, so we think that as we look at multiproduct adoption and continue to focus our land and expand strategy. We're setting ourselves up for sustaining back room, so that's how we think about. You had a second question.
Mikkel Svane
About the sales, I mean cover that…
Elena Gomez
All the fields, yeah, go ahead.
Mikkel Svane
So Bryan has really been working to as you know restructure, which is pretty much behind us, but part of that restructure activity was to put strategic sales reps, account reps in market, and so for the first time we have account executives who will be closer to our customers and potential customers, and we're already seeing a benefit to that activity, so first time more that gives been out in especially North America in region with the representation, and so that's up to an early start and he's ramping up those individuals right now.

Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Kees from Summit Redstone. Your line is open.
Jonathan Kees
Great. Thanks for taking my question guys, and I just had a couple of questions here, as you get more into the larger customers and also even with unit requirements, are you seeing a lot of dual sourcing taking place. Especially with the larger customers, I would think that there would invite multiple people in for the RFPs. That's the first question.
Mikkel Svane
Well so, generally customer will kind of rely on a few vendors for different types of application that they're trying to serve we oftentimes through as our land and expand model try to short circuit the normal traditional RFP process, but we do also compete often in the RFP process. When we compete in the RFP process our winning power is around total cost of ownership time the first ticket, the flexibility of our product, the future Jodi out of our products, so you know those are the things that we put forward to gain you know standing in those RFP proposals, and those are the fee type sales actions.

Jonathan Kees
Okay, so in those RFP situations in and I guess you would encounter I would assume more the bigger players who also offer solution as one part of their packages of software offerings, are you seeing more pressure from the big guys are you also seeing pressure from the smaller guys at the bottom end with more the transactional business, just curious in terms of competitive picture?
Elena Gomez
Our competitive picture hasn't really changed, frankly in and leases I have been here, we continue to see obviously service cloud on the high end and we continue to have a fragmented market on the low end. So we're not - we're not really seeing anything emerge as giving us cause for concern to change our strategy.
Jonathan Kees
Okay, great, that's helpful. Thanks a lot guys, good.

Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Van Rhee from Craig Hallum. Your line is open.
Jeff Van Rhee
Great, thanks. A couple from me maybe first understanding the limitations of our billings number, maybe you could comment if you met your own bookings expectation. And then second on outbound can you give us some sense of size revenue headcount they have live customers a little better sense of how mature the product was in the company itself?
Mikkel Svane
We do not comment on bookings, but from a calculated billings perspective, two things I'll remind everyone, only about approximately 50% of our revenues are invoiced annually, the rest is invoiced quarterly and monthly and Q1is the transactional quarter, so there's a lot of debt activity in Q1.
As far as out bound they have customer base, we had some overlapping customers, that's where we kind of discovered that we were taking some parallel pass and we could take up - take what they've done and what we've done from our connect program and create something that is bigger better, but also one we thought we can monetize sooner than just pursuing Connect on its own, so we're really pleased to have that Connect team or the out bound team join our Connect team to make this a very nice solution for the customer experience.
Jeff Van Rhee
And any semblance of their size that you can share?
Mikkel Svane
Yeah generally there were small company, that was generating revenues and developed a really nice product, and we will upscale that for Zendesk to go after our larger customers with it. But that's all I want to say.
Jeff Van Rhee
Okay, thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of Ian Strgar from UBS. Your line is open.
Ian Strgar
Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. We noticed that during the quarter there were some outages that were posted to your site, I'm wondering if you guys could just give us a little more color on one whether that impacted your ability to meet SLA agreements. And to just kind of how your whole infrastructure strategy it is looking going into the rest of 2017?
Mikkel Svane
Yes, I just want to start a high level, and what I said previously like we've had some outages and we didn't live up to our own expectations. Specifically we've had some capacity issues that we have remedied, a fixed and we have accelerated, as we said on move to cloud infrastructure, so we can have a more elastic environment which that benefits our growth rates, which is one of the issues on our infrastructure. So definitely we we've seen some outages that got that going to amplified by some of our capacity issues, we have accelerated our move to kind of structure because that projects involved in that, and setting ourselves a better op for the rest of the year and to live up to the full promise of our customers. As far as bridges, Elena?
Elena Gomez
No we haven't add anything outside any financial impact and don't expect that this time.

Ian Strgar
Okay, great. And Mikkel, it's been about a year now since you brought on Brian Cox to lead enterprise sales initiative. I'm wondering if you can just comment on now that you have 12 months in your rearview mirror, can you just kind of comment on how he has performs and the progress he has made relative to your initial expectation.
Mikkel Svane
So, it's been almost exactly of a year since both Elena, Tom and Brian joined us and it's been a fantastic years. It's been great. It's been - no, but it's like any new few new executive to your management team is traditionally complicated but likely we've been incredibly successful with both the dynamic and the result that we are creating as a team. So I'm very excited about that with Brian specifically like Brian comes with a ton of professional jobs and operational jobs and has really helped us scale and set the organization up for future success.
And I am really excited about that. This is his job as a Chief Revenue Officer, is really to ensure both of current execution and said while sending ourselves out for the future and it's a lot of work, which he will also tell you if you come to Analyst Day. But like it, it's going really well and I'm - I couldn't be more excited about adding such great talent in both Elena, Tom and Brian to my team here.
Ian Strgar
Okay. Great. And if I could squeeze one more in, the connect product, could you just give us any more color on that particular the connect product and how the early customer reception has been and if there's just been any kind of interesting conversations or used cases with that particular product that kind of spans outside of core customer service?
Mikkel Svane
We've learned tremendously from the connect product and from the early access program that we've had. And I think running into outbound with a bunch of our customers has also informed us about the right direction for that product. So excited to have the outbound team join us and it's been really interesting to see what some of our customers are doing. We have one of them coming to Analyst Days who can talk a little bit more about there, some of their experiences so if you can join us for that you can get some firsthand information there.

Unidentified Analyst
Hi. This is Mass Spencer [ph] on for Pat. Thank you for taking my question. If you wouldn't mind, could you just tell me what kind of trends you're seeing with in app support and maybe talk a little bit about the work you're doing with fabric and Zendesk kit? Thank you.
Mikkel Svane
Yes. So like with so many of the things we're doing, mobile is growing rapidly. I think we mentioned at the last earnings call that just the amount of chat traffic we see going from web to mobile over the last, over June 2016 that was quite dramatic a shift and we continue to see that in kind of throughout powering the customer experience that more, more things are happening, not just on mobile web but in apps also. So by supporting the fabric framework, the Google fabric framework, we are really making these things incredibly easy for developers. And like with a few clicks you can get the full kind of support, customer service experience in to your app and really provided as a seamless interaction in our app.
So very excited about working with Google fabric framework, very exciting to work with many, many developments who are building these capabilities into their apps and that's no doubt that it's a different paradigm providing these things on mobile but like we have a big team working on it and I'm really excited about what we're seeing there.

Your next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst
Yeah. Hey, guys. This is Scott on for Alex. Just a couple quick ones for me. You call that kind of 1Q as the volume base quarter, enterprise more since really back half weighted. I'm curious if there are any kind of strategic programs or initiatives that they've launched to help feed those sale cycles to this up sale cycle. We've hear anecdotally you might be testing out then kind of strategy consulting teams in a limited number of geographies, curious if that's true and if we could get any more color on that?
Mikkel Svane
I think what you're referring to is our motions around solutions consulting and success and those kind of activities in professional services. And as we move and evolve up market those kind of activities tend to be more valued. And so that's probably what you're observing is that marketplace is that some of our customers are getting into more complex use cases, they're getting into a broader implementations Zendesk and they look to our teams to help them. That is part of our future strategy is to not only build our own teams to support that but over time to kind of describe to our customers the availability of a broader external set of development systems integrators that can help out. You hear more about that next week at our Investor Day but that is part of our kind of evolving strategy addressing these larger opportunities.
Unidentified Analyst
Got it. Understood. I look forward to hear more about that. And then unrelated we're hearing kind of on again off again plans to pursue federal apps certification, curious that if it's back on and that's true, what you're seeing in the federal vertical right now?
Mikkel Svane
So there are a lot of things happening in Fed ramp and there are some alternatives in the Fed ramp-up process and we're evaluating those alternative avenues for Fed ramp. Fed ramp is endower is somewhat long and cumbersome and so there are other ways that we can do business with the Fed. As you know we're already doing business at the FCC and other places within pockets of those different government entities. But it is an area that we will focus on over time.

History[edit]
Zendesk was founded in 2007 by Mikkel Svane, Morten Primdahl, and Alexander Aghassipour. The company was started in a loft located in Copenhagen, Denmark.[5] The three men were working in customer service solutions and found several problems with customer tracking and incident reporting software. This prompted them to create an alternative that would be simple and intuitive to use.[6] In June 2008, Zendesk received US$ 500,000 in seed funding from angel investor Christoph Janz.[7] In 2009, following a $6 million series B funding from Charles River Ventures and Benchmark Capital,[8] the company moved to San Francisco to establish its headquarters. In April 2014, Zendesk acquired Zopim Technologies Pte Ltd, a Singapore-based provider of live chat software.[9] Zendesk would eventually turn this software into Zopim Premium Live Chat.[10] In May 2014, Zendesk became a publicly-traded company, debuting with an IPO price of $9 per share.[11] On October 13, 2015, Zendesk acquired We Are Cloud SAS for $45.0 million.[12] We Are Cloud is the maker of BIME Analytics software, the technology that Zendesk now uses to power its customer data platform.[13]
Products and technology[edit]
Product families[edit]
Zendesk's family of products[14] represent the shift the company has made from a single customer service product to a unified consortium of products that are all focused on improving customer relationships.[15] The products help organizations better understand their customers, improve communication, and offer support where and when it is most needed.[15] All of the products in the Zendesk family work closely together through a common user interface and are being developed to provide a single login and a shared customer data platform. The family includes: Support, Guide, Connect, Explore, Help Center, Chat, Talk, and Message.[14]
The software is written in Ruby on Rails, and is notable for its ability to integrate with dozens of content management systems, customer relationship management tools, and web apps.[16][17] The platform is available for mobile and tablet.[18] In 2011 the firm founded the Networked Help Desk initiative to create an open standard for sharing information between separate customer support applications.[19] In December 2013, the firm announced integrations with SurveyMonkey and MailChimp to support the launch of surveys and email campaigns from within Zendesk.[20]
Support[edit]
Zendesk Support is a system for tracking, prioritizing, and solving customer support tickets.[21] It puts all customer information in one place so that everything is in a single location.[22] Zendesk Support is designed to be flexible because no two businesses are exactly alike. It configures any workflow, from the simplest to the most complex, while providing clear visibility into customer interactions. This is important because personalized service requires greater context. Using customer analytics and machine learning capabilities, Zendesk customers can better understand and predict customer satisfaction, measure performance, and uncover actionable insights across their data.[23]
Guide[edit]
Zendesk Guide provides machine learning powered, self-service customer support. Through the use of a combination of the Zendesk API, Web Widget, and Mobile SDK as Zendesk Embeddables, Guide allows companies to deliver intelligent, contextual customer service responses on whatever app or website a customer is using. Guide features the Answer Bot (an AI assistant) and the Knowledge Capture App (an agent-focused content creation app).[24]
Connect[edit]
Zendesk Connect is customer intelligence software built for targeted campaigns and proactive engagement.[25] Connect allows businesses to get to know their customers by collecting customer data from across the Zendesk family of products and providing a complete timeline of events and conversations.
By creating segments of customers based on behavior or profile, identifying trends, or triggering targeted campaigns, it works to get the right message to the right customers. As a result, use of the software can build loyalty and trust. A proactive heads up about issues or a well-timed tip for newbies may deliver assistance before customers know they need it. Zendesk CEO Michael Svane stated, "it provides predictors of where a relationship might move."[25]
Explore[edit]
Zendesk Explore, formerly BIME Analytics, provides analytics to measure and understand the entire customer experience.[26] The product works to make teamwork more efficient by measuring team performance and workload capacity. It has the ability to learn how customers use a business' website, products, or support channels. By analyzing data from every step of a customer's journey, Explore helps understand and improve each customer experience.
The easy-to-use interface and interactive drill-ins surface valuable insights that customers ask for most. By enabling them to create custom metrics, reports, and dashboards, and even perform data joins without SQL, data gets turned into meaningful analyses. Zendesk SVP of Product, Adrian McDermott explained it as "everyman business intelligence” –  taking information from Zendesk products and third-party data to get everything in one place.[26]

Chat (Formerly Zopim)[edit]
Zendesk Chat (formerly Zopim) is an online marketing, live chat support and web analytics product that is offered as a SaaS (Software-as-a-service) model. The product enables companies to chat with visitors in real-time on their websites.[27] A website owner must embed the Zendesk Chat widget into their website's HTML code. Then they can chat with their visitors via the dashboard control panel.[28]
Zopim was founded in 2008 by Royston Tay, Wenxiang Wu, Yang Bin Kwok and Lim Qing Ru.[29] The idea for Zopim live chat emerged while the founders were studying together at Stanford on the NUS Overseas College Program in 2008.[30]
In 2010, Zopim incorporated as a private company and launched its freemium pricing model. They also received seed funding and investment from Media Development Authority’s (MDA) i.JAM program, SPRING Singapore and NUS.[29][31] At that time it was listed in Asia’s Top 10 Apps at Accelerate 2010.[32]
In 2014, Zopim was acquired by Zendesk Inc.[33][34][35]
In February 2015, Zopim moved to a new office in Singapore that also functions as Zendesk’s Asia-Pacific Headquarters.[36][37]
In March 2015, Zendesk formed a partnership with Facebook’s new Businesses on Messenger product.[38] Zopim live chat was the technology powering Businesses on Messenger.[39][40]
In April 2015, Zopim introduced a Premium plan which offers support team leaders workforce management tools on top of the regular chat reports and metrics.[41] Later it was named best Live Chat Software in the Cloudswave Awards 2015.[42] Also in October 2015, TalentLMS has released an update to the Learning Management System that allowed for integration between the two. When integrated, Zopim is to be utilized as means of communication between the learners and the instructional designer [43] On October 26, 2016, Zopim was renamed to Zendesk Chat, aligning with the Zendesk family of products.[44]
Talk[edit]
Zendesk Talk is a cloud-based call center software that can immediately get customers in touch with a company representative via any Internet-connected device.[45] Since it is built right into the Zendesk Support ticketing system, Talk gives customer service teams the ability to provide phone support from the same platform they utilize to manage all of their other channels. They have access to customer history, automatic ticket creation, and call recording, which means agents can focus on conversations with the customers instead of navigating workflow.[15][46]
Talk offers flexible IVR, group routing, and real-time queue monitoring to avoid bottlenecks. With analytics that deliver insight into what is happening, support teams can are equipped to provide flexible, powerful support as businesses evolve.[46] Talk allows businesses to create phone numbers and forward calls to customer representatives’ devices, forgoing the need for physical call centers.[47]
Message[edit]
This digital communications channel gives businesses the opportunity to reach and market to a new generation of customers. Zendesk Message is a messaging software that helps companies engage customers on their favorite messaging apps, like Facebook and Twitter. Using Zendesk Message, businesses can blend human agents with bots to increase efficiency.[10]
Inbox[edit]
Inbox allows Zendesk customers to collaborate on a marketing campaign or any other influx of emails, with the ability to add private notes and follow key conversations.[48]
Embeddables[edit]
Embeddables allows companies to build customer support functions into mobile and web applications.[49] This includes a mobile Software Development Kit, which lets companies offer self-service via Help Center. With embeddables users are able to create support tickets or chat real-time with a Help Center representative through their preferred mobile apps or online sites. This eliminates the need to leave the app for a third-party help center.[50] The tech support process is part of the native experience on the site or application.[51]
Relate[edit]
Relate is Zendesk’s online publication, featuring editorial content dedicated to customer service and business relationships. It connects the business side of what Zendesk does –  create software for improving customer interactions –  to the more general human desire for better relationships.[52] Relate has also been adopted as the branding name for Zendesk conferences, which specialize in customer service case studies, brand relationships and engagement, and industry changes.[53][54]

Philanthropy[edit]
Zendesk Neighbor Foundation[edit]
Zendesk’s headquarters is located in the Tenderloin neighborhood of San Francisco and has made several philanthropic initiatives and charitable donations to the area. The Zendesk Neighbor Foundation, a nonprofit organization started by Zendesk, launched $1 million in funding for local charities working on social issues.[62] In 2015, Zendesk Neighbor Foundation donated $100,000 to St. Anthony’s Tenderloin Technology Lab.[63] Since then, the Foundation has also expanded to the communities of Melbourne, Australia;[64] London, England;[65] and Madison, Wisconsin,[66] where the company has made $100,000+ donations per community to Boys and Girls Clubs, public libraries, employment workshops, Autism organizations, and other local non-profits.
Link-SF, Copenhelp and Link-Dane[edit]
Aside from monetary contributions, Zendesk has also used its technology to develop Link-SF. Link-SF is an app that helps homeless people find shelter, food, medical care, technology access, and hygiene services.[67][68][69] Subsequent to Link SF, Zendesk launched two similar apps: Copenhelp (for Copenhagen)[70] and Link-Dane (for Madison, Wisconsin).[71]

Zendesk joined over 100 companies in filing an Amicus Brief opposing Executive Order 13769. [72]

Zendesk Support is a system for tracking, prioritizing, and solving customer support tickets.[21] It puts all customer information in one place so that everything is in a single location.[22] Zendesk Support is designed to be flexible because no two businesses are exactly alike. It configures any workflow, from the simplest to the most complex, while providing clear visibility into customer interactions. This is important because personalized service requires greater context. Using customer analytics and machine learning capabilities, Zendesk customers can better understand and predict customer satisfaction, measure performance, and uncover actionable insights across their data.[23]
Guide[edit]
Zendesk Guide provides machine learning powered, self-service customer support. Through the use of a combination of the Zendesk API, Web Widget, and Mobile SDK as Zendesk Embeddables, Guide allows companies to deliver intelligent, contextual customer service responses on whatever app or website a customer is using. Guide features the Answer Bot (an AI assistant) and the Knowledge Capture App (an agent-focused content creation app).[24]
Connect[edit]
Zendesk Connect is customer intelligence software built for targeted campaigns and proactive engagement.[25] Connect allows businesses to get to know their customers by collecting customer data from across the Zendesk family of products and providing a complete timeline of events and conversations.
By creating segments of customers based on behavior or profile, identifying trends, or triggering targeted campaigns, it works to get the right message to the right customers. As a result, use of the software can build loyalty and trust. A proactive heads up about issues or a well-timed tip for newbies may deliver assistance before customers know they need it. Zendesk CEO Michael Svane stated, "it provides predictors of where a relationship might move."[25]
Explore[edit]
Zendesk Explore, formerly BIME Analytics, provides analytics to measure and understand the entire customer experience.[26] The product works to make teamwork more efficient by measuring team performance and workload capacity. It has the ability to learn how customers use a business' website, products, or support channels. By analyzing data from every step of a customer's journey, Explore helps understand and improve each customer experience.
The easy-to-use interface and interactive drill-ins surface valuable insights that customers ask for most. By enabling them to create custom metrics, reports, and dashboards, and even perform data joins without SQL, data gets turned into meaningful analyses. Zendesk SVP of Product, Adrian McDermott explained it as "everyman business intelligence” –  taking information from Zendesk products and third-party data to get everything in one place.[26]

Chat (Formerly Zopim)[edit]
Zendesk Chat (formerly Zopim) is an online marketing, live chat support and web analytics product that is offered as a SaaS (Software-as-a-service) model. The product enables companies to chat with visitors in real-time on their websites.[27] A website owner must embed the Zendesk Chat widget into their website's HTML code. Then they can chat with their visitors via the dashboard control panel.[28]
Zopim was founded in 2008 by Royston Tay, Wenxiang Wu, Yang Bin Kwok and Lim Qing Ru.[29] The idea for Zopim live chat emerged while the founders were studying together at Stanford on the NUS Overseas College Program in 2008.[30]
In 2010, Zopim incorporated as a private company and launched its freemium pricing model. They also received seed funding and investment from Media Development Authority’s (MDA) i.JAM program, SPRING Singapore and NUS.[29][31] At that time it was listed in Asia’s Top 10 Apps at Accelerate 2010.[32]
In 2014, Zopim was acquired by Zendesk Inc.[33][34][35]
In February 2015, Zopim moved to a new office in Singapore that also functions as Zendesk’s Asia-Pacific Headquarters.[36][37]
In March 2015, Zendesk formed a partnership with Facebook’s new Businesses on Messenger product.[38] Zopim live chat was the technology powering Businesses on Messenger.[39][40]
In April 2015, Zopim introduced a Premium plan which offers support team leaders workforce management tools on top of the regular chat reports and metrics.[41] Later it was named best Live Chat Software in the Cloudswave Awards 2015.[42] Also in October 2015, TalentLMS has released an update to the Learning Management System that allowed for integration between the two. When integrated, Zopim is to be utilized as means of communication between the learners and the instructional designer [43] On October 26, 2016, Zopim was renamed to Zendesk Chat, aligning with the Zendesk family of products.[44]
Talk[edit]
Zendesk Talk is a cloud-based call center software that can immediately get customers in touch with a company representative via any Internet-connected device.[45] Since it is built right into the Zendesk Support ticketing system, Talk gives customer service teams the ability to provide phone support from the same platform they utilize to manage all of their other channels. They have access to customer history, automatic ticket creation, and call recording, which means agents can focus on conversations with the customers instead of navigating workflow.[15][46]
Talk offers flexible IVR, group routing, and real-time queue monitoring to avoid bottlenecks. With analytics that deliver insight into what is happening, support teams can are equipped to provide flexible, powerful support as businesses evolve.[46] Talk allows businesses to create phone numbers and forward calls to customer representatives’ devices, forgoing the need for physical call centers.[47]
Message[edit]
This digital communications channel gives businesses the opportunity to reach and market to a new generation of customers. Zendesk Message is a messaging software that helps companies engage customers on their favorite messaging apps, like Facebook and Twitter. Using Zendesk Message, businesses can blend human agents with bots to increase efficiency.[10]
Inbox[edit]
Inbox allows Zendesk customers to collaborate on a marketing campaign or any other influx of emails, with the ability to add private notes and follow key conversations.[48]
Embeddables[edit]
Embeddables allows companies to build customer support functions into mobile and web applications.[49] This includes a mobile Software Development Kit, which lets companies offer self-service via Help Center. With embeddables users are able to create support tickets or chat real-time with a Help Center representative through their preferred mobile apps or online sites. This eliminates the need to leave the app for a third-party help center.[50] The tech support process is part of the native experience on the site or application.[51]
Relate[edit]
Relate is Zendesk’s online publication, featuring editorial content dedicated to customer service and business relationships. It connects the business side of what Zendesk does –  create software for improving customer interactions –  to the more general human desire for better relationships.[52] Relate has also been adopted as the branding name for Zendesk conferences, which specialize in customer service case studies, brand relationships and engagement, and industry changes.[53][54]

History[edit]
Zendesk was founded in 2007 by Mikkel Svane, Morten Primdahl, and Alexander Aghassipour. The company was started in a loft located in Copenhagen, Denmark.[5] The three men were working in customer service solutions and found several problems with customer tracking and incident reporting software. This prompted them to create an alternative that would be simple and intuitive to use.[6] In June 2008, Zendesk received US$ 500,000 in seed funding from angel investor Christoph Janz.[7] In 2009, following a $6 million series B funding from Charles River Ventures and Benchmark Capital,[8] the company moved to San Francisco to establish its headquarters. In April 2014, Zendesk acquired Zopim Technologies Pte Ltd, a Singapore-based provider of live chat software.[9] Zendesk would eventually turn this software into Zopim Premium Live Chat.[10] In May 2014, Zendesk became a publicly-traded company, debuting with an IPO price of $9 per share.[11] On October 13, 2015, Zendesk acquired We Are Cloud SAS for $45.0 million.[12] We Are Cloud is the maker of BIME Analytics software, the technology that Zendesk now uses to power its customer data platform.[13]
Products and technology[edit]
Product families[edit]
Zendesk's family of products[14] represent the shift the company has made from a single customer service product to a unified consortium of products that are all focused on improving customer relationships.[15] The products help organizations better understand their customers, improve communication, and offer support where and when it is most needed.[15] All of the products in the Zendesk family work closely together through a common user interface and are being developed to provide a single login and a shared customer data platform. The family includes: Support, Guide, Connect, Explore, Help Center, Chat, Talk, and Message.[14]
The software is written in Ruby on Rails, and is notable for its ability to integrate with dozens of content management systems, customer relationship management tools, and web apps.[16][17] The platform is available for mobile and tablet.[18] In 2011 the firm founded the Networked Help Desk initiative to create an open standard for sharing information between separate customer support applications.[19] In December 2013, the firm announced integrations with SurveyMonkey and MailChimp to support the launch of surveys and email campaigns from within Zendesk.[20]
Support[edit]
Zendesk Support is a system for tracking, prioritizing, and solving customer support tickets.[21] It puts all customer information in one place so that everything is in a single location.[22] Zendesk Support is designed to be flexible because no two businesses are exactly alike. It configures any workflow, from the simplest to the most complex, while providing clear visibility into customer interactions. This is important because personalized service requires greater context. Using customer analytics and machine learning capabilities, Zendesk customers can better understand and predict customer satisfaction, measure performance, and uncover actionable insights across their data.[23]
Guide[edit]
Zendesk Guide provides machine learning powered, self-service customer support. Through the use of a combination of the Zendesk API, Web Widget, and Mobile SDK as Zendesk Embeddables, Guide allows companies to deliver intelligent, contextual customer service responses on whatever app or website a customer is using. Guide features the Answer Bot (an AI assistant) and the Knowledge Capture App (an agent-focused content creation app).[24]
Connect[edit]
Zendesk Connect is customer intelligence software built for targeted campaigns and proactive engagement.[25] Connect allows businesses to get to know their customers by collecting customer data from across the Zendesk family of products and providing a complete timeline of events and conversations.

As a result, use of the software can build loyalty and trust. A proactive heads up about issues or a well-timed tip for newbies may deliver assistance before customers know they need it. Zendesk CEO Michael Svane stated, "it provides predictors of where a relationship might move."[25]

Zendesk Explore, formerly BIME Analytics, provides analytics to measure and understand the entire customer experience.[26] The product works to make teamwork more efficient by measuring team performance and workload capacity. It has the ability to learn how customers use a business' website, products, or support channels. By analyzing data from every step of a customer's journey, Explore helps understand and improve each customer experience.

By enabling them to create custom metrics, reports, and dashboards, and even perform data joins without SQL, data gets turned into meaningful analyses. Zendesk SVP of Product, Adrian McDermott explained it as "everyman business intelligence” –  taking information from Zendesk products and third-party data to get everything in one place.[26]

Talk[edit]
Zendesk Talk is a cloud-based call center software that can immediately get customers in touch with a company representative via any Internet-connected device.[45] Since it is built right into the Zendesk Support ticketing system, Talk gives customer service teams the ability to provide phone support from the same platform they utilize to manage all of their other channels. They have access to customer history, automatic ticket creation, and call recording, which means agents can focus on conversations with the customers instead of navigating workflow.[15][46]
Talk offers flexible IVR, group routing, and real-time queue monitoring to avoid bottlenecks. With analytics that deliver insight into what is happening, support teams can are equipped to provide flexible, powerful support as businesses evolve.[46] Talk allows businesses to create phone numbers and forward calls to customer representatives’ devices, forgoing the need for physical call centers.[47]

Using Zendesk Message, businesses can blend human agents with bots to increase efficiency.[10]
Inbox[edit]
Inbox allows Zendesk customers to collaborate on a marketing campaign or any other influx of emails, with the ability to add private notes and follow key conversations.[48]
Embeddables[edit]
Embeddables allows companies to build customer support functions into mobile and web applications.[49] This includes a mobile Software Development Kit, which lets companies offer self-service via Help Center. With embeddables users are able to create support tickets or chat real-time with a Help Center representative through their preferred mobile apps or online sites. This eliminates the need to leave the app for a third-party help center.[50] The tech support process is part of the native experience on the site or application.[51]
Relate[edit]
Relate is Zendesk’s online publication, featuring editorial content dedicated to customer service and business relationships. It connects the business side of what Zendesk does –  create software for improving customer interactions –  to the more general human desire for better relationships.[52] Relate has also been adopted as the branding name for Zendesk conferences, which specialize in customer service case studies, brand relationships and engagement, and industry changes.[53][54]
Accolades[edit]

2017- Zendesk was recognized by DestinationCRM as a 2017 CRM Service Leader
2016 – FastCompany ranked Zendesk 5th on its list of Most Innovative Companies in Enterprise Software[55]
2016 – Svane included in the Inc. Founders 40 list[56]

Philanthropy[edit]
Zendesk Neighbor Foundation[edit]
Zendesk’s headquarters is located in the Tenderloin neighborhood of San Francisco and has made several philanthropic initiatives and charitable donations to the area. The Zendesk Neighbor Foundation, a nonprofit organization started by Zendesk, launched $1 million in funding for local charities working on social issues.[62] In 2015, Zendesk Neighbor Foundation donated $100,000 to St. Anthony’s Tenderloin Technology Lab.[63] Since then, the Foundation has also expanded to the communities of Melbourne, Australia;[64] London, England;[65] and Madison, Wisconsin,[66] where the company has made $100,000+ donations per community to Boys and Girls Clubs, public libraries, employment workshops, Autism organizations, and other local non-profits.
Link-SF, Copenhelp and Link-Dane[edit]
Aside from monetary contributions, Zendesk has also used its technology to develop Link-SF. Link-SF is an app that helps homeless people find shelter, food, medical care, technology access, and hygiene services.[67][68][69] Subsequent to Link SF, Zendesk launched two similar apps: Copenhelp (for Copenhagen)[70] and Link-Dane (for Madison, Wisconsin).[71]
Other Initiatives[edit]
Zendesk joined over 100 companies in filing an Amicus Brief opposing Executive Order 13769. [72]

The Man Who Turned A 'Boring' Idea Into A $1.7 Billion Company Explains The Secret To Success

When Zendesk CEO Mikkel Svane first came up with the idea of Zendesk, a customer service software that’s now worth $1.7 billion, everyone thought it was boring. 
But when he shared the vision for his product — a web-based, on-demand platform where companies can build relationships with customers — his boring idea suddenly became sexy. 
He shares his thinking behind his idea in his recent book, “Startupland.” He writes, “Sexy stuff sometimes happens when you make mundane things easy and accessible. Any aspect of democratization is a good thing.”
For example, he says the old FTP file sharing platform doesn’t sound all that fun, but Dropbox and Box made file-sharing sexy with better features and design. Retail credit card payment isn’t all that exciting, but Square made it cool, too. Because of Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, the boring idea of taking bookstores online turned into a massive overhaul of the world of commerce, he says.
Svane also shares some of his trade secrets from working in the customer support field. Here are three of the “most unlikely tricks” he learned:


Make it personal, and mistakes are OK: Emails that were perfectly crafted didn’t generate much response, he says. Instead, when spelling errors or simple sentences were used, people would respond more often. “People realized it wasn’t an automated email but a message from a real person — and they responded to that.”

Women get more responses: When early employee Michael Hansen used his male name, he didn’t get a lot of responses. But once he changed his name to Josephine, the response rate shot up. It might be because most IT people are male, but for some reason, female names work better.

It’s all about the conversation: It doesn’t really matter what you talk about, but just having a real conversation helps in terms of response rates. “We could quickly see a direct correlation between response rates to our emails and conversions to customers,” he writes.

Mikkel Svane – ZenDesk 1 of 2
Posted by tony on  February 15, 2012 10:28 am



 

              "One of the most gratifying rewards is to see our customers grow." Zendesk's customer support platform enables companies to deliver great customer experiences.

 Blog:  www.zendesk.com/blog  
 Twitter: @Zendesk, @mikkelsvane 


  Watch:  Part 1,  Part 2 









Matthew: Hi. This is Matthew Wise with FounderLY. We empower entrepreneurs to have a voice and share their story with the world, enabling others to learn about building products and starting companies.
So, it’s with great pleasure that I am here today with Mikkel Svane, who is the founder of Zendesk. Zendesk is a Cloud based customer service platform.
Mikkel, we’d love for you to give our audience a brief bio.
Mikkel:  Yes. First of all, I’m Danish, thus the broken English here. I moved to California with my family two years ago. Basically, I moved my company over here and then my family moved along.
Zendesk is my first startup at this stage, but I’ve always been working with my own companies, I’ve always been working with technology. Always been working with Internet technologies, basically since my first visit to San Francisco, which was back in ’95. Thus ’95 was the year when we started to have dial-up connections and so on in Europe and I flew into San Francisco. Drove up to San Francisco through the 101, and there’s all these billboards and they all have web addresses on them and I was like, “What the hell is going on here?.” It was super-interesting, something that defined a lot of my career path. But I’m Danish, I have a couple of kids, live on out in Bernal Heights, grew up in Copenhagen.
Matthew: Can you tell us what makes Zendesk unique? Who is it for and why are you so passionate about it?
Mikkel:  Yes. We built Zendesk. I have two co-founders for my company, and we built Zendesk because we had experience from working with these kind of systems. We implemented these kind of systems for companies and enterprises of all sizes and both from the business side and from the technology side, and these systems were just painful to work with.
It felt like it was a space that, it was an industry that flew under the radar. There was a bunch of startups working with social this and mobile this and productivity and how to work smarter and better and all kinds of stuff. But nobody really wanted to deal with the customer support Help Desk space. I think a lot of it had to do with the fact that, back then, all traditional customer support Help Desk was very much for the bottom feeders. If you couldn’t figure out how to be an Engineer, you ended up in the Help Desk. If you couldn’t figure out being a Sales Person, you ended up in the Customer Service Department.
It wasn’t a very sexy industry, you didn’t pick up a lot of girls saying you work with Help Desks, so it seemed like nobody really tried to reach or take that industry up-to-date. So, we thought it was painful products to work with back then and we got together and said, “We can do this product. Let’s figure out building a product that is both beautiful, simple, intuitive and all of that stuff and make it up-to-date so that it works with Internet technologies and you can subscribe to it as a service and so on.” As with start-ups, there’s many ways to tell the founding story but this is one of them, at least.
Matthew: What are some of the technology and market trends that currently exist, and where do you see things developing in the future for your space?
Mikkel:  We were, in many ways, a first mover in kind of rethinking the customer service space, the customer service platforms out there. And I think we’ve been blessed and we’ve been very, very lucky that since we launched our product, it has become very, very obvious for companies that they need to take the customer service much more seriously. It’s very hard today, because of the Internet, because of social media and all that stuff, it’s very hard today to conceal or to hide a bad customer service experience. If somebody has a bad experience with something, it’s out there. 
So you not only, for some companies they say, “Well, we can’t satisfy everybody. So, there are some of our customers, they get a bad customer service experience and that’s too bad, we’ll lose them.” But nobody can really say that anymore because if somebody gets a bad customer service experience, they’ll tell everybody about it and it will be super public. It will be out there, and their friends will know about it and they will inspire others to look for other products, too.
Since we launched our product, a lot of companies have realized they need to take their customer service and their technical support much more seriously. Basically, they have to address some of the very basic contract items in dealing with your customers or dealing with people in your own life. They need to be responsive, they need to be open and transparent about what’s going on and they need to be authentic. You can’t just lie yourself out of stuff. You have to address things with a real tone. That is basically what we at help companies are doing and to what extent it has really helped and transformed our business.
Matthew: What inspired you to start Zendesk? How did you come across an idea and discover the opportunity?
Mikkel:  As I said before, we worked with these kind of systems. We found that it was painful to work with them. The implementation processes were typically year long. It became very complicated systems that were very complicated for the actual users, the customer support people that supported this use. I think most importantly all these systems were so complicated, so filled with metrics and management and administration that nobody really had the ability to focus on the customer service experience.
It was kind of like the customer got buried in all these big, complicated systems so, we basically said, “Let’s turn this upside down. Build a system that is beautifully simple to use, that you can hit the ground running with the system. You don’t have to think about training, administration, or anything like that. It’s not something that you have to install on your own server. You don’t need to think about how does this integrate with my email server, or how does it integrate with my website and take care of all of that stuff. And just allows you to not focus on the clutter and focus on your customers.” In many ways, that was what, at least, one of the stories that defines the startup of our company.
Matthew: Who are your co-founders? How did you meet? What qualities were you looking for, and how did you know that they would be a good fit?
Mikkel:  First of all, they are really good friends. I think that everybody knows that the first period of a startup, pre-funding and all that stuff is a bitch. There are so many things that can go wrong. So, you need to have a good contract, a good relationship with the people that surround you.
One of the dilemmas with building a startup, pre-funding is you have to go through a phase of bootstrapping, there’s no money in it, it’s a little hard for everybody. And if you are out together with really good people, they all get all these offers for, “Why don’t you get a job here? or Why don’t  you participate in [inaudible 08:05]. We are funded. It’s a completely different game,” and you have to manage yourself and your co-founders through that process and that’s just painful.
I’ve known both my two co-founders for many years. I’ve been working with them in different companies, and we were all working as consultants, back then. And we all agreed that, if we wanted to get back to what we were really passionate about and that was building products, building great products, this was our last chance. If we didn’t do it now, we would never get to do it.
I have two co-founders. We are three co-founders in total. Morten, we’re all Danish, Morten and Alexander, Morten Primdahl and Alexander Aghassipour. You have to spell that. We are all three with the company still, and Alex is our Product Mother and Morten is our Chief I-Tech and still responsible for most of the infrastructure.
Matthew: From idea to product launch, how long did it take, and when did you actually launch Zendesk?
Mikkel:  I think we worked with the idea for quite a while and I think we spent almost a year trying to build the product, getting ideas about what was the optimal work flow, what were the best practices that we try to built big into the product without making them stand in your face. So, I think that took a year building a working version of the product and being able to launch that. That was one of the things we really wanted to do. We wanted to go out and have a fully functional product that you could start with on day one.
That was a little bit over 4 years ago. That was October 1st, 2007 that we launched the product into the wild, and it was a fully functional product and we started having customers already the first month.
Matthew: Are there any unique metrics or social proof about Zendesk that you’d like to share with our audience?
Mikkel:  Sure. Yes, I will. We came to San Francisco two years ago. It was a very bootstrap operation until then. It was basically the three founders, and then we had a couple of people around the world helping us. Today, I think we’re like 130 people in total, 100 of those people here in San Francisco in our new offices in the new Mid-Market District up in 6th and Market. We announced earlier this year that we now have more than 10,000 customers. That is 10,000 businesses around the world using our product for serving their employee’s partners or, of course, customers.
We have customers enrolled in 100 countries today. We have a European Headquarters in London. We have an APac Headquarters in Melbourne. We have an Engineering Division that we just set up in my home city of Copenhagen where we have, I think, ten employees right now. We’re a cost free raised round over here, so we have through our series A, B and C raised a little over $26 million. And we are doing really, really well.
I remember one of the first times we got to San Francisco, I visited Twitter and these guys, there were like 20 people and all over the place and it was the greatest people to deal with, ever. And they wanted to use Zendesk. I remember they were like, “Yeah, we probably have like a couple of hundred requests a day.” Yeah, no problem. Easy Peasy.
And we helped them, and soon after that, they got on “Oprah” and Obama, and I don’t know what. Their popularity just exploded. And we got through that transition with them. It’s one of these stories where we are a little tiny bit of the Twitter story and that’s just superinteresting.
I also remember the first time the Groupon people approached us. Tiny little company up in Chicago. We didn’t really knew who they were. There was some weird conversation going on. We were literally uncertain about it. “What are these guys?” But we said, “Yeah, let’s make our way to helping them and get them started with some good customer service and so on.” Right now, today they got 3,000 agents on Zendesk. It’s completely crazy and we’ve been with them through this crazy growth they’ve been on. It’s really interesting to see these operations from the inside. And I can tell the same story of FD&B or Dropbox or a lot of these other companies that are using Zendesk today. That’s an amazing part of our story. 
But, coming back to what it is that we really want to do here, building a beautiful, simple product, is also that we wanted to marketize this space. We want to make everybody capable of providing great customer service. So, some of the stories that are most kind of fascinating for me is how these little maintenance management company in Missouri that needed to bid on a tender and needed to provide a sales service solution for this tender. So, they set up a Zendesk over the weekend, made it look crazy good, submitted it and won that tender and they’ve been winning every tender since then just because they have a professional grade, sweet looking sales service part.
So these are some of the stories that are great to share.

I think Jake was just trying to suggest a workaround. But I agree there's a usability issue.
