Turgay Ciner: Electric production with coal must be supported




17.06.2014



Turgay Ciner, the Chairman of Ciner Holding, who said that electric production from coal is not supported in Turkey, asked “There is 8-billion coal only in Elbistan basin. Why do these fields not put to good use, what is the reason behind the challenges in front of their use?”
Pointing to the importance of support for Coal-fired electricity generation, Ciner also asked for the removal of the state domination over the mines. He said, "Of course, EPDK is the last in this process. Before coming to EPDK, it is necessary to remove the state domination over these areas. Today, 90 percent of mining licenses in Turkey belong to the state. Which mine we have, which one we do not is a mystery. Whether there is coal or not is unknown. So they remain idle ."
Ciner, the Chairman of Ciner Holding, participated in the program 'Strategic Initiatives and New Regulatory Perspectives Towards Turkey Energy Market'as part of 12th anniversary events of  Energy Market Regulatory Authority in Ankara (EPDK). Ciner said that he had been conducting studies in electricity production from coal, the 'black side’of coal-fired electricity generation,and thatthe coal-fired electricitygeneration was not well liked in Turkey.
‘THERE ARE 8 BİLLION TONS OFRESERVE IN ELBISTAN’
Stating that there is 8 billion tons of coal only in Elbistan basin, Ciner said that the present value of this corresponded to $ 250 billion of natural gas. Cinerwent on to say: "Why do the use of thse fields be prevented, what are the reasons behind the difficulties raised?Both the government, the private sector, and EPDK should give encouragement and support in order to eliminate these difficulties. "
Ciner, pointing to the regulations issued related to the mining sector, "We are applying for drilling in the coal mine, to the Prime Minister. We faced some funny situations. They must be eliminated immediately. We are not currently able to drill. If you say 'I will make power plants from imported coal-fired' nobody asks about ‘your source, about drilling"he said.
‘THERE IS A DISTORTED SITUATION HERE’
Pointing to that EPDK has given license to more than 100 thousand megawatts of electricity in the last 10 years, Ciner said, "Domestic coal-fired electricity generation license is probably around 2 thousand megawatts. As far as I know part of it that enters the processing is done by 3-4 investors. We are also one of the smallest ones. This too seems to be an unpleasant situation, which is why we're having some difficulties in the economy. "
‘STATE DOMINANCE OVER MINING SHOULD BE CALLED OFF’
Ciner said that the coal capacity in Turkey was in an amount to provide sufficient resources to current needs. Ciner, who wants that the difficulties in the sector should be eliminated said: "This sector should be cleaned off difficulties. Of course, EPDK is the last in this process. Before coming to EPDK, it is necessary to remove the state domination over these areas. Today, 90 percent of mining licenses in Turkey belong to the state. Which mine we have, which one we do not is a mystery. Whether there is coal or not is unknown. They remain idle. If this situation is corrected, our current account deficit of 60-100 billion will be removed. "
