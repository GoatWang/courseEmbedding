“With an emphasis on thoughtful portfolio construction, the fund is designed to provide investors with an opportunity for both short and long-term performance through a strategic blend of exposure across strategies, vintage years and geographies,” said Jackie Rantanen, Principal in the Product Management Group at Hamilton Lane.
Hamilton Lane has been managing funds-of-funds strategies since 1998 and seeks to provide access to the top echelon of funds worldwide through its robust platform. Leveraging the firm’s global presence and rigorous due diligence process, the Fund represents a continuation of Hamilton Lane’s tailored funds-of-funds approach to provide investors with a balanced portfolio of private market investments.

Hamilton Lane closes latest fund above target at $435m

Antonia Timmerman 




                    June 15, 2017                

Alternative investment firm Hamilton Lane has closed its Strategic Opportunities Fund 2017 at $435 million, exceeding its initial target of $250 million. The announcement came just a week after it reported the closing of its $1.9 billion Secondary Fund IV LP.
The Strategic Opportunities Fund comprises a diverse set of institutions, including Taft-Hartley pension funds, insurance companies, foundations, and high-net-worth individuals. It also includes a number of existing and new investors from Asia, the Middle East, Europe, North and South America.
Structured as an annual series with a single-year investment period, the fund is designed to target private credit investments around the globe.
“The opportunity in the private credit market is meaningful and we expect it to continue to evolve and grow,” Drew Schardt, managing director and global head of the private credit team at Hamilton Lane, said in a statement.
“We believe the Strategic Opportunities series provides our clients with a flexible credit solution and unique access to these high-quality private market transactions,” he added.
A recent survey conducted by Hamilton Lane revealed that nearly two-thirds of LPs planned to increase allocations to private credit. This appetite, it said, was reflected in the strong demand for its 2017 fund.
“LPs are being thoughtful in their approach to credit, and the structure of this fund aims to deliver a high level of flexibility and optionality, while still enabling them to leverage the Hamilton Lane platform,” Emily Nomeir, principal and co-head of the product management group, explained.
Hamilton Lane has long been an active investor in targeted strategies, including credit-oriented direct investments and co-investments. While the fund represents the third dedicated vehicle of its kind, it is an extension of the company’s broader credit platform. In total, Hamilton Lane has about $20 billion in credit assets under management.
Its Secondary Fund IV LP – closed at $1.9 billion last week – is its biggest secondary fund to date. It was launched in 2016 with an initial fundraising target of $1.25 billion. The size of the secondary fund more than doubles the corpus of the preceding vehicle, Hamilton Lane Secondary Fund III, which closed at $900 million in 2013.

Hamilton Lane Secondary Fund IV Closes Above Target

BALA CYNWYD, Pa.
, June 7, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Hamilton Lane (NASDAQ:  HLNE) today announced the final closing of Hamilton Lane Secondary Fund IV, L.P. (the "Fund" or "Fund IV"), a global and diversified private equity secondary fund. 
Originally targeting $1.25 billion, the Fund received strong demand from the institutional investor community and exceeded its target to close on $1.9 billion, the firm's largest secondary fund to-date. The Fund consists of a diverse base of more than 110 investors from around the globe, including Taft-Hartley pension plans, corporate and public pensions, sovereign wealth funds, family offices, endowments, foundations and other financial institutions.








"As the secondary market evolves, LPs are increasingly looking for differentiation among secondary firms. The Hamilton Lane approach continues to stand out, validated by our successful fundraise," said Tom Kerr, Managing Director and Global Head of Secondaries. "We believe our platform offers distinct competitive advantages in the secondary market, providing access to relationships, information and differentiated deal flow -- all of which allows us to invest selectively as an informed buyer."  
Hamilton Lane has been investing in the secondary market for more than 15 years, and Fund IV represents the successful expansion of the firm's secondary program and strong global investment team. Fund IV aims to provide investors with a balanced portfolio by diversifying across proprietarily-sourced single funds, subset portfolios and complex structured/direct investments. 
"We are grateful for the strong interest and support from a diverse group of sophisticated global limited partners – both new and existing investors – that led to Fund IV closing oversubscribed and above target," said Ryan Cooney, Product Manager of Hamilton Lane's secondary platform. "What resonated with our investor base and led to the strong interest in our largest-ever fundraise was our ability to find interesting opportunities with quality GPs and assets, and in turn to deploy that capital, reinvest back into our team and platform and strengthen our position in the market."
About Hamilton Lane
Hamilton Lane (NASDAQ:  HLNE) is a leading alternative investment management firm providing innovative private markets solutions to sophisticated investors around the world.
