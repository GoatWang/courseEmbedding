Have you been eager to see how Santander Consumer USA Holdings Inc.SC performed in Q2 in comparison with the market expectations? Let's quickly scan through the key facts from this Texas-based technology-driven consumer finance company's earnings release this morning:An Earnings Beat
 Santander Consumer came out with earnings per share of 70 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 62 cents. Results exclude impact of decreased tax rate in the quarter. Elevated total finance and other interest income were recorded.How Was the Estimate Revision Trend?
 You should note that the earnings estimate revisions for Santander Consumer remained stable prior to the earnings release. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has remained unchanged over the last 7 days.    
 Also, Santander Consumer has a mixed record of earnings surprise history. The company had an average negative beat of 10.54% in the trailing four quarters.Santander Consumer USA Holdings Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseSantander Consumer USA Holdings Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Santander Consumer USA Holdings Inc. QuoteRevenue Came In Higher Than Expected   
 Santander Consumer posted revenues of $1.69 billion, which was above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.55 billion. Further, it compared favorably with the year-ago number of $1.68 billion.Key Stats to Note:Total auto originations: $5.5 billionNet interest margin: 11.3%Net charge-off ratio: 7.5%Return on average equity: 19.1%Return on average assets: 2.7%What Zacks Rank Says
 The estimate revisions that we discussed earlier have driven a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Santander Consumer. However, since the latest earnings performance is yet to be reflected in the estimate revisions, the rank is subject to change. While things apparently look favorable, it all depends on what sense the just-released report makes to the analysts.
 (You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. )How the Market Reacted So Far
 Following the earnings release, Santander Consumer shares were up more than 2% in the pre-trading session. This is in line to what the stock witnessed in the prior-day's session. Clearly, the initial reaction shows that the investors have considered the results in their favor. However, the full-session's price movement may indicate a different picture.
 Check back later for our full write up on this Santander Consumer earnings report!The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce "the world's first trillionaries," but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

DALLAS, July 28, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Santander Consumer USA Holdings Inc. (NYSE:    SC) ("SC") today announced net income for the second quarter ended June 30, 2017 ("Q2 2017") of $265 million, or $0.74 per diluted common share. During Q2 2017, SC's effective tax rate was 24.0 percent, down from 35.2 percent in the second quarter ended June 30, 2016 ("Q2 2016"). The decreased tax rate for Q2 2017 is associated with Santander Consumer International Puerto Rico, LLC results, leading to a $41 million impact, or $0.11 per diluted common share, of which $14 million, or $0.04 per diluted common share is attributable to Q2 2017.








Q2 2017 Highlights (variances compared to Q2 2016):

Announced proposed dividends of $0.03 per share in Q4 2017 and $0.05 per share in Q1 and Q2 of 2018, following the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review ("CCAR") results of Santander Holdings USA, Inc. ("SHUSA") 
Total auto originations of $5.5 billion, up 1% 

Core retail auto loan originations of $2.3 billion, up 36% 
Chrysler Capital nonprime loan originations of $948 million, up 11% 
Chrysler Capital prime loan originations of $854 million, down 30% 

Net finance and other interest income of $1.1 billion, down 6% 
Net leased vehicle income of $131 million, up 5%     
Return on average assets of 2.7%, down from 3.0% 
Common equity tier 1 ("CET1") ratio of 14.3%, up 170 bps 
Executed asset sales of $536 million through Banco Santander flow agreement 
Completed national roll out of Chrysler Capital VIP program with more than 2,500 dealers enrolled 
Chrysler penetration rate of 20%, up from 19% at the end of the first quarter of 2017 
Issued $2.3 billion in securitizations, including the first public DRIVE securitization 

"We are pleased that following SHUSA's 2017 CCAR results, SC announced proposed dividends to our shareholders of $0.03 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $0.05 per share in the first and second quarters of 2018, as SC and SHUSA continue to make significant improvements to the organization's capital planning processes. While there is still work to be done, I am proud of our diligent and hard work over the last several years as we endeavor to maintain the highest standards of governance, compliance and risk management," said Jason Kulas, President and Chief Executive Officer.
Mr. Kulas continued, "We are also pleased with the progress we have made to further strengthen our relationship with Chrysler. During the quarter, we completed the national roll out of our VIP program with more than 2,500 Chrysler dealers enrolled, executed a second asset sale through the Banco Santander flow agreement, and remain committed to growing our dealer floorplan strategy with Santander Bank NA, all of which support improved penetration rates with Chrysler."
Izzy Dawood, Chief Financial Officer, added, "During the quarter, we continued to demonstrate robust access to the capital markets by executing two securitizations totaling $2.3 billion from our SDART and DRIVE platforms, including our inaugural public DRIVE securitization."
Finance receivables, loans and leases, net1 of $35 billion as of Q2 2017 increased 3 percent versus December 31, 2016. Net finance and other interest income decreased 6 percent to $1.1 billion in Q2 2017 from $1.2 billion in Q2 2016, driven by a combination of lower retail installment contract ("RIC") balances and higher cost of funds, which was driven primarily by an increase in benchmark rates.
SC's average annual percentage rate ("APR") at the end of Q2 2017 for RICs held for investment was 16.6 percent, down from 16.7 percent at the end of Q2 2016. These APRs are consistent with credit trends in our held for investment portfolio. As of the end of Q2 2017, RICs with FICO® scores at origination of less than 540 decreased to 22.4 percent, from 22.9 percent as of the end of Q2 2016, and RICs with FICO® scores at origination greater than 640 increased to 14 percent, from 13.3 as of the end of Q2 2016.
Net leased vehicle income increased 5 percent to $131 million in Q2 2017, from $125 million in Q2 2016, as a result of the continued growth of our leasing portfolio.
SC's allowance ratio2 decreased 10 basis points, to 12.6 percent at the end of Q2 2017, from 12.7 percent at the end of Q1 2017.
SC's RIC net charge-off ratio3 and delinquency ratio4 increased to 7.5 percent and 4.7 percent, respectively, in Q2 2017, from 6.0 percent and 4.2 percent, respectively, in Q2 2016. The increase in SC's net charge-off ratio is attributable to a combination of a lower recovery rate, slower portfolio growth since Q2 2016 and the acceleration of bankruptcy related charge-offs. These bankruptcy related charge-offs are primarily timing related and would have likely otherwise occurred in future quarters, as such not changing SC's overall view of vintage losses. The increase in delinquency ratio in Q2 2017 was also impacted by the slower portfolio growth since Q2 2016.
Provision for credit losses increased to $521 million in Q2 2017, from $512 million in Q2 2016. 
SC recorded net investment losses of $100 million in Q2 2017, compared to net investment losses of $101 million in Q2 2016. The current period losses were primarily driven by $90 million of lower of cost or market adjustments related to the held for sale personal lending portfolio, comprised of $104 million in customer default activity and a $14 million decrease in market discount, consistent with typical seasonal patterns. Excluding the impact of personal lending, net investment losses totaled $2 million.
During Q2 2017 SC incurred $282 million of operating expenses, up 4 percent from $272 million in Q2 2016, primarily driven by continued investment in compliance and control functions. SC's expense ratio for the quarter increased to 2.2 percent, up from 2.0 percent during the same period last year. 
SC executed asset sales of $566 million during Q2 2017, with $536 million in sales generated through the flow agreement with Banco Santander, under which it retains servicing. The serviced for others portfolio of $9.9 billion as of Q2 2017, is down 24 percent from $13 billion in Q2 2016. Servicing fee income decreased 26 percent to $32 million in Q2 2017, from $43 million in Q2 2016. The decline in SC's serviced for others portfolio and servicing fee income are a result of lower prime originations and lower prime asset sales in Q2 2017, compared to the same quarter the prior year, as the prime environment remains highly competitive.
1 Includes Finance receivables held for investment, Finance receivables held for sale and Leased vehicles.
2 Ratio for allowance for credit losses excludes end of period balances on purchased receivables portfolio of $194 million and finance receivables held for sale of $2.1 billion. 
3 Net charge-off ratio stated on a recorded investment basis, which is unpaid principal balance adjusted for unaccreted net discounts, subvention and origination costs.
4 Delinquency ratio is defined as the ratio of end of period delinquent principal over 60 days to end of period gross balance of the respective portfolio, excludes capital leases.

Any statements about our expectations, beliefs, plans, predictions, forecasts, objectives, assumptions, or future events or performance are not historical facts and may be forward-looking. These statements are often, but not always, made through the use of words or phrases such as anticipates, believes, can, could, may, predicts, potential, should, will, estimates, plans, projects, continuing, ongoing, expects, intends, and similar words or phrases. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable, these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties that are subject to change based on various important factors, some of which are beyond our control. For additional discussion of these risks, refer to the section entitled Risk Factors and elsewhere in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q filed by us with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Among the factors that could cause the forward-looking statements in this press release and/or our financial performance to differ materially from that suggested by the forward-looking statements are (a) the inherent limitations in internal controls over financial reporting; (b) our ability to remediate any material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting completely and in a timely manner; (c) continually changing federal, state, and local laws and regulations could materially adversely affect our business; (d) adverse economic conditions in the United States and worldwide may negatively impact our results; (e) our business could suffer if our access to funding is reduced; (f) significant risks we face implementing our growth strategy, some of which are outside our control; (g) unexpected costs and delays in connection with exiting our personal lending business; (h) our agreement with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles US LLC may not result in currently anticipated levels of growth and is subject to certain performance conditions that could result in termination of the agreement; (i) our business could suffer if we are unsuccessful in developing and maintaining relationships with automobile dealerships; (j) our financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations depend on the credit performance of our loans; (k) loss of our key management or other personnel, or an inability to attract such management and personnel; (l) certain regulations, including but not limited to oversight by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the European Central Bank, and the Federal Reserve, whose oversight and regulation may limit certain of our activities, including the timing and amount of dividends and other limitations on our business; and (m) future changes in our relationship with Banco Santander that could adversely affect our operations.

Therefore, we caution the reader not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking information or statements. The effect of these factors is difficult to predict. Factors other than these also could adversely affect our results, and the reader should not consider these factors to be a complete set of all potential risks or uncertainties as new factors emerge from time to time. Any forward-looking statements only speak as of the date of this document, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking information or statements, whether written or oral, to reflect any change, except as required by law.

DALLAS, July 28, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Santander Consumer USA Holdings Inc. (NYSE:    SC) ("SC") today announced net income for the second quarter ended June 30, 2017 ("Q2 2017") of $265 million, or $0.74 per diluted common share. During Q2 2017, SC's effective tax rate was 24.0 percent, down from 35.2 percent in the second quarter ended June 30, 2016 ("Q2 2016"). The decreased tax rate for Q2 2017 is associated with Santander Consumer International Puerto Rico, LLC results, leading to a $41 million impact, or $0.11 per diluted common share, of which $14 million, or $0.04 per diluted common share is attributable to Q2 2017.








Q2 2017 Highlights (variances compared to Q2 2016):

Announced proposed dividends of $0.03 per share in Q4 2017 and $0.05 per share in Q1 and Q2 of 2018, following the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review ("CCAR") results of Santander Holdings USA, Inc. ("SHUSA") 
Total auto originations of $5.5 billion, up 1% 

Core retail auto loan originations of $2.3 billion, up 36% 
Chrysler Capital nonprime loan originations of $948 million, up 11% 
Chrysler Capital prime loan originations of $854 million, down 30% 

Net finance and other interest income of $1.1 billion, down 6% 
Net leased vehicle income of $131 million, up 5%     
Return on average assets of 2.7%, down from 3.0% 
Common equity tier 1 ("CET1") ratio of 14.3%, up 170 bps 
Executed asset sales of $536 million through Banco Santander flow agreement 
Completed national roll out of Chrysler Capital VIP program with more than 2,500 dealers enrolled 
Chrysler penetration rate of 20%, up from 19% at the end of the first quarter of 2017 
Issued $2.3 billion in securitizations, including the first public DRIVE securitization 

"We are pleased that following SHUSA's 2017 CCAR results, SC announced proposed dividends to our shareholders of $0.03 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $0.05 per share in the first and second quarters of 2018, as SC and SHUSA continue to make significant improvements to the organization's capital planning processes. While there is still work to be done, I am proud of our diligent and hard work over the last several years as we endeavor to maintain the highest standards of governance, compliance and risk management," said Jason Kulas, President and Chief Executive Officer.
Mr. Kulas continued, "We are also pleased with the progress we have made to further strengthen our relationship with Chrysler. During the quarter, we completed the national roll out of our VIP program with more than 2,500 Chrysler dealers enrolled, executed a second asset sale through the Banco Santander flow agreement, and remain committed to growing our dealer floorplan strategy with Santander Bank NA, all of which support improved penetration rates with Chrysler."
Izzy Dawood, Chief Financial Officer, added, "During the quarter, we continued to demonstrate robust access to the capital markets by executing two securitizations totaling $2.3 billion from our SDART and DRIVE platforms, including our inaugural public DRIVE securitization."
Finance receivables, loans and leases, net1 of $35 billion as of Q2 2017 increased 3 percent versus December 31, 2016. Net finance and other interest income decreased 6 percent to $1.1 billion in Q2 2017 from $1.2 billion in Q2 2016, driven by a combination of lower retail installment contract ("RIC") balances and higher cost of funds, which was driven primarily by an increase in benchmark rates.
SC's average annual percentage rate ("APR") at the end of Q2 2017 for RICs held for investment was 16.6 percent, down from 16.7 percent at the end of Q2 2016. These APRs are consistent with credit trends in our held for investment portfolio. As of the end of Q2 2017, RICs with FICO® scores at origination of less than 540 decreased to 22.4 percent, from 22.9 percent as of the end of Q2 2016, and RICs with FICO® scores at origination greater than 640 increased to 14 percent, from 13.3 as of the end of Q2 2016.
Net leased vehicle income increased 5 percent to $131 million in Q2 2017, from $125 million in Q2 2016, as a result of the continued growth of our leasing portfolio.
SC's allowance ratio2 decreased 10 basis points, to 12.6 percent at the end of Q2 2017, from 12.7 percent at the end of Q1 2017.
SC's RIC net charge-off ratio3 and delinquency ratio4 increased to 7.5 percent and 4.7 percent, respectively, in Q2 2017, from 6.0 percent and 4.2 percent, respectively, in Q2 2016. The increase in SC's net charge-off ratio is attributable to a combination of a lower recovery rate, slower portfolio growth since Q2 2016 and the acceleration of bankruptcy related charge-offs. These bankruptcy related charge-offs are primarily timing related and would have likely otherwise occurred in future quarters, as such not changing SC's overall view of vintage losses. The increase in delinquency ratio in Q2 2017 was also impacted by the slower portfolio growth since Q2 2016.
Provision for credit losses increased to $521 million in Q2 2017, from $512 million in Q2 2016. 
SC recorded net investment losses of $100 million in Q2 2017, compared to net investment losses of $101 million in Q2 2016. The current period losses were primarily driven by $90 million of lower of cost or market adjustments related to the held for sale personal lending portfolio, comprised of $104 million in customer default activity and a $14 million decrease in market discount, consistent with typical seasonal patterns. Excluding the impact of personal lending, net investment losses totaled $2 million.
During Q2 2017 SC incurred $282 million of operating expenses, up 4 percent from $272 million in Q2 2016, primarily driven by continued investment in compliance and control functions. SC's expense ratio for the quarter increased to 2.2 percent, up from 2.0 percent during the same period last year. 
SC executed asset sales of $566 million during Q2 2017, with $536 million in sales generated through the flow agreement with Banco Santander, under which it retains servicing. The serviced for others portfolio of $9.9 billion as of Q2 2017, is down 24 percent from $13 billion in Q2 2016. Servicing fee income decreased 26 percent to $32 million in Q2 2017, from $43 million in Q2 2016. The decline in SC's serviced for others portfolio and servicing fee income are a result of lower prime originations and lower prime asset sales in Q2 2017, compared to the same quarter the prior year, as the prime environment remains highly competitive.
1 Includes Finance receivables held for investment, Finance receivables held for sale and Leased vehicles.
2 Ratio for allowance for credit losses excludes end of period balances on purchased receivables portfolio of $194 million and finance receivables held for sale of $2.1 billion. 
3 Net charge-off ratio stated on a recorded investment basis, which is unpaid principal balance adjusted for unaccreted net discounts, subvention and origination costs.
4 Delinquency ratio is defined as the ratio of end of period delinquent principal over 60 days to end of period gross balance of the respective portfolio, excludes capital leases.

 (a)  
 Under the banking agencies' risk-based capital guidelines, assets and credit equivalent amounts of derivatives and off-balance sheet exposures are assigned to broad risk categories. The aggregate dollar amount in each risk category is multiplied by the associated risk weight of the category.

Banco Santander Reportedly Plans To Raise Stake In Santander Consumer
Jul 10 17
Banco Santander, S.A. (BME:SAN) is planning to raise stake in Santander Consumer USA Holdings Inc. (NYSE:SC). Banco Santander plans to go ahead with a proposal to increase control of Santander Consumer USA, after the business passed the Federal Reserve's stress test last month, according to people familiar with the matter. Banco Santander is still waiting for regulators to sign off on the transaction, first proposed in 2015. Banco Santander, which already owns 59% of Santander Consumer USA, has been trying for two years to purchase a 9.7% stake from co-founder Thomas G Dundon. It's not clear what Banco Santander would pay if the transaction goes ahead now. A Madrid-based press officer for Banco Santander declined to comment.

Overview

						About Santander Consumer USA Holdings Inc.
					

						Santander Consumer USA Holdings Inc. (NYSE: SC) is a full-service, technology-driven consumer finance company focused on vehicle finance and unsecured consumer lending products. The company, which began originating retail installment contracts in 1997, has a serviced portfolio of more than $40 billion (as of September 30, 2014), has more than two million customers across all credit grades, and is headquartered in Dallas. Santander Consumer USA Holdings Inc. is the parent company of Santander Consumer USA Inc. ("SC").
					
 History 

						The company was founded by a group of entrepreneurs within the auto industry. The group gained experience working in finance in auto dealerships, and in 1995 left the dealership environment to start a new company focused on the finance side of the industry. As a non-originator, the new company marketed the auto finance programs of various banks, gaining valuable perspective on the auto originations process.
					

						The success of the group caught the attention of FirstCity Financial and in 1998 our entrepreneurial partnership joined with FirstCity Financial to form FirstCity Funding, a nonprime auto finance company with a unique business model serving a niche market. We grew quickly and in 2000 our ownership group expanded to include HBOS plc., and FirstCity Funding officially became Drive Financial Services LP.
					

						In 2004, FirstCity Financial sold its interest in Drive, shifting ownership to HBOS plc and Drive Management LP. The stability and strength of HBOS plc allowed Drive to surpass expectations and continue to grow at a rapid pace. In 2006, HBOS plc and certain members of Drive Management LP sold their interest to Banco Santander S.A.
					

						In 2009, Santander contributed its interest in the company to Santander Holdings USA Inc. (SHUSA), a wholly owned subsidiary of Banco Santander S.A. and until December 31, 2011, the company was owned by SHUSA and our CEO.
					

						In late 2011, three leading private investment equity firms, Centerbridge Partners LP, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. LP and Warburg Pincus LLC, through Sponsor Auto Finance Holding Series LP, purchased an ownership interest in the company.
					

						In 2013, Santander Consumer USA launched Chrysler Capital auto purchase and lease financing program with the Chrysler Group LLC and integrated its subprime Drive brand into the main Santander platform. In 2014, SC became a public company with a listing on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: SC).
