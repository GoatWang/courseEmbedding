Kohl’s Names Greg Revelle Chief Marketing Officer






April 10, 2017 12:00 PM Eastern Daylight Time



MENOMONEE FALLS, Wis.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Kohl’s 
      (NYSE: KSS) today announced Greg Revelle has been named the company’s 
      chief marketing officer. Revelle will be responsible for Kohl’s 
      marketing organization and overall marketing strategy, including the 
      company’s focus on driving customer engagement through analytics, 
      enhancing the loyalty platform, accelerating customer traffic and 
      continuing to build Kohl’s overall brand position. He will report 
      directly to Michelle Gass, chief merchandising and customer officer.
    


      “Greg will be a strong addition to our senior leadership team,” said 
      Gass. “He is uniquely experienced in reaching customers in more relevant 
      and personal ways. We are excited to have him lead our efforts in 
      driving omnichannel traffic, building strong customer engagement and 
      leveraging data-driven insights to create powerful customer 
      interactions. Greg and the marketing team will elevate and accelerate 
      our loyalty and personalization efforts to help reach our goal of 
      becoming the most engaging retailer in America.”
    

      “I am excited to join Kohl’s and be part of such a strong brand with a 
      great culture,” said Revelle. “In serving millions of families across 
      the country, Kohl’s has deep connections with its customers and is 
      well-positioned to be a leader in loyalty and personalized marketing. 
      I’m energized by all of the opportunity ahead.”
    

      Prior to joining Kohl’s, Revelle was the chief marketing officer at Best 
      Buy Co., Inc., responsible for marketing, customer strategy, brand 
      positioning and execution across all channels and customer touch points. 
      He led efforts to redefine Best Buy’s brand positioning and customer 
      strategy, championed a shift to digital and personalized customer 
      communications, developed sophisticated analytics capabilities and drove 
      significant growth in the company’s loyalty program. Prior to Best Buy, 
      Revelle served as chief marketing officer at AutoNation. Before that, he 
      was vice president of worldwide online marketing at Expedia, Inc. and an 
      investment banker at Credit Suisse.
    

      Revelle holds a bachelor’s degree from Princeton University in Finance 
      and Economics and a master's degree in business administration from 
      Harvard Business School.

The broadcast company, created with its spin-off from the newspaper side of Gannett (which retained the Gannett name), will now spin-off one of its digital media assets 
The broadcast company TEGNA yesterday announced that it would be spinning off its digital media property Cars.com, and today set a date (May 16) for an investor meeting in NYC. The spin is expected to be completed on May 31, 2017.
A little background: TEGNA is the new company formed by the splitting up of the old Gannett. The broadcast side became TEGNA, and the newspaper side remained named as Gannett. The CEO of Gannett, Gracia Martore, then became the CEO of TEGNA. If that wasn’t a big enough sign that the broadcast side was the place to be, the other big decision was that the digital publishing assets Cars.com and CareerBuilder went not with the print publishing side of the split, but with the broadcast side.
As I wrote in 2015, this really hamstrung the newspaper company that would remain as Gannett:
Like the Tribune Company spin-off, the new newspaper company will be forced into agreements with the digital assets that will go to the broadcast side: CareerBuilder, Cars.com and G/O Digital. As a result, the newspaper will actually be driving digital growth for the broadcast company, while having their hands tied as to new digital initiatives.
Everyone could see that this was a terrible thing to do to Gannett.
“We expect TEGNA to benefit from acquisitions as well as increased contribution from Cars.com and CareerBuilder,” wrote Joe Cornell for Forbes. “On the other hand, Gannett Co. operates the less promising publishing business with declining traditional print advertising revenues. We have revised downwards our target price for Gannett Co. to $15.60 per share (earlier $17.25) implying a 10% upside from the current price of $14.13 per share and downgrade our rating on the stock to Hold.”
Gannett’s stock did fall a little after the spin-off, but then rose to $17.91 at the end of November 2015. It didn’t last. Today it is trading at $8.40, down 5 percent today, likely due to the stories coming out about layoffs at its local newspapers.
As for TEGNA, now it gets to spin-off another company, something that generally proves quite profitable for both the top executives and the shareholders.
As for those who work at Cars.com. what happens to the new company determined by the conditions set for the spin-off — and the signs are not good. From the release see in full below:
“Prior to the separation, Cars.com will make a one-time cash distribution of $650 million to TEGNA. Cars.com expects to enter into new credit facilities with borrowing capacity of approximately $900 million and expects a portion of the facilities will remain undrawn at closing.”
It is actually shocking that TEGNA shares (TGNA) are not climbing today after the details of the spin-off were made public, especially since TEGNA said (also below) that it would use its $650 million windfall in a stock repurchase initiative, which also should boost the stock.
Here is the announcement for the Cars.com spin-off:

MCLEAN, Va.— May 3, 2017 — TEGNA Inc. today announced that its Board of Directors has approved the previously announced spin-off of Cars.com, which will create two publicly traded companies: TEGNA, an innovative media company with the largest broadcast group among major network affiliates in the top 25 markets; and Cars.com, a leading digital automotive marketplace.
The spin-off will be effected through a pro rata distribution of all outstanding shares of Cars.com to TEGNA stockholders of record at the close of business on May 18, 2017 (the “Record Date”). Stockholders will retain their TEGNA shares and receive one share of Cars.com for every three shares of TEGNA stock they own on the Record Date. Cars.com shares are expected to begin “regular way” trading on June 1, 2017. The spin-off remains subject to the conditions described in the preliminary information statement filed by Cars.com on Form 10 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Gracia Martore, President and CEO of TEGNA, who will retire upon the closing of the spin-off, said, “Today’s milestone brings us one step closer to creating two industry-leading companies with the right focus, resources and leadership to capture the unique opportunities in each of their rapidly evolving industries. This spin-off is the culmination of a multi-year transformation of our company, and the Board is confident that both companies are well positioned to execute their strategic plans for growth and create shareholder value.”
Dave Lougee, who will serve as President and CEO of TEGNA upon completion of the separation, added, “I am honored to lead TEGNA into the future at such a pivotal time for our company. With our strong capital structure, we are well-positioned to take advantage of current and future regulatory changes. We will continue TEGNA’s history of serving our local communities by creating and distributing innovative and compelling content across a wide range of platforms and by providing our clients marketing tools and services to enable them to succeed in the digital age.”
Alex Vetter, who will serve as President and CEO of Cars.com upon completion of the separation, said, “We are approaching a watershed moment for Cars.com and I couldn’t be more excited about our future. As an independent company, we have greater flexibility to capture the opportunities ahead of us by leveraging our strong brand, innovative platform and expanding, loyal audience. We are a pure-play digital company in an excellent position to drive long-term growth and profitability, and we are a unique investment opportunity in the digital automotive space.”
Upon completion of the separation, TEGNA will continue to trade on the New York Stock Exchangeunder the ticker symbol TGNA and Cars.com will trade regular way on the New York Stock Exchangeunder the symbol CARS. Holders of TEGNA common stock who sell TEGNA shares regular way on or before May 31, 2017 will also be selling their right to receive shares of Cars.com common stock in the distribution. Investors are encouraged to consult with their financial advisors regarding the specific implications of buying or selling TEGNA common stock before the distribution date.
John A. (Jack) Williams, President of TEGNA Digital, will retire upon the closing of the spin-off. Ms. Martore added, “Jack joined the company 22 years ago and has been instrumental in leading our Digital portfolio since 2008. I want to thank Jack for all that he has done for this company and wish him well in his retirement.”
Capital Structure
Prior to the separation, Cars.com will make a one-time cash distribution of $650 million to TEGNA. Cars.com expects to enter into new credit facilities with borrowing capacity of approximately $900 million and expects a portion of the facilities will remain undrawn at closing. It intends to invest in organic growth initiatives and selective acquisitions to create shareholder value and does not anticipate paying a cash dividend.
It is expected that TEGNA’s existing credit facility will remain in place following the transaction, and the company expects to target long-term leverage levels in line with its peers. The company intends to use the $650 million tax free distribution from Cars.com and cash flow from operations to reduce leverage and, to that end, will extinguish its current share repurchase program, with plans to reassess in the future. TEGNA expects to pay a regular cash dividend of $0.28 per share annually. The company intends to continue investing in organic and strategic growth opportunities and also intends to maintain the financial flexibility to pursue strategic acquisitions when appropriate.
TEGNA Board of Directors
Current TEGNA Board Chairman Marjorie Magner will continue to serve as chairman of TEGNA’s Board of Directors following the separation and will be joined by Dave Lougee, who will be TEGNA’s president and CEO following the separation. TEGNA’s Board of Directors will also include current TEGNA directors Jennifer Dulski, Howard D. Elias, Lidia Fonseca, Scott K. McCune, Henry W. McGee, Susan Ness, Bruce P. Nolop and Neal Shapiro.
Cars.com Board of Directors
Scott Forbes will serve as chairman of the Cars.com Board of Directors following the separation. The Cars.com Board of Directors will also include Alex Vetter, Cars.com President and CEO, and current TEGNA director Jill Greenthal. In addition, upon completion of the separation, Thomas Hale, Donald McGovern and Greg Revelle are expected to serve on the Cars.com Board of Directors. Ms. Greenthal will resign from the TEGNA Board concurrently with the completion of the spin-off.
