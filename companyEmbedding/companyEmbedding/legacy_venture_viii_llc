Legacy Venture











































WE TAP VENTURE CAPITAL TO HELP OUR MEMBERS

AMPLIFY THEIR POSITIVE IMPACT IN THE WORLD





About Us

Founded in 1999, Legacy aggregates over $1.5 billion from over 500 investors who intend that all returns, both principal and gains, will be used for their individual philanthropic interests. Thus Legacy investors leverage venture returns to make an even more significant impact for good in the world.
Legacy Venture manages a series of fund-of-funds. We invest in a select group of premier venture capital firms who in turn invest in companies that have included Facebook, LendingClub, Fitbit, YouTube, Skype, Xiaomi, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Airbnb. These venture firms are often highly sought after and in many cases are not accessible to new investors. Legacy has gained access to these venture funds by virtue of its philanthropic mission and its well-connected management team.
 












Meet The TeamLegacy Venture’s executive team is comprised of seasoned leaders in venture capital, finance and philanthropy who have more than 50 years of combined experience in the field. Their deep insights and personal networks are a key part of what makes Legacy Venture attractive to such elite and successful funds, and what empower our investors to strive to maximize their philanthropy.

A Community of Innovative PhilanthropistsBased in Silicon Valley, and global in reach, Legacy is honored to support the philanthropy of over 500 investors in the existing Legacy funds. Among our investors are founders, CEOs and senior executives from prominent technology companies, including Apple, Facebook, eBay, Pinterest, Google, Yahoo, Cisco and Amazon, as well as private equity, real estate, hedge and venture firm executives. Those individual philanthropists are joined by a select group of private foundations, community foundations, and a few nonprofit organizations. Legacy connects investors with each other, encouraging them to share ideas, insights and expertise that amplify their impact.












The following gallery illustrates some of the organizations that have benefited from our community’s generous philanthropy.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
