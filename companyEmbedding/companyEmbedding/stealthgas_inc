 Weekly Market Report 7/7/17 - 14/7/17

Email 

14th July 2017
NWE/MED
The European coaster market has had a reasonably active week with several fixtures being concluded, especially in NWE. Butane continues to be the driving force, particuarly smaller parcels by PetroIneos ex Grangemouth. There are prompt vessels in NWE across all sectors, and with the larger coasters now competing on part cargoes this is leading to further downward pressure on rates.
It has been quieter in the Med and Black Sea with some traders showing potential relet positions. Some Lavera export tonnes were discussed, however, these were eventually lifted on trader controlled vessel. 
SEA/FEAST
The Singapore IHS conference has kept the Asian spot market muted this week with limited demand from the receivers. The Total CFR purchase tender for delivery into Bangladesh was awarded this week though details are unconfirmed. On the freight market, a lack of ships kept spot rates firm whilst on the period market traders are still keen to take more 5000cbm ships on charter. Earlier this week, a European trading house took another 5000 cbm ship on charter from a European owner for 1 option 1 years for Eastern trading.
According to some press reports Enterprise Products and Navigator Holdings have signed a Letter of Intent to develop an Ethylene export terminal at Morgan's Point in the Houston Ship Channel. For the sake of owners (and traders and brokers) looking to move more long-haul petchems, we hope these long-term commitments are forthcoming, however, we remain less than convinced about a new golden age of US Ethylene exports.
In Asia, apart from Petronas quoting some spot sell tenders, discussion on intra-Asia Ethylene movements has been minimal. The NE Asian Propylene market has shown some strength in anticipation of the scheduled turnaround at Formosa Taiwan with traders exploring the possibility to move deep-sea cargoes to fill the expected production loss. The C4 market has also been quiet with no fresh tenders heard thus far this week. The main issue has been delays in Chinese ports due to congestion and ullage issues resulting in ships being cancelled. Unsurprisingly, with a slack petchem market some small pressure ships are now being tempted to engage in the LPG market.
Time Charter Fixtures

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.      Stock Money Flow    Uptick/Downtick Trade Ratio  0 2    1.38      Net Money Flow ($)  16,617    Money flow gives a snapshot of relative buying and selling pressure in a stock.
