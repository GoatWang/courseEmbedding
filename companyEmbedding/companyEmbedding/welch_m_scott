Scott Welch, CEO of Welch Packaging and 1982 graduate of DePauw University, "founded the company as Elkhart Container with four employees in 1985," reports Indiana's Elkhart Truth. "He now employs 600, about 200 of them in Elkhart. Of the 725 companies nationwide that convert paper into corrugated products, Welch is among the five largest." (photo by Jennifer Shephard/Elkhart Truth)
The article by Jeff Parrott notes that Welch offers about 10 college students a year a chance to participate in a leadership program that allows them to learn about the company from the bottom up.  It provides the packaging company with a steady pipeline of future managers.
"I always look for kids with some kind of connection to Welch Packaging," Welch tells the newspaper. "Is it that they went to school with our kids? Are they from Elkhart? Are they from DePauw (where he and two of his children earned degrees)? Things that I could have a little more probability of success, versus just being another company they’re going to go to work for."
According to the CEO, who was a psychology major and standout golfer and receiver on the Tiger football team, "I started this business really young. I didn’t have a lot of management skills, but I’d been on a team since fourth grade. This business is run like a team as much as it is a business. You get a bunch of people with a common goal, and you have coaches in different areas."

Scott Welch is a member of DePauw's Board of Trustees. A gift from him and his wife is creating the M. Scott and Kimberlee A. Welch Fitness Center, a 16,000 square-foot facility that will serve varsity athletics teams, while also providing the primary recreational fitness facility for the students, faculty and staff.  You'll find more information in this previous summary.

Company HIstory l Welch Packaging




















































WELCH PACKAGING











“My whole mission was to create an environment where people felt respected and appreciated.”– Scott Welch, President









HISTORY




COMPANY




CAREER




Capabilities








In 1985, M. Scott Welch and silent partner, Don Kindt, established Welch Packaging as Elkhart Container.
Welch Packaging was founded upon the principle that making a difference was what mattered most. With a clear vision to provide the highest quality corrugated experience, Welch and his team set out to establish a new industry standard. At that time, the business had four associates, a handful of commitments from local prospects and a few pieces of basic converting equipment. With a strong commitment to customers, customized relationships and reinvestment in the business, Elkhart Container was established.
In 1988, Mr. Welch bought Mr. Kindt’s share of the business and in 1994, the company made its first acquisition by buying local competitor Pulp Products. This purchase marked the beginning of the Welch initiative to grow through strategic acquisitions and since then, the business has executed an acquisition per year for over 20 years. From a humble beginning, Welch Packaging has steadily grown into one of the most dynamic independent packaging companies in the United States and the premier corrugated manufacturer in the Midwest.
Today, with 7 regional locations, 5 distribution centers and almost 900 employees, Welch Packaging remains dedicated to servicing the needs of local customers with custom corrugated boxes, creative packaging solutions, and a commitment to long-term relationships.  Welch Packaging has never wavered from the core values upon which it was founded. Now, more than ever, Welch Packaging strives to make a difference in customers' business, associates’ lives, and every community affected by its work.

Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in California:













Does Scott L Welch Construction carry a valid contracting license?



In California, any remodeling or construction project that exceeds $500 (labor and materials), requires a contractor to have an active license with the California Contractor State License Board (CSLB).
Scott L Welch Construction currently holds license 976472 (General Building Contractor), which was Active when we last checked.











How important is contractor licensing in California?



The CSLB is one of the highest rated licensing boards in the US. Applicants are required to pass a written board exam and prove at least four years of prior, relevant work experience. In addition, the CSLB requires all license holders to maintain at least $2,500 in operating capital and provides you with a range of other consumer protections.











Your liability risk when hiring Scott L Welch Construction



Contractors in California are required to carry workers' compensation insurance if they have employees and proof of liability insurance with the cumulative limit of $1 million for licensees with five or fewer persons, and an additional 100,000 for each additional member over five, not to exceed $5 million total.











Financial recourse when hiring Scott L Welch Construction



All licensed contractors in California are required to maintain a bond, which provides you with financial recourse in case they perform defective work or violate license regulations. If you feel as though you have been taken advantage of, you should leave feedback on the contractor's BuildZoom profile and file a complaint with the CSLB.
Scott L Welch Construction has a $15,000 bond with AMERICAN CONTRACTORS INDEMNITY COMPANY. 











What else should I know before hiring Scott L Welch Construction



California contractors are required to submit their fingerprints to the board, which are then checked against criminal records held by the California Department of Justice (DOJ) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) prior to obtaining a valid contracting license.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The California State License Board recommends getting at least three written bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.
