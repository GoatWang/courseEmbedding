La Jolla Terrace



                                Do not move into La Jolla Terrace. PLEASE. Management is horrible they are hardly in the office, nothing ever gets fixed, the water bill is extremely to high, basically you're paying yours and your neighbors water bill. The rent is way to much for what they offer. The flooring choices they have are really bad, no carpet anywhere, and since it is surrounded by trees there are a ton of skunks lurking about at night. They dont give notices if they are working on utilities so you may just wake to no water. they are reall horrible. They don't take  care of the residents. This apartment complex is  not good for families or really anyone. I regret living here.

LA JOLLA TERRACE



                                MANAGEMENT IS NOT HELPFUL WHAT SO EVER, THEY NEVER ANSWER THE PHONE OR RETURN PHONE CALLS. i HAVE TO TAKE OFF WORK JUST TO GET THEM TO TALK TO ME. AND THEIR SUPPOSED TO BE OPEN ON THE WEEKENDS AND NEVER ARE...THERE IS ALWAYS POLICE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD FROM SOMEONE HAVING AN ALTERCATION. MY SON WITNESSED SOMEONE GET STABBED OUTSIDE. MAINTENANCE TAKES THEIR TIME RESOLVING ISSUES. I'VE BEEN THERE 12 MONTHS AND THEY JUST CAME LAST WEEK TO FIX MY SINK AND A LEAKING CEILING I REPORTED WHEN I FIRST MOVED IN. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND LIVING HERE

Neighborhood - Outer East Fort Worth








Outer East Fort Worth






Nestled between downtown Fort Worth and nearby Arlington, the East Fort Worth area combines the best of both areas. The residential areas are a welcome escape from the "big city" feel of neighborhoods closer to the downtown area. However, East Forth Worth residents find that they have plenty to do and see and plenty of convenient amenities available to them, right in the neighborhood.

The East Fort Worth area is more diverse than other neighborhoods within the city, in large part because it stretches out through the mid-cities, almost to the Irving and Grapevine areas. From the outer east portion of the city, residents have access to Lake Arlington, numerous major roadways and a wide stretch of the Trinity River. Aditionally, residents can access the downtown area of the city in under 20 minutes from most locations within the outer East Fort Worth neighborhood.

La Jolla Terrace



                                Do not move into La Jolla Terrace. PLEASE. Management is horrible they are hardly in the office, nothing ever gets fixed, the water bill is extremely to high, basically you're paying yours and your neighbors water bill. The rent is way to much for what they offer. The flooring choices they have are really bad, no carpet anywhere, and since it is surrounded by trees there are a ton of skunks lurking about at night. They dont give notices if they are working on utilities so you may just wake to no water. they are reall horrible. They don't take  care of the residents. This apartment complex is  not good for families or really anyone. I regret living here.

LA JOLLA TERRACE



                                MANAGEMENT IS NOT HELPFUL WHAT SO EVER, THEY NEVER ANSWER THE PHONE OR RETURN PHONE CALLS. i HAVE TO TAKE OFF WORK JUST TO GET THEM TO TALK TO ME. AND THEIR SUPPOSED TO BE OPEN ON THE WEEKENDS AND NEVER ARE...THERE IS ALWAYS POLICE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD FROM SOMEONE HAVING AN ALTERCATION. MY SON WITNESSED SOMEONE GET STABBED OUTSIDE. MAINTENANCE TAKES THEIR TIME RESOLVING ISSUES. I'VE BEEN THERE 12 MONTHS AND THEY JUST CAME LAST WEEK TO FIX MY SINK AND A LEAKING CEILING I REPORTED WHEN I FIRST MOVED IN. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND LIVING HERE

Neighborhood - Outer East Fort Worth








Outer East Fort Worth






Nestled between downtown Fort Worth and nearby Arlington, the East Fort Worth area combines the best of both areas. The residential areas are a welcome escape from the "big city" feel of neighborhoods closer to the downtown area. However, East Forth Worth residents find that they have plenty to do and see and plenty of convenient amenities available to them, right in the neighborhood.

The East Fort Worth area is more diverse than other neighborhoods within the city, in large part because it stretches out through the mid-cities, almost to the Irving and Grapevine areas. From the outer east portion of the city, residents have access to Lake Arlington, numerous major roadways and a wide stretch of the Trinity River. Aditionally, residents can access the downtown area of the city in under 20 minutes from most locations within the outer East Fort Worth neighborhood.

La Jolla Terrace



                                Do not move into La Jolla Terrace. PLEASE. Management is horrible they are hardly in the office, nothing ever gets fixed, the water bill is extremely to high, basically you're paying yours and your neighbors water bill. The rent is way to much for what they offer. The flooring choices they have are really bad, no carpet anywhere, and since it is surrounded by trees there are a ton of skunks lurking about at night. They dont give notices if they are working on utilities so you may just wake to no water. they are reall horrible. They don't take  care of the residents. This apartment complex is  not good for families or really anyone. I regret living here.

LA JOLLA TERRACE



                                MANAGEMENT IS NOT HELPFUL WHAT SO EVER, THEY NEVER ANSWER THE PHONE OR RETURN PHONE CALLS. i HAVE TO TAKE OFF WORK JUST TO GET THEM TO TALK TO ME. AND THEIR SUPPOSED TO BE OPEN ON THE WEEKENDS AND NEVER ARE...THERE IS ALWAYS POLICE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD FROM SOMEONE HAVING AN ALTERCATION. MY SON WITNESSED SOMEONE GET STABBED OUTSIDE.

I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND LIVING HERE

Neighborhood - Outer East Fort Worth








Outer East Fort Worth






Nestled between downtown Fort Worth and nearby Arlington, the East Fort Worth area combines the best of both areas. The residential areas are a welcome escape from the "big city" feel of neighborhoods closer to the downtown area. However, East Forth Worth residents find that they have plenty to do and see and plenty of convenient amenities available to them, right in the neighborhood.

The East Fort Worth area is more diverse than other neighborhoods within the city, in large part because it stretches out through the mid-cities, almost to the Irving and Grapevine areas. From the outer east portion of the city, residents have access to Lake Arlington, numerous major roadways and a wide stretch of the Trinity River. Aditionally, residents can access the downtown area of the city in under 20 minutes from most locations within the outer East Fort Worth neighborhood.

La Jolla Terrace



                                Do not move into La Jolla Terrace. PLEASE. Management is horrible they are hardly in the office, nothing ever gets fixed, the water bill is extremely to high, basically you're paying yours and your neighbors water bill. The rent is way to much for what they offer. The flooring choices they have are really bad, no carpet anywhere, and since it is surrounded by trees there are a ton of skunks lurking about at night. They dont give notices if they are working on utilities so you may just wake to no water. they are reall horrible. They don't take  care of the residents. This apartment complex is  not good for families or really anyone. I regret living here.

LA JOLLA TERRACE



                                MANAGEMENT IS NOT HELPFUL WHAT SO EVER, THEY NEVER ANSWER THE PHONE OR RETURN PHONE CALLS. i HAVE TO TAKE OFF WORK JUST TO GET THEM TO TALK TO ME. AND THEIR SUPPOSED TO BE OPEN ON THE WEEKENDS AND NEVER ARE...THERE IS ALWAYS POLICE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD FROM SOMEONE HAVING AN ALTERCATION. MY SON WITNESSED SOMEONE GET STABBED OUTSIDE. MAINTENANCE TAKES THEIR TIME RESOLVING ISSUES. I'VE BEEN THERE 12 MONTHS AND THEY JUST CAME LAST WEEK TO FIX MY SINK AND A LEAKING CEILING I REPORTED WHEN I FIRST MOVED IN. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND LIVING HERE

Neighborhood - Outer East Fort Worth








Outer East Fort Worth






Nestled between downtown Fort Worth and nearby Arlington, the East Fort Worth area combines the best of both areas. The residential areas are a welcome escape from the "big city" feel of neighborhoods closer to the downtown area. However, East Forth Worth residents find that they have plenty to do and see and plenty of convenient amenities available to them, right in the neighborhood.

The East Fort Worth area is more diverse than other neighborhoods within the city, in large part because it stretches out through the mid-cities, almost to the Irving and Grapevine areas. From the outer east portion of the city, residents have access to Lake Arlington, numerous major roadways and a wide stretch of the Trinity River. Aditionally, residents can access the downtown area of the city in under 20 minutes from most locations within the outer East Fort Worth neighborhood.

La Jolla Terrace



                                Do not move into La Jolla Terrace. PLEASE. Management is horrible they are hardly in the office, nothing ever gets fixed, the water bill is extremely to high, basically you're paying yours and your neighbors water bill. The rent is way to much for what they offer. The flooring choices they have are really bad, no carpet anywhere, and since it is surrounded by trees there are a ton of skunks lurking about at night. They dont give notices if they are working on utilities so you may just wake to no water. they are reall horrible. They don't take  care of the residents. This apartment complex is  not good for families or really anyone. I regret living here.

LA JOLLA TERRACE



                                MANAGEMENT IS NOT HELPFUL WHAT SO EVER, THEY NEVER ANSWER THE PHONE OR RETURN PHONE CALLS. i HAVE TO TAKE OFF WORK JUST TO GET THEM TO TALK TO ME. AND THEIR SUPPOSED TO BE OPEN ON THE WEEKENDS AND NEVER ARE...THERE IS ALWAYS POLICE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD FROM SOMEONE HAVING AN ALTERCATION. MY SON WITNESSED SOMEONE GET STABBED OUTSIDE.

I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND LIVING HERE

Neighborhood - Outer East Fort Worth








Outer East Fort Worth






Nestled between downtown Fort Worth and nearby Arlington, the East Fort Worth area combines the best of both areas. The residential areas are a welcome escape from the "big city" feel of neighborhoods closer to the downtown area. However, East Forth Worth residents find that they have plenty to do and see and plenty of convenient amenities available to them, right in the neighborhood.

The East Fort Worth area is more diverse than other neighborhoods within the city, in large part because it stretches out through the mid-cities, almost to the Irving and Grapevine areas. From the outer east portion of the city, residents have access to Lake Arlington, numerous major roadways and a wide stretch of the Trinity River. Aditionally, residents can access the downtown area of the city in under 20 minutes from most locations within the outer East Fort Worth neighborhood.

La Jolla Terrace



                                Do not move into La Jolla Terrace. PLEASE. Management is horrible they are hardly in the office, nothing ever gets fixed, the water bill is extremely to high, basically you're paying yours and your neighbors water bill. The rent is way to much for what they offer. The flooring choices they have are really bad, no carpet anywhere, and since it is surrounded by trees there are a ton of skunks lurking about at night. They dont give notices if they are working on utilities so you may just wake to no water. they are reall horrible. They don't take  care of the residents. This apartment complex is  not good for families or really anyone. I regret living here.

LA JOLLA TERRACE



                                MANAGEMENT IS NOT HELPFUL WHAT SO EVER, THEY NEVER ANSWER THE PHONE OR RETURN PHONE CALLS. i HAVE TO TAKE OFF WORK JUST TO GET THEM TO TALK TO ME. AND THEIR SUPPOSED TO BE OPEN ON THE WEEKENDS AND NEVER ARE...THERE IS ALWAYS POLICE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD FROM SOMEONE HAVING AN ALTERCATION. MY SON WITNESSED SOMEONE GET STABBED OUTSIDE. MAINTENANCE TAKES THEIR TIME RESOLVING ISSUES. I'VE BEEN THERE 12 MONTHS AND THEY JUST CAME LAST WEEK TO FIX MY SINK AND A LEAKING CEILING I REPORTED WHEN I FIRST MOVED IN. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND LIVING HERE

Neighborhood - Outer East Fort Worth








Outer East Fort Worth






Nestled between downtown Fort Worth and nearby Arlington, the East Fort Worth area combines the best of both areas. The residential areas are a welcome escape from the "big city" feel of neighborhoods closer to the downtown area. However, East Forth Worth residents find that they have plenty to do and see and plenty of convenient amenities available to them, right in the neighborhood.

The East Fort Worth area is more diverse than other neighborhoods within the city, in large part because it stretches out through the mid-cities, almost to the Irving and Grapevine areas. From the outer east portion of the city, residents have access to Lake Arlington, numerous major roadways and a wide stretch of the Trinity River. Aditionally, residents can access the downtown area of the city in under 20 minutes from most locations within the outer East Fort Worth neighborhood.

La Jolla Terrace

Do not move into La Jolla Terrace. PLEASE. Management is horrible they are hardly in the office, nothing ever gets fixed, the water bill is extremely to high, basically you're paying yours and your neighbors water bill. The rent is way to much for what they offer. The flooring choices they have are really bad, no carpet anywhere, and since it is surrounded by trees there are a ton of skunks lurking about at night. They dont give notices if they are working on utilities so you may just wake to no... View More water. they are reall horrible. They don't take  care of the residents. This apartment complex is  not good for families or really anyone. I regret living here.  View Less
