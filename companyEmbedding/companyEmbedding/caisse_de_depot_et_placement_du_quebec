History[edit]
Foundation and growth[edit]
The Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec was established on July 15, 1965 by an Act of Québec’s National Assembly to manage the funds of the Quebec Pension Plan, a public pension plan also created by the Québec government. In the years following, CDPQ was entrusted with managing the funds of other public pension and insurance plans: the Supplemental Pension Plan for Employees of the Québec Construction Industry (1970), the Government and Public Employees Retirement Plan (RREGOP) (1973), the Pension Plan of Management Personnel (PPMP) (1973) and the Fonds de la santé et de la sécurité du travail (1973).
CDPQ initially focused on bonds before entering the Canadian stock market in 1967. It then created its private equity portfolio (1971), investing in Québec companies. Since 1974, it has been managing the largest Canadian equity portfolio in the country.
Between 1975 and 1984, CDPQ adopted new investment guidelines, placing greater emphasis on equity and entering the real estate market. It acquired its first office building and its first shares listed on foreign exchanges (1983). In 1984, it made its first foreign private equity investment. In 1978, another government body, the Fonds d’assurance automobile du Québec, entrusted the Caisse with the management of its funds.
In 1989, CDPQ acquired Ivanhoe Inc., the real estate arm Steinberg’s grocery store chain, consisting mainly of shopping centres, and diversified its real estate portfolio with investments abroad. In 1994, the Caisse began to manage the funds of another government institution, namely, the Retirement Plans Sinking Fund. Total assets under management reached $28 billion CAD in 1986.
In 1996, the Caisse’s Real Estate group was the leading real estate owner in Québec and the second largest in Canada. The following year, legislative changes allowed the Caisse to invest 70% of its portfolio in shares, compared to a maximum of 40% prior to that. Since 2003, the Caisse has received the best short- and long-term credit ratings issued by the major credit rating agencies: Moody's Investors Service (Moody’s), Standard and Poor's (S&P), and Dominion Bond Rating Service (DBRS).
In 2005 and 2006, the Caisse made its first major infrastructure acquisitions by investing in foreign airports. The next year, with partners, it purchased the Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT), owner of the prestigious Château Frontenac in Québec City. In 2007, its results put the Caisse in the first quartile of large Canadian pension funds for the fourth consecutive year.
In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, during which CDPQ lost almost $40 billion CAD in asset-backed commercial paper investments, the Caisse implemented a series of measures to maximize efficiency, focus on core competencies, and strengthen risk management to support its long-term performance.
As of July 2015, CDPQ has 32 depositors and is active on Canadian and international markets. The Caisse holds a diversified portfolio including fixed-income securities, publicly listed shares, real estate investments, and private equity. A shareholder in more than 4,000 companies in Québec, elsewhere in Canada, and around the world, the Caisse is internationally recognized as a leading institutional investor.[3]
2008 loss of $40 billion[edit]
In 2008, CDPQ lost $39.8 billion and generated a minus-26-per-cent return, making it the worst in the Caisse's 43-year history (in 2002, the Caisse had suffered a minus-9.4-per-cent return, its second worst year). The 2008 annual report of the Caisse shows that no bonuses were paid for 2008.[4] The Caisse subsequently undertook a major restructuring. CEO Henri-Paul Rousseau took the lead and negotiated the conversion of the ABCP into long-term bonds, and major players agreed to prevent a forced liquidation that would have resulted in losses of $20 billion CAD.[5] The resulting Montréal Agreement was deemed success and the 2008 loss was almost completely recouped in subsequent years.[6][7]
Creation of CDPQ Infra[edit]
In June 2015, the Québec National Assembly passed Bill 38 "An Act to allow the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec to carry out infrastructure projects". CDPQ thereafter created a new subsidiary dedicated to the development of infrastructure projects, CDPQ Infra. The Quebec government submitted two projects for CDPQ Infra's evaluation: a public transit system to be integrated to the future Champlain bridge, and a public transit system linking downtown Montreal, the Montréal–Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport and the West Island.
On April 22nd, 2016, CDPQ Infra unveiled plans for a new public transportation project, the Réseau électrique métropolitain (REM).[8] As proposed, the REM will link downtown Montréal, the South Shore, the West Island (Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue), the North Shore (Deux-Montagnes) and the airport in a unified, electrically powered and fully automated, 67-km light rail transit (LRT) system.[9] The new network represents an investment of approximately $5.5 billion, of which CDPQ Infra is willing to commit $3 billion as the majority shareholder.[citation needed]
On March 8, 2017, General Electric said it had agreed to sell GE Water for around USD $3.4 billion to Suez SA in France and Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec.[10]

Mandate and independence[edit]
In 2005, article 4 of CDPQ's founding statute[11] was amended to make the institution's mandate explicit:

4.1. The mission of the Fund is to receive moneys on deposit as provided by law and manage them with a view to achieving optimal return on capital within the framework of depositors' investment policies while at the same time contributing to Québec's economic development.

In June 2015, the CDPQ statute was further amended to specify that CDPQ "acts with full independence in accordance with this Act." [12]
Organization[edit]
CDPQ's Board of Directors can have up to 15 members, two-thirds of whom must be independent. It is composed of its Chair, the President and CEO, depositor representatives, and independent members. The Board is responsible for establishing CDPQ's main orientations and ensuring that the Caisse operates according to all legislative and regulatory requirements. The position of Chairman of the Board of Directors is separate from that of President and Chief Executive Officer.
The Québec government appoints members of the Board of Directors, upon consultation with the Board. CDPQ’s Board of Directors has defined a profile of expertise and experience required for its independent directors.[13]
The Executive Committee is composed of the President and CEO and the senior officers of CDPQ’s various sectors.
Subsidiaries[edit]
CDPQ has three subsidiaries: Ivanhoé Cambridge, Otéra Capital and CDPQ Infra.
CDPQ Infra works on creating major public infrastructure projects. One of the biggest projects for CDPQ Infra is the Réseau électrique métropolitain (REM) in the Greater Montreal area.
Ivanhoé Cambridge is the real estate subsidiary of the Caisse. The Company aims to invest in real estate assets ranging from office space, shopping centers to multiresidential buildings. Some of the biggest projects for Ivanhoé Cambridge are CIBC Square in Toronto and DUO in Paris.
Otéra Capital is a balance sheet lender in commercial real estate debt in Canada.
The headquarters for each of these subsidiaries are located in Montreal, in the Jacques-Parizeau Building.

History[edit]
Foundation and growth[edit]
The Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec was established on July 15, 1965 by an Act of Québec’s National Assembly to manage the funds of the Quebec Pension Plan, a public pension plan also created by the Québec government. In the years following, CDPQ was entrusted with managing the funds of other public pension and insurance plans: the Supplemental Pension Plan for Employees of the Québec Construction Industry (1970), the Government and Public Employees Retirement Plan (RREGOP) (1973), the Pension Plan of Management Personnel (PPMP) (1973) and the Fonds de la santé et de la sécurité du travail (1973).
CDPQ initially focused on bonds before entering the Canadian stock market in 1967. It then created its private equity portfolio (1971), investing in Québec companies. Since 1974, it has been managing the largest Canadian equity portfolio in the country.
Between 1975 and 1984, CDPQ adopted new investment guidelines, placing greater emphasis on equity and entering the real estate market. It acquired its first office building and its first shares listed on foreign exchanges (1983). In 1984, it made its first foreign private equity investment. In 1978, another government body, the Fonds d’assurance automobile du Québec, entrusted the Caisse with the management of its funds.
In 1989, CDPQ acquired Ivanhoe Inc., the real estate arm Steinberg’s grocery store chain, consisting mainly of shopping centres, and diversified its real estate portfolio with investments abroad. In 1994, the Caisse began to manage the funds of another government institution, namely, the Retirement Plans Sinking Fund. Total assets under management reached $28 billion CAD in 1986.
In 1996, the Caisse’s Real Estate group was the leading real estate owner in Québec and the second largest in Canada. The following year, legislative changes allowed the Caisse to invest 70% of its portfolio in shares, compared to a maximum of 40% prior to that. Since 2003, the Caisse has received the best short- and long-term credit ratings issued by the major credit rating agencies: Moody's Investors Service (Moody’s), Standard and Poor's (S&P), and Dominion Bond Rating Service (DBRS).
In 2005 and 2006, the Caisse made its first major infrastructure acquisitions by investing in foreign airports. The next year, with partners, it purchased the Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT), owner of the prestigious Château Frontenac in Québec City. In 2007, its results put the Caisse in the first quartile of large Canadian pension funds for the fourth consecutive year.
In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, during which CDPQ lost almost $40 billion CAD in asset-backed commercial paper investments, the Caisse implemented a series of measures to maximize efficiency, focus on core competencies, and strengthen risk management to support its long-term performance.
As of July 2015, CDPQ has 32 depositors and is active on Canadian and international markets. The Caisse holds a diversified portfolio including fixed-income securities, publicly listed shares, real estate investments, and private equity. A shareholder in more than 4,000 companies in Québec, elsewhere in Canada, and around the world, the Caisse is internationally recognized as a leading institutional investor.[3]
2008 loss of $40 billion[edit]
In 2008, CDPQ lost $39.8 billion and generated a minus-26-per-cent return, making it the worst in the Caisse's 43-year history (in 2002, the Caisse had suffered a minus-9.4-per-cent return, its second worst year). The 2008 annual report of the Caisse shows that no bonuses were paid for 2008.[4] The Caisse subsequently undertook a major restructuring. CEO Henri-Paul Rousseau took the lead and negotiated the conversion of the ABCP into long-term bonds, and major players agreed to prevent a forced liquidation that would have resulted in losses of $20 billion CAD.[5] The resulting Montréal Agreement was deemed success and the 2008 loss was almost completely recouped in subsequent years.[6][7]
Creation of CDPQ Infra[edit]
In June 2015, the Québec National Assembly passed Bill 38 "An Act to allow the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec to carry out infrastructure projects". CDPQ thereafter created a new subsidiary dedicated to the development of infrastructure projects, CDPQ Infra. The Quebec government submitted two projects for CDPQ Infra's evaluation: a public transit system to be integrated to the future Champlain bridge, and a public transit system linking downtown Montreal, the Montréal–Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport and the West Island.
On April 22nd, 2016, CDPQ Infra unveiled plans for a new public transportation project, the Réseau électrique métropolitain (REM).[8] As proposed, the REM will link downtown Montréal, the South Shore, the West Island (Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue), the North Shore (Deux-Montagnes) and the airport in a unified, electrically powered and fully automated, 67-km light rail transit (LRT) system.[9] The new network represents an investment of approximately $5.5 billion, of which CDPQ Infra is willing to commit $3 billion as the majority shareholder.[citation needed]
On March 8, 2017, General Electric said it had agreed to sell GE Water for around USD $3.4 billion to Suez SA in France and Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec.[10]
Presidents[edit]

1966-1973 : Claude Prieur
1973-1980 : Marcel Cazavan
1980-1990 : Jean Campeau
1990-1995 : Jean-Claude Delorme et Guy Savard

2002-2008 : Henri-Paul Rousseau
2008-2009 : Richard Guay
2009- : Michael Sabia

Mandate and independence[edit]
In 2005, article 4 of CDPQ's founding statute[11] was amended to make the institution's mandate explicit:

4.1. The mission of the Fund is to receive moneys on deposit as provided by law and manage them with a view to achieving optimal return on capital within the framework of depositors' investment policies while at the same time contributing to Québec's economic development.

In June 2015, the CDPQ statute was further amended to specify that CDPQ "acts with full independence in accordance with this Act." [12]
Organization[edit]
CDPQ's Board of Directors can have up to 15 members, two-thirds of whom must be independent. It is composed of its Chair, the President and CEO, depositor representatives, and independent members. The Board is responsible for establishing CDPQ's main orientations and ensuring that the Caisse operates according to all legislative and regulatory requirements. The position of Chairman of the Board of Directors is separate from that of President and Chief Executive Officer.
The Québec government appoints members of the Board of Directors, upon consultation with the Board. CDPQ’s Board of Directors has defined a profile of expertise and experience required for its independent directors.[13]
The Executive Committee is composed of the President and CEO and the senior officers of CDPQ’s various sectors.
Subsidiaries[edit]
CDPQ has three subsidiaries: Ivanhoé Cambridge, Otéra Capital and CDPQ Infra.
CDPQ Infra works on creating major public infrastructure projects. One of the biggest projects for CDPQ Infra is the Réseau électrique métropolitain (REM) in the Greater Montreal area.
Ivanhoé Cambridge is the real estate subsidiary of the Caisse. The Company aims to invest in real estate assets ranging from office space, shopping centers to multiresidential buildings. Some of the biggest projects for Ivanhoé Cambridge are CIBC Square in Toronto and DUO in Paris.
Otéra Capital is a balance sheet lender in commercial real estate debt in Canada.
The headquarters for each of these subsidiaries are located in Montreal, in the Jacques-Parizeau Building.

History[edit]
Foundation and growth[edit]
The Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec was established on July 15, 1965 by an Act of Québec’s National Assembly to manage the funds of the Quebec Pension Plan, a public pension plan also created by the Québec government. In the years following, CDPQ was entrusted with managing the funds of other public pension and insurance plans: the Supplemental Pension Plan for Employees of the Québec Construction Industry (1970), the Government and Public Employees Retirement Plan (RREGOP) (1973), the Pension Plan of Management Personnel (PPMP) (1973) and the Fonds de la santé et de la sécurité du travail (1973).
CDPQ initially focused on bonds before entering the Canadian stock market in 1967. It then created its private equity portfolio (1971), investing in Québec companies. Since 1974, it has been managing the largest Canadian equity portfolio in the country.
Between 1975 and 1984, CDPQ adopted new investment guidelines, placing greater emphasis on equity and entering the real estate market. It acquired its first office building and its first shares listed on foreign exchanges (1983). In 1984, it made its first foreign private equity investment. In 1978, another government body, the Fonds d’assurance automobile du Québec, entrusted the Caisse with the management of its funds.
In 1989, CDPQ acquired Ivanhoe Inc., the real estate arm Steinberg’s grocery store chain, consisting mainly of shopping centres, and diversified its real estate portfolio with investments abroad. In 1994, the Caisse began to manage the funds of another government institution, namely, the Retirement Plans Sinking Fund. Total assets under management reached $28 billion CAD in 1986.
In 1996, the Caisse’s Real Estate group was the leading real estate owner in Québec and the second largest in Canada. The following year, legislative changes allowed the Caisse to invest 70% of its portfolio in shares, compared to a maximum of 40% prior to that. Since 2003, the Caisse has received the best short- and long-term credit ratings issued by the major credit rating agencies: Moody's Investors Service (Moody’s), Standard and Poor's (S&P), and Dominion Bond Rating Service (DBRS).
In 2005 and 2006, the Caisse made its first major infrastructure acquisitions by investing in foreign airports. The next year, with partners, it purchased the Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT), owner of the prestigious Château Frontenac in Québec City. In 2007, its results put the Caisse in the first quartile of large Canadian pension funds for the fourth consecutive year.
In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, during which CDPQ lost almost $40 billion CAD in asset-backed commercial paper investments, the Caisse implemented a series of measures to maximize efficiency, focus on core competencies, and strengthen risk management to support its long-term performance.
As of July 2015, CDPQ has 32 depositors and is active on Canadian and international markets. The Caisse holds a diversified portfolio including fixed-income securities, publicly listed shares, real estate investments, and private equity. A shareholder in more than 4,000 companies in Québec, elsewhere in Canada, and around the world, the Caisse is internationally recognized as a leading institutional investor.[3]
2008 loss of $40 billion[edit]
In 2008, CDPQ lost $39.8 billion and generated a minus-26-per-cent return, making it the worst in the Caisse's 43-year history (in 2002, the Caisse had suffered a minus-9.4-per-cent return, its second worst year). The 2008 annual report of the Caisse shows that no bonuses were paid for 2008.[4] The Caisse subsequently undertook a major restructuring. CEO Henri-Paul Rousseau took the lead and negotiated the conversion of the ABCP into long-term bonds, and major players agreed to prevent a forced liquidation that would have resulted in losses of $20 billion CAD.[5] The resulting Montréal Agreement was deemed success and the 2008 loss was almost completely recouped in subsequent years.[6][7]
Creation of CDPQ Infra[edit]
In June 2015, the Québec National Assembly passed Bill 38 "An Act to allow the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec to carry out infrastructure projects". CDPQ thereafter created a new subsidiary dedicated to the development of infrastructure projects, CDPQ Infra. The Quebec government submitted two projects for CDPQ Infra's evaluation: a public transit system to be integrated to the future Champlain bridge, and a public transit system linking downtown Montreal, the Montréal–Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport and the West Island.
On April 22nd, 2016, CDPQ Infra unveiled plans for a new public transportation project, the Réseau électrique métropolitain (REM).[8] As proposed, the REM will link downtown Montréal, the South Shore, the West Island (Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue), the North Shore (Deux-Montagnes) and the airport in a unified, electrically powered and fully automated, 67-km light rail transit (LRT) system.[9] The new network represents an investment of approximately $5.5 billion, of which CDPQ Infra is willing to commit $3 billion as the majority shareholder.[citation needed]
On March 8, 2017, General Electric said it had agreed to sell GE Water for around USD $3.4 billion to Suez SA in France and Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec.[10]
Presidents[edit]

1966-1973 : Claude Prieur
1973-1980 : Marcel Cazavan
1980-1990 : Jean Campeau
1990-1995 : Jean-Claude Delorme et Guy Savard

2002-2008 : Henri-Paul Rousseau
2008-2009 : Richard Guay
2009- : Michael Sabia

Mandate and independence[edit]
In 2005, article 4 of CDPQ's founding statute[11] was amended to make the institution's mandate explicit:

4.1. The mission of the Fund is to receive moneys on deposit as provided by law and manage them with a view to achieving optimal return on capital within the framework of depositors' investment policies while at the same time contributing to Québec's economic development.

In June 2015, the CDPQ statute was further amended to specify that CDPQ "acts with full independence in accordance with this Act." [12]
Organization[edit]
CDPQ's Board of Directors can have up to 15 members, two-thirds of whom must be independent. It is composed of its Chair, the President and CEO, depositor representatives, and independent members. The Board is responsible for establishing CDPQ's main orientations and ensuring that the Caisse operates according to all legislative and regulatory requirements. The position of Chairman of the Board of Directors is separate from that of President and Chief Executive Officer.
The Québec government appoints members of the Board of Directors, upon consultation with the Board. CDPQ’s Board of Directors has defined a profile of expertise and experience required for its independent directors.[13]
The Executive Committee is composed of the President and CEO and the senior officers of CDPQ’s various sectors.
Subsidiaries[edit]
CDPQ has three subsidiaries: Ivanhoé Cambridge, Otéra Capital and CDPQ Infra.
CDPQ Infra works on creating major public infrastructure projects. One of the biggest projects for CDPQ Infra is the Réseau électrique métropolitain (REM) in the Greater Montreal area.
Ivanhoé Cambridge is the real estate subsidiary of the Caisse. The Company aims to invest in real estate assets ranging from office space, shopping centers to multiresidential buildings. Some of the biggest projects for Ivanhoé Cambridge are CIBC Square in Toronto and DUO in Paris.
Otéra Capital is a balance sheet lender in commercial real estate debt in Canada.
The headquarters for each of these subsidiaries are located in Montreal, in the Jacques-Parizeau Building.

History[edit]
Foundation and growth[edit]
The Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec was established on July 15, 1965 by an Act of Québec’s National Assembly to manage the funds of the Quebec Pension Plan, a public pension plan also created by the Québec government. In the years following, CDPQ was entrusted with managing the funds of other public pension and insurance plans: the Supplemental Pension Plan for Employees of the Québec Construction Industry (1970), the Government and Public Employees Retirement Plan (RREGOP) (1973), the Pension Plan of Management Personnel (PPMP) (1973) and the Fonds de la santé et de la sécurité du travail (1973).
CDPQ initially focused on bonds before entering the Canadian stock market in 1967. It then created its private equity portfolio (1971), investing in Québec companies. Since 1974, it has been managing the largest Canadian equity portfolio in the country.
Between 1975 and 1984, CDPQ adopted new investment guidelines, placing greater emphasis on equity and entering the real estate market. It acquired its first office building and its first shares listed on foreign exchanges (1983). In 1984, it made its first foreign private equity investment. In 1978, another government body, the Fonds d’assurance automobile du Québec, entrusted the Caisse with the management of its funds.
In 1989, CDPQ acquired Ivanhoe Inc., the real estate arm Steinberg’s grocery store chain, consisting mainly of shopping centres, and diversified its real estate portfolio with investments abroad. In 1994, the Caisse began to manage the funds of another government institution, namely, the Retirement Plans Sinking Fund. Total assets under management reached $28 billion CAD in 1986.
In 1996, the Caisse’s Real Estate group was the leading real estate owner in Québec and the second largest in Canada. The following year, legislative changes allowed the Caisse to invest 70% of its portfolio in shares, compared to a maximum of 40% prior to that. Since 2003, the Caisse has received the best short- and long-term credit ratings issued by the major credit rating agencies: Moody's Investors Service (Moody’s), Standard and Poor's (S&P), and Dominion Bond Rating Service (DBRS).
In 2005 and 2006, the Caisse made its first major infrastructure acquisitions by investing in foreign airports. The next year, with partners, it purchased the Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT), owner of the prestigious Château Frontenac in Québec City. In 2007, its results put the Caisse in the first quartile of large Canadian pension funds for the fourth consecutive year.
In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, during which CDPQ lost almost $40 billion CAD in asset-backed commercial paper investments, the Caisse implemented a series of measures to maximize efficiency, focus on core competencies, and strengthen risk management to support its long-term performance.
As of July 2015, CDPQ has 32 depositors and is active on Canadian and international markets. The Caisse holds a diversified portfolio including fixed-income securities, publicly listed shares, real estate investments, and private equity. A shareholder in more than 4,000 companies in Québec, elsewhere in Canada, and around the world, the Caisse is internationally recognized as a leading institutional investor.[3]
2008 loss of $40 billion[edit]
In 2008, CDPQ lost $39.8 billion and generated a minus-26-per-cent return, making it the worst in the Caisse's 43-year history (in 2002, the Caisse had suffered a minus-9.4-per-cent return, its second worst year). The 2008 annual report of the Caisse shows that no bonuses were paid for 2008.[4] The Caisse subsequently undertook a major restructuring. CEO Henri-Paul Rousseau took the lead and negotiated the conversion of the ABCP into long-term bonds, and major players agreed to prevent a forced liquidation that would have resulted in losses of $20 billion CAD.[5] The resulting Montréal Agreement was deemed success and the 2008 loss was almost completely recouped in subsequent years.[6][7]
Creation of CDPQ Infra[edit]
In June 2015, the Québec National Assembly passed Bill 38 "An Act to allow the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec to carry out infrastructure projects". CDPQ thereafter created a new subsidiary dedicated to the development of infrastructure projects, CDPQ Infra. The Quebec government submitted two projects for CDPQ Infra's evaluation: a public transit system to be integrated to the future Champlain bridge, and a public transit system linking downtown Montreal, the Montréal–Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport and the West Island.
On April 22nd, 2016, CDPQ Infra unveiled plans for a new public transportation project, the Réseau électrique métropolitain (REM).[8] As proposed, the REM will link downtown Montréal, the South Shore, the West Island (Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue), the North Shore (Deux-Montagnes) and the airport in a unified, electrically powered and fully automated, 67-km light rail transit (LRT) system.[9] The new network represents an investment of approximately $5.5 billion, of which CDPQ Infra is willing to commit $3 billion as the majority shareholder.[citation needed]
On March 8, 2017, General Electric said it had agreed to sell GE Water for around USD $3.4 billion to Suez SA in France and Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec.[10]
Presidents[edit]

1966-1973 : Claude Prieur
1973-1980 : Marcel Cazavan
1980-1990 : Jean Campeau
1990-1995 : Jean-Claude Delorme et Guy Savard
1995-2002 : Jean-Claude Scraire
2002-2008 : Henri-Paul Rousseau
2008-2009 : Richard Guay
2009- : Michael Sabia

Mandate and independence[edit]
In 2005, article 4 of CDPQ's founding statute[11] was amended to make the institution's mandate explicit:

4.1. The mission of the Fund is to receive moneys on deposit as provided by law and manage them with a view to achieving optimal return on capital within the framework of depositors' investment policies while at the same time contributing to Québec's economic development.

In June 2015, the CDPQ statute was further amended to specify that CDPQ "acts with full independence in accordance with this Act." [12]
Organization[edit]
CDPQ's Board of Directors can have up to 15 members, two-thirds of whom must be independent. It is composed of its Chair, the President and CEO, depositor representatives, and independent members. The Board is responsible for establishing CDPQ's main orientations and ensuring that the Caisse operates according to all legislative and regulatory requirements. The position of Chairman of the Board of Directors is separate from that of President and Chief Executive Officer.
The Québec government appoints members of the Board of Directors, upon consultation with the Board. CDPQ’s Board of Directors has defined a profile of expertise and experience required for its independent directors.[13]
The Executive Committee is composed of the President and CEO and the senior officers of CDPQ’s various sectors.
Subsidiaries[edit]
CDPQ has three subsidiaries: Ivanhoé Cambridge, Otéra Capital and CDPQ Infra.
CDPQ Infra works on creating major public infrastructure projects. One of the biggest projects for CDPQ Infra is the Réseau électrique métropolitain (REM) in the Greater Montreal area.
Ivanhoé Cambridge is the real estate subsidiary of the Caisse. The Company aims to invest in real estate assets ranging from office space, shopping centers to multiresidential buildings. Some of the biggest projects for Ivanhoé Cambridge are CIBC Square in Toronto and DUO in Paris.
Otéra Capital is a balance sheet lender in commercial real estate debt in Canada.
The headquarters for each of these subsidiaries are located in Montreal, in the Jacques-Parizeau Building.

Sortons la caisse du carbone – Demandons à la Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec de désinvestir des combustibles fossiles
































Demandons à la Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec de désinvestir des combustibles fossiles
La Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (CDPQ) investit une part significative de l’épargne des Québécois(es) dans les énergies fossiles. Ces investissements sont incompatibles avec l’Accord de Paris et avec la science du climat. Ils sont aussi de plus en plus risqués alors que la transition énergétique s’accélère, que les énergies renouvelables ont le vent dans les voiles, et que les actifs de combustibles fossiles sont déjà –ou en voie d’être– fortement dévalués.
La CDPQ a augmenté ses investissements dans les énergies fossiles depuis la signature de l’Accord de Paris en 2015. En 2016, la Caisse a même augmenté ses investissements dans le charbon, le pétrole et le gaz, les faisant passer à 16,7 milliards de dollars* alors qu’au niveau de son portefeuille d’actions, la proportion dans les énergies fossiles est passée de 7% à 9,7%. Avec notre argent, la CDPQ finance, entre autres, la construction de pipelines et l’expansion des sables bitumineux, détenant des actifs dans Enbridge, TransCanada et Kinder Morgan, pour ne citer que trois exemples éloquents. Entre 2015 et 2016, la Caisse a augmenté de 48% ses investissements dans Enbridge et de 66% dans TransCanada!
À l’opposé, le désinvestissement des combustibles fossiles a déjà atteint 710 établissements dans 76 pays, représentant plus de 5,5 billions de dollars d'actifs sous gestion, ce qui indique que l'industrie des combustibles fossiles n'a pas d'avenir. C’est le cas des grands fonds de pension de la Californie et du plus grand fonds souverain au monde basé en Norvège. C’est aussi le cas de l’Université Laval à Québec!
Notre épargne ne doit pas être mise à risque pour financer la crise climatique, les sables bitumineux ou les pipelines. Elle ne doit pas partir en fumée dans des énergies fossiles dévaluées, mais soutenir la transition vers un avenir fondé à 100% sur les énergies renouvelables et les emplois verts.
Remplissez le formulaire et envoyez un courriel au PDG de la CQDP, M. Michael Sabia, pour lui demander de désinvestir des combustibles fossiles immédiatement.
L’argent de nos retraites ne doit pas servir à ruiner l’avenir de nos enfants.

Cher Monsieur Michael Sabia,
Je vous écris aujourd’hui pour vous exprimer mon profond désaccord avec le maintien des investissements de la Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec dans le secteur des énergies fossiles.
Comme travailleur(se), retraité(e) et/ou citoyen(e) québécois(e) soucieux(euse) de l’environnement et de l’avenir de nos enfants, je considère que ces investissements sont incompatibles avec mes valeurs et celles d’une majorité de concitoyens.
Je ne veux pas que les épargnes pour ma retraite ou au fonds des générations soient exposées aux risques inutiles d’un secteur en déclin qui, de surcroît, détruit la nature et le climat, et brime les droits de Premières Nations. On mérite mieux que ça.
Dans le monde, plus de 600 institutions financières et fonds ont commencé à se prémunir contre le risque d’éclatement d’une bulle carbone, en sortant partiellement ou complètement leurs placements des combustibles fossiles. La CDPQ devrait suivre leur exemple.
En espérant voir mes épargnes sortir rapidement du secteur des énergies fossiles, je vous souhaite le courage de prendre les décisions qui feront de notre Caisse un exemple de solidarité, efficience et durabilité.

History[edit]
Foundation and growth[edit]
The Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec was established on July 15, 1965 by an Act of Québec’s National Assembly to manage the funds of the Quebec Pension Plan, a public pension plan also created by the Québec government. In the years following, CDPQ was entrusted with managing the funds of other public pension and insurance plans: the Supplemental Pension Plan for Employees of the Québec Construction Industry (1970), the Government and Public Employees Retirement Plan (RREGOP) (1973), the Pension Plan of Management Personnel (PPMP) (1973) and the Fonds de la santé et de la sécurité du travail (1973).
CDPQ initially focused on bonds before entering the Canadian stock market in 1967. It then created its private equity portfolio (1971), investing in Québec companies. Since 1974, it has been managing the largest Canadian equity portfolio in the country.
Between 1975 and 1984, CDPQ adopted new investment guidelines, placing greater emphasis on equity and entering the real estate market. It acquired its first office building and its first shares listed on foreign exchanges (1983). In 1984, it made its first foreign private equity investment. In 1978, another government body, the Fonds d’assurance automobile du Québec, entrusted the Caisse with the management of its funds.
In 1989, CDPQ acquired Ivanhoe Inc., the real estate arm Steinberg’s grocery store chain, consisting mainly of shopping centres, and diversified its real estate portfolio with investments abroad. In 1994, the Caisse began to manage the funds of another government institution, namely, the Retirement Plans Sinking Fund. Total assets under management reached $28 billion CAD in 1986.
In 1996, the Caisse’s Real Estate group was the leading real estate owner in Québec and the second largest in Canada. The following year, legislative changes allowed the Caisse to invest 70% of its portfolio in shares, compared to a maximum of 40% prior to that. Since 2003, the Caisse has received the best short- and long-term credit ratings issued by the major credit rating agencies: Moody's Investors Service (Moody’s), Standard and Poor's (S&P), and Dominion Bond Rating Service (DBRS).
In 2005 and 2006, the Caisse made its first major infrastructure acquisitions by investing in foreign airports. The next year, with partners, it purchased the Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT), owner of the prestigious Château Frontenac in Québec City. In 2007, its results put the Caisse in the first quartile of large Canadian pension funds for the fourth consecutive year.
In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, during which CDPQ lost almost $40 billion CAD in asset-backed commercial paper investments, the Caisse implemented a series of measures to maximize efficiency, focus on core competencies, and strengthen risk management to support its long-term performance.
As of July 2015, CDPQ has 32 depositors and is active on Canadian and international markets. The Caisse holds a diversified portfolio including fixed-income securities, publicly listed shares, real estate investments, and private equity. A shareholder in more than 4,000 companies in Québec, elsewhere in Canada, and around the world, the Caisse is internationally recognized as a leading institutional investor.[3]
2008 loss of $40 billion[edit]
In 2008, CDPQ lost $39.8 billion and generated a minus-26-per-cent return, making it the worst in the Caisse's 43-year history (in 2002, the Caisse had suffered a minus-9.4-per-cent return, its second worst year). The 2008 annual report of the Caisse shows that no bonuses were paid for 2008.[4] The Caisse subsequently undertook a major restructuring. CEO Henri-Paul Rousseau took the lead and negotiated the conversion of the ABCP into long-term bonds, and major players agreed to prevent a forced liquidation that would have resulted in losses of $20 billion CAD.[5] The resulting Montréal Agreement was deemed success and the 2008 loss was almost completely recouped in subsequent years.[6][7]
Creation of CDPQ Infra[edit]
In June 2015, the Québec National Assembly passed Bill 38 "An Act to allow the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec to carry out infrastructure projects". CDPQ thereafter created a new subsidiary dedicated to the development of infrastructure projects, CDPQ Infra. The Quebec government submitted two projects for CDPQ Infra's evaluation: a public transit system to be integrated to the future Champlain bridge, and a public transit system linking downtown Montreal, the Montréal–Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport and the West Island.
On April 22nd, 2016, CDPQ Infra unveiled plans for a new public transportation project, the Réseau électrique métropolitain (REM).[8] As proposed, the REM will link downtown Montréal, the South Shore, the West Island (Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue), the North Shore (Deux-Montagnes) and the airport in a unified, electrically powered and fully automated, 67-km light rail transit (LRT) system.[9] The new network represents an investment of approximately $5.5 billion, of which CDPQ Infra is willing to commit $3 billion as the majority shareholder.[citation needed]
On March 8, 2017, General Electric said it had agreed to sell GE Water for around USD $3.4 billion to Suez SA in France and Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec.[10]
Presidents[edit]

1966-1973 : Claude Prieur
1973-1980 : Marcel Cazavan
1980-1990 : Jean Campeau
1990-1995 : Jean-Claude Delorme et Guy Savard
1995-2002 : Jean-Claude Scraire
2002-2008 : Henri-Paul Rousseau
2008-2009 : Richard Guay
2009- : Michael Sabia

Mandate and independence[edit]
In 2005, article 4 of CDPQ's founding statute[11] was amended to make the institution's mandate explicit:

4.1. The mission of the Fund is to receive moneys on deposit as provided by law and manage them with a view to achieving optimal return on capital within the framework of depositors' investment policies while at the same time contributing to Québec's economic development.

In June 2015, the CDPQ statute was further amended to specify that CDPQ "acts with full independence in accordance with this Act." [12]
Organization[edit]
CDPQ's Board of Directors can have up to 15 members, two-thirds of whom must be independent. It is composed of its Chair, the President and CEO, depositor representatives, and independent members. The Board is responsible for establishing CDPQ's main orientations and ensuring that the Caisse operates according to all legislative and regulatory requirements. The position of Chairman of the Board of Directors is separate from that of President and Chief Executive Officer.
The Québec government appoints members of the Board of Directors, upon consultation with the Board. CDPQ’s Board of Directors has defined a profile of expertise and experience required for its independent directors.[13]
The Executive Committee is composed of the President and CEO and the senior officers of CDPQ’s various sectors.
Subsidiaries[edit]
CDPQ has three subsidiaries: Ivanhoé Cambridge, Otéra Capital and CDPQ Infra.
CDPQ Infra works on creating major public infrastructure projects. One of the biggest projects for CDPQ Infra is the Réseau électrique métropolitain (REM) in the Greater Montreal area.
Ivanhoé Cambridge is the real estate subsidiary of the Caisse. The Company aims to invest in real estate assets ranging from office space, shopping centers to multiresidential buildings. Some of the biggest projects for Ivanhoé Cambridge are CIBC Square in Toronto and DUO in Paris.
Otéra Capital is a balance sheet lender in commercial real estate debt in Canada.
The headquarters for each of these subsidiaries are located in Montreal, in the Jacques-Parizeau Building.

CDPQ's portfolio is divided into four main categories of assets:[14]

History[edit]
Foundation and growth[edit]
The Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec was established on July 15, 1965 by an Act of Québec’s National Assembly to manage the funds of the Quebec Pension Plan, a public pension plan also created by the Québec government. In the years following, CDPQ was entrusted with managing the funds of other public pension and insurance plans: the Supplemental Pension Plan for Employees of the Québec Construction Industry (1970), the Government and Public Employees Retirement Plan (RREGOP) (1973), the Pension Plan of Management Personnel (PPMP) (1973) and the Fonds de la santé et de la sécurité du travail (1973).
CDPQ initially focused on bonds before entering the Canadian stock market in 1967. It then created its private equity portfolio (1971), investing in Québec companies. Since 1974, it has been managing the largest Canadian equity portfolio in the country.
Between 1975 and 1984, CDPQ adopted new investment guidelines, placing greater emphasis on equity and entering the real estate market. It acquired its first office building and its first shares listed on foreign exchanges (1983). In 1984, it made its first foreign private equity investment. In 1978, another government body, the Fonds d’assurance automobile du Québec, entrusted the Caisse with the management of its funds.
In 1989, CDPQ acquired Ivanhoe Inc., the real estate arm Steinberg’s grocery store chain, consisting mainly of shopping centres, and diversified its real estate portfolio with investments abroad. In 1994, the Caisse began to manage the funds of another government institution, namely, the Retirement Plans Sinking Fund. Total assets under management reached $28 billion CAD in 1986.
In 1996, the Caisse’s Real Estate group was the leading real estate owner in Québec and the second largest in Canada. The following year, legislative changes allowed the Caisse to invest 70% of its portfolio in shares, compared to a maximum of 40% prior to that. Since 2003, the Caisse has received the best short- and long-term credit ratings issued by the major credit rating agencies: Moody's Investors Service (Moody’s), Standard and Poor's (S&P), and Dominion Bond Rating Service (DBRS).
In 2005 and 2006, the Caisse made its first major infrastructure acquisitions by investing in foreign airports. The next year, with partners, it purchased the Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT), owner of the prestigious Château Frontenac in Québec City. In 2007, its results put the Caisse in the first quartile of large Canadian pension funds for the fourth consecutive year.
In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, during which CDPQ lost almost $40 billion CAD in asset-backed commercial paper investments, the Caisse implemented a series of measures to maximize efficiency, focus on core competencies, and strengthen risk management to support its long-term performance.
As of July 2015, CDPQ has 32 depositors and is active on Canadian and international markets. The Caisse holds a diversified portfolio including fixed-income securities, publicly listed shares, real estate investments, and private equity. A shareholder in more than 4,000 companies in Québec, elsewhere in Canada, and around the world, the Caisse is internationally recognized as a leading institutional investor.[3]
2008 loss of $40 billion[edit]
In 2008, CDPQ lost $39.8 billion and generated a minus-26-per-cent return, making it the worst in the Caisse's 43-year history (in 2002, the Caisse had suffered a minus-9.4-per-cent return, its second worst year). The 2008 annual report of the Caisse shows that no bonuses were paid for 2008.[4] The Caisse subsequently undertook a major restructuring. CEO Henri-Paul Rousseau took the lead and negotiated the conversion of the ABCP into long-term bonds, and major players agreed to prevent a forced liquidation that would have resulted in losses of $20 billion CAD.[5] The resulting Montréal Agreement was deemed success and the 2008 loss was almost completely recouped in subsequent years.[6][7]
Creation of CDPQ Infra[edit]
In June 2015, the Québec National Assembly passed Bill 38 "An Act to allow the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec to carry out infrastructure projects". CDPQ thereafter created a new subsidiary dedicated to the development of infrastructure projects, CDPQ Infra. The Quebec government submitted two projects for CDPQ Infra's evaluation: a public transit system to be integrated to the future Champlain bridge, and a public transit system linking downtown Montreal, the Montréal–Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport and the West Island.
On April 22nd, 2016, CDPQ Infra unveiled plans for a new public transportation project, the Réseau électrique métropolitain (REM).[8] As proposed, the REM will link downtown Montréal, the South Shore, the West Island (Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue), the North Shore (Deux-Montagnes) and the airport in a unified, electrically powered and fully automated, 67-km light rail transit (LRT) system.[9] The new network represents an investment of approximately $5.5 billion, of which CDPQ Infra is willing to commit $3 billion as the majority shareholder.[citation needed]
On March 8, 2017, General Electric said it had agreed to sell GE Water for around USD $3.4 billion to Suez SA in France and Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec.[10]
Presidents[edit]

1966-1973 : Claude Prieur
1973-1980 : Marcel Cazavan
1980-1990 : Jean Campeau
1990-1995 : Jean-Claude Delorme et Guy Savard

2002-2008 : Henri-Paul Rousseau
2008-2009 : Richard Guay
2009- : Michael Sabia

Mandate and independence[edit]
In 2005, article 4 of CDPQ's founding statute[11] was amended to make the institution's mandate explicit:

4.1. The mission of the Fund is to receive moneys on deposit as provided by law and manage them with a view to achieving optimal return on capital within the framework of depositors' investment policies while at the same time contributing to Québec's economic development.

In June 2015, the CDPQ statute was further amended to specify that CDPQ "acts with full independence in accordance with this Act." [12]
Organization[edit]
CDPQ's Board of Directors can have up to 15 members, two-thirds of whom must be independent. It is composed of its Chair, the President and CEO, depositor representatives, and independent members. The Board is responsible for establishing CDPQ's main orientations and ensuring that the Caisse operates according to all legislative and regulatory requirements. The position of Chairman of the Board of Directors is separate from that of President and Chief Executive Officer.
The Québec government appoints members of the Board of Directors, upon consultation with the Board. CDPQ’s Board of Directors has defined a profile of expertise and experience required for its independent directors.[13]
The Executive Committee is composed of the President and CEO and the senior officers of CDPQ’s various sectors.
Subsidiaries[edit]
CDPQ has three subsidiaries: Ivanhoé Cambridge, Otéra Capital and CDPQ Infra.
CDPQ Infra works on creating major public infrastructure projects. One of the biggest projects for CDPQ Infra is the Réseau électrique métropolitain (REM) in the Greater Montreal area.
Ivanhoé Cambridge is the real estate subsidiary of the Caisse. The Company aims to invest in real estate assets ranging from office space, shopping centers to multiresidential buildings. Some of the biggest projects for Ivanhoé Cambridge are CIBC Square in Toronto and DUO in Paris.
Otéra Capital is a balance sheet lender in commercial real estate debt in Canada.
The headquarters for each of these subsidiaries are located in Montreal, in the Jacques-Parizeau Building.

The Executive Committee is composed of the President and CEO and the senior officers of CDPQ’s various sectors.
Subsidiaries[edit]
CDPQ has three subsidiaries: Ivanhoé Cambridge, Otéra Capital and CDPQ Infra.
CDPQ Infra works on creating major public infrastructure projects. One of the biggest projects for CDPQ Infra is the Réseau électrique métropolitain (REM) in the Greater Montreal area.
Ivanhoé Cambridge is the real estate subsidiary of the Caisse. The Company aims to invest in real estate assets ranging from office space, shopping centers to multiresidential buildings. Some of the biggest projects for Ivanhoé Cambridge are CIBC Square in Toronto and DUO in Paris.
Otéra Capital is a balance sheet lender in commercial real estate debt in Canada.
The headquarters for each of these subsidiaries are located in Montreal, in the Jacques-Parizeau Building.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
