When we couldnt find the answers she kept testing until we found the best way to treat me. If I need a specialist she always sends me to one of my choice and insurance plan. Her office is professional and very organized. I have been her patient for almost 20 years and have refused to change insurances to any that she doesn't accept. While I filed for Social Security Disability she stood in my corner, provided medical care for ten years with me paying whatever I could afford and finaly convinced the judge before they would approve me. There is no more caring, supportive doctor out there than Dr. DianaMoore Primary CareAllison S. ratedCame in for sore throat which I suspected  was strep since I've had strep several times  over the  years  and I am very familiar  with the pain. This clinic uses students who most often have no clue. The student swabbed my tongue (not throat) and my strep test came back negative. The doctor prescribed me a zpak  for sinusitis  and pharyngitis.  3 days later I'm in the emergency  room with strep throat. I now have the correct antibiotics  as a zpak  will not kill streptococcus. I am in extreme  pain and I feel like this clinic should  do better for its patients.O'Connor Diana DOrickfen ratedDr. O'Conner is a highly professional and competent physician.  The staff is pleasant and courteous as well as efficient.  I have been able to get an appointment within a short length of time which had become all but impossible at my previous doctor's office.  Dr. O'Conner has taken time to listen to my concerns and issues and has never failed to provide appropriate care.  Clearly, I will be a patient here as long as she will have me.Moore Primary Caretiffany.lechus ratedReally great!I have been going there for years with my whole family. They are always great to get us in even without an appointment and everyone on the staff has always been so nice! I hate that bad reviews have been posted because I have never had one complaint in years other than one billing problem which was resolved. You may not see the same doctor every time, but I have never been disappointed. O'Connor Diana DObhedges ratedI enjoy Dr O'Connor, she is a tell it like it is DO.  HOWEVER her front office staff leaves a lot to be desired.   They are abrupt and unfriendly.  Wondering how they would feel if they were going to a doctor or any other professional and they experienced the treatmemt and service they are presenting.   Humm  I doubt they would be back.O'Connor Diana DOBonita C. ratedwe have been seeing DrO for 20+ yrs,we had to change once due to insurance,but returned as soon as we could.  Nothing but praise for this office, employees come and go these days ,but some of her staff have been with ever since I have been seeing her. They have personalities and you may not always mix well,but you will be taken care of.Moore Primary Careclem238 ratedThis is the best place ever ! ...This is the best place ever !   I'm 45 and been to many doctors.  I love the staff and the doctors here.  My whole family has been going there since they opened and will not go anywhere else.  Dr. Carter and his wife are awesome as well as Michelle (she is super nice and helpful anytime I call.  I'd give 10 stars if I could !   O'Connor Diana DOmrsbaker3 ratedWhile her staff has a tendency to be rude, it is worth it once you get past them. Her PA, Rachel Moore, is even better. Dr. O'Connor is an awesome doctor. She is caring. She listens to all my concerns. Takes her time. Explains everything. I would recommend her to any one looking for an excellent primary care physician.Oklahoma Medical Pain ManagementMary W. ratedDr.Jackson is very good.  He listens, talks as if you are an equal and gives good advice.The only problem is his staff doesn't answer the phone, doesn't usually return calls if you leave a message.   It is a big problem, IMO. Sometimes I have a question but can't get an answer.  Otherwise I think Dr. Jackson is great.Family Medicine-OU Physicians Family Medicine Centersexylady1958 ratedFAMILY MEDICINE-OU PHYSICIANS ...FAMILY MEDICINE-OU PHYSICIANS FAMILY MEDICINE CENTER ARE SOME VERY COOL DOCTOR'S AND NURSE'S CAUSE THEY DO TRUELY CARE. CAUSE I GO THERE AS I HAVE MS AND OTHER HEALTH ISSUES AND I'VE ALWAY'S BEEN TREATED WITH RESPECT AND CARE.

These individuals provide diagnoses and treatments for a wide variety of ailments, and preventative care and early detection for more serious illnesses. Whether you love or hate going to the doctor, the fact is your physician is there to listen to your health concerns, take preventative measures against diseases and advise you on your options for staying in tip-top shape.In 2013, there were more than 1 million doctors of medicine in the U.S., over 854,000 of which were active. Additionally, in 2012, there were about 18,000 active general surgeons in the country. It's important to know which type of physician or surgeon you need, how to choose the best one, and account for other considerations in order to stay healthy.Different Types of PhysiciansPatients can choose from a wide variety of physicians depending on doctor specialty and what problems they are experiencing. Here are a few of the most common types of physicians that you may see in your lifetime:General Practitioner
Your GP is the doctor that you go to for regular checkups, vaccines and to identify health issues. GPs can treat many different illnesses and injuries, from the common cold to a broken arm. If your health requires a second opinion or expert care, the GP will refer you to a specialist who has the skills to focus in on the issue.Cardiologist
Heart attacks and heart disease are some of the most common afflictions seen across the country, making cardiologists important to your long-term health. These physicians specialize in studying and treating the heart and related diseases.Dentist
Other than a GP, the dentist is likely the most common physician you'll ever see. These professionals work with the human mouth, ensuring that your teeth and gum health are up to par. Patients typically go to the dentist twice a year.Dermatologist
Dermatologists are focused on skin-related issues and diseases, from skin cancers, to acute acne, eczema, psoriasis, and general cosmetic concerns like aging and scars. Most will also perform annual or semi-annual mole checks to screen for any signs of melanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer.ENT
If you have a number of sinus infections or have had your tonsils taken out, you've likely seen an ENT specialist. ENTs handle ailments related to the ear, nose and throat, often related to taking out tonsils and treating hearing issues.OB/GYN
For many women, their gynecologist and obstetrician are the same person. These professionals work with the female reproductive system to focus on reproductive health, fertility issues, prenatal care, options for new and expectant mothers, neonatal care and childbirth. OB/GYNs can also help in the early detection of breast or cervical cancer.Choosing a PhysicianThere are obviously a number of physicians that you can choose from, but how do you know if they're the best choice for you? Here are a few considerations to help you pick a physician:Look at Your Insurance
Before you get down to the details, you need to verify which doctors are covered by your insurance and whether they are in or out of your carrier's network. Rates may be cheaper if the doc is in network – a doctor can be covered by your insurance but not necessarily in network. Out of network is typically more expensive. Doctors often add and drop plans, so it's important to ensure that your options are compatible with your insurance plan. Doing your homework will help you avoid unexpected expenses. Check for Board Certification
Your physician should be certified through the American Board of Medical Specialties. Doctors must earn a medical degree from a qualified school, complete three to seven years of residency training, be licensed by a state medical board and pass one or more ABMS exams to be certified.Examine the Reviews
Reviews of a doctor can reveal a lot about what your experience may be like. People may grade on staff friendliness, availability and effectiveness of treatment. Looking at these evaluations and getting recommendations from family and friends can direct you toward a physician for your needs.Choosing a SurgeonSurgeons can literally hold your life in their hands, and it's important to find the best one that can put you at ease and treat you effectivelyCompatibility Factor
You need to feel comfortable with your surgeon. It's important to communicate your concerns and that your surgeon can respond adequately. Surgeons should be willing to go over the details of your procedure and answer any questions that you may have. They must take the time to discuss and address your worries.Expertise Level
If you're going in for surgery, you want someone that knows what they're doing and has a high success rate. Ask how often the surgeon performs this surgery and try to find one that regularly does it. This will give you peace of mind that you're in capable hands.Understanding Your InsuranceYour decision on a physician or surgeon can be majorly affected by the insurance plan you have. You may have insurance through employment, your spouse, your parents if you're under 26, or the marketplace if the previous options don't apply to you. It's important to understand how your insurance works to have the full picture of what you'll need to pay for.Your insurance will have a deductible, which is the amount that you're responsible to pay for covered medical expenses. Some plans have coinsurances, where you must pay a certain percentage of the bill, and insurance will cover the rest. Co-pays state a flat rate for certain services, like paying $20 when you visit your GP or a $100 co-pay for an emergency room visit. Once you reach your out-of-pocket maximum, which will differ if you're an individual or within a family plan, your insurance may pay for 100 percent of covered medical expenses for the rest of the plan year.If you plan to go to the doctor, need medication or have been recommended for surgery, call your insurance provider or go online to see what your plan covers. You can choose the best doctor for your needs, understand your options and prevent yourself from being blindsided by medical expenses.Setting Your AppointmentMost doctors require a phone call for an appointment, although some may provide online scheduling as well. Be sure to have your insurance card with you when you set an appointment, and to bring it with you to the actual appointment. They need the ID numbers to verify your coverage, and will usually make a copy of the card for their files so you don't have to show it again unless your insurance changes.When you call, let them know if you're a new patient, as this will require you to complete some paperwork for your first visit. Tell them the reason for your visit, such as your symptoms if you're feeling sick. It's also important to inform them if you have Medicaid and to find out if you need to bring anything to the visit, like current medications or medical records.From here, the receptionist will likely ask what dates and times work best for you. During your call, it's important to be honest about your symptoms and the reason for your visit. This information will help the doctor treat you and give him or her an idea of what to expect. Your appointment may progress faster as a result, and the doctor can come prepared with a list of options to better care for you.RisksDoctors see a number of patients in a day, sometimes in 15-minute increments in areas where the physicians are in high demand. This can leave little time for doctors to perform thorough examinations, and they can end up missing certain problem indicators. While some problems, like a cold or flu, can be diagnosed in this time, more complex ailments require attention, which takes up time. Reviews can illuminate which doctors actively spend the necessary time with their patients and which ones are pressed against the clock to meet demand.Surgery has some more dire risks attached to it, so be sure to talk to your surgeon about the potential issues that can come up as a result of your procedure. If a patient has a reaction to anesthesia, it can cause very serious complications, but this is an uncommon occurrence. Blood clots can be a significant problem after surgery, often caused by inactivity during recovery. Infections, numbness, scarring, swelling and death are all possible, but the likelihood of these issues will vary depending on the type of surgery you're undergoing. Talk to your doctor about your concerns and your risk potential.AftercareSurgery affects people in different ways, but as you begin to emerge from anesthesia, you'll want to alert your nurse to any issues you may have. The nurse will tell you how the procedure went, what effect it will have on your condition, what to expect when you get home and how long it will take to get back to normal. If you start feeling pain, the nurse may give you medication to stop it from getting worse. When possible, it's also advised to move around to avoid blood clots from developing in your legs. This can be as simple as occasionally flexing your knee or rotating your foot. Some surgeries are outpatient procedures, where people are released the same day. For major surgeries, patients may stay at the hospital for a few days to be monitored and address any concerns before being sent home. Discuss with your surgeon the projected length of the hospital stay and what you need to bring.Recovery and Follow-upYour recovery time and follow-up expectations will vary depending on your procedure. For example, you can be expected to be on your feet within a few days of having your wisdom teeth taken out, but it may be weeks before you have fully recovered from a broken foot or heart-valve surgery. Your surgeon will give you a list of things that you'll need to do during this time, including what medications to take and when you'll be able to get back to work and other activities.Every surgery will have a follow-up call or appointment to discuss your recovery and allow you to ask any questions about unusual symptoms or changes in your overall health. If you have a major operation, like heart surgery, it's important to make regular checkups with your doctor or a specialist to ensure that everything is normal. Visiting a doctor will help deter infection and verify that everything is healing as expected. These appointments will give you peace of mind about your state of health and ensure that any issues are caught early on.

                    Bella Donna: Nichelle Nichols
                



Depending on when you were born, you'll recognize Nichelle Nichols as Nana Dawson on Heroes or as Lieutenant Uhura in Star Trek. Today, she's as stunning at age 75 as she was in her youth.
It's hard to overstate what Nichols' portrayal of Uhura meant in pop culture. The show began in 1966, just one year after the passage of the Voting Rights Act. During the first season of Star Trek, Nichols considered leaving the show because she felt her role lacked significance. A conversation with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. changed her mind; a fan of the series, he insisted she was a role model for black women and children everywhere. She stayed on, of course, and was part of a groundbreaking interracial kiss with his royal Shatness. After the show's cancellation, she volunteered with NASA to recruit women and minorities; astronaut Mae Jemison has said that her interest in space exploration was inspired by Nichols and Uhura.
Nichols' look as Uhura was typical of the '60s; black liquid eyeliner and nude lip gloss can help you recreate her look. But pay attention to how she looks today, too. If anyone shows that having a few wrinkles doesn't detract from beauty, it's her.

She's so elegant and pretty funny at the Shatner roast!

My dad had a crush on her too....we are quite a Trekkie-friendly family!

i LOVE her! she was one of the best on the original star trek cast.  and WOW she looks AMAZING! 





kia

9 years
love her!  she was my avatar pic for a while on this side.  one of my heroes.  she wanted to walk away from star trek and mlk jr. himself asked her to stay on the show.  he thought that even though the show was fiction she was an african-american woman and fourth in command of the ship... and that meant a lot as a role model.

Nichelle Nichols is a beautiful woman who has inspired so many of us.  I'm proud to be a fan!  I didn't know she was on Heroes.  I better start tuning in!

Hotness!  I LOVE Nichelle Nichols.  She brought such class to the bridge of the U.S.S. Enterprise.

She was one of my very favorite characters growing up watching Star Trek. Her skin was always glowing, and she seemed the hardest-working of the lot! She's aged not only gracefully and very elegantly, but with the most amazing eyebrows (jealous!).





marcella

She has aged so gracefully!  Just gorgeous!





GiggleSugar

Lordy, was she gorgeous. (And still is stunninig!) I remember as a kid thinking that that little thing she fiddled with in her ear was the height of chic. :nerdgirl:





ChrissyBaby

Fierce!





kahribar

don't watch the new show, but she is a very striking woman!





areidz

I'm glad she went on to do better things.  Star Trek did give her a bad reputation as far as showing what a woman was useful for.  It was a sign of the times.  She's always and still does look beautiful.





bythesea

Such a beautiful woman, then and now! 





Stravs-Firebird

I want to wear gray hair that beautifully when my time comes. She just radiates beauty.

She was always my favorite on Star Trek, I was even inpired to be her a few Holloween's back! I just love the fact that she is back in action on "Heroes" and still looking georgous at 75





mini_pixie

9 years
she is so beautiful!  I love how her hair and skin look so natural!  She isn't going for Barbie and letting herself look like herself.

Aging gracefully is an unsung talent, in my opinion.

LOVED her in Star Trek. My dad had such a crush on her! LOL :P

Why This Makeup Artist Says "Stop Asking Me to Contour Your Face"


If I had a dime for every time some gum-snapping postmillennial with 15 pounds of mineral powder on her skin requested that I "contour her face," I would be a very rich woman.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
