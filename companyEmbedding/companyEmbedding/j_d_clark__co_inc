It All Started with Colloidal Minerals
Tom Clark standing in front the original mine portal.
It didn’t take us long to discover the power of colloidal mineral water. Back in the early 1920’s, a rancher named T.J. Clark suddenly became very ill. A Native American friend led him to a sacred spring, where he drank the water began to feel better almost immediately.  The claim to the original mine has been in the Clark family for almost 100 years!  Read the entire history
Today we are proud to offer our most popular colloidal mineral supplement, passed down from grandfather to grandson (pictured to the right).  Our colloidal minerals are all natural and truly unique.  Each bottle contains up to 72 trace minerals and elements presented in a format only mother nature can deliver.
Over the years our product line has grown to include: vitamins, minerals, amino acids, capsule supplements and many other specialty supplements you won’t find anywhere else.
Wholesale, OEM and Private Label Supplements
Private label supplements on the manufacturing line.
We formulate and manufacture liquid vitamins and minerals in-house. This gives us the ability to meet the demands of many different wholesalers. Private label and OEM product options are also available upon request. Additionally, we can handle custom formulations for companies that don’t have the resources to produce their own supplements.

Product Research and Health Information
In our quest to make better products for our customers, we’ve compiled health and nutrition information about vitamins, minerals, phytochemicals and various diseases. We encourage you to use these free resources to increase your knowledge about health and nutrition.

These claims cause your products to be drugs, as defined in section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Act. Because these products are not generally recognized as safe and effective when used as labeled, they are also new drugs as defined in section 201(p) of the Act. Under section 505 of the Act, a new drug may not be legally marketed in the United States without an approved New Drug Application (NDA).
Furthermore, we found that your web sites at www.tjclarkine.com, www.tjclarkminerals.com, www.tjclarkdirect.com, and www.tjclarkco.com list numerous diseases (e.g., herpes, HIV/AIDS, HPV/cervical cancer) with a link for each disease. By clicking the link for a particular disease, the viewer is directed to a page about the disease. Each of these pages contains links (e.g., "Click Here for the SOLUTION") that lead the viewer to a list of your Life Source product "packages" available for sale on the website. This also causes the Life Source product packages to be drugs because the website implies that these products are the "solution" (i.e., a treatment or cure) for the listed diseases.
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive review of products sold on your Internet web sites or your firm's other products and their labeling. You are responsible for ensuring that all products marketed by your firm are in compliance with applicable United States laws.
We request that you take prompt action to correct these violations. Failure to promptly correct these violations may result in enforcement action being initiated by FDA without further notice. The Act provides for the seizure of illegal products and for injunction against the manufacturer and/or distributor of illegal products.
Please notify this office in writing within fifteen (15) working days of receipt of this letter as to the specific steps you have taken to correct the stated violations, including an explanation of each step being taken to identify and make corrections to assure that similar violations will not recur. If corrective action cannot be completed within 15 working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which the corrections will be implemented. Your reply should be directed to the attention of Ms. Shelly Maifarth, Compliance Officer, Food and Drug Administration at the attached letterhead address.

Sincerely,
/s/
B. Belinda Collins
Director,
Denver District

Welcome to the website of JD Clark Electric, Inc.

I've been an Erie electrician a long time - over 35 years now in northwestern
Pennsylvania, making me a great Erie business guide. That's also long
enough to have the resources and knowledge to complete any
residential, commercial or industrial project, and to specialize in new
installation in Erie, parts of Ohio and New York. I'm very proud of what
we, as a company, have done - becoming a leading provider and
integrator of whole house generators, electrical work, communications,
and insurance approved burglar alarms.
