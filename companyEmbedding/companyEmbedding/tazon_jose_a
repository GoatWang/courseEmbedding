The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

Jose Antonio Tazon





Company: Amadeus IT Group SA, Madrid,   Spain   Entry Submitted by: Clarke Mulder Purdie   Company Description: Amadeus has evolved from the leading  Global Distribution System to leading technology provider to travel buyers,  sellers and providers. As a distributor, Amadeus offers access to 95% of  airline seats, over 240 hotel chains and 27 car rental firms. As a technology  partner, Amadeus is the preferred supplier to many global organisations  including BA, IATA, IBM, Qantas, Star  Alliance, TOTAL and TUI.   Nomination Category: Management Categories   Nomination Sub Category: Best Executive in Europe
Nomination Title: José Antonio Tazón, President and CEO
   1. Tell the story  about what this nominee achieved in the past year (up to 500 words). Focus on  specific accomplishments, and relate these accomplishments to past performance  or industry norms. Be sure to mention obstacles overcome, innovations or  discoveries made, and outcomes:
          José Antonio  Tazón became President and CEO of Amadeus in  1990.  Amadeus has              achieved significant success under his  leadership, including: 
          • becoming the largest Global Distribution System  (GDS) provider in the              world,  breaking into the fiercely competitive American market through the              acquisition  of System One. Its share of the world market has grown every year              since 1999,  currently standing at 31 per cent globally.  
          • expanding Amadeus operations globally in Europe,  South America, the              Far   East, the Middle East, Asia-Pacific and the  US to include  65 operating              companies  across 215 markets.  
          • re-investing revenue to effect a strategic  transformation from a              distributor  of travel to a leading travel technology provider.  Under José,              Amadeus is  the largest Research and Development investor in its sector              according to  the European Commission, devoting €182.2 million in 2005.  
          Under José’s  leadership, Amadeus has enjoyed consistent revenue growth year on              year  achieving 2,683 million euro earnings and revenue growth of 10.9 per cent              in  2006.  José has directed this income into  researching and developing              unrivalled  technology solutions such as Altéa, the first next-generation              Customer  Management Solution for the airline sector in 30 years.  Altéa              centres  airline operations on the customer as opposed to flights, and              integrates  all operations from booking to baggage collection, enabling              superior service together with efficiency  savings.  Airlines around the world,              including  BA, Qantas and Lufthansa now use the system.   Amadeus’ deal with the              Star Alliance,  to implement Altéa as a common IT platform, is the largest IT              deal in the  sector in terms of value.  
          Amadeus  manages more than 370 million transactions a day and processes up to              2.5 million  net bookings per day.  These were logged  through the Erding Data              Centre,  developed by José when he was General Manager and Senior Vice              President of  Operations, which has become the largest civilian data centre in              the  world.  It handles up to 56 million  active passenger name records at any              one time  with an average response time of less than 0.3 seconds. 
          José has  placed Amadeus at the forefront of major industry initiatives.               Amadeus is  IATA’s preferred partner for implementing e-ticketing ahead of the              December  2007 deadline for all airline tickets to be e-tickets.  Amadeus now              has the  largest e-ticket distribution network consisting of over 187 airlines              in 143  markets.  It has also established a  strong e-commerce division (Amadeus              e-Travel),  offering airlines, companies and travel agencies worldwide e-             commerce  solutions.  
          Having  established Amadeus as a leading technology provider to the airline              industry,  José is now driving Amadeus’ diversification into other areas of              travel IT  with the goal for Amadeus to be the number one provider of all              travel IT by  2010.  To support this, Amadeus acquired  Optims, a hospitality              technology  company.  Amadeus’ Hotel Property  Management System is the second              most popular  on the global market, while their Hotel Revenue Management System              is the most  popular.  Amadeus is currently working on  a next generation              platform to  revolutionise hospitality IT.
          José is  proud of Amadeus’ ability to partner closely with companies across the              world which  he attributes to Amadeus’ truly multicultural environment.  It has              7,600  employees from 95 nationalities.   Enjoying 80,000 hours of training              programmes a year keeps employees  motivated, something José believes is key              requirement  for a successful organisation. 
   2. List hyperlinks  to any online news stories, press releases, or other documents that support the  claims made in the section above. IMPORTANT: Begin each link with http://, and  enclose each link in square brackets; for example,  [http://www.youraddress.com]:
          Gallery of  press releases illustrating Amadeus’ continuing business success              through  investment and diversification of technology              http://www.amadeus.com/amadeus/x5088.xml
          Press Kit  explaining more about what Amadeus does, how José’s strategy              combined  with customer satisfaction has led to consistent growth             http://www.amadeus.com/amadeus/documents/corporate/Amadeus%20Press%20Kit%20Q1%202007%20(English).doc
   3. Provide a brief  (up to 100 words) biography about this nominee:
          José has  devoted his career to travel technology.   He began as a               communications software specialist, programming American hotel  systems.  He              joined Iberia  in 1975 as head of maintenance engineering, rising to take on              financial  responsibilities for the company.  He  joined Amadeus in 1987, taking              the company  from its very inception to the position of global dominance it              holds  today.  He has been inducted into the  British Travel Industry’s Hall of              Fame.  In addition, he belongs to the World Travel  and Tourism Council and is              a member of  Exceltur, an alliance for excellence in tourism, since its              formation in  2002.
