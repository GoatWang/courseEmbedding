For his vision and leadership in creating and building a leading global supplier of molybdenum - the Thompson Creek Metals Company - and for his dedicated support of minerals education as a Trustee of the Colorado School of Mines.AIME William Lawrence Saunders Gold Medal in 2005Mr. Mooney is currently the Chief Executive Officer of the Thompson Creek Metals Company, a privately held company which owns and operates two molybdenum mines, the Thompson Creek Mine in central Idaho and the Endako Mine in British Columbia, and Langeloth Metallurgical Company, a metal processing facility in western Pennsylvania. The group of companies now employs over 500 people and is the second leading molybdenum producer in the country. Mr. Mooney began his professional career in 1956, after graduating from the Colorado School of Mines with a degree in Geological Engineering, when he joined the Utah Mining Company (now BHP Minerals).

He retired from Cyprus in 1993 at which time he was President of the Cyprus Copper Company, a division of Cyprus Minerals. He subsequently formed the Thompson Creek Companies. In 1990, he was awarded the Distinguished Achievement Medal by the Colorado School of Mines. He served on the Board of Trustees of that university for two terms and was President of the Board in his second term. He has been a long-time member of the American Institute of Mining and Metallurgical Engineers and is a Director of the American Mining Association. He is a Registered Professional Engineer in Colorado. In 1957, he was on active duty with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Mr. Mooney was born in Denver in 1934 and attended public schools there.

The Amazon.com Textbooks Store




	
Are you tired of paying a small fortune for your textbooks every year? Wouldn’t you rather buy cheap college textbooks and have more money to buy that great pair of skinny jeans, eat out more often instead of heating up a frozen pizza, or just have a little more spending money? When you come to Amazon.com, you can save money by buying cheap new and used textbooks and by renting textbooks for college. You can also trade your used textbooks for an Amazon Gift Card, whether you bought your books from us or not. By being a smart shopper and saving money on textbooks at Amazon.com, you’ll have more cash for the things in life that can’t be learned from a textbook.

The Amazon Textbooks Store allows you to shop online and buy all your textbooks without ever leaving the comfort of your couch. We offer a variety of new, used, rental, and eTextbooks. Don’t worry about selection, we’ve got your textbook needs covered for any subject from biology, chemistry, and nursing to accounting, arts, and engineering. Once you’re finished with your textbooks you can trade them in at Amazon.com and get up to 80% of their value in an Amazon Gift Card.   

Shop the Amazon Textbooks Store and save up to 90% on textbook rentals, up to 90% on used textbooks, and up to 50% on new textbooks. You can also enjoy Free Two-Day Shipping on millions of items, including cheap college textbooks, when you join Prime Student. Get your textbooks delivered to your door and save both time and money by shopping at Amazon.com. So go ahead and treat yourself to that designer purse or new video game, you can since you’ve saved so much on your textbooks.
