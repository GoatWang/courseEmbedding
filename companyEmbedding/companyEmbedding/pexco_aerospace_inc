TransDigm to Acquire the Aerospace Business of Pexco LLC

Apr 30, 2015, 18:30 ET
		  		  						
						 from   TransDigm Group 











 
















































 

 




















 




CLEVELAND, April 30, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- TransDigm Group Incorporated (NYSE:   TDG), announced today that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the assets of the aerospace business of Pexco LLC ("Pexco Aerospace"), a portfolio company of Odyssey Investment Partners, LLC, for approximately $496 million in cash. The purchase price includes approximately $160 million of tax benefits to be realized by TransDigm over a 15 year period beginning in 2015. TransDigm expects to finance the acquisition primarily through a combination of cash on hand, existing availability under our revolving credit facility and new debt.


Pexco Aerospace is a global leader in the manufacturing of extruded plastic interior parts for use in the commercial aerospace industry. A vast majority of revenues are sole source, the majority is proprietary and nearly all revenue comes from the commercial transport market. The business employs approximately 300 people in two locations in Yakima, Washington and Huntington Beach, California.  
W. Nicholas Howley, Chairman and CEO of TransDigm Group Incorporated, stated, "Pexco Aerospace is a leading proprietary aerospace manufacturer with attractive positions on all active Boeing platforms and a significant and growing commercial aftermarket. The commercial aftermarket is currently approaching 35% of revenue but we expect that percentage to grow to close to 60% over the next five years as the Boeing 787 and Boeing Sky Interior of 737 become an increasing share of the installed fleet. These products fit well with our overall business strategy." 
Baker Hostetler represented TransDigm Group and Latham & Watkins represented Pexco Aerospace. Harris Williams & Co served as exclusive advisor to Pexco Aerospace.

History




The History of Pexco
From Extrusion to Custom Plastics
The US-based specialty plastic products company today known as Pexco LLC was conceived more than 45 years ago by American Filtrona Corporation of Richmond, Virginia.  In 1970 fiber extruder American Filtrona (today Essentra plc) diversified into plastics manufacturing by acquiring Southern Plastics of Columbia, South Carolina.  American Filtrona over the years accumulated additional specialty plastic extrusion businesses throughout North America.  As the company grew, it came to serve a broad variety of markets and advance its plastic manufacturing processes.  It also underwent organizational ownership and name changes.  The company name was changed in 1997 to Bunzl Extrusions Inc., in 2005 to Filtrona Extrusions Inc., and in 2009 to Pexco LLC, an investment of Saw Mill Capital Partners.  On August 9th, 2012, Pexco was acquired by Odyssey Investment Partners, LLC from Saw Mill Capital.Today, Pexco is based north of Atlanta, Georgia with several manufacturing plants across the United States and Mexico, offering a full range of plastics design, engineering and fabrication services.  It operates eight Class 7 & Class 8 medical clean rooms and meets the requirements of ISO 9001:2008; ISO 13485; 21 CFR 820; GMP; AS9100C; ITAR and other registrations and/or certifications for its manufacturing operations.  Pexco is a North American leader in the design and fabrication of specialty plastic products.  It provides standard and custom parts and finished assemblies to manufacturers and end-users across medical, defense, industrial, and commercial market applications.
