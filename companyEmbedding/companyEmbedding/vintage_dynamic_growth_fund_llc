Vintage Year

What is the 'Vintage Year'
The vintage year is the year in which the first influx of investment capital is delivered to a project or company. This marks when capital is contributed by venture capital, a private equity fund or a partnership drawing down from its investors. Investors can use the vintage year of an investment to further explain its returns.

      
BREAKING DOWN 'Vintage Year'
      Having a vintage year occur at the peak or bottom of a business cycle can affect the later returns on the initial investment as the company may have been overvalued or undervalued at the time. The vintage year provides information in regards to when a small business initially received its first investment capital. This can include capital from a variety of sources, so is not restricted in regards to the origin of the funds. The vintage year helps determine the nature of the business cycle in which the company entered.Vintage Years for ComparisonBy observing the trends among other companies with the same vintage year, an overall pattern can be potentially identified to gain an overview of economic sentiment at a particular time. If particular vintage years perform better than other vintage years, this information may be extrapolated to predict the performance of other companies within the higher performance vintage year.For example, 2014 may be considered a strong vintage year in regards to crowdfunding platforms, such as GoFundMe, as they were marked by high growth. Regulations on the industry are generally considered appropriate, suggesting the future growth of these companies will not be hindered for the time being.Impact of Business CyclesMost businesses experience economic shifts as a regular part of doing business. This can include seasonal fluctuations experienced by certain business, such as the increase in retail sales during the holiday season or an increase in lawn care product sales in warmer months, as well as other cycles based on the occurrence of certain events such as major product releases.The business cycle is said to progress systematically through four phases: the upturn, the peak, the decline and the recovery. During the upturn and up to the peak, the value of the company is seen to increase. During the decline until the start of recovery, the value is seen as falling.The point in the cycle the business resided in during the vintage year may skew the appearance of the company’s true value, leaving room for analysis prior to making investment decisions. During peaks in the market, new companies are more likely to be overvalued based on the current economic outlook. This increases the expectations on an investment's return because more money is initially contributed. Inversely, companies are typically undervalued during low points in the market; because less capital is initially contributed, these companies or projects have less pressure to generate big returns.

Nuveen Covered Call Closed-End Funds 
For income-oriented investors who are seeking the growth and diversification potential of equities, but who desire higher income and reduced volatility, covered call closed-end funds (also known as equity option closed-end funds) can be an attractive diversifying portfolio opportunity.



Covered Call Strategies for Today's Income Investors 
Nuveen's covered call closed-end funds have been designed to meet the income, risk, and diversification needs of income-oriented investors. Combining a traditional equity portfolio strategy of persistently selling covered calls, then monetizing the long-term expected total returns into quarterly cash distributions, results in the strong potential for a diversifying, higher-yielding and more stable investment.

What are covered call strategies?
							Covered call strategy funds invest in a portfolio of stocks, and sell call options on either individual stocks or stock indices, for the purpose of enhancing total return, reducing volatility, and providing a measure of downside protection over time.  The fund receives a premium from the buyer of the call option, and must sell or deliver the underlying stock (or cash, in the case of a stock index call option) if the call option is exercised by the buyer.  The value of the stocks that are linked to call options sold, relative to the value of full stock portfolio, is termed the Option Overwrite percentage.

MANEUVER IN MARKETSSM

Diversify a portfolio with long-term and timely strategies
Consider these ideas to discuss with your advisor.





Changing interest rates call for active fixed-income strategies.

Being smart about taxes can enhance current income.


 A BROADLY DIVERSIFIED APPROACH

Putnam Tax Exempt Income Fund



 A HIGHER INCOME APPROACH
Consider a fund that seeks high current income exempt from federal income tax by investing in lower-rated municipal bonds.

Putnam Tax-Free High Yield Fund



 A DEEPER DIVE
LOGIN TO PUTNAM ADVISOR SITE REQUIRED
Compare 50 states to see after-tax returns of municipal bonds.
Try a calculator to compare CDs and municipal bonds’ after tax returns.

The U.S. economy may be poised for stronger growth.

 A DIVIDEND POWER APPROACH
Favor a strategy for stocks that harnesses the power of dividends.

Putnam Equity Income Fund



 A DEEPER DIVE
LOGIN TO PUTNAM ADVISOR SITE REQUIRED
See an infographic that shows why staying invested in stocks for long-term growth has rewarded investors.





Consider these portfolio ideas in the context of Putnam’s investment insights.


PUTNAM PERSPECTIVES

Value benefits from an expanding economy
Value stocks have lagged the market in 2017, but if the economy continues to expand, rates rise, and the yield curve steepens, this trend could reverse.


ECONOMIC UPDATES AND MARKET OUTLOOKS

Currency: Don't look to the dollar for leadership
The U.S. dollar outlook continues to be most heavily influenced by the Fed, as expectations for fiscal policy have been pushed beyond the investment horizon.

Volatility meter

A fund’s volatility is determined using a statistical measure called “standard deviation". Standard deviation measures the amount of variability of returns that has historically occurred relative to the average return. The higher the standard deviation of a fund, the greater the range of returns it has experienced in the past. Other types of risk, both measurable and non-measurable, exist. In addition, just as historical performance may not be indicative of future returns, a fund’s historical volatility may not be indicative of its future volatility.
