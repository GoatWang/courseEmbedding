                                                    Review on Meramec Valley Bank



I wish I would have never heard of Meramec Valley Bank and used a bank of higher quality and more honor. Jim Jones is a vindictive person. I recommend you stay away from this "bank"

DO NOT USE THIS BANK.  I took out a CD and got the contract, but Providence reneged on the contract and did not compensate me for their early retirement as they would charge me if I were to withdraw.

      SAFE & SOUND® STAR RATINGS™
    EDWARD JONES TRUST COMPANYSAINT LOUIS, Missouri 63131STAR RATING: 5
    Predictive Indicator
    neutral
    As of
    
        March 31,
      2016
    Federal Reserve System Identifier 3529315HOLDING COMPANY INFORMATION(Based on data from the previous quarter.)This bank is not owned by a holding company.INTRODUCTIONU.S. commercial banks are chartered under either federal or state jurisdiction for the purposes of accepting funds for deposit and extending loans to either individual or business borrowers. Banks are subject to credit, interest rate, and operational risk, and, because of both their public purpose and their importance to the nation’s economy, banks become the object of intense regulatory scrutiny.U.S. thrift institutions are chartered under either federal or state jurisdiction for the primary purpose of  utilizing deposited funds to issue loans secured by real estate.  Currently, real estate-backed loans account for approximately 42% of total thrift industry assets, and one-to-four family residential mortgages comprise nearly 59% of the industry’s real estate loan portfolio. Thrift institutions are subject to credit, interest rate, and operational risk, and, during the last twenty years, thrifts have made great strides toward reducing historic mismatches between asset and liability maturities.
        The Bankrate proprietary commercial bank rating model analyzes capitalization,
        asset quality, earnings, and liquidity and produces composite and component
        "Star" ratings that can be used as a measure of the rated entity's financial
        safety and soundness. Additionally, early warning components of the model
        highlight operating characteristics of immediate concern and recommended
        follow-up actions. "The analyses are not adjusted for TARP funding and those
        institutions receiving funds may receive ratings that would differ were the
        TARP funds adjusted out of the analyses. You can check whether or not this
        institution has received TARP funding and whether or not they have paid it
        back at http://projects.propublica.org/bailout/list/index."

            Early warning indicators identify areas of potential concern, which may lead to financial deterioration and thus, require inquiry or in-depth investigation.
            For this bank we have noted:
          Net Interest MarginOverheadInstitution CommentaryOVERVIEW of InstitutionEDWARD JONES TRUST COMPANY, which, as of
        
            March 31,
          2016,
        reported $63.935 million in total assets.
        At that date, loans and deposits held by the bank amounted to
        $0 thousand and $500 thousand,
        respectively. The bank's
        
            March 31,
          2016
        equity base of $56.568 million produced an Equity/Assets ratio of
        88.48%, as of that date.
      COMPOSITE SUMMARY
        Bankrate believes that, as of
        
            March 31,
          2016,
        this bank exhibited a superior condition, characterized by
        approximately normal overall, sustainable profitability,
        a very high measure of asset quality,
        very strong capitalization and
        ample liquidity.
      EARNINGS ANALYSIS
        For the twelve months ended
        
            March 31,
          2016,
        the bank recorded net income
        of $6.628 million. The bank experienced a return on average assets (ROA) of
        11.42% over the latest four quarters. Year earlier
        twelve month results amounted to a net income
        of $6.365 million, or a
        12.37%
        ROA over the most recent four quarters at that time. An ROA of at least 1.0% is deemed satisfactory in accordance with banking
        industry standards, and the industry's annualized ROA for the twelve months
        of 2016 was approximately 0.95% for commercial banks
        and 1.25% for thrift institutions.
      
        We have concluded that for the four quarters ending
        
            March 31,
          2016,
        the bank achieved a good
        return on equity.
        We deem net interest margin to have been substantially below average, and the reported percentage should cause inquiry into balance sheet composition, asset yields, and liability costs.
        Noninterest income was solid.
        We also observed overhead ratios that were significantly higher than average, and the composition of overhead should be thoroughly analyzed.
        Importantly, net interest margins, noninterest income components, and overhead expense levels
        represent operating factors that combine to impact overall operating results.
        ASSET QUALITY ANALYSIS
        The bank revealed, as previously stated, a very high measure of
        asset quality. Our conclusion with respect to asset quality incorporates our analysis
        of data depicting regional economic conditions as well as our computations of
        a relatively low
            March 31,
          2016 nonperforming asset ratio,
        much better than normal
        reserve coverage for nonperforming loans; and
        apparently acceptable quality, or no greater than average,
        holdings of commercial real estate and construction loans, two categories
        that can intensify credit risk.
        
          Other asset categories, such as farm and consumer loans, which may carry
          more than usual default potential, should not have a substantial negative impact
          upon future results.
        Loan yield can measure financial reward versus credit risk. Excessive loan yield may be an
        indicator of existing or future problems. Our loan review indicates that the bank has assumed a
        seemingly prudent position between credit risk and financial reward.
        CAPITAL ANALYSIS
        For the one year period ended
        
            March 31,
          2016, the bank reported
        a better than normal rate of growth in equity capital.
        Balance sheet structural changes, through the one year period of time ended
        
            March 31,
          2016, have
        highly improved
        the bank's capital position. Our analytical methodology does take into account the quantity,
        quality, and durability of net worth, and, as set forth above, we have determined, based upon
        our series of tests, that the bank demonstrates
        very strong
        capitalization. We have calculated the bank's
        
            March 31,
          2016
        Total Risk-Based Capital position, a computation used by industry regulators, and have concluded
        that this bank substantially exceeded
        the requirement, set by regulation, for this test.
        LIQUIDITY ANALYSIS
        As of
        
            March 31,
          2016, the bank displayed
        Much Better Than Normal
        balance sheet liquidity and a
        No Greater Than Average Dependence
        upon wholesale, or non-core liabilities, which include all borrowings, such as Federal Home
        Loan Bank Advances, and CD's greater than $250,000.
        
        Accounting principles require some securities to be categorized as "Available-for-Sale."
        Changes in market value of these securities are reflected through the GAAP (Generally
        Accepted Accounting Principles) net worth of the institution. Based upon the bank's
        present balance sheet, changes in the value of the current level of securities reported
        as "Available-for-Sale"
        might not have a substantial impact
        upon future net worth of the bank.
      INSTITUTION SUMMARY
        This bank has been rated
        superior.
      
          Positive factors that impacted that rating follow:Asset QualityCapitalizationLiquidity
          As noted previously, early warning indicators, possibly requiring specific
          investigation include:
        Net Interest MarginOverheadPREDICTIVE INDICATOR
        As stated, we have determined a composite Star rating for this bank of
        
            5
            
        , indicative of a
        superior
        financial condition. At times, financial conditions of banks change rapidly and significantly.
        Hence, our Safe & Sound Star ratings should not be deemed predictive of likely future ratings.
        However, in view of early warning indicators set forth within this report, in combination with
        the institution's financial data, we believe that the Star rating for this institution is
        
            unlikely to change
          
        within the ensuing twelve month period.

                                    What Does It Mean to Be FDIC Insured?
                                     


How Do Banks Work?
By: John Kiernan, Personal Finance Editor
													The manner in which banks operate might seem like a rather basic topic, but given how complex financial markets have become in recent years, it’s helpful to revisit the fundamental simplicity of the industry.

Having money exactly when you need to it—and earning income on it when you don’t—is a problem as old as money itself. Banks exist to solve that problem, and have served as an intermediary between savers and borrowers since the Italian Renaissance, the Crusades, or even earlier, depending on which historians you consult.

More specifically, banks lend the funds deposited into savings accounts and certificates of deposit (CDs) to other customers, who repay the money with interest over time. Depositors entrust their money to banks for two reasons: 1) banks offer safe-keeping, borne from FDIC insurance; and 2) banks pay interest on deposits, allowing funds to grow over time. Banks, in turn, make money, by charging a higher rate of interest on their loans than what they pay on deposits. Banks can have other sources of revenue as well, including investments, fees on various services, and commissions on the sale of financial products such as mutual funds and insurance.

In addition to serving as a vector for borrowing and lending, banks play a central role in a number of other financial mechanisms. For example, banks process payments between buyers and sellers and they exchange foreign currencies. Banks also carry out governmental monetary policy by increasing or decreasing the amount of money they keep in reserve.
											

How Do I Choose a Bank?
By: Odysseas Papadimitriou, WalletHub CEO
													When it comes to selecting a bank, the options can be overwhelming. In past generations, it was common to choose whichever institution was to your home or office, or to be lured in by special prizes such as a free toaster. These days, you might just as easily do business with a bank that’s located across the country or with an online-only bank that has no branch offices at all. Special offers also are less likely to be small kitchen appliances and more likely to be perks such as free checking, introductory interest rates, or a lump of cash to jumpstart your savings account.

But before you jump on the bank with the biggest name or the flashiest offers, take some time to identify how you’re most likely to use your account and which features are most important to you.

Do you need a brick-and-mortar location? You may find yourself in need of a safe-deposit box. Or if questions arise, you may be the kind of person who is most comfortable with face-to-face communication. If you need access to a real building staffed by live people, prioritize your bank’s location and hours.

Bankers’ hours are notoriously short, and if your workday overlaps them completely, you might want to choose a bank that’s close to your office rather than your home, so that you can slip in at lunchtime. Or you might want to look for a bank with better hours.

Are you a technophile? You may find access to better interest rates and fee structures by opting for an online-only bank or bank account. By the same token, you may be able to minimize fees by opting for paperless statements, keeping tabs on your account balance electronically, and using mobile apps to locate ATMs that are within your network.

These are great opportunities, and you should take advantage of banks that offer them…if you are likely to use them. If your inbox is full of unread email notifications and your phone is loaded with unused apps, it helps to be realistic. Read through the fine print, understand the fees and penalties, and decide whether they work for your lifestyle.

Do you travel abroad extensively? International financial transactions have never been easier or less labor-intensive. And while most banks charge special fees for international debit card transactions and ATM withdrawals, others have been able to pass the savings along to their customers.

If you’re a frequent international traveler, it definitely pays to open one of the various no foreign transaction fee credit cards that are on the market.  Not only will this enable you to avoid the industry-standard 3% international surcharge, but you’ll also save a lot of money on currency conversion since Visa and Mastercard offer much better rates than bank branches or airport kiosks.  You should also look into getting a checking account that charges for neither international debit card use, nor foreign ATM withdrawals.

Is a sense of responsibility to the community important to you when it comes to banking? Since the global financial crisis of 2008, the reputation of many banks has suffered a black eye. But the banking industry is not a monolithic entity. Many consumers who are concerned about issues like local development, fair lending, and executive salaries have turned to small community and cooperative banks as well as credit unions for their banking needs.

These institutions may be less likely to offer all the bells and whistles of their larger cousins, but their mission is to provide the immediate community with the best products and services possible.  They’re worth a look at the very least.
											

What Does It Mean to Be FDIC Insured?
By: John Kiernan, Personal Finance Editor
													If your bank is FDIC insured, any money you put into a deposit account, along with any earned interest, will be returned to you, even if your bank fails. There are limits, of course. Insurance coverage tops out at $250,000 per depositor, per institution—not per account, as some people assume. That means if you have $125,000 in a money market account and another $125,000 in a CD at the same bank, you’ll want to open a new account at a different bank before depositing any more money in order to make everything is insured.

It’s important to note that FDIC insurance covers deposit accounts only, that is, checking, savings, CDs, and money market accounts. Other investment vehicles that banks sometimes provide, such as annuities, life insurance, and mutual funds (including money market funds), are not insured.

Most banks and thrifts (also known as savings and loan institutions), are FDIC insured, but a few are not. By law, those that are must display the FDIC logo prominently on the bank premises and in written materials. If you don’t see the logo, or if you have any doubts, ask about coverage. Credit unions are not covered by the FDIC, but they do have an insurance program of their own, sponsored by the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA).  As is the case with banks, this provides coverage for up to $250,000 per depositor, per institution.

The FDIC, which stands for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, was founded by the U.S. government in 1933 in response to the widespread bank failures of the Great Depression. FDIC insurance is deemed necessary because bank failures can initiate a devastating domino effect involving consumers, commerce, other banks, and the overall economy. And one of the hard lessons of the 1920s and 1930s was that even healthy banks can fail when skittish customers withdraw all their deposits en masse. Deposit insurance gives depositors the assurance necessary to keep their money in the bank, even in the face of frightening economic and financial news. In that way, it protects not only the consumer, but also the banks and the economy.

Depending on your needs for a checking account, like direct deposit or checks, I suggest letting your credit cool off and open what's called a simple card account. It does require proof of identity, no fees, allows direct deposit, and is a Visa cash, not credit card.Also, I'd suggest talking to a credit union about an account, because their systems run checks - it is not the same as a traditional bank check system.

I've been in same position and resorted to doing a title loan, but not your usual one. Look into a company called New Deal. They provide title loans assistance but, the % is wal less and since collateral is involved, they'll be more willing. It goes on credit as a loan, and also helps improve your credit score with each on time payment

Walmart had something called bluebird checking and you get a debit card also. There are NO Fees. You cannot get overdrafts like I have at Wells Fargo and Chase when I specifically wrote and told them no on overdrafting. I would deposit the money before opening the next business day but those monster banks were so greedy making it like they did me a favor charging me 34.00 and usually for less than 34.00 over and I had the money in by the next business day. Also Amex Serve charges very little depending on your habits and which plan you select. As another mentioned, credit unions are another good place to call and nowadays are more lax on who can open accounts. Go to the social worker at the hospital and see if he/she can help. They sometimes have extended payment plans, partial forgiveness, low interest, etc. for such things. The billing office probably won't help you so if the are bothering you tell them you are working with the social worker to get it paid. I don't know if you qualify for Medicaid within 3 mo of the illness but health and human resources in your state would be able to help you then. But you would have to have very low income and less than 2,000 in resources not counting your house or car. There are other agencies in your city/county that may also help. One place to call is 211.… read more

...and so there is this checking acc. from Wells Fargo called "Everyday Checking".Here is how it works: You open an account that consists of a Savings Acc. with some minimal starting amount (in my case opening was $100) and a checking acc.with lets say $4600 for total of $4700.This type of Acc. "Everyday Checking", comes with a $10 Monthly Service Fee, which one of the ways that could be waved is to maintain a minimum of $1500.Now as part of this checking/savings acc. is a scam called "Save As You Go". That means that every time you make some electronic transaction (like paying a bill), usually $1, $2, $3 or more dollars, (depending on the amount of the transaction), will be transferred from your checking part of the acc. to the Saving acc.The idea is that YOU are to stupid to manage and save your own money, so Wells Fargo will do it for you by moving a dollar or two of your own money from your checking to your savings.As a result of this scam, you can find yourself in a position where you have, lets say, $400 in your Savings acc., and $1600 in your checking, for a total of $2000.So, lets assume You make a "bill pay" to your Cable Co. of $100, that leaves a balance in your checking acc. of $1500, and your So called "Save As You Go"savings acc., still has the $400 for a total of $1900.Here is the kicker, remember, You checking had $1600, you paid the cable co. $100, you have left $1500, but because Well Fargo moved $1 dollar to your savings, your Savings amount became $401, and your checking $1499.At $1499 in your checking, you are below the $1500 and therefore you are subject to a $10 Monthly Service Fee, even though you still have $401 in your savings.now, I am sure that those very young, smart, highly educated people in the wells fargo boardroom, get a lot of money paid to find ways that will boost the Bank's profits, but ultimately, a "Pig with a Lipstick, is still a pig".It should be obvious by now that my issue is not the $10.I could close my acc. and make sure that these will be the first, the last and the only $10 wells Fargo will ever take from me (very inexpensive insurance policy against wells Fargo ever taking another penny out of me). I still think is a scam, is designed to exploit the poor and I will forward my thoughts and your response to the local news (starting with Michael Turko of the Turko Files Ch. 9 - KUSI News - San Diego, CA), and follow with Huffington Post and let the public decide with their comments whether my point is valid or not.… read more

You've totaly misread the 3 ways to avoid the $10.00 fee. First off, if you DO the savings, that alone automatically waives the $10.00 checking fee. 2nd is if you use your debit card 10x, and Wells Fargo is very upfront, in fact, around 1pm, they post pending transactions that come in that night! So, at 2pm your balance could be -$90.00 and you can cover it before they post that night! NO other bank lets you know what's coming through, as that's money directly out of their pocket! 3rd is to simply have a measly $500.00 in direct deposits for the month, and this includes direct deposits from square and cash.me/scotttampa . Also, they are up front about these too! You have 24-7 access next to each option, it shows how many debit card purchases you have ( I just run 10 $1.00 charges through square) and also shows your total direct deposits, and one month I came up short and guess what! They didn't charge the $10.00... they said "as a valued customer we've noticed you came close this month so we'll waive the $10.00 but please keep an eye on your numbers and make sure one of the options is completed each month.So, You are WAY off base. Also, I created this account on their website in 5 minutes with only a $25.00 initial deposit! Received a debit card and signature card to sign and mail back within 4 days. BEST BANK I'VE EVER BANKED WITH, as they don't HIDE THINGS.Scott McClellanTampa, Florida… read more

Credit Union of the Rockies used to be a good institution, but it seems they have lost all customer service. I had been with them for 15+years. We had financed a car and our home and had a standing line of credit. We maintained a healthy balance in our accounts and were never late on a payment (actually we always paid our loans off early. Anyway, we were buying a condo as an investment and needed a mortgage for about 25% of the property (we were bringing a 75% down-payment to the table). Credit Unions of the Rockies uses a mortgage broker, we applied and the service we received was appalling: Keith Schnell, theLoan Officer with CU Members Mortgage was very slow to communicate and even though we applied 6 weeks prior to the closing, he was still messing around two days before closing. We ended up taking a short term loan from another source and closing without the loan from the Credit Union of the Rockies. The poor performance of Mr. Schnell and CUR costs us time, an $400 appraisal and put our $5,000 earnest money at risk. I have had almost no follow up from the CUR even though I left messages and send a letter when closing our accounts. I can not recommend Credit Union of the Rockies or Credit Union Members Mortgage.… read more

I recently discontinued my account with this bank for several reasons. I was with TD Bank since them being Commerce Bank. I truly enjoyed the fact that they were open 7 days a week and had longer working hours then other banks. The customer service was excellent and I had no issues with them. A bout 2 years after them becoming TD Bank I started to notice several fees being charged to my account. And even more overdraft fees when I specifically called them and took that option off of my account so that I would never overdraft it. The customer service was horrible. This became such a problem that I ended up having hundreds of dollars in overdraft fees. I am planing on taking this matter to court because of the fact that they are liars and I feel that they do that just to take money from you.… read more

Ally use to be good. But sadly this is no longer the case. They have raised fees. Put $10 cap on ATM fee reimbursement. They also are scandalous in there system. Debits are applied before credits which means if you have low balance and have a bill on auto pay and you put money in your account the same day, the bill is paid first and you are charged an overdraft fee which is now $25 a hit. You get 1 overdraft fee reimbursement for the Lifetime of the account. Not monthly or annually LIFETIME OF THE ACCOUNT. worst of all is there TERRIBLE Customer service which btw is only 24/7 phone or email now. All the things that made Ally great are now gone. Best to look else where for your online banking needs.… read more

I have been using the Washington Federal bank for maybe three years now,and it seems to me that they are one of those banks that wants to keep your money if you put it in their bank. There was an instance when I was trying to withdraw my money and got to the bank 10 minutes early before they would stop letting people withdraw their money or transfer it. Because of the long lines, I ended up having to wait 12 minutes, and so I was 2 minutes late. The women inside refused to give me money, and i did not have any money for the weekend. I called her supervisor and it was resolved, but it should not have happened in the first place. it was horrible ,and I am not too fond of them anymore. Watch out with this bank, they will try to keep YOUR money.… read more

I have a fixed mortgage of 5.5% with Weber state Credit Union. Back in June, I applied for re-financing with the same lender. I was approved for a rate of 3.25%. Closing was supposed to take place at end of August, but it did not because the bank made an error on some house paperwork that is invalid. They now have to go through the process of removing the error, but I have to continue to pay a higher interest on my mortgage - not to any fault of my own.

I immediately switched over to Bashas Associates Federal Credit Union after being with Bank of America for five years. I wanted to be with a bank that hand superb customer service and treated customers fairly. I have overall been happy with the services I have received and the 24/7 support I have gotten abroad and domestically. There have been several situations in which my bank account had been compromised and needed assistance with Bashas. Although they weren't as quick to respond as BofA would be, they still worked hard to send me new cards and secure my account without too much of a hassle.

They offer certain benefits to the checking account that I truly appreciate such as no International withdrawal fees. The customer service is excellent whenever I've had to call for various reasons. The saving account interest rate is not great like all the other banks but when I initially sign up they had the highest rate I keep hoping it will go back up.

I have been a Wells Fargo customer for over 15 years. Whenever I call or visit Wells Fargo, the customer service is usually very good. The agent is very respectful and appreciative and handles queries as best as s/he can. Recently, I accidentally left my card in the ATM machine at my local branch. When I called the bank about it, they informed me that the ATM will automatically shred the card if I do not take it out of the machine. They went ahead and arranged for a new one to be sent to my address. In the meantime, they told me to visit a local branch, and an agent could issue me a temporary card connected to my account. I visited a branch later that day, and was issued a card within five minutes. I was quite impressed with the efficiency and speed. I had been so annoyed with myself, thinking about how inconvenient my "card-less" existence would be for the next week. In the end, Wells Fargo made this inconvenience as hassle-free as possible, which I did really appreciate.… read more

I chose them because they were close to my home and they had a student specialty program so I wouldn't need a specific amount of dollars in my bank account. A td bank atm was even in my college as well, providing extra convenience. I love that they allow you to take their pens. The feel and atmosphere of the bank was nice. They always allow you to get free items such as candy or hand sanitizers. Every experience with them has gone smoothly.

I can’t say enough great things about having USAA as a bank. Their overall fees are very low, and they reimburse you for a certain amount of ATM withdrawl fees each month.

I thought that I would have to co-sign for him,but that was not to be. I have 4 accounts with MFCU,a savings,a Christmas club account,and two checking accounts.

Bank of America has been my bank for many years. Once there was an incident where my account had been comprised ( by someone nameless ). I went into the bank to resolve it. Honestly I was surprised and relieved at how this was handled. One account had to be closed, a new one opened; easy and painless. So many pleasing attributes in my opinion, not to mention ease of use, banking online, bill pay, chat, and the list goes on. The thing I enjoy most about my bank is I'm able to transfer funds easily to family members and vise versa. Oh did I mention some overdraft fees have been refunded as a courtesy. I can go on and go.

I recently opened checking and savings accounts with USAA. I am extremely pleased with them so far. I had been very happy with the same national bank for close to 20 years, but when a couple of problems arose with them, things went south for me very quickly. I chose USAA because I use the company for my auto and homeowner's insurance,All the services (insurance, banking services, etc.) USAA offered are centered around veterans and our specific needs. I've had nothing but positive experiences with their insurance services, and I can honestly also say the same about my experiences to date with their checking and savings products. I pay no monthly fees; the accounts have no minimum balance, and they extend the same excellent service in their banking division as they do for their insurance policies.The only downside is that you either have to be a veteran or related to one to join. If you are eligible, however, I strongly encourage you to join.… read more

I bank with Navy Federal Credit Union. I have been with them for over 25 years now. When I retired from the Navy out here in San Diego,I was given a lump sum of cash. The first place I went to was NFCU. I was very lucky to pick them as my choice for all of my financial needs. Over the years I can count on one hand how many times that I had a dispute with them. And every time,EVERY time,that I questioned something,they always had an answer for me. The customer service is excellent!! The auto rate loans (I have had 4) are also one of the lowest that you will find out here in san diego. I am a father of 6 and all my kids are with NFCU also. Before you decide on where to put your hard earned money,my suggestion is to give NFCU a call.… read more

A few years ago I totaled my car just a week after paying it off. I was very upset; especially since it was the other person's fault. They ran a stop sign and hit me right on the driver's side door. The car spun several times and I found myself trapped inside. After the accident I could see the other driver and his friends moving his car to make it look like it was my fault. They then tried to move my car with me inside, instead of trying to help me get out. The entire experience was dreadful and the other driver's insurance company refused to pay because of the way the cars had been set up. USAA, however, believed me when I told them what happened. They got me a rental car that very day and I had money to buy a new car with a couple of days. I also got more than I was expecting. Banking, insurance, and savings with USAA is always a good experience!… read more

I have recently had a very frustrating experience with BB&T bank. I applied for a checking account and they said that they would not approve me. They would not give me a reason why or any other information regarding the matter. They would only say that I was not approved for a checking account. I've never had such an experience in my life!

I bank with Webster Bank and have for over 20 years. I am extremely happy with their service and user friendly app and website. I have always felt that my information was secure and my money was in safe hands. I must say I am a person who often misplaces my cards. I am always embarrassed to make the call, once again that I have misplaced my card. They help me as if it was my first time each and every time. Never making me feel embarrassed or insecure even though they can clearly see this has not been my first loss. My children also have opened accounts through them, and their child friendly program is the best!… read more

My bank Is US Bank. A bit like heirlooms, US Bank has been passed down and always used by my family. Recently, i opened a checking account upon my 18th birthday. When signing up at my branch they put a student indicator on my account saying the $8.95 maintenance fee would be waived. For one reason or another it was for about two months then this month it wasn't refunded. I called customer service and they switched me over to a "Easy Student" account which did cost $2 but is waived by online statements. If you ever have an Issue their customer service is top notch and they try hard to help you. Bonus for some: customer service is based in the US so it's all native speakers from here. That personally doesn't matter to me but for older people or folks with trouble understanding international people it would help. The US Bank android app is wonderful and simple. Really my only qualm with US Bank is that their money sending system online is hard and bad from the app. All together, It would be hard to find a better bank then good ol' US Bank.… read more

I bank with USAA. I have used many other banks and find USAA to be better equipped to serve my needs. I bank only online and enjoy that convenience that they offer. I can transfer money, pay bills, make deposits all from my phone or computer even while I'm on the go. I don't have time to go the physical bank. The representatives are always helpful as well. In addition, they offer many discounts on products and services within and out of the bank. I am certain I will never bank with another institution as they are a one-stop shop.… read more

I bank with First Convenience Bank in Central Texas. They are located in all the local Walmarts which is very nice. Recently, I had a very low balance in my account and accidently used my debit card, over drawing my account since the bank does not decline point of sale purchases to costumers in good standing. This caused several over draft charges that amounted to about $100.00 dollars. I went in to my local branch and explained the situation, the woman I was speaking with removed the charges and resolved the issue on the spot. I was very pleased.… read more

US Bank based in Minnesota,is our bank of choice offering reasonably good customer service as well as good credit products and loan services.Many contacts with customer service on the phone have ended with me well satisfied that my problems or questions were well taken care of.My only negative comments would be in the area of their charges for overdraft coverage,which doesnt really affect me that much, as well as the lack of offices reasonably close to my home.I would grade them out at a B+.… read more

I recently opened a checking account with Citibank. Citibank has a number of locations all over New York City, and I’d heard good things from a friend so I decided this was the way to go. I liked that there is no interest rate, and monthly fees are low. I’ve had good experience with customer service so far as well. I would recommend using this bank if you are near a branch and wanting to go with a reputable large scale operation.… read more

I have used Farmers & Merchants Bank in the past when I lived in a different city and I was overall pleased. I had both a checking and savings account with them, and I found their APR rates and policies and terms to be overall fair. I also found their customer service representatives to be very helpful and efficient.

Yes, you can get a loan with tarnished credit, but you will have to pay a considerably higher interest rate because lenders assume you are a higher risk. You should attempt to rebuild the relationships you have with existing creditors to help improve your credit in the short term. If your accounts have not gone past 90 days in delinquency there is a good chance that by calling and speaking to a customer service rep, or by sending along a 'goodwill' letter and simultaneously making your accounts current your lenders may report your accounts as never late. There are a lot of other ways to remove past negative remarks from your credit report, but it is important that your first become current with all over due accounts. You should begin by puling your free annual credit report from https://www.annualcreditreport.com/ so you can begin to triage the worst of your accounts. Once you have a better picture of where you credit is now, you can begin the process of forming a recovery strategy and determine which lenders may be willing to extend credit to you. I would recommend staying away from credit counseling agencies and others such as Lexington Law because they are incredibly expensive and you can everything and more than they are able to do with a little research of your own. You may wish to familiarize yourself with 'credit good will letters' and have a look at the following websites:www.creditboards.comwww.myFico.comGood luck, you will certainly be able to repair your credit in good time!… read more

I never have to wait to get into my safe deposit box. There is always someone available to take me back to the vault. I have not had a single negative experience I can think of with this bank or it's employees. I would highly recommend this bank to anyone in this area! I love it! I give it five stars!… read more

We have been banking at Minster Bank in Ohio for four years now.  It is a small community bank and we really like the personalized service and the fact that the bank clerks actually know us on a first name basis.  We have both checking and saving at Minster.  I would highly recommend it to anyone.

I have been a customer of GE Capital bank for more than 3 years. I was trying to open the account online but something went wrong with the system - I've got asked to call to their customer service. Once I've called them and provided some clarification details, the person on the phone was able to open the account for me. I heavily using their mobile client for making deposits - pretty easy and user-friendly process. Love the ability to link external accounts. Easy to manage, with no hassle - highly recommend!… read more

I agree with Jess below that Woodforest National Bank is a reliable and great option when it comes to banks because they are located in Walmart stores. Pretty much everywhere you go there is a Walmart so you can get the banking assistance that you need. I have found their customer service to be pretty helpful, and I’m happy with their lower transaction and banking fees. I would recommend this bank for anyone who is looking for a convenient bank.… read more

Woodforest National Bank is perhaps the most useful bank in the country because most of them are located in Walmart stores. This bank has saved me a lot of hassle because I have moved about four times in eight years, and there has been a Woodforest branch in all four of these locations. I don't find their checking account itself to be substantially better than any other checking available at a national bank, but their customer service is ideal, with rapidly moving lines and friendly demeanor in all transactions I've had.… read more

In addition their online platform has developed very nicely to be able to do whatever I need it to. Branch workers are always very helpful and polite. Up to date I have had no complaints or bad experiences. If you want a good bank with the local home grown feeling, Wells is your home.… read more

If you have a question about anything you can call direct to your branch or email them and you get a personal answer to any question you may have. They remember you and you are treated like part of the family. I am so satisfied with this bank after being part of the Big three banks for years where you are just a number.… read more

I have been with Credit Union One for about three years and I can honestly say I have never had any problems with them. The one thing I wish that they had was more places I can use an ATM machine that I don't have to pay a fee to use. I like the security that they also offer, I am notified immediately if they question any kind of questionable use on my account, I get emails from them notifying me even if my account is logged into too many times in one day. I am planning on getting a car loan from them in the next month or so, I'm sure they will be a pretty easy process since I already belong with them.… read more

My checking account is with UBS Bank USA. I like it the way they handle their clients. Each time my maintaining balance drops, they don't charge me right away with the penalty. They call me first, notifying that if I can't replenish the account balance they would be constrained to impose the penalty. And they are so endearing when they do this during the course of the conversation. I call it human touch. That to me is very polite and courteous disposition of a Bank.… read more

I have used USAA Federal Savings Bank for the last 8 years. I have had other banking accounts over the years, but none that I have liked as much as USAA. Whenever I call them, they are always friendly and helpful. There have been times that I made mistakes in my checking, causing the dreaded $29.00 overdraft fee, but a simple phone call with explanation has always been enough to get the charges reversed, which means I don't often have to worry about extra money leaving my account for fees and such.… read more

I have an account with TDBank North. I am very unhappy with them My account was somehow compromised and money was taken and used without my knowledge. They said it was used with an ATM card but I have the card. I have the card though so the bank is telling me they will not refund the money taken without doing a complete investigation. I understand they need to investigate but I have been a customer for maybe 10 years without any previous issues. They should return the disputed funds until/unless they can find no evidence of a theft. Even then if that happens that would be bad for me because the money really was taken. I would recommend another bank.… read more

We have banked with Vystar and its predecessor Jax Navy Fed C/U for nearly thirty years and have never had any problems with them except one recent event where an apparent unauthorized charge on our debit card appeared from a vendor we hadn't used in six months. Also, on the date of the charge we were not in town, making the charge appear fraudulent. Vystar reversed the charge and began an investigation. After three months and a thoroughly helpful Vystar customer service rep we discovered the charge to be correct. The vendor had taken its time to submit the proper paper work. Must be nice to be in no hurry to get paid.… read more

I bank with Chase Manhattan, just Chase to most and I have to say that every time I go in they are nice, the wait is never very long and the place is always clean. One time I needed $150 in gold dollars for a fundraiser and I went in and they said that most branches usually only have about $50 unless you order them in advance. Well, I didn't have that kind of time. I didn't think I would have to order them. So I told the gal I would just drive to a few banks. She told me to wait while she made a couple calls. When she came back about 5minutes later she said she called the bank next door (an independent credit union) and that they had what I needed and someone would bring them right over! Within 10 minutes I was out the door and didn't have to drive all over town! They always go the extra mile when I need them to. Plus hardly any fees and a good interest rate...all the boring things..haha..makes this a great bank I will stay with for years and years!… read more

My deciding factor in choosing Green Dot was how user friendly and easy the card is to use.  I've had a wonderful experience with it since I can use it anywhere as a credit or debit card and refill's are easy. My experience with Direct Deposit and Transfers are easy and wonderful to use. It does cost monthly, but the ease and flexibility are worth it!

I have been banking with one local credit union in San Antonio - Generations FCU - since 2003. It has expanded and acquired more branches since the time I opened my accounts with them. I definitely like their interest rates on loans and very straight-forward membership fees and policies. Overdraft and other account fees are way cheaper than in major banks. My account is free, because I have a direct deposit. The new location is very close to my house. I was able to get several car loans through them at a very low rate and still have a line of credit.… read more

Re: Wells Fargo, when I used their ATM for the first time I was charged a fee that I never agreed to. They referred to it as a "inquirer fee." This was in addition to a $3 fee that I did agreed to. This put my account into the negative. I discussed this with the bank and showed them my receipt which did state that I did not agree to the charge. After a call with the bank manager it was agreed that this was an unintentional mix-up an overdraft was not charged. At least they made it right.… read more

We changed from a different back to WPCU about ten years ago and have had no issues with their banking or service. We have done multiple home refinances and auto loans as the fee structures and rates tend to be the best. The staff is knowledgeable and made every effort to advise us of changing and best rates. One of the better benefits is not being constantly hit with numerous fees for the privilege of banking with them. The only negative that I have is the lack of locations to do ATM transactions. On the flip side, if I have to use a out of network ATM, WPCU allows me to recover the cost of the transaction. So, they do almost everything right to earn and keep my business.… read more

Allegacy Federal Credit Union is a southeastern credit union that provides outstanding service. The company is extremely conservative with credit lending decisions. I can say that as a customer, I feel secure in knowing that my investments are safe and I am being provided with exemplary financial stewardship. I have been a customer for over two decades and have not had a problem. Their standards are high and they take few risks, especially when it comes to borrowing. I can't say that I have always been happy with their decisions, but in retrospect, I believe the correct decision was made.… read more

I have had an Capital One 360 account for about 6 months and I can honestly say I have never been so pleased with a bank before. For those of you who don't know, CO 360 is an online-based banking experience. I moved to the middle of nowhere, Tennessee where there are mostly Credit Unions and very few big banks, so I decided to open a CO 360 account. You can deposit checks just by taking a picture of them with your phone; you can do Person2Person transfers and if the receiver also has Capital One the transfer is instant (Example: I told my roommate to get us Taco Bell on the way home and transferred $15 to her, which she received immediately). They also give you the option of opening as many savings accounts as you'd like, and even have an automatic-savings plan where you choose how much to put in each savings account every month. Whenever I call the bank for any questions or assistance, a customer service representative answers IMMEDIATELY. No confusing and misleading menus! I recommend it to everyone. Did I mention there's no annual fees or minimums?… read more

I am new to the game of being an Entrepreneur and they have been very informative on a need to know basis. I never knew that the average monthly amount of deposits that could be made per month is 20.

When I lived in New York I was drawn to TD Bank for their flexible hours (closed at 7pm, open on Sundays). That worked great for a while until my student privileges expired. They would charge me $5 if I didn't have a minimum of $50 in the account. There were also no TD Banks or ATMs in the Brooklyn area, and they would charge you $2 if you withdrew money at a non-TD Bank ATM. In the end I realized this bank was established for rich, Wall Street people and closed my account.… read more

I have a Bank Account with Fifth Third Bank. I absolutely love this bank. The only downfall was the opening deposit amount of $50 because I was just getting back on my feet. At the time I opened my account with them, I had terrible credit due to a separation that I had recently went through. I was trying to get my life back in order and I was denied an account by almost every bank. Fifth Third Bank offered me a second chance with their second chance checking. I opened my second chance checking account and began to use it wisely. After six months of continuous responsible checking with Fifth Third Bank they helped me get approved for a small personal loan to help rebuild my credit. They also offer an identity Theft program that is a great tool to alert you when something looks suspicious. I love Fifth Third Bank!… read more

I had a Bank account with Huntington some time back and at first things seemed all on the up and up, Then Their was a problem with a transfer. I tried to call customer service and was on hold for at least 30-45 minutes and then finally got threw the person on the other end was extremely rude and said they were transferring me to another department. The customer service person failed to mention before transferring me that that department was not even open. Very frustrating and I didn't want to have to wait another 45 minutes on hold again. So anyone who don't like to wait and anyone who don't make $100,000 or more a year should not bank with Huntington.… read more

I had a checking account with Huntington Bank for three years. My account was always in good standing. Then, I had some money problems and was unable to make a deposit before the check when through. I was a day late. I spoke with the manager about waving the NSF fee since it was my first time and I was a valued customer. She politely said no. Therefore, I not only had that check bounce, but another check bounced as well. I had to pay two NSF fees and was unable to cover my bills because of it.

I've had a bank account in Idaho central credit union bank since last year. The main issue with the bank is the hidden charges which they never tell you about while you are opening an account with them.For transactions that you do overseas they are going to charge $5 as processing fees which other reputed banks are not.Also if for 3 months you don't deposit any money they are going to charge you for that.In my opinion this information should be given to customers prior to opening the account.… read more

I switched to Huntington bank this year because it does not hassle me with service fees, and it is close to the university I will be attending. I love how Huntington is open every day of the week. It is convenient for people who work during the week and can only make it to the bank on the weekend. Overall I am satisfied with this service. My biggest issue is that checks take several days to clear and the bankers can be a bit pushy when they are trying to sell the bank's credit card. For instance, when I walked into the bank the first time after opening an account, the banker I worked with skipped hellos and immediately asked if I was still considering the credit card even though I told him no last time. Usually the staff is friendly and takes care of my needs quickly when I visit, however.… read more

I have a bank account with BBT. Unfortunately they have the tendency to ding you with fees. When I was out of work, they would charge me $10 a month for having a bank account with them. When I was working, I had zero complaints about them. I wish they would remove that $10 fee, when you do not have a steady stream of income coming in. It is hard to keep up with a fee when you have zero money coming in.… read more

I currently have 5/3 Bank for my checking and savings account, as well as, for a mortgage loan. We chose this bank primarily because of location (right across the street from our previous address). We have never had any issues with them and I have always found their customer service to be excellent (kind, considerate, respectful, pleasant and attentive to my needs). Setting up the mortgage with them and our accounts was easy breezy. The only issue we have with them now is that they are not nearby so we have to travel some ways to get to them now that we relocated. It would be nice if they upgraded to things such as taking a pic of a check and utilizing those tools like Chase does. Outside of that, I do recommend this bank to anyone who is searching for a new bank.… read more

I applied for a home mortgage at Mountain West Bank in Idaho. It turned into a miserable experience. The first mortgage broker took all my information and started to shop for rates. Two anxious weeks later he told me that no one wanted my mortgage. I have great credit and 50% down payment but because it was a rural home with minimal fire protection (the home is on forest service land) no one wanted the loan. I talked to a second loan officer at Mountain West who said that he had other contacts to check. Another long week of waiting and no response. When I started to call these loan officers back they didn't want to take my calls. Very disappointing. I would not recommend doing business with them in the future.… read more

I recently opened up an account with Woodforest National Bank. I have had this account for less than a year, but I can already tell that this bank stands out among the others because it truly cares about its banking customers. Checks deposited to your account are available immediately. Even checks deposited through ATM are available the same day - within the hour. There is no ridiculous holding process for larger checks or deposited funds. The tellers are always friendly and happy to help. The only complaint that I have would be the number of locations in the Houston area, inner loop. One important aspect of your bank is number of locations. Direct deposit works for me now, but any time I need to be physically present for any banking, I do have to hunt down a location.… read more

Citibank. During my younger corporate years, I was delinquent with my credit card payments at one point. Couple of years after, I was unexpectedly approved for a Citibank Visa credit card. I must say that their application assessment is thorough and they give considerations or chances for young professionals to reestablish their credit.

I live in Canada and have all my banking with TD Canada Trust. We opted the bank as it has the best customer service. It also provides service during weekends and holidays which is very helpful for working people. Also they have financial advisers who provide all the liable options for banking to us to choose. They provide answers to all our questions and will have a very friendly relation with the customers.

Around one year ago I opened an account at a local Busey Bank, in my home city. It´s not a very well-known bank, but it´s close to my home and, so far, I´ve had no problem with it. The bank features a no minimum balance requirement, with the sole condition of getting the statements on-line. It offers debit and credit cards, online banking, mobile and direct deposit, and its customer service is excellent. The only detail I´m a little bit disappointed with is the fact that every time I sign-in online I have to wait for an E-mail with an access code, but that problem is a minor one. The problem lies on the fact that, I don´t know why, the system is unable to recognize my computer. It´s somehow a bargain, but nothing compared to the possibilities it features.… read more

MidFirst Bank has been the best bank I've ever used. The fact that they allow you to use any ATM and not charge you a fee is the most solid choice for going with them. They always make you feel welcome every time you visit their locations. The only negative experience I have had with them is putting a hold on my account for a purchase I made for $2. I appreciate the fact that a bank will look out for you but it caused a problem when I didn't know and I was trying to make a purchase. I guess I would've appreciated a phone call or an email telling me that they put a hold on the account...and did a $2 purchase for something unusual really warrant a hold? Other than that, great bank and I will be a member for years to come!… read more

Boeing Employee Credit Union, is the bank that I'll be mentioning today. Don't get me wrong, but this bank is great, but there are incidents that made me decide to switch to other banks. This bank only gave me about 5 mobile transfer actions per month which was far less than what I would prefer because I like to make transfers from my savings to checking account to make sure I had enough funds for what I wanted to buy. I also use my mobile banking system a lot so it was a serious problem I had with this bank.… read more

            I will never use this company again!!! They have to many people that work in their offices off of Manchester and I270 that really are not qualified to work in the public. Tried calling for my grandmother, was transferred to some product master file dept and the female who answered was not listening or to busy talking to someone else. Very rude

Edward Jones should be shut down at this point.

I did take some income, which EJ is always glad to point out. However, $100,000 in an up market is unaccounted for. Some of that was due...

I decided to just keep it there because I was too busy dealing with so much. I totally regret it because it seems after about 7 months I will owe them money when I transfer my money! Please beware they are very expensive and do not look out for you.Helpful?YesNoRobert of The Villages, FL on June 29, 2017Satisfaction RatingWe joined Edward Jones in 2015 - we finally escaped in 2017 with minimal losses in the stocks recommended to us. Two of the stocks WE chose gained significantly - Apple and Amazon - our brokers sniffed at both. We invested $49K in a recommended mutual fund. After one year we had gained a whopping $500! That was erased by a $650 "management fee" from their "experts". We were audited recently for that year. Received no 1099s from EJ so wound up paying $22K in taxes, penalties, interest, and back taxes. Appealed and received A $2.5K refund from the IRS, based on the fact that Edward Jones had OVERREPORTED our profits. These people are not your friends, or even competent investment counsel lord. Run Away!Helpful?YesNoDiane of Raleigh, NC on June 28, 2017Satisfaction RatingI have worked with the company for the last six months. During that time I dealt with an advisor who was very sarcastic in his ways of communication. His way of describing something when I would not agree to his advice was by saying "best wishes" and hanging up the phone on me. I know what this phrase meant... It means stick it somewhere (I will not go into further detail as I think most people can read between the lines). I finally decided to remove this advisor and was given another from the same company. The new person was very professional initially. I liked him. However, he then contacted an estate attorney that is working with my late father's finances. I agree I did give him the phone number but did not instruct him to call either. Please, please, please consult me before you take the initiative that you think is in my best interest without my consent. To make a long story short I am moving on to a new firm that may value my business and respect me too. If you feel as I do this may not be the firm for you to do business with.Helpful?YesNoIrene of Hoquiam, WA on June 10, 2017Satisfaction RatingGot a phone call from the financial advisor. He says we can get rid of your husband's Roth IRA if you want to downsize the amount of accounts you guys have. I said, "Okay if that is what you recommend." Then tax time came. Our accountant informed us that because we closed the Roth IRA 6 months too early that there is a penalty and fine to pay. Okay so we did that. Then research was needed to find out what the profits were from the account. This is needed to pay another fine and that fine would be 100% of the profits. We found out that the account after 10 years had a loss. So at least we did not have to give away more dollars.On another note... We had put $ into our Simple IRA. The advisor says we can put into your traditional too. So I wrote a check. Our accountant said, "NO NO you cannot do both for that year." It took a few hours of phone calls and e-mails to get that straightened out. We ended up leaving the money in the IRA accounts because the IRS does not like you to remove the money once it is there. So we have Taxed and Non-Taxed dollars in our Traditional IRA accounts now. Our accountant says he is keeping track for us of what is real IRA dollars and what are not. I highly recommend that if you are getting advice from a financial advisor to go to your accountant to find out if what they are telling you to do is correct. This can save you from doing costly mistakes that take up a lot of time to fix and figure out.Helpful?YesNorobert of Pueblo West, CO on May 24, 2017Satisfaction RatingEDWARD JONES, 2045 Columbia Dr, Pueblo, Co. 81005 - Oh I read the Important Information about doing business with Edward Jones and I couldn't find the part where they said it was alright for their financial advisors to lie to their clients in order to get the extra financial bonus that they receive that left me losing $38,000 Plus. Had $107,834.34 in a Lincoln annuity and was getting $5467. a year, or $453. a month. 8/13 My financial adviser ** said she could get me 6% a year. All I had to do was leave it in for 1 year before I took anything out. So she had Edward Jones take that much out so I would still be getting $453. and I ended up with $101,500. Guess I should have been adding up the numbers because there is $867 missing right there. She just happen to quit or was canned after 11 months. Wonder how much she got for this lie.So EJ put in a new financial adviser **, went in after that 1st year 8/14 and the annuity was worth $107.590. and I wanted to start taking my money out. ** told me all I could draw out was 4% So now I was only getting $403. a month. Went in 8/15 and asked ** how much this thing was worth because like ** said the numbers looked kind of fuzzy, he told my wife and me said "I don't blame you but as long as don't take any more than I'm taking now it was worth 107,590". Should have went to a real financial adviser for advice because this just cost me another $10,303 for the year. Went in 8/16 and ** says "oh I don't think you are getting any interest on this", so he makes a call to AIG and says it was only worth $91,800. Guess they heard about the Fiduciary clause and thought if they started to tell the truth now it was alright. They've done this to other people too because the secretary A ** who was an accomplice to ** and should have been canned with her, had this line to says, "you made $300. dollars and you will always get $403 dollars for the rest of your life". I guess this worked with other people who had to have this money to survive. Let's see. That means I made 1/10 of 1% a year for three years. Talked to a Vanguard agent and in order to transfer this to them would cost Me $3500. to get out of this phony deal with EJ. and the AIG annuity. Could have put this money in a can in the shed in my back yard and been $3,500 ahead. So now I don't take any money out just to get my 6% which in reality is only $600. a year. It will take me another 3 years to get back to 107,000, so made no money for 6 years they used my money. I would think EJ would do background checks on these people being the reputable company they are, just don't google them.So when they sent me a letter to make them custodians of my account in Dec., I told my wife that it looked like they were trying to steal the other $91,000 so I found a real EJ financial adviser on the north side of Pueblo and transferred it to his office. $5467 X 3 = $16,350 and $107,590 - $91,800 = $15,790 and $3297 to surrender the Lincoln annuity and $3000 to dump this turkey with AIG. Grand total of $38,437. This is pretty apparent that they were working for their best interest and not their client. Didn't seem like it would do any good to do their complaint dept. everybody just gets the runaround.Helpful?YesNo

It was a young man who had just started up. I had $6,000 I wanted to invest in Nash Finch. It was $6 a share at the time. He didn't take my order but said he would look at Nash Finch to see if it was a good investment. Later that day I visited him again and he recommended against it because of debt. In place he recommended 3 mutual funds, Putman New Growth Opportunity and 2 Hartford funds $2,000 in each. The result Putman went from $35 to $9 with no call from broker. The Hartford funds went down about 30% again no call from broker. In the same period Nash Finch went from $6 to $36 per share. Decided to do my own thing for awhile and was successful but did not like do it. So decided to try an Edward Jones broker that some of my relatives had used. Went to see him and went through my portfolio with him.I had bought a drug company called IVAX. He asked me about it and I told him I bought it because the leader of the company was always buying back its stock. He told me I should sell and buy Pfizer which was at $35 a share and I did so on his recommendation. What happened? Pfizer went down to $9 without a call while IVAX got bought out by TEVA the Israel drug company and took off. Again traded on own buying adding a new stock MDU to my portfolio. Went to see new Edward Jones broker asking to buy more MDU. His response was I needed more diversity and suggest Bank Of America at $55 a share. Once again went down to $9 a share with no call from broker.In addition to these gems they also recommended Citi bonds a burn job and some Williston Basin stock also a bust. I believe my Edward Jones representatives made as much in my account as I did. Closed one account that was basically in cash last Friday and it is now Wednesday and transfer still has not hit bank. Tempted to sue for lack of fiduciary responsibility, believe this is widespread enough it could be a class action.Helpful?YesNoMagdalena of Bellevue, WA on April 19, 2017Satisfaction RatingIn October 2015, after having met with an Edward Jones Financial Advisor in Kirkland Washington for the first time, I was advised that my financial situation allowed me to retire at 65 years of age instead of having to wait until 66. She transferred everything I had from Fidelity to Edward Jones saying there would be a "one-time charge of 2.5% and nothing thereafter". I thought that was high but liked the idea of no further charges. She placed me into 13 different Mutual Funds with American and Franklin Funds advising that it was to diversify. It wasn't until I went to a Retirement Seminar months later that it was brought to my attention that I had been charged 3.5%, not 2.5% and that I would be charged an Annual Fee ranging from .9 to 1.6% from each of the Mutual Funds.Morningstar ranks Mutual Funds from 1-5 Stars Bronze, Silver and Gold. I found out that 9 out of my 13 Funds were Bronze, usually 2 stars, with Below Average Returns for 3,5, and/or 10 years as well as their being High Risks for 3, 5, and/or 10 years. When I asked her about this, she became angry that I was questioning her. I realized I could no longer trust her and therefore could no longer work with her. I sold all of my Funds and transferred the cash back to Fidelity, where it has remained as cash since I am afraid to trust anyone again. I placed a complaint with Edward Jones requesting that my $12,000 commission be returned to me for all that had happened. I had only been with EJ for about 9-10 months. I was just told my complaint had been denied.If I had known then what I know now about Edward Jones, I would never have gone with them. I think their customer service has been terrible. I have had to call them repeatedly to see where my complaint stood. I feel they did not listen to anything I was saying. They do not record their conversations and they do not allow you to see your record so it was my word against theirs and, of course, they believed their Advisor over me. I have tried to work this out with them but they have refused to work with me. My only option now is to contact FINRA to see what they can do to help.Helpful?YesNoVIC of Willits, CA on April 14, 2017Satisfaction RatingIt takes a lot to inspire me to write a review, good or bad. My experience with Edward Jones has been the worst financial related experience in my life. There was a total lack of concern to get my and our employees' money invested properly, one employee never got his money into an account at all as he thought he had, his deductions just went into a money market fund making nothing, for a year! No one at EJ bothered to say anything to him or follow up with any of us. My funds also languished in this money market fund for many weeks, of the choices told to me, I picked 2, no contact from them telling me one fund was not really available, I had to contact them to ask why nothing was going into my chosen funds. Then they say "oh you have to wait for us to mail you a new form, and mail it back." Seriously?? 2 more weeks wasted. Then my bi-monthly deposits would not show up in my account sometimes a month later. Long story short, our company chose to move our accounts over to ADP, then EJ takes weeks of prodding to make this happen, then rather than transferring funds into our ADP 401K accounts, they send all our checks to the owner of the company, no notice to anyone, so the checks sit in a mail box for some time before the owner comes home and finds them in the mail. Now none of us knows how to properly get these funds deposited into our ADP 401K accounts as they are not made out to us individually. Never do business with EJ, especially in Sandpoint, Idaho.Helpful?YesNoArla of Park City, UT on March 8, 2017Satisfaction RatingAfter over 25 years with Edward Jones, I closed my account in January 2017. Received all tax info except for one (was sent with incomplete figures) and was checking weekly with the online access for those final figures. With no prior warning or communication I discovered this week that my online access is now denied for the accounts as they are closed!!! When I inquired about this with both my local investment office and the online "Help" 800 number, the response was basically "Too bad, so sad"!! I do my taxes electronically and now cannot pull those figures over electronically as I no longer have the access to that information. Warning to anyone else who has or is thinking about closing Edward Jones accounts. Frankly in this day and age and electronic environment it is beyond logic that this business practice exists. At the very least, the account(s) information and accessibility should remain available until after April 15th of each year!!!Helpful?YesNoBrenda of Sebring, FL on March 7, 2017Satisfaction RatingI went Edward Jones in January 2014. Thinking I didn't know too much and put my faith in them. I had $10,000 plus 129 shares of Home Depot. As I sat in his office he told me he thought I should sell Home Depot. Price at that time was $78.00. I told him I really didn't want to sell it as I inherited the stock and wanted to keep it. He assured me I was doing the right thing and he let me keep $1000.00 of stk only. I bought a small amt of Apple and Twitter. In the meantime Home Depot was going up in price. I called Corporate because I was upset. They investigated and said nothing I could do because I sold it. When I went to transfer to another E. Jones no one would take account. I had to sell what was left through my Agent. Needless to say I lost a lot of money. Today Home Depot is worth $147.00 per share. I am a senior and was counting on that money. They nickel-and-dimed me with fees. I hope I have saved someone from making the same mistake. I would of done better on my own.Helpful?YesNoWilliam of San Francisco, CA on March 3, 2017Satisfaction RatingI had an account with EJ for many years and contributed many thousands in fees to them. Now that I have closed the account they are not allowing me to access my tax info electronically, per their policy. This means that instead of a simple import into TurboTax, I now have to manually input, into various tax forms, the many trades executed by EJ from a 15-page statement. Everyone who closes their account will encounter the same problem. Other financial institutions that I deal with do allow downloads from closed accounts, as you still have to file your taxes on the previous year's activity and they have profited from your business. By the way, the reason I closed my account was that I consistently lost money yearly with them while paying many thousands in fees. It's a lousy company.Helpful?YesNoEd of Larkspur, CO on Feb. 28, 2017Satisfaction RatingEdward Jones agent sold me an annuity with many promises of how it would step and lock in new highs every time the market set a new high. BS no way. Once confronted about his lies, he said "I never said that", or "Maybe I told you wrong". If you want to be ripped off invest with Edward Jones M. R. Office Castle Rock, CO. I lost about $ 2000.00 or more. All I had to do is put the money in a cd and watch it grow. Never again.Helpful?YesNoDenise of Seattle, WA on Feb. 7, 2017Satisfaction RatingI'd like to warn the public that if you have any issues of any kind including my experiences of Broker misconduct (disclosing my personal info to other Brokers when attempting to move my account from her custody) to their transferring errors (moving my investment accounts to them and they invested my two retirement account improperly and refused to correct it when I discovered it years later). Beware that the SEC only takes the complaints. They do not help and when I attempted resolution with regarding to my investments accounts (they invested my ROTH account into my Standard IRA account so now not only did I not receive credit on my Income Tax return, I now have to pay taxes on the redraw of the funds I already paid taxes on!). FINRA, a branch of supposed investment regulators that a consumer supposedly can turn to for such matters, told me to hire a lawyer. No one wants to help and Edward Jones doesn't do a thing about misconduct of their Brokers. I have undisputable proof and received a letter back from their Compliance Department, same experience with the retirement account issue that explained nothing. Just said they looked into it and that now they considered the case closed, no explanation whatsoever. It's all for show to make the consumer comfortable that there is supposedly safeguards in place. PLEASE DON'T BE FOOLED. I plan to call my Legislative representatives to see if they can help me since Edward Jones won't. I have been dealing with the hell regarding this issue for several years now. They are deceptive so don't be fooled. I learned the hard way, don't you make that mistake. They seem fine until there's a problem.Helpful?YesNoPamela of Milwaukee, WI on Dec. 21, 2016Satisfaction RatingMy husband passed away recently, and I have been trying to close his accounts, including his Edward Jones account. I am the executor and have supplied them with the paperwork authorizing me to do this. No one else. However, they are refusing to close the account. Instead, they are insisting that I transfer it to a Fiduciary account to be held by them!!! I already have an Estate account!! I have provided the very same documentation to other accounts, with no problems. I would highly recommend NOT putting ANY money with them, unless you don't care if you ever see again! In that case go to the Casino or play the lottery, you'll have more fun throwing the money away.Helpful?YesNoA of Columbia Falls, MT on Nov. 28, 2016Satisfaction RatingRolled over my deceased husband's IRA to Edward Jones 2 months ago. Told my broker I wanted the money somewhere safe and he suggested 100% in mutual funds. After listening to his spiel, I agreed, and to date have lost over $8500.00. It seems a bit excessive for something that was suppose to be safe. I feel because I know very little about the market that I am being fleeced. Looking for other options.Helpful?YesNoTina of Nashville, TN on Nov. 4, 2016Satisfaction RatingLast year William ** of the Bellevue branch of Edward Jones approached my husband and I in our driveway. He wanted to sell us some stock. We were not interested. I said if and when I was interested in investing with him I would call him. He gave me his card and I gave him mine. This was early Spring last year 2015. A month or so later I started to get emails then phone calls. Over and over. I kept stating I would contact him when I was ready to do anything. He just would not give up. Then he contacted me about some Disney Stock. Again he just wouldn't stop. So he finally wore me down and we invested 10,000.00 and bought the Disney Stock and of course he was the only one to make money off of that mistake. As soon as it goes up some we are pulling out and I never intend on doing business with Edward Jones ever again. I also would never refer anyone to them. William ** just couldn't take no for an answer. I have never had an experience with anyone such as that in my life. (He no longer works there) not sure why. I will never do any new business with them.Helpful?YesNobob of Madison, WI on Nov. 1, 2016Satisfaction RatingI created a fund through Edward Jones for my daughter when she was a minor. She has been of age for over 15 years. I recently made an attempt to have the account moved to her name through the broker in Mt. Horeb handling the account. Instead of helping he resigned as the agent. Currently I now have no broker to perform the transfer.Helpful?YesNokaren of Gardner, MA on Sept. 24, 2016Satisfaction RatingDo yourself a favor by saving time and money by saying NO to Edward Jones and investing on your own or with a fee-based advisor or someone who at least offers low-cost investment options. Edward Jones' fees are insanely high. I recently requested a transfer of my Edward Jones Roth IRA account to another brokerage because I was tired of paying the annual fee EJ IRA fee. EJ charged $95 to terminate my Roth IRA account (not unusual for a brokerage to do that) BUT what angered me is that EJ withheld $40 from the Roth IRA transfer until they could verify that I had already paid the $20 annual fee. Yes, you read that correct. THEY WITHHELD $40 UNTIL THEY VERIFIED I HAD PAID MY $20 DOLLAR ANNUAL FEE. THAT'S TWICE THE AMOUNT WITHHELD... thus causing me to be put into a margin call status with my new brokerage account. WTF??? I had paid the $20 annual fee in April so I was all set. You mean to tell me they could not check my account statement to see that I had already paid the annual fee BEFORE transferring my account. Now I have to wait 5 business days for EJ to verify that I paid the annual fee and then they will release the $40 to my new brokerage. Stay away from Edward Jones. They suck. They are horrible.Helpful?YesNoRandall of Cary, IL on Aug. 26, 2016Satisfaction RatingFraudulent activity on my retirement account at Edward Jones. Edward Jones refuses to investigate fraudulent activity on my account that decreased the amount from over $300 thousand dollars to only $135 thousand dollars. They will not provide any statements other than money has been withdrawn under my name. Well, I have news for Edward Jones, I have not withdraw these money. Edward Jones is really bad company to invest with. Right now I am working with the Police, State Attorney, BBB and FTC to rectify this issue. If you have any money with Edward Jones, do yourself a favor and take them somewhere else before they will misplace them and blame you for it. Trust me it is not easy to fight big companies, but I will do my best to fight them.Helpful?YesNoBernhard of Mobile, AL on Aug. 17, 2016Satisfaction RatingMy mother passed away recently, and I have been trying to close her various accounts, including her Edward Jones account. I am the executor and co-trustee of my mother's trust. No one else. However, they are refusing to close the account unless my sister signs on to release the funds TO THE TRUST. I have provided the very same documentation to three other accounts, with no problems. I now have to get my attorney involved to help them with their reading comprehension. I would highly discourage anyone from putting any money with these people. If you don't want to see it again, you'll have more fun throwing the money out of a car window.Helpful?YesNoDennis of Fairview, NC on Aug. 8, 2016Consumer Increased Rating!2An Aunt recently passed away and I, along with a few brothers and cousins, received notification from an Edward Jones Rep or agent, concerning a Revocable Trust my Aunt had, to which an Edward Jones Rep accepted the trusteeship and custodianship. E J sent a notification letter explaining a bit about the estate settlement process, etc., while forwarding a copy of the trust, Will, Form W-9, etc. Edward Jones was the Investment firm my Aunt utilized prior to her death. The real reason I am concerned is that the Edward Jones Rep is also named as a equal Beneficiary of the trust, along with my brothers and cousins, etc. I did not know my Aunt real well, but I understand she was in a care facility for a number of years prior to her death. I have heard a bit about her mental state, but will not go into that here. Am I wrong here to be concerned? This just does not sit well with me. I was a quite removed from my Aunt, so I feel fortunate to have been remembered by her at all. Thank You.Helpful?YesNoMichelle of Columbus, IN on Aug. 6, 2016Satisfaction RatingI knew about Edward Jones and what a bad investment company they were because I researched them before opening my first Roth IRA at age 18. I instead went with Vanguard. That was 10 years ago. For those not in the know, Ed Jones is bad because they fleece you in fees. Both fixed fees and the variable expenses of their investment picks. They make commission off their selections. Or as they call it "revenue sharing". They make sure you sign the fine print about that and the fees when you open an account. Now I'm sure the people who work for them are nice. You probably know a person or two who works or started working for them. Like insurance, they like to hire people (college grads anyone?) and have them focus on their relatives/friends as new leads. It's why they're quite popular despite how bad they are. Now I understand people need to make money. But that money should be earned and often times, it isn't.The company's policies are horrid. The financial advisors (and most "advisors" actually) are 80% sales people and 20% financial knowledge. They are a middle man who put you in investments that likely aren't in your best interests, but theirs. If you took a little time and researched basic investment advice, you could be a passive investor in a balance or target date mutual fund and probably come out way ahead than going with this company. In fact, I guarantee you would. My personal story is that my small employer decided to switch to Ed Jones as their "retirement expert" to handle the employees 401ks. It was really a Sep IRA, but that's what they called it. Now I wasn't thrilled about this and I believe they made the decision because of personal connections or a mutually beneficial business relationship. I'm not sure. It wasn't my call to make so off we switched.Frankly I had to transfer my account over around to Ed Jones mid May 2016. I then took another job in June with a much larger company. Guess what funds they offered their employees? That's right: Vanguard (and Fidelity). There's a reason both them and Amazon and other big companies use them for their employees. Now I was given some interesting advice by both the Ed Jones advisor and his assistant. The assistant was insistent I invest right away into their funds. I politely declined and kept in cash, knowing I was probably going to be switching jobs soon and not wanting to pay transaction fees.Red flag #1: She hinted I would have to pay taxes on the whole amount if I didn't invest with them in a certain time. Now I know I wouldn't have to if the direct transfer was done correctly. And I think she knew this, with how long she'd be working there. But I suppose I could be wrong about that and maybe she really didn't know. Next when I did talk about funds, he wanted me to invest 33% of my portfolio in Apple stock. Red flag #2. Why? Because investing such a large amount in any one stock is extremely risky. The whole "don't put your eggs in one basket" elementary idea. His graph of Apple's impressive returns over the past 10 years was nice & all but a little common sense would see through this. Apple has peaked. They went from being relatively forgotten to some bigs wins with the iPod and iPhone. It's unlikely those gains would be seen again. At least for the foreseeable future.So no, I didn't think now was a good time to get into Apple, just from my take on where they're headed. The other 2 mutual funds (utilities and a bond fund) he had me in were high in fees. 1.5-2%. Ridiculous when you're use to.5% or less (usually.15%). And to someone who doesn't know better, it may not seem like much, that 1 to 2% fee difference. But go plug some numbers into a future value calculator and change the rate of return by 1% and be in awe of the difference it makes in 20, 30, 40 years. So I switched my work Sep IRA over to my Vanguard IRA, who did most of the work to transfer it. It closed on 7/7/16. I wanted to make sure it was done before 7/31/16 before the annual fee was charged as was indicated online. But I should have realized who I was dealing with.I got my statement today. Not only did they charge the close out fee of $95 (also preposterous but this is to discourage you from leaving them), they of course charged the annual fee of $40. $135 to close an account. But I'm not surprised, just ticked off that they can charge a year's worth of account maintenance for a month and a half of service. Not even that. But of course they don't pro-rate fees. If you haven't learned by now from this review and others, they aren't exactly concerned with going out of their way for the consumer.Do yourself a favor by saving time and money by saying no to Edward Jones and investing on your own, going with a fee-based advisor, or someone who at least offers low cost investment options. It's easy. Just go to Vanguard's website and open an IRA. You can put up to $5500/yr in one. Put it in a target-retirement fund. You chose the year you plan to retire. That's it. Simple. You're already better off than doing any investing with Ed Jones.Helpful?YesNoT.G. of League City, TX on Aug. 2, 2016Satisfaction RatingThe E. Jones advisor wanted to buy Chevron. I worked in oil & gas, so advised her our CEO told us prices dropping, so I just sold my co. stock. I reluctantly agreed, making clear if no profit I would move acct. She bought CVX and again when price falling. I lost 8% of initial portfolio in a year, then moved acct. I am holding, hoping oil goes back up. Some experts say it won't (electric cars) & CVX will cut its dividend. All oil stock PE too high.Helpful?YesNoJerry of Cedar Falls, IA on June 23, 2016Satisfaction RatingWe opened and funded our accounts the latter part of May. At that time it was suggested we each invest in American Funds. We told our adviser that we collectively had $217,730 invested with American Funds and declined his offer. We were shocked and frustrated after reading our July 15th Jones Account Summary to find our adviser had invested another 50,000 dollars in Income Fund of America and incurred an AMECX capital loss of $5,943 recorded 7/30. Meanwhile we sold the funds for a loss and are considering court action.Helpful?YesNoG. of Anytown, AL on June 2, 2016Satisfaction RatingLast night I got a call from a telemarketer. They identified themselves and said Edward Jones sold them my number. Beware giving Edward Jones your personal data.Helpful?YesNoKim of Arlington, TX on May 5, 2016Satisfaction RatingI originally thought that in opening an account and NOT using advising services was FEE FREE... but as my stock gained value and the gains rolled into new stock purchases I learned 8 years later that I'd been paying for re-investing existing stock. So I moved my money and I had to pay $95 just to close my account, which I feel was exorbitant and predatory to consumers and I don't recall agreeing to these fees.Helpful?YesNoLisa of Myrtle Beach, SC on April 19, 2016Satisfaction RatingI opened my IRA account on 5/18/2012. I closed my IRA account on 3/8/2016. So complete length of time I have had my account with Edward Jones has been < 4 years or about 46-47 months. However they charged me 5 years of annual fees. I was charged $40 in May of 2012, $40 in May of 2013, $40 in May of 2014, $40 in May 2015, and then another $40 in March 2016, even though the fee was not due until May of 2016. So I have only had my account < 4 years, but they have charged me 5 years of fees totalling $200. I have contacted the #800 and local office and have only been told, "we don't prorate the fees". However I'm not asking them to even prorate the fees, I am just asking NOT to be charged for fees I don't owe. In addition I had to pay $95 just to close my account, which I feel was exorbitant and predatory to consumers. I don't understand how they earned $95?? I filled out all the paperwork myself, and at most a wire fee to send money out is only about $15 - $30. It appears Edward Jones motive is to charge excessive and unearned fees, especially the close-out fee which is 3 times in excess of what the industry standard appears to be. Then they tried to tell me it's "for account management/reporting" going forward. The cost of a stamp is 47 cents, and most IRS reporting is done electronically nowadays, at a relatively minimal cost, additionally I'm not retiring anytime soon, so I don't see how Edward Jones can justify $95 other than to say "sorry no one explained these fees to you." I'm also concerned at how easily their business practices can take advantage of the elderly or less educated in regards to investing. Telling people these fees 'are the norm', when they absolutely must be the highest in the industry. I do not understand what fiduciary responsibility they have to consumers, their sole purpose seems to be to charge their clients exploitative fees/charges whether earned or not, for the sake of their own profits.Helpful?YesNoSherry of Middletown, RI on April 13, 2016Satisfaction RatingMy employer suggested we move from Principal Funds to Edward Jones. Mid October 2015, Andre ** visited my place of employment with folders of paperwork to fill out. November 11th met with Andre ** in his office with October Principal Funds Quarterly Statement (something ** said he needed in order to facilitate rolling over into Ed Jones). Signed paperwork to open the account.** strongly recommended I buy into the John Hancock Lifestyle Growth PTF A. I said no, that I wanted my investment to remain in an Index Fund as I have with Principal Funds and we left it at that. January 2016, I received an End of Year Statement from Principal Funds indicating nothing had been rolled over. I was told the account had been created but nothing had been deposited. I was told I needed to fill out a Transfer Form. I said "I did that already". I was told to do it again which I did promptly. January 26th, I received a voicemail message indicating the rollover from Principal Funds had taken place and all was in order.Mid-March, I received a voicemail message wanting to know what to do with the cash I was accumulating. The message was, "All I need is a quick verbal over the phone to get things in motion and I will send a Letter of Standing Instruction to take care of further purchases. You won't be bothered any longer." I phoned back and spoke with **. I said "I wanted the cash invested in the Principal Funds Index Fund that rolled over to my Ed Jones Account." ** said, "oh that's a bad decision. The fees are so high." I held my ground and said "Index Fund", and that was that.A week later I received a Letter of Standing Instruction for me to sign and send back indicating I wanted ** to invest my contributions to the John Hancock Lifestyle Growth PTF A. I phoned him back and told him "no I wanted my contributions to be invested in an Index Fund." He said he was coming to visit my place of employment and we could chat more about it.April 5th, I met with ** at work. He pulled out another Letter of Standing Instruction for me to invest my contributions in yes, you guessed it! The John Hancock Lifestyle Growth PTF A. He said, "I need instructions on how to invest the cash that is building in your account." I said "I wanted the cash to go into the Principal Index Fund that rolled over from Principal Funds." At this point I was tired. I said, "let's just let the cash build." He agreed. Less than an hour later, I receive a voicemail message from ** saying, "I FORGOT I put through a 'buy' on Friday (4 days prior), so you don't have any 'cash' in your account anymore. It's not too late to cancel it if you want, but you need to call me back soon."I'M DONE WITH HIM! He forgot??? We talked for nearly an hour about what to do with the 'cash' in my account and he forgot he used the entire amount and put through a 'buy'! I have no cash and he can't remember? I'm not necessarily upset about the transaction - it's actually what I've been wanting to happen for the last 5 months (since November 11th). I told the 'powers that be' at work and heard similar stories. The good news is we're moving our retirement investments to another company!Helpful?YesNoMichael of Greensboro, NC on March 12, 2016Satisfaction RatingLong story short, I let them recommend stocks. They picked 100% oil stocks. In a year when the market went up I lost 16,000. Cenovus was the biggest loser. There's obviously some kind of scam relation going on there. I filed complaints with FINRA. I honestly don't think anyone really cares including the government. Too many people in on the scam.Helpful?YesNoAdrian of Bismarck, ND on March 11, 2016Satisfaction RatingWhen investing you either make money or you don't. With EJ I did not make money. I invested low amount of $14,000 and waited for EJ to prove themselves before I invested more money with them. EJ proved themselves failures. My EJ financial adviser put my money in mutual funds and he told me it will take about 6 months on average to make money and 2 years is more than enough time for my holdings to make money. After 2 years all my mutual funds lost $2000 and my adviser told me he does not remember telling me that in 2 years I will make money, and instead told me it takes about 5-10 years for my accounts to make money. As the markets tanked my adviser told me to buy against the tide (sales pitch) and I asked my adviser why he sold me oil stocks at the top peak before oil prices tanked and his excuse was "nobody can predict the markets". I don't care about excuses. After 2 years I sold off all my accounts with EJ and fired my adviser and EJ. I will never do business with EJ and do not recommend them. Edward Jones either scams customers or does not know what they are doing with customers' money.Helpful?YesNoExpert ReviewBarbara FriedbergPersonal Finance Contributing EditorBarbara Friedberg, MBA, MS is a former investment portfolio manager with decades of financial experience.

        	CredentialsThere are several types of specialized financial advisors, many of whom receive specific credentials for their areas of expertise. There are actually scores of financial advisor designations. Following are a few of the more popular financial advisor credentials.​Registered Investment Advisor: Registered Investment Advisors (RIAs) are either individuals or firms registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or state securities authorities. They are charged with providing advice and recommendations or writing reports about securities.
                                    Registered representative: Registered representatives are licensed by the SEC. They must pass the Series seven and Series 63 securities examinations and be registered with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). This individual typically works for an investment brokerage company and may also be called a stockbroker or account executive for the firm.
                                    Certified Financial Planner: The Certified Financial Planner is governed by requirements set by the Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards, Inc. (CFP). The designation holders must meet the following requirements: hold a minimum education level of a bachelor’s degree, complete coursework in financial planning and successfully complete a comprehensive exam.
                                    Chartered Financial Analyst: This gold standard designation is issued by the internationally recognized CFA Institute. There are extensive educational, experiential and examination requirements. CFA holders demonstrate high levels of competence in investment research and portfolio management.
                                    Personal Financial Specialist: The well-regarded PFS is credentialed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). This professional is a Certified Public Accountant (CPA)with additional training in financial and wealth management.
                                    Services providedFinancial advisors provide clients with a vast range of services, depending on the client's needs and the firm’s focus.​Tax accounting: A CPA (Certified Public Account) is a type of financial advisor that helps clients handle, complete and submit their taxes.
                                    Financial planning: Financial advisors who provide financial planning advice on how to reach future life and financial goals - including information about investing, saving, taxes, estate planning and more.
                                    Investing: Clients who want to invest can use registered representatives or other types of financial professionals for education and assistance.
                                    Money and wealth management: This service provides oversight of the client’s finances including security selection and complete financial management.
                                    Insurance services: Many financial advisors include insurance products in their suite of money management services.
                                    Ethical reputationIt’s important when hiring a financial advisor to check their prior record for any ethical breaches. The consumer must engage an advisor who is trustworthy and competent.​Good compliance: Financial advisors are required to adhere to ethical codes, and clients can check a financial advisor's compliance history via records kept by the Financial Industry Regulation Authority (FINRA) and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
                                    Firsthand client experience: Word-of-mouth is a good way to determine if clients are happy with their advisors; trustworthy financial advisors will have many clients who are happy to provide a reference.
                                    Rankings: Consumers may review financial publications and institutions such as Barrons Magazine that ranks financial advisors according to the advisor's ethics, success and reputation. Regardless of the ranking, potential clients should perform their own due diligence.
                                    Pay structureClients pay financial advisors for their services, and there are various ways financial advisors are compensated. Consumers must ask the prospective financial advisor how they are paid. Look for advisors with reasonable fees, as higher fees don’t directly correlate with better investment results.​Commission-based payments: Financial advisors who work on commission receive a fee when they buy or sell securities on behalf of the client.
                                    Fixed fee-based payments: Some financial advisors charge a set fee for specific services, so clients know how much they can expect to pay in advance.
                                    Hourly payments: Many financial advisors bill by the hour and may request a retainer fee prior to providing services.
                                    Management fee: Some advisors, generally those who manage the client’s complete financial portfolios, charge a percentage of the Assets Under Management (AUM) fee.
                                    Typical clienteleSome financial advisors provide their services to a wide range of customers, while others specialize in a particular type of client.Wealthy clientele: Financial advisors who gear their business towards wealthy clientele often require a minimum amount of investable assets.
                                    Young clientele: Financial advisors who work with young clientele tend to charge by the hour and offer services for customers who don't have a lot of assets.
                                    Varied clientele: Some financial advisors, particularly at large firms, work with a range of clients.
                                    Firm sizeFinancial advisors often work for firms or with groups of advisors, and these firms vary in size.​Large investment firms: Large investment firms typically have dozens of advisors and work with thousands of clients, so they have experience handling all types of financial needs but may lack personal service.
                                    Boutique investment firms: Boutique investment firms are small to medium businesses with a small group of advisors who may limit their clientele.
                                    Individual advisors: Individual financial advisors may or may not be affiliated with a larger financial advisory network.
