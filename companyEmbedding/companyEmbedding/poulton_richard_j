CHICAGO, Oct. 15, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- Allscripts announced Richard J. Poulton will join the company as Chief Financial Officer, effective October 29, 2012. 
Poulton will oversee all company finance functions including controllership, tax, financial planning and analysis, treasury, and investor relations. Mr. Poulton will report to Allscripts Chief Executive Officer Glen Tullman. 
"Rick is an accomplished and respected executive who brings a strong operational focus to Allscripts," said Tullman. "His prior experience as a public company CFO, paired with a strong record of delivering results paired with his strategic approach to financial management make him the right choice for Allscripts as we execute on our growth plans."  
Poulton brings more than 18 years of experience in financial planning, operational and business management, and development. He joins Allscripts from AAR Corporation (NYSE:   AIR), a provider of diverse products and services to the worldwide commercial aviation and government/defense industries, where he served as CFO and Treasurer. Prior to AAR, Poulton spent more than 10 years at UAL Corporation in a variety of financial and business development roles including Senior Vice President of business development as well as President and CFO of the company's client focused Loyalty Services subsidiary.
"Allscripts has a broad product portfolio, a strong client base, and a team committed to making a difference in healthcare," said Poulton. "I believe there are significant opportunities for Allscripts to lead through innovation while enhancing product focus and client experience. I am looking forward to the opportunity to work with Glen and the rest of the team as we help to transform healthcare with our clients and garner the financial advantages of doing so for our employees  and our stockholders." 
Poulton succeeds interim CFO David Morgan and will be located at Allscripts corporate headquarters in Chicago.  
Tullman also said, "I want to thank Dave Morgan for stepping up during a challenging time and filling the role during this interim period."
