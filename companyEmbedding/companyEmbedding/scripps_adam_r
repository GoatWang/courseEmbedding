What are analysts saying about Scripps Networks Interactive stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Scripps Networks Interactive stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Scripps Networks' top line in the second quarter is expected to be driven by strong growth in advertising revenues in its U.S. Networks division. The company's efforts to exapnd its operations are also impressive. The company recently announced plans to acquire Spoon University. We are also impressed by its efforts to reward shareholders. In Feb 2017, the company hiked its quarterly dividend by 20% to $0.30 per share. However, the company's high debt levels bother us. We also remain mindful of other headwinds like mounting programming costs, advertising and marketing expenses. The headwinds are likely to hurt the company's bottom line in the second quarter of 2017. Detailed results should be out on Aug 9. On the conference call, we expect an update on rumors regarding its merger with Discovery or Viacom. Shares of Scripps Networks have underperformed its industry over the past one year. " (7/25/2017)
2. Jefferies Group LLC analysts commented, "SNI reported 1Q EPS and EBITDA of $1.53 / $369M vs. JEFe $1.21 / $338M, once again beating ests on lower Op Ex at the U.S. nets – likely largely on a timing shift. Dom adv of 5.1% vs. our 6.0% est, offset by stronger affil. growth. Given weakness in the space yesterday, we believe the stock will trade higher today. Guidance Unchanged: Despite beating estimates, mgmt left the FY guidance unchanged. While we assume that the timing of expenses will push Op Ex higher in 2Q/3Q vs. 1Q/2Q, this was the same narrative in F16 (which ultimately resulted in the FY coming in stronger than expected)." (5/5/2017)
3. Stifel Nicolaus analysts commented, "We are raising our target price on Scripps to $90 following better than expected 4Q results and raising our 2017 estimates accordingly. With ratings growth across its platform, the company continues to be able to monetize on the strong scatter market to the degree that peers are less able to do so, while the focus/more limited number of channels continues to position the company well in a world of more slimmed down bundles through traditional or OTT delivery' While our operating income estimates are unchanged, as the company will spend an additional $40mn in technology spend (excluding that spend our estimates would have been increased), our EPS guidance is increased on lower D&A. We continue to see upside to estimates for 2017 given the strong ad trends in 4Q and the pacings QTD. We remain Buy rated." (2/22/2017)
4. Guggenheim analysts commented, "We have updated our outlook to reflect 4Q16 results and management guidance (summary table within). Of note, the company anticipates 6% total company revenue growth in 2017 (we now estimate 6.2% versus our prior 4.0%), including positive domestic distribution revenue growth (we estimate 5.0%). We now forecast another year of strong domestic ad growth (+7.2%) and more modest international revenue growth (+4.3%). Our 1Q and 2017 EPS forecasts now stand at $1.16 and $5.40 from $1.18 and $5.24 prior, respectively. Note that we no longer adjust acquisition amortization out of our EPS estimate. Management is confident 2017 outlook is underpinned by continued strong audience trends, as all six of the company's networks recorded total-day C3 ratings growth in 2016 and ad demand has remained strong." (2/22/2017)
5. Needham & Company LLC analysts commented, "SNI reported 4Q16 revenue of $889mm (up 4% y/y, 1% above estimates), OIBDA of $341mm, (up 7% y/y, 8% above estimates) and Adjusted EPS of $1.02 (down 25% y/y, 4% below estimates). What we liked most: 1) SNI's 2017 calendar upfront got 10-13% CPM growth rates and 'sold a similar amount of inventory' as 2016 and 'cancellations of options are practically nil'; 2) SNI's leverage ratio was 2.6x at 12/31/16, down from 2.8x 90 days ago; 3) TV Everywhere reported 'significant growth' in 2016, and 'January 2017 visitors were 2mm, up 22% over December'; 4) All six of SNI's US Networks had higher C-3 ratings and 95% of viewing was live in 2016; 5) HGTV, DIY Network and Cooking Channel each had their best ratings performance in history; 6) HGTV was the #1 cable network for upscale women (for 10th year)."

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Scripps Networks Interactive (NASDAQ:SNI) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 2 Sell Ratings, 7 Hold Ratings, 5 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.21)Consensus Price Target: $76.92 (10.98% downside)
