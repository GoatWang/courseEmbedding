Regulation D Resources prepared our offering materials for Verse Capital Ventures. We released on platforms that see virtually every major fundraising campaign today and received great reviews across the board. One specifically said, “your presentation material is as good as something we would receive from our biggest clients, like a KKR or a Kleiner Perkins Caufield Byers.” 
— Caleb Eliason, Managing Partner, Verse Capital Partners








“
Delivered far beyond expectation!  Very professional and we will continue using for future offerings.  It is a great service!

The high quality of the investor website portals developed for Cardone Acquisitions along with high quality PPM materials makes Regulation D Resources the best in the business.

I have used two different law firms for my Regulation D offerings throughout the years.  It has always bothered me not having any control over the process.  One group charged me over $30k.  After searching for an alternative, I found Regulation D Resources.  For a fraction of what the law firms charged me, I got exactly what I wanted in a timely fashion.  I won’t use anyone else.

Regulation D Resources — Private Placement Memorandums (PPMs)











































private placement memorandums





A key aspect of the Regulation D Resources services matrix is assistance in the development of ultra high specification offering documents.  A key document we assist in developing is the disclosure prospectus for the offering – commonly referred to as a Private Placement Memorandum or “PPM”. The private placement memorandum serves to disclose critical information to potential investors ensuring they are properly informed regarding the company’s operations, investment risks, SEC disclosures, and offering terms prior to investing.
A private placement memorandum will also have Exhibits to disclose additional needed information critical to the investment decision such as historical and projected financials, subscription documents, related contracts, company bylaws, and other pertinent supporting data.  For offerings executed under certain Regulation D exemptions the SEC has specific regulations that govern what is disclosed to investors.
Regulation D Resources has adopted the SEC’s Form 1A disclosure standard for use in crafting our Regulation D exempt private placement memorandum documents.  The Form 1A standard is the disclosure standard and disclosure format the SEC mandates for certain registered type securities offerings and exceeds what is typically required under a Regulation D exempt offering.  Drafting our PPM’s to this standard provides several important benefits to our clients:

A properly prepared Form 1A spec private placement memorandum protects the client more effectively than the “letter” or summary type offering documents typically prepared by other Regulation D preparatory firms
Form 1A provides for a very high specification private placement memorandum document which greatly enhances the professionalism of your disclosure package for investors
Form 1A is the disclosure standard most broker-dealer firms will require in order to have the offering approved for retail to their investor clients



Presentation GradeTM PPM Documentation
A unique aspect of our offering documents is the “Presentation Grade” quality of the private placement memorandum. Most private placement memorandum documents are comprised of basic text content with minimal presentation quality aspects. In
                fact, most lawyers and other preparatory firms use a “speed doc” type process for creating these documents which involves fill-in-the-blank forms and minimal customization and drafting. Our PPM’s are developed to a standard that far exceeds
                “typical” and truly enhances the quality of the client’s presentation to investors. Our Presentation Grade™ PPM’s are also referred to as “Tier 1 Grade” meaning they could be utilized effectively with a Tier 1 level investment bank or
                broker-dealer. Our private placement memorandum documents regularly pass compliance and legal review at FINRA broker-dealer firms as well as applicable State merit compliance review.
Our Presentation Grade™ PPM’s allow our clients to present an ultra high specification prospectus to investors which dramatically increases the quality and effectiveness of the offering and ensures investors have a high quality, professional
                perception of the client company. Each Presentation Grade™ PPM is carefully custom drafted by our expert staff to provide accurate SEC Form 1A spec disclosure and a professional grade presentation that has customized graphics and content
                specific to your business and industry.
Securing private investment successfully involves many factors and a critical factor is investor confidence. Potential investors must have confidence that the company’s management team is comprised of sophisticated professionals that will
                manage the company effectively. One of the key metrics they will use to judge your sophistication level is the quality of your investment presentation and offering documents as those documents are the primary source of information for
                potential investors. A Presentation Grade™ PPM ensures you are providing the very best PPM materials to your investor prospects.
Provided below is a sample of our Presentation Grade™ Private Placement Memorandum prospectus. The sample prospectus is for a Multi-family Property Real Estate Fund and contains fictional information about the issuer, business operations,
                and individual managers. Any similarities with an existing operational entity and/or individuals is entirely coincidental. All of our Presentation Grade PPM documents are custom created for the client and relative to their specific planned
                business operations.
Whether you are raising $250,000 or $25,000,000 – you never get a second chance to make a quality first impression with investors.
