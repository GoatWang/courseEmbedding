Liftboats


We own and operate a fleet of 19 liftboats located in West Africa and the Middle East. Our well maintained and diverse fleet of vessels range from Class 105 to Class 280 and are capable of meeting a wide range of customer needs. We possess a proven track record of providing superior, versatile and reliable services to support construction and maintenance work on offshore development projects.
 
Liftboats, commonly referred to as the “workhorse” of the offshore industry, are reliable, versatile and self-propelled. They provide a cost-effective and efficient alternative to traditional pipelay/derrick vessels. With their large, open deck areas, they are self-propelling and self-elevating. Our fleet provides a work platform for a wide range of services, from coiled tubing and wireline operations to well intervention.
 
Our vessels are operated by highly trained personnel who adhere to a commitment to deliver safe and efficient operations. We maintain a rigorous maintenance and upgrade program to keep our fleet in line with the regulations and operating standards of the regions in which we operate. In addition, our teams of certified mechanics, crane inspectors and port engineers continuously monitor the status of our fleet to ensure a standard of operational reliability.
 
For more information, please contact our International Liftboat Sales Team.

Hercules Offshore Sells Domestic Liftboats to All Coast (USA) | Offshore Energy Today

Hercules Offshore Sells Domestic Liftboats to All Coast (USA) 

zoom 
All Coast, LLC, a newly formed company for the marine services industry founded by John Powers and John Nesser III, has completed the acquisition of Hercules Offshore’s domestic liftboat assets.
This $57.5 million acquisition includes 29 actively marketed liftboats ranging from class 105 to class 229, 10 inactive liftboats and additional related assets.
All Coast is a limited liability company, newly formed for this transaction, with John Powers and John Nesser III leading as Managers and Co-CEOs.
Powers and Nesser, All Coast managers and co-chief executive officers, each have more than 40 years of experience in the oil and gas, engineering and maritime industries.
Throughout his career, Powers has owned and operated numerous energy and marine services companies including Power Offshore Services, LLC; Reeled Tubing, LLC; Seatrax, LLC; and Coastal Drilling Co.

Previously, Nesser served as the executive vice president and chief operating officer for McDermott International, where he held executive positions for more than 10 years.
All Coast domestic operations will be led by Byron Allemand, vice president and chief operating officer, and the operations center will remain in Lafayette, La.
Nesser commented that “John and I have been looking for the opportunity to re-enter the liftboat industry as owners and operators for several years.
“We look forward to the challenge of serving the offshore market with the highest standards of service and safety,” Nesser further noted. “We expect to grow All Coast and expand our fleet with new acquisitions and new builds.”
Joining Powers and Nesser is The Fleming Corporation, a private equity investment firm that will provide capital and a long-term perspective on value creation. The new owners are committed to growing the fleet’s market-leading position. Financing for the acquisition and working capital has been provided by Whitney Bank.
