Publisher's Description▼▲
They always manage to knock on your door at the worst possible times. It's difficult to talk to Jehovah's Witnesses because they test your Bible knowledge and spiritual endurance. But the effort is worth it, because they need to hear the gospel from you. Reed, a former JW elder, closely examines the Jehovah's Witnesses' favorite Bible verses and discusses other important verses they ignore.


Author Bio▼▲
David A. Reed is the author of Jehovah's Witnesses Answered Verse by Verse and coauthor of Mormons Answered Verse y Verse. He is also the author of Behind the Watchtower Curtain and several other books exposing the errors of Jehovah's Witnesses.

            This is an excellent book to read to find out the teachings of Jehovah's Witnesses.  It goes verse by verse and then it gives you an explanation of their belief and how to show them that their interpretation of the bible is incorrect.  I recommend you purchase this book if you know someone who is thinking about becoming a Jehovah's Witness or to give current Jehovah's Witnesses something to think about.  It is a must that you read it first before you try to witness to a Jehovah's Witness.  With this book you don't have to hide when they come knocking at your door.

            I really enjoyed this book.  It answered all of my questions about Jesus, God, and the Holy Spirit.  Jehovah Witnesses should read this book it explains everything so well and shows you the scripture in the bible that supports the topic.

            This book is awesome.  The author is an ex-JW and can speak with authority to what they falsely teach and believe.  This book gives me confidence to defend Biblical Christianity and converse intelligently with well trained JW's who seem to jump from verse to verse.  It explains why they believe what they believe and allows me to present the REAL truth.  Awesome resource!

            An excellent reference for the beliefs of JWs, how those beliefs compare to Christianity, and how to combat the JW rapid fire verse-spewing approach to conversion.  I have an interest in apologetics, and a friend thats a JW.  Ive been frustrated at never knowing what to say to him or where to look in the Bible to counter his arguments for his faith.  This book is definitely the answer.  Not only does the author quote scripture, but he also quotes Watchtower literature that illustrates the contradictions and fallacies of the JW mindset.  It's a small book, and makes for a relatively quick and easy read.  Or it can be used as a reference manual (verse-by-verse setup).  If you are a Christian who knows a Jehovahs Witness, or a Jehovahs Witness who wants to know more about Christianity, or if you just want to be prepared next time they knock on your door, buy this book.

            This book does an excellent job of showing just what the J W's believe and gives you great tools on how to teach JW's the true Gospel of Christ
