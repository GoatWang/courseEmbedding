MILWAUKEE, Oct. 28, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Telkonet, Inc. (OTCQB: TKOI), whose complementary business divisions include EcoSmart™, the leading energy management technology platform featuring Recovery Time™ technology, and EthoStream®, one of the largest hospitality High-Speed Internet Access providers in the world, today announced the receipt of official Anatel certification in Brazil for its EcoConnect, EcoSense, and EcoInsight product lines.  Anatel certification provides official approval from the Brazilian government for distribution and use of communications products.  

Communication products and accessories, including products that encompass modems, Wi-Fi routers and radio-electrical spectrum for signal transmission, used in Brazil are required to have certification and homologation by the Brazilian Telecommunication Agency (Agência Nacional de Telecomunicações or Anatel).  Certification and homologation services for Anatel are provided through a series of testing and inspections performed by TÜV Rheinland, a global leader in independent testing, inspection, and certification services, ensuring quality and safety for people, the environment and technology in nearly all aspects of life. This certification permits legal importation of products made outside of Brazil and enables the use of relevant products in the country.  
The Anatel certifications for Telkonet products were sponsored and paid for by the Company's partner in Brazil, Evolutix, as part of their collaboration for penetrating the Brazilian Hospitality market, which has been rapidly adopting energy efficiency and management solutions.  Based in Brazil, Evolutix focuses on commercial building projects that require the design and implementation of intelligent systems for building infrastructure, power grids, and lighting that minimize energy use and enhance sustainability.  
"We're thrilled to have received approval following a five-month certification process that will now permit our products to be imported and used in Brazil," stated Jason Tienor, CEO of Telkonet. "We're very pleased with the positive outcome as well as the ongoing participation and support by our partner Evolutix.  Telkonet will now be able to expand our activities in Brazil knowing that we have unfettered access to the market with a strong partner."
"We look forward to a mutually rewarding relationship with expanding opportunities for EcoSmart product installations and delighted clients in Brazil," said Pedro Moreira, Chief Executive Officer at Evolutix.  "We are off to an excellent start with Telkonet and see a tremendous market opportunity for both of our companies."
Earlier this year, Telkonet announced its successful expansion in Brazil through its strategic relationship with channel partner Evolutix.  The companies have been collaborating on the sale and installation of EcoSmart Energy Management technology in a number of hotel and hospitality properties, including the marque Hilton Barra Hotel project in Rio de Janeiro.  
The Hilton Barra Hotel project calls for the use of EcoInsight, a revolutionary energy management thermostat, EcoSense, an in-room occupancy sensor, and EcoConnect, which creates a fully networked energy management solution.  The hotel's Property Management System (PMS) will be interfaced with EcoSmart platform products and its EcoCentral Virtual EngineerTM, the energy management command center that allows Telkonet's customer service team as well as property and asset managers the ability to monitor and manage cost savings room-by-room.  
ABOUT EVOLUTIXEvolutix, headquartered in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, is a world leader in developing and implementing sustainable energy consumption strategies for both new construction and also retro-commissioning projects to maximize return on investment.  For more information, visit, www.evolutix.net
ABOUT TELKONETTelkonet is a leading energy management technology provider offering hardware, software and services to Commercial customers throughout the world.  The Company's complementary business divisions include EcoSmart™, an energy management technology platform featuring Recovery Time™ technology, and EthoStream®, one of the largest hospitality High-Speed Internet Access networks in the world.  www.telkonet.com

EcoSmart - EcoSmart Intelligent Energy Management System
EcoSmart is a cloud-based wireless energy management system that aggressively reduces utility costs while maintaining room comfort in spaces with unpredictable occupancy patterns. The EcoSmart suite of products includes intelligent thermostats, outlets and switches that can be networked and integrated with many other ZigBee® wireless enabled room automation devices and communicate with BACnet® compatible HVAC control systems. 

EcoSmart is built on a robust, secure wireless network and utiliz






 
 


EcoInsight - Energy Management Thermostat






 
The EcoInsight is a programmable thermostat that samples 132 data points to control the efficiency of HVAC equipment. The EcoInsight provides compatibility across a wide variety of HVAC systems and is easily installed on packaged terminal air conditioners, fan coils, heat pumps, split systems, and more.
 
 
 
 





 
 


EcoSwitch - Energy-Efficient Light Switch






 
The EcoSwitch individually addressable energy management light switch controls lighting with commands from an EcoSmart thermostat or occupancy sensor, an EcoCentral schedule or manual command, BMS or hotel Property Management System that determines sold/unsold room status.
 
 
 
 





 
 


EcoContact - Infra-Red Occupancy Control






 
The EcoContact is a motion sensor and magnetic contact equipped with a ZigBee module for wireless operation. The EcoContact is used to monitor the position of doors or windows and save energy when they are left open.
 
 
 
 





 
 


EcoView - In-Room Occupancy Sensor






 
The EcoView is a passive infra-red (PIR) detector that evaluates both body temperature and motion to ensure accurate occupancy detection. The EcoView also includes an integrated photometer light level sensor to increase the accuracy of occupant detection in low-light conditions.
 
 
 
 





 
 


EcoWave - Remote Thermostat Package






 
The EcoWave wireless HVAC controller package has two hardware components: the wireless EcoAir battery-powered display unit and the EcoSource HVAC controller. The EcoSource is connected to the HVAC unit for physical control of the system. The EcoAir display can be placed in the optimal location for both temperature measurement and ease of use.
 
 
 
 





 
 


EcoGuard - Energy Management Outlet and Meter






 
The EcoGuard is an intelligent power outlet that monitors and stops the flow of power to one or both outlets, turning off energy-consuming loads. The EcoGuard combats “energy vampires”, or devices on standby power, that continue to draw energy from a power outlet.
