NEW YORK, July 27, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- E-compass Acquisition Corp. (Nasdaq:    ECAC) (the "Company", "we" or "our"), a special purpose acquisition company, announced today that it entered into a definitive merger agreement (the "Merger Agreement") with NYM Holding, Inc. ("NYM"). NYM, a Delaware corporation, is a fast growing Asian/Chinese grocery supermarket chain in the north-eastern U.S. providing food and other merchandise hard to find in mainstream grocery stores.
The Transaction








Upon consummation of the transaction contemplated by the definitive merger agreement, (i) ECAC will redomesticate to Delaware by merge with and into iFresh Inc.("iFresh"), a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of ECAC, and (ii) immediately after the redomestication, iFresh Merger Sub Inc. ("Merger Sub"), a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of iFresh, will be merged with and into NYM, resulting NYM being a wholly owned subsidiary of iFresh. 
Pursuant to the definitive merger agreement, the Company would pay NYM's current stockholders an aggregate of $125 million in connection with the transaction: (i) $5 million in cash, plus, (ii) 12,000,000 shares of common stock of iFresh to be issued to the selling shareholders valued at $10.00 per share (the deemed value of the shares in the Acquisition Agreement). The transaction is conditioned on the surviving company receiving a loan of at least $15 million in connection with the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.  If the transaction closes, iFresh will also receive an option to acquire an additional five supermarkets prior to March 31, 2017 for consideration of $10 million in cash. The transaction is expected to close before the end of 2016.

NYM currently has two wholesale facilities and eight retail supermarkets across New York, Massachusetts and Florida, with annual revenue of $131.2 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016.

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for E-compass Acquisition Corp. - (NASDAQ:ECAC) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: No ratings tracked in the last 12 months.Consensus Rating:N/A (Score: NaN)Consensus Price Target: N/A

You should be aware of all the risks associated with trading, and seek advice from your broker and or an independent financial advisor if you have any doubts.

E-compass Acquisition Corp. Announces Pricing of Initial Public Offering






Aug 13, 2015, 6:00am EDT














NEW YORK, Aug. 13, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- E-compass Acquisition Corp. (NASDAQ: ECACU) (the "Company") today announced the pricing of its initial public offering of 4,000,000 units at an offering price of $10.00 per unit for aggregate gross proceeds of $40,000,000. Each unit consists of one ordinary share, par value $.0001 per share, and one right to receive one-tenth of one ordinary share upon consummation of an initial business combination.  
The units are expected to begin trading Thursday, August 13, 2015 on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol "ECACU." Once the securities comprising the units begin separate trading, the ordinary shares and rights are expected to be listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbols "ECAC" and "ECACR," respectively.
The Company is a Cayman Islands exempted company incorporated as a blank check company formed for the purpose of entering into a share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities, or entering into contractual arrangements that give it control over such a target business. The Company's efforts to identify a prospective target business will not be limited to a particular industry or geographic region of the world, although the Company initially intends to focus on target businesses in the People's Republic of China that operate in the e-commerce and consumer retail industry.
Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. is acting as the sole underwriter for the offering. The offering is being made only by means of a prospectus, copies of which may be obtained from Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., 499 Park Avenue, 5th Floor, New York, NY 10022 Attention: Capital Markets, email: Prospectus@Cantor.com.
This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction.
Forward Looking Statements
This press release includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.  Forward looking statements are statements that are not historical facts. Such forward-looking statements, including the successful consummation of the Company's initial public offering, are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ from the forward looking statements. The Company expressly disclaims any obligations or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect any change in the Company's expectations with respect thereto or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any statement is based.

We estimate that the net proceeds of this offering, in addition to the funds we
will receive from the sale of the private units (all of which will be deposited
into the trust account), will be as set forth in the following table:

(1) A portion of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration fee,
    the FINRA filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the Nasdaq listing fee
    and a portion of the legal and audit fees, have been paid from the funds we
    received from Lodestar Investment Holdings I LLC, an affiliate of Richard Xu
    described below. These funds will be repaid out of the proceeds of this
    offering available to us.

(2) The underwriting discount of 3.0% is payable at the closing of the offering
    and the deferred underwriting fee of 1.5% (and 4.5% on gross proceeds
    received from the over-allotment option) payable to Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. is
    payable upon consummation of our initial business combination and will be
    held in the trust account until consummation of such business combination.
    Additionally, in the event that investors introduced by us to the
    underwriter do not purchase at least $20,000,000 of the units being offered
    hereby, there will be an additional underwriting commission paid to the
    underwriter in the amount of $0.15 per unit (1.5%) on the amount below
    $20,000,000 invested by investors introduced by us, which will not affect
    the amount in trust due to the obligation of our initial shareholders to
    purchase commission units. No discounts or commissions will be paid with
    respect to the purchase of the private units.

(3) The amount of proceeds not held in trust will remain constant at $600,000
    even if the over-allotment is exercised. In addition, interest income earned on
    the amounts held in the trust account (after payment of taxes owed on such
    interest income) will be available to us to pay for our working capital
    requirements. We estimate the interest earned on the trust account will be
    approximately $30,000 over a 18-month period assuming an interest rate of
    approximately 0.05% per year.

(4) These are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all of these
    items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, we may
    incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates in
    connection with negotiating and structuring our initial business combination
    based upon the level of complexity of that business combination. We do not
    anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than
    fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which
    fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific
    category of expenses, would be deducted from our excess working capital.

An affiliate of Richard Xu, our Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,
has committed to purchase an aggregate of 310,000 private units at a price of
$10.00 per unit ($3,100,000 in the aggregate). This affiliate has also agreed
that if investors introduced by us to the underwriter do not purchase at least
$20,000,000 of the units being offered hereby, it will purchase from us at a
price of $10.00 per unit the number of commission units (up to an aggregate of
110,000 commission units) that will equal the increased commissions we will pay
the underwriter, as described above, and to cover the additional $0.40 that
public investors may receive upon conversion or liquidation to total $10.40 per
share, as described elsewhere herein. All of the proceeds we receive from these
purchases will be placed in the trust account described below.

$40,800,000, or $46,800,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full,
of net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private units will be
placed in an account at Morgan Stanley in the United States, maintained by
Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New York, New York, as trustee. The
funds held in trust will be invested only in United States government treasury
bills, bonds or notes having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market
funds meeting the applicable conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the
Investment Company Act of 1940 and that invest solely in United States
government treasuries, so that we are not deemed to be an investment company
under the Investment Company Act. Except with respect to (i) interest earned on
the funds held in the trust account that may be released to us to pay our income
or other tax obligations and (ii) any remaining interest earned on the funds
held in the trust account that may be released to us for our working capital
requirements, the proceeds will not be released from the trust account until the
earlier of the completion of a business combination or our liquidation. The
proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay the
sellers of a target business with which we complete a business combination. Any
amounts not paid as consideration to the sellers of the target business may be
used to finance operations of the target business.

No compensation of any kind (including finder’s, consulting or other similar
fees) will be paid to any of our existing officers, directors, shareholders, or
any of their affiliates, prior to, or for any services they render in order to
effectuate, the consummation of the business combination (regardless of the type
of transaction that it is). However, such individuals will receive reimbursement
for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on
our behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses, performing business
due diligence on suitable target businesses and business combinations as well as
traveling to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective
target businesses to examine their operations. Since the role of present
management after a business combination is uncertain, we have no ability to
determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a
business combination.

Regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full, the net
proceeds from this offering available to us out of trust for our working capital
requirements in searching for a business combination will be approximately
$600,000. In addition, interest earned on the funds held in the trust account
(after payment of taxes owed on such interest income) may be released to us to
fund our working capital requirements in searching for a business combination.
We intend to use the excess working capital available for miscellaneous expenses
such as paying fees to consultants to assist us with our search for a target
business and for director and officer liability insurance premiums, with the
balance being held in reserve in the event due diligence, legal, accounting and
other expenses of structuring and negotiating business combinations exceed our
estimates, as well as for reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred
by our initial shareholders, officers and directors in connection with
activities on our behalf as described above.

The allocation of the net proceeds available to us outside of the trust account,
along with the available interest earned on the funds held in the trust account,
represents our best estimate of the intended uses of these funds. In the event
that our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may reallocate some of such
proceeds within the above described categories. If our estimate of the costs of
undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating our initial business
combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so, or the amount of
interest available from the trust account is insufficient as a result of the
current low interest rate environment, we may be required to raise additional
capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently
unascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional capital through
loans or additional investments from members of our management team, but such
members of our management team are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

We will likely use a substantial portion of the net proceeds of this offering,
including the funds held in the trust account, to acquire a target business and
to pay our expenses relating thereto. To the extent that our share capital is
used in whole or in part as consideration to effect a business combination, the
proceeds held in the trust account which are not used to consummate a business
combination will be disbursed to the combined company and will, along with any
other net proceeds not expended, be used as working capital to finance the
operations of the target business. Such working capital funds could be used in a
variety of ways including continuing or expanding the target business’
operations, for strategic acquisitions and for marketing, research and
development of existing or new products.

To the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination, we will pay
the costs of liquidating our trust account from our remaining assets outside of
the trust account. If such funds are insufficient, Richard Xu and Chen Liu have
agreed to advance us the funds necessary to complete such liquidation (currently
anticipated to be no more than $15,000) and have agreed not to seek repayment of
such expenses.

As of March 31, 2015, Lodestar Investment Holdings I LLC, an affiliate of
Richard Xu, loaned to us an aggregate of $115,000 to be used to pay a portion of
the expenses of this offering referenced in the line items above for SEC
registration fee, FINRA filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the Nasdaq
listing fee and a portion of the legal and audit fees and expenses. In April
2015, Lodestar Investment Holdings I LLC loaned us an additional $50,000. The
loans are payable without interest on the earlier of (i) October 31, 2015, (ii)
the date on which we consummate our initial public offering or (iii) the date on
which we determine to not proceed with our initial public offering. The loans
will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering available to us for payment
of offering expenses.

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds (which includes amounts that may be released to us from the
trust account) to operate for the next 18 months, assuming that a business
combination is not consummated during that time. However, if necessary, in order
to meet our working capital needs following the consummation of this offering,
our initial shareholders, officers and directors or their affiliates may, but
are not obligated to, loan us funds, from time to time or at any time, in
whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion. Each loan would
be evidenced by a promissory note. The notes would either be paid upon
consummation of our initial business combination, without interest, or, at the
lender’s discretion, up to $500,000 of the notes may be converted upon
consummation of our business combination into additional private units at a
price of $10.00 per unit (which, for example, would result in the holders being
issued 55,000 ordinary shares if $500,000 of notes were so converted since the
50,000 rights included in the private units would result in the issuance of
5,000 ordinary shares upon the closing of our business combination). Our
shareholders have approved the issuance of the units and underlying securities
upon conversion of such notes, to the extent the holder wishes to so convert
them at the time of the consummation of our initial business combination. If we
do not complete our initial business combination, the loans would not be repaid.

A public shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account to
the extent not previously released to us) only in the event of (i) our
liquidation if we have not completed a business combination within the required
time period or (ii) if that public shareholder converts such shares in
connection with a business combination which we consummate or a vote to amend
the provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of
association relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-business combination
activity. In no other circumstances will a public shareholder have any right or
interest of any kind to or in the trust account.


In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business, we may encounter
intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to
ours. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience
identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates.
Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources
than us and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted
with those of many of these competitors. While we believe there may be numerous
potential target businesses that we could acquire with the net proceeds of this
offering, our ability to compete in acquiring certain sizable target businesses
may be limited by our available financial resources.

The following also may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses:

• our obligation to seek shareholder approval of a business combination may
  delay the completion of a transaction;

• our obligation to convert ordinary shares held by our public shareholders
  (but not our initial shareholders or non-tendering investors with respect to
  up to 1,000,000 ordinary shares purchased in this offering) may reduce the
  resources available to us for a business combination;

• Nasdaq may require us to file a new listing application and meet its initial
  listing requirements to maintain the listing of our securities following a
  business combination;

• our outstanding rights and unit purchase options, and the potential future
  dilution they represent;

• our obligation to either repay or issue private units upon conversion of up to
  $500,000 of working capital loans that may be made to us by our initial
  shareholders, officers, directors or their affiliates;

• our obligation to register the resale of the insider shares, as well as the
  private units (and underlying securities) and any securities issued to our
  initial shareholders, officers, directors or their affiliates upon conversion of
  working capital loans; and

• the impact on the target business’ assets as a result of unknown liabilities
  under the securities laws or otherwise depending on developments involving us
  prior to the consummation of a business combination.

Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully
negotiating a business combination. Our management believes, however, that our
status as a public entity and potential access to the United States public
equity markets may give us a competitive advantage over privately-held entities
having a similar business objective as ours in acquiring a target business with
significant growth potential on favorable terms.

If we succeed in effecting a business combination, there will be, in all
likelihood, intense competition from competitors of the target business. We
cannot assure you that, subsequent to a business combination, we will have the
resources or ability to compete effectively.


Company Description
We were formed for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset
acquisition, share purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or similar
business combination with one or more businesses or entities, which we refer to
as a “target business,” or entering into contractual arrangements


 that give us
control over such a target business. While our efforts to identify a prospective
target business will not necessarily be limited to a particular industry or
geographic region of the world, we initially intend to focus our search on
target businesses located in the People’s Republic of China as well as the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region and the Macau Special Administrative Region
(but not Taiwan), which we refer collectively throughout this prospectus as
“China” or the “PRC,” that operate in the e-commerce and consumer retail
industry. We believe that companies that operate in the e-commerce and consumer
retail industry in China will perform favorably over the next decade due to the
following reasons:

• Rising spending power of Chinese consumers;

• China’s online shopping population is relatively underpenetrated;

• An increase in categories of products and services online;

• Increased usage of mobile devices;

• China’s offline retail market faces significant challenges;

• Offline retailers are starting to use online marketplaces to grow their
  business;

• Growth in China’s consumption;

• Growth in the number of people in China that have access to the Internet; and

• Greater availability of goods online across consumption categories.

We do not have any specific business combination under consideration and we have
not (nor has anyone on our behalf), directly or indirectly, contacted any
prospective target business or had any discussions, formal or otherwise, with
respect to such a transaction. Accordingly, we may not be able to locate a
suitable or attractive target business to consummate an initial business
combination with.

We will have until 18 months from the consummation of this offering to
consummate our initial business combination. If we are unable to consummate our
initial business combination within such time period, we will distribute the
aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, pro rata to the holders
of the ordinary shares which are being sold as part of the units in this public
offering (whether they are purchased in the public offering or in the
aftermarket) by way of redemption and cease all operations except for the
purposes of winding up of our affairs.

Pursuant to the Nasdaq listing rules, our initial business combination must be
with a target business or businesses whose collective fair market value is at
least equal to 80% of the balance in the trust account at the time of the
execution of a definitive agreement for such business combination, although this
may entail simultaneous acquisitions of several target businesses. The fair
market value of the target will be determined by our board of directors based
upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community (such
as actual and potential sales, earnings, cash flow and/or book value). The
target business or businesses that we acquire may have a collective fair market
value substantially in excess of 80% of the trust account balance. We are not
required to obtain an opinion from an unaffiliated third party that the target
business we select has a fair market value in excess of at least 80% of the
balance of the trust account unless our board of directors cannot make such
determination on its own.

We currently anticipate structuring our initial business combination to acquire
100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We
may, however, structure our initial business combination where we merge directly
with the target business or where we acquire less than 100% of such interests or
assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target
management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete
such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50%
or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target (whether through
outright ownership or through contractual arrangements) or otherwise acquires a
controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to
register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended, or the Investment Company Act. The government of the PRC has restricted
or limited foreign ownership of certain kinds of assets and companies operating
in a wide variety of industries, including some online and mobile commerce
businesses. Accordingly, we may need to structure our transaction to acquire a
target business using contractual arrangements through variable interest
entities, which are entities 100% owned by Chinese citizens. Even if the
post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities
of the target, our shareholders prior to the business combination may
collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending
on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination
transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a
substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital
shares of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest
in the target; however, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of
new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial business
combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent
to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests
or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the
post-transaction company, only the portion of such business or businesses that
is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net
assets test.

If any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination
opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to which he has
pre-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations, he may be required to present
such business combination opportunity to such entity prior to presenting such
business combination opportunity to us. All of our officers and directors
currently have certain pre-existing fiduciary duties or contractual obligations.
Additionally, each of Richard Xu, our Executive Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer, Peiling (Amy) He, our Chief Financial Officer, and Aimin Song, one of
our Directors, is also an officer and/or director of Sino Mercury Acquisition
Corp., or Sino Mercury, a blank check company formed to effect a merger, capital
stock exchange, asset acquisition or other similar business combination with one
or more businesses or entities. On April 24, 2015, Sino Mercury entered into an
Agreement and Plan of Reorganization with Wins Finance Group Ltd., or WFG, an
integrated financing solution provider with operations located primarily in
Jinzhong City, Shanxi Province and Beijing, China. Pursuant to the Agreement and
Plan of Reorganization, Sino Mercury is currently prohibited from reviewing
alternative transactions. Accordingly, at this time, Mr. Xu, Ms. He and Mr. Song
have no obligation to present business opportunities to Sino Mercury prior to
presenting them to us. If the business combination between Sino Mercury and WFG
is not completed for any reason, then Sino Mercury will have until June 1, 2016
(or September 1, 2016 if certain conditions are met) to complete another
business combination. Each of Mr. Xu, Ms. He and Mr. Song would then be required
to present all business opportunities which are suitable for Sino Mercury to
Sino Mercury prior to presenting them to us.
