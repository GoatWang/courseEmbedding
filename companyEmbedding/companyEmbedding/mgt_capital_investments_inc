Company Information

MGT Capital Investments, Inc. (OTCPink: MGTI)
MGT Capital Investments, Inc. (OTC: MGTI) is in the process of acquiring and developing a diverse portfolio of cyber security technologies. With industry pioneer John McAfee at its helm, MGT is positioned to address various cyber threats through advanced protection technologies for mobile and personal tech devices, as well as corporate networks. The Company's first product, Sentinel, an enterprise class network intrusion detector, is scheduled to be released by the end of June 2017. The Company also has entered into a joint venture with Nordic IT to develop and market a mobile phone with extensive privacy and anti-hacking features.

Also as part of its corporate efforts in secure technologies, MGT is growing its capacity in mining Bitcoin. Currently at 5.0 PH/s, the Company's facility in WA state produces about 80 Bitcoins per month, ranking it as one of the largest U.S. based Bitcoin miners. Further, MGT is in active discussions with financial partners to grow Bitcoin output materially.
Lastly, MGT stockholders have voted to change the corporate name of MGT to "John McAfee Global Technologies, Inc."  Following a dispute over ownership and permitted usage of the name McAfee, The Company and Intel have agreed to a mediation process to avoid unnecessary legal costs.

 John McAfee Provides Update on MGT Sentinel
Download PDF


DURHAM, N.C., April 12, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- MGT Capital Investments, Inc. (OTC: MGTI) today provided an update on MGT Sentinel, an intrusion monitoring platform designed to protect corporate and enterprise intranets from sophisticated hacking threats. 
John McAfee, Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of MGT, explained, "When I joined MGT, my stated mission was to deliver the next generation of cybersecurity technology to the marketplace. Sentinel was acquired because the principles and technology foundation nearly exactly match the needs of enterprise clients in today's IT environment. By building onto this base hardware, we had hoped to jumpstart normal timelines and deliver a world class product at the end of last year. During its limited initial release, we challenged the best hackers in the world to exploit MGT Sentinel. Unfortunately, the product proved vulnerable on both the server and sensor side, and was not foolproof as I had promised.
"The Company also was also hampered by corporate events that limited its access to capital and prevented it from quickly ramping up its tech team, particularly in light of the termination of our planned merger agreement. We have since restructured our technical team and engaged Chris Roberts, the world-renowned cybersecurity expert, to replace our former interim Chief Technology Officer. Under the lead direction of Chris, Sentinel has completed a redesign and all issues uncovered by our hacker testing have been addressed."
Mr. Roberts stated, "Sentinel has been re-engineered with a greater understanding of the latest exploits. We know how the attackers work, so Sentinel has been enhanced to blend seamlessly within its environment by maintaining the appropriate port and service configurations. Sentinel's advanced capabilities will monitor extraneous traffic to identify legitimate threats within seconds."
Mr. McAfee concluded, "I'm excited to announce that we are now at the stage that I can promise an outstanding product. We expect prototypes in the next several weeks to give us success with a large distribution partner, with sales beginning by the end of this quarter."
The Company also invites shareholders to view a message from Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, John McAfee.
About MGT Capital Investments, Inc. 
MGT Capital Investments, Inc. (OTC: MGTI) is in the process of acquiring and developing a diverse portfolio of cyber security technologies. With industry pioneer John McAfee at its helm, MGT is positioned to address various cyber threats through advanced protection technologies for mobile and personal technology devices, as well as corporate networks.
Also as part of its corporate efforts in secure technologies, MGT is growing its capacity in mining Bitcoin. Currently at 5.0 PH/s, the Company's facility in WA state produces about 100 Bitcoins per month, ranking it as one of the largest U.S. based Bitcoin miners. Further, MGT is in active discussions with financial partners to grow Bitcoin output materially.
Lastly, MGT stockholders have voted to change the corporate name of MGT to "John McAfee Global Technologies, Inc." Following a dispute over ownership and permitted usage of the name McAfee, The Company and Intel have agreed to a mediation process to avoid unnecessary legal costs.

By offering a bitcoin derivative product with regulatory structure and controls, TeraExchange created an exciting opportunity for institutional investors to confidently participate in bitcoin the marketplace              HARRISON, N.Y., Feb. 27, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- MGT Capital Investments, Inc. (NYSE MKT: MGT) announced today that it has entered into a Letter of Intent ("LOI") with Tera Group, Inc., ("Tera") owner of TeraExchange, LLC, a Swap Execution Facility regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ("CFTC").  Pursuant to the LOI, both companies will work diligently to finalize and execute a definitive agreement by March 16, 2015. MGT will then file a combination S-4 Prospectus and Proxy Statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Under the contemplated terms of the agreement, and subject to stockholder approval, MGT will issue shares of its common stock to the current owners of Tera, representing 70% of the pro forma equity of the combined companies at closing. Tera has played a leading role in the development of bitcoin derivatives. In September 2014, Tera launched on TeraExchange the first regulated Bitcoin derivative products, and a spot Bitcoin price index.  Trading of USD/Bitcoin derivatives is subject to the rules and regulations of TeraExchange and the CFTC.  The Tera Bitcoin Price Index ("TeraBit") employs a dynamic algorithm that compiles and filters data on a real-time basis from a number of widely utilized global Bitcoin spot exchanges.  The TeraBit Index will be used as the settlement rate for USD/Bitcoin derivatives transactions.   "Growing consumer and merchant adoption of bitcoin is driving demand for regulated capital markets solutions. By combining with MGT, Tera will create a unique public offering to support the essential infrastructure needed for a vibrant global bitcoin ecosystem," said Christian D. Martin, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder of Tera.

Tera is led by a talented management team with a combined 47 years of experience in capital markets and derivative products, 43 years in legal and regulatory, and 46 years in technology development and engineering.

Only a tiny fraction of his one-time $100 million net worth survived the 2008 market crash. But his fortunes really took a hit in 2012, when McAfee fled Belize police who aggressively sought him for questioning on the death of his neighbor.  The government raided his jungle compound and seized everything inside. The buildings on McAfee's property later burned down under suspicious circumstances.  "Everything I owned was in Belize. I left with nothing in my pocket," he said.  McAfee said most of his remaining riches were in the vast art collection he left behind. He claims that the Belize government auctioned off many of his belongings, but his art pieces never showed up.  McAfee is now living in an apartment in Montreal, Canada, with his wife Janice. He's getting by on consulting work -- shelling out advice to firms on acquisitions, technology and internal restructuring."  http://money.cnn.com/2014/01/08/technology/john-mcafee/    Actual unretouched selfie of John McAfee - seriously!   "Known for his outspokenness and getting himself into a spot of trouble, John McAfee is certainly a colourful character in the tech industry. Since he became a suspect in the death of his neighbour in Belize back in 2012, McAfee has been arrested for driving under the influence with a handgun, revealed he is running for President, and released a bizarre video featuring scantily clad women, ‘bath salts’ and a guide on how to uninstall McAfee Antivirus." - http://money.cnn.com/2014/01/08/technology/john-mcafee/   Trailer for Showtime documentary "Gringo: The Dangerous Life of John McAfee" -  http://www.sho.com/video/50863/gringo-trailer     MGT changed to MGTI, and delisted from the NYSE Amex to the OTC.:   http://otce.finra.org/DLAdditions  Who is the face of Future Tense?
