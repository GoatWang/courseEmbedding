Testimonial on Service
						I have had excellent service from your company. No matter how serious it seems, you are always are able to fix it in a short amount of time. We do not always get the same person, but they all treat our needs with the same concern and confidence that they can take care of our machines problem.
					

						M.L (Portland, OR)
					





Sales and Service
						We were looking to improve our printing capabilities and our current suppliers were unable or unwilling to understand our needs. From the first day to current we received much better than expected service. Even after the lease was signed we were treated like we were their only customer. I highly recommend Pacific Office Automation.
					

						Kevin Griffin (Bend, OR)
					





Timely and Efficient Customer Service
						We value the timely and efficient customer service that Pacific Office Automation provides for us. Whether it's a hardware or supply request, POA always gets back to us quickly and helps us solve problems that keep our business running smoothly. It's nice to know that even in today's fast-paced world of business that POA is a company that puts the customer first.

Testimonial on Service
						I have had excellent service from your company. No matter how serious it seems, you are always are able to fix it in a short amount of time. We do not always get the same person, but they all treat our needs with the same concern and confidence that they can take care of our machines problem.
					

						M.L (Portland, OR)
					





Sales and Service
						We were looking to improve our printing capabilities and our current suppliers were unable or unwilling to understand our needs. From the first day to current we received much better than expected service. Even after the lease was signed we were treated like we were their only customer. I highly recommend Pacific Office Automation.
					

						Kevin Griffin (Bend, OR)
					





Timely and Efficient Customer Service
						We value the timely and efficient customer service that Pacific Office Automation provides for us. Whether it's a hardware or supply request, POA always gets back to us quickly and helps us solve problems that keep our business running smoothly. It's nice to know that even in today's fast-paced world of business that POA is a company that puts the customer first.
