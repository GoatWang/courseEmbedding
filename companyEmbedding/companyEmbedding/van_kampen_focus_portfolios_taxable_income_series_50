VAN KAMPEN FOCUS PORTFOLIOS (SM)
 A DIVISION OF VAN KAMPEN FUNDS INC.
 INSURED INCOME TRUST, SERIES 92

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Van Kampen Focus Portfolios Insured Income Trust, Series 92 invests in a  
portfolio of long-term bonds. The Trust seeks to provide a high level of current
income and to preserve capital. The Trust is a unit investment trust included in
Van Kampen Focus Portfolios, Taxable Income Series 7.                           

                                          Monthly                Semi-Annual

                                       -------------            ------------
    Estimated Current Return:           6.03%                    6.07%
    Estimated Long Term Return:         6.01%                    6.05%
       CUSIP:                           92114K-50-1 92114K-51-9

Estimated current return shows the estimated cash you should receive each 
year divided by the Unit price. Estimated long term return shows the estimated  
return over the estimated life of your Trust. We base this estimate on an       
average of the bond yields over their estimated life. This estimate also        
reflects the sales charge and estimated expenses. We derive the average yield   
for your portfolio by weighting each bond's yield by its value and estimated    
life. Unlike estimated current return, estimated long term return accounts for  
maturities, discounts and premiums of the bonds. These estimates show a         
comparison rather than a prediction of returns. No return calculation can       
predict your actual return. Your actual return may vary from these estimates.   

 PROSPECTUS PART I
 MAY 1, 2002

 This prospectus contains two parts.

 No one may use this Prospectus Part I unless accompanied by Prospectus Part II.

 YOU SHOULD READ THIS PROSPECTUS AND RETAIN IT FOR FUTURE REFERENCE.

   The Securities and Exchange Commission has not approved or disapproved of

(1)  Some bonds may mature or be called or sold during your Trust's life. This  
could include a call or sale at a price below par value. We cannot    
   guarantee that the value of your units will equal the principal amount of
bonds per unit when you redeem them or when your trust terminates.    

(2)  After the first settlement date (May 6, 2002), you will pay accrued        
interest from this date to your settlement date less interest         
distributions.                                                        

(3)  We base this amount on estimated cash flows per Unit. This amount will vary
with changes in expenses, interest rates and maturity, call or sale of
bonds. The Information Supplement includes the estimated cash flows.  

(4)  This shows estimated expenses in the first year other than insurance       
expenses. Estimated expenses are expected to fluctuate periodically.  

(5)  Your Trust assesses this fee per $1,000 principal amount of bonds. Your    
   Trust assesses other fees per Unit. (6) During the first year the Trustee
    will reduce its fee by approximately $.19 per Unit (which is the estimated
   interest to be earned prior to the expected delivery dates for the "when,
    as and if issued" or "delayed delivery" bonds). Should the interest exceed
  this amount, the Trustee will reduce its fee up to its annual fee. After
the first year, the Trustee's fee will be the amount indicated above. 
    Estimated interest income will increase to $62.62. Estimated expenses will
    increase to $2.32 and $1.92 under the monthly and semi-annual distribution
  plans, respectively. Estimated net interest income will remain as shown.

NOTES TO PORTFOLIO 

(1) The bonds are represented by "regular way" or "when issued" contracts for   
  the performance of which an irrevocable letter of credit, obtained from an
   affiliate of the Trustee, has been deposited with the Trustee. Contracts to
   acquire the bonds were entered into during the period from January 23, 2002
to April 30, 2002.                                                      

(2) Other information regarding the bonds is as follows:                        

         COST TO           PROFIT (LOSS)
       SPONSOR            TO SPONSOR
      ---------------      ---------------
$    8,832,176        $     77,778

The Sponsor may have entered into contracts which hedge interest rate   
fluctuations on certain bonds. The cost of any such contracts and the   
   corresponding gain or loss is included in the Cost to Sponsor. Bonds marked
  by "##" following the maturity date have been purchased on a "when, as and
if issued" or "delayed delivery" basis. Interest on these bonds begins  
accruing to the benefit of Unitholders on their respective dates of     
delivery. Delivery is expected to take place at various dates after the 
first settlement date.                                                  

"#" prior to the coupon rate indicates that the bond was issued at an   
  original issue discount. See "The Trusts--Risk Factors" in Prospectus Part
II. The tax effect of bonds issued at an original issue discount is     
described in "Federal Tax Status" in Prospectus Part II.                

(3) All ratings are by Standard & Poor's unless otherwise indicated. "*"        
   indicates that the rating of the bond is by Moody's. "o" indicates that the
rating is contingent upon receipt by the rating agency of a policy of   
insurance obtained by the issuer of the bonds. "NR" indicates that the  
rating service did not provide a rating for that bond. For a brief      
  description of the ratings see "Description of Ratings" in the Information
Supplement.                                                             

(4) This is the year in which each bond is initially or currently callable and  
the call price for that year. Each bond continues to be callable at     
 declining prices thereafter (but not below par value) except for original
    issue discount bonds which are redeemable at prices based on the issue price
    plus the amount of original issue discount accreted to redemption date plus,
   if applicable, some premium, the amount of which will decline in subsequent
years. "S.F." indicates a sinking fund is established with respect to an
  issue of bonds. Certain bonds may be subject to redemption without premium
prior to the date shown pursuant to extraordinary optional or mandatory 
redemptions if certain events occur. See "The Trusts--Risk Factors" in  
Prospectus Part II.                                                     

UNDERWRITING. The Underwriters named below have purchased Units in the
following amounts from the Sponsor. See "Public Offering--Sponsor and
Underwriter Compensation" in Prospectus Part II.

REPORT OF CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

   To the Board of Directors of Van Kampen Funds Inc. and the Unitholders of
Van Kampen Focus Portfolios Insured Income Trust, Series 92 (Van Kampen Focus   
Portfolios, Taxable Income Series 7):                                           

  We have audited the accompanying statement of condition and the portfolio of
Van Kampen Focus Portfolios Insured Income Trust, Series 92 (Van Kampen Focus   
Portfolios, Taxable Income Series 7) as of May 1, 2002. The statement of        
condition and portfolio are the responsibility of the Sponsor. Our              
responsibility is to express an opinion on such financial statements based on   
our audit.                                                                      

We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally    
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan  
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a 
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial    
statements. Our procedures included confirmation of an irrevocable letter of    
credit deposited to purchase bonds by correspondence with the Trustee. An audit 
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by the Sponsor, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement      
presentation. We believe our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

   In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Van Kampen Focus Portfolios    
Insured Income Trust, Series 92 (Van Kampen Focus Portfolios, Taxable Income    
Series 7) as of May 1, 2002, in conformity with accounting principles generally 
accepted in the United States of America.

 TAXABLE INCOME SERIES 7

 This prospectus contains two parts.

 No one may use this Prospectus Part II unless accompanied by Prospectus Part I.

YOU SHOULD READ THIS PROSPECTUS AND RETAIN IT FOR FUTURE REFERENCE. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   The Securities and Exchange Commission has not approved or disapproved of
the Trust Units or passed upon the adequacy or accuracy of this prospectus.     

Any contrary representation is a criminal offense.

THE TRUSTS 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GENERAL. Your Trust was created under the laws of the State of New York
pursuant to a Trust Indenture and Agreement (the "Trust Agreement"), dated the  
date of this prospectus (the "Date of Deposit") among Van Kampen Funds Inc., as 
Sponsor, J.J. Kenny & Co., Inc., as Evaluator, Van Kampen Investment Advisory   
Corp., as Supervisor, and The Bank of New York, as Trustee.                     

Your Trust may be an appropriate medium for investors who desire to   
participate in a portfolio of taxable bonds with greater diversification than   
they might be able to acquire individually. Diversification of a Trust's assets 
will not eliminate the risk of loss always inherent in the ownership of bonds.  
For a breakdown of your Trust's portfolio, see "Portfolio" in Prospectus Part I.
In addition, bonds of the type initially deposited in the portfolio of a Trust  
are often not available in small amounts and may, in the case of any privately  
placed bonds, be available only to institutional investors.                     

On the Date of Deposit, the Sponsor deposited with the Trustee the    
aggregate principal amount of bonds indicated in the "Summary of Essential
Financial Information" in Prospectus Part I. The bonds initially consist of     
delivery statements relating to contracts for their purchase and cash, cash     
equivalents and/or irrevocable letters of credit issued by a financial          
institution. Thereafter, the Trustee, in exchange for the bonds, delivered to   
the Sponsor evidence of ownership of the number of Units indicated under        
"Summary of Essential Financial Information" in Prospectus Part I. A Trust that 
holds primarily long-term bonds, as described on the cover of Prospectus Part I,
is referred to herein as a "Long-Term Trust". A Trust that holds primarily      
intermediate-term bonds, as described on the cover of Prospectus Part I, is     
referred to herein as an "Intermediate-Term Trust". A Trust that holds only     
insured bonds are referred to herein as "Insured Trusts". Unless otherwise      
terminated as provided herein, the Trust Agreement will terminate at the end of 
the calender year prior to the fiftieth anniversary of its execution in the case
of a Long-Term Trust and at the end of the calender year prior to the twentieth 
anniversary of its execution in the case of an Intermediate-Term Trust.         

   Each Unit initially offered represents a fractional undivided interest in
the principal and net income of the Trust. To the extent that any Units are     
redeemed by the Trustee, the fractional undivided interest in the Trust         
represented by each Unit will increase, although the actual interest in the     
Trust will remain unchanged. Units will remain outstanding until redeemed by    
Unitholders or until the termination of the Trust Agreement.                    

OBJECTIVE AND BOND SELECTION. The objective of a Long-Term Trust is to
provide income and conservation of capital by investing in a professionally     
selected portfolio primarily consisting of long-term bonds. The objective of an 
Intermediate-Term Trust is to provide income and conservation of capital by     
investing in a professionally selected portfolio primarily consisting of        
intermediate-term bonds. There is, of course, no guarantee that a Trust will    
achieve its objective. Your Trust may be an appropriate investment vehicle for  
investors who desire to participate in a portfolio of fixed income bonds with   
greater diversification than they might be able to acquire individually.        

 In selecting bonds for each Trust, the Sponsor considered the following
factors, among others: (a) either the Standard & Poor's rating of the bonds was 
not less than "BBB-", or the Moody's Investors Service, Inc. ("Moody's") rating 
of the bonds was not less than "Baa3", including provisional or conditional     
ratings, respectively, (or, if not rated, the bonds had credit characteristics  
sufficiently similar to the credit characteristics of interest-bearing bonds    
that were so rated as to be acceptable for acquisition by a Trust in the opinion
of the Sponsor), (b) the prices of the bonds relative to other bonds of         
comparable quality and maturity, (c) the diversification of bonds as to purpose 
of issue and location of issuer and (d) with respect to the Insured Trusts, the 
availability and cost of insurance. After the Date of Deposit, a bond may cease 
to be rated or its rating may be reduced below the minimum required as of the   
Date of Deposit. Neither event requires elimination of a bond from a Trust but  
may be considered in the Sponsor's determination as to whether or not to direct 
the Trustee to dispose of the bond (see "Trust Administration--Portfolio
Administration"). In particular, the ratings of the bonds in an Investment Grade
Trust could fall below "investment grade" (i.e., below "BBB-" or "Baa3") during 
the Trust's life and the Trust could continue to hold the bonds. See "The
Trusts--Risk Factors".                                                          

   Insurance guaranteeing the timely payment, when due, of all principal and
interest on the bonds in an Insured Trust has been obtained from a bond         
insurance company. For information relating to insurance on the bonds, see      
"Insurance on the Bonds in an Insured Trust". Neither the Public Offering Price 
nor any evaluation of Units for purposes of repurchases or redemptions reflects 
any element of value for the insurance obtained by an Insured Trust unless bonds
are in default in payment of principal or interest or in significant risk of    
such default. See "Public Offering--Offering Price".                            

In order for bonds to be eligible for insurance, they must have credit
characteristics which would qualify them for at least the Standard & Poor's     
rating of "BBB-" or at least the Moody's Investors Service, Inc. rating of      
"Baa3", which in brief represent the lowest ratings for securities of investment
grade (see "Description of Ratings" in the Information Supplement). Insurance is
not a substitute for the basic credit of an issuer, but supplements the existing
credit and provides additional security. If an issue is accepted for insurance, 
a non-cancellable policy for the prompt payment of interest and principal on the
bonds, when due, is issued by the insurer. A monthly premium is paid by a Trust 
for the insurance obtained by it. The Trustee has the right to obtain permanent 
insurance from a Portfolio Insurer in connection with the sale of a bond insured
under the insurance policy obtained from the respective Portfolio Insurer by an 
Insured Trust upon the payment of a single predetermined insurance premium from 
the proceeds of the sale of such bond. Accordingly, any bond in an Insured Trust
is eligible to be sold on an insured basis. All bonds insured by a Portfolio    
Insurer or by a Preinsured Bond Insurer receive a "AAA" rating by Standard &    
Poor's. Standard & Poor's describes securities it rates "AAA" as having "the    
highest rating assigned by Standard & Poor's to a debt obligation. Capacity to  
pay interest and repay principal is extremely strong." See "Insurance on the
Bonds in an Insured Trust".                                                     

RISK FACTORS. All investments involve risk. This section describes the main
risks that can impact the value of bonds in your Trust. You should understand   
these risks before you invest. If the value of the bonds falls, the value of    
your Units will also fall. You can lose money by investing in a Trust. No one   
can guarantee that your Trust will achieve its objective or that your investment
return will be positive over any period. The Information Supplement contains a  
more detailed discussion of risks related to your investment.                   

Market risk is the risk that the value of the bonds in your Trust will
fluctuate. This could cause the value of your Units to fall below your original 
purchase price or below the par value. Market value fluctuates in response to   
various factors. These can include changes in interest rates, inflation, the    
financial condition of a bond's issuer or insurer, perceptions of the issuer or 
insurer, or ratings on a bond. Even though the Supervisor supervises your       
portfolio, you should remember that no one manages your portfolio. Your Trust   
will not sell a bond solely because the market value falls as is possible in a  
managed fund.                                                                   

Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of bonds will fall if   
interest rates increase. Bonds typically fall in value when interest rates rise 
and rise in value when interest rates fall. Bonds with longer periods before    
maturity are often more sensitive to interest rate changes.                     

   Credit risk is the risk that a bond's issuer or insurer is unable to meet
its obligation to pay principal or interest on the bond.                        

    Call risk is the risk that the issuer prepays or "calls" a bond before its
stated maturity. An issuer might call a bond if interest rates fall and the bond
pays a higher interest rate or if it no longer needs the money for the original 
purpose. If an issuer calls a bond, your Trust will distribute the principal to 
you but your future interest distributions will fall. You might not be able to  
reinvest this principal at as high a yield. A bond's call price could be less   
than the price your Trust paid for the bond and could be below the bond's par   
value. This means that you could receive less than the amount you paid for your 
Units. If enough bonds in your Trust are called, your Trust could terminate     
early. The first date that the issuer can call each bond in the portfolio is    
listed in Prospectus Part I along with the price the issuer would have to pay.  

  Bond quality risk is the risk that a bond will fall in value if a rating
agency decreases the bond's rating. Bond concentration risk is the risk that    
your Trust is less diversified because it concentrates in a particular type of  
bond. When a certain type of bond makes up 25% or more of a Trust, the Trust is 
considered to be "concentrated" in that bond type. The different bond types are 
described in the following sections.                                            

Reduced diversification risk is the risk that your Trust will become  
smaller and less diversified as bonds are sold, are called or mature. This could
increase your risk of loss and increase your share of Trust expenses.           

     Liquidity risk is the risk that the value of a bond will fall if trading in
the bond is limited or absent. No one can guarantee that a liquid trading market
will exist for any bond because these bonds generally trade in the              
over-the-counter market (they are not listed on a securities exchange).         

Litigation and legislation risk is the risk that future litigation or 
legislation could affect the value of your Trust. Litigation could challenge an 
issuer's authority to issue or make payments on bonds.                          

   MORE ABOUT THE BONDS. In addition to describing the purpose of the bonds,
other information about the bonds is also listed in the "Portfolio" in          
Prospectus Part I. This information relates to other characteristics of the     
bonds. This section briefly describes some of these characteristics.            

    Original issue discount bonds were initially issued at a price below their
face (or par) value. These bonds typically pay a lower interest rate than       
comparable bonds that were issued at or above their par value. In a stable      
interest rate environment, the market value of these bonds tends to increase    
more slowly in early years and in greater increments as the bonds approach      
maturity. The issuers of these bonds may be able to call or redeem a bond before
its stated maturity date and at a price less than the bond's par value.         

   Zero coupon bonds are a type of original issue discount bond. These bonds
do not pay any current interest during their life. If an investor owns this type
of bond, the investor has the right to receive a final payment of the bond's par
value at maturity. The price of these bonds often fluctuates greatly during     
periods of changing market interest rates compared to bonds that make current   
interest payments. The issuers of these bonds may be able to call or redeem a   
bond before its stated maturity date and at a price less than the bond's par    
value.                                                                          

"When, as and if issued" bonds are bonds that trade before they are   
actually issued. This means that the Sponsor can only deliver them to your Trust
"when, as and if" the bonds are actually issued. Delivery of these bonds may be 
delayed or may not occur. Interest on these bonds does not begin accruing to    
your Trust until the Sponsor delivers the bond to the Trust. You may have to    
adjust your tax basis if the Sponsor delivers any of these bonds after the      
expected delivery date. Any adjustment would reflect interest that accrued      
between the time you purchased your Units and the delivery of the bonds to your 
Trust. This could lower your first year estimated current return. You may       
experience gains or losses on these bonds from the time you purchase Units even 
though your Trust has not yet received them.                                    

     NO FDIC GUARANTEE. An investment in your Trust is not a deposit of any bank
and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or
any other government agency.                                                    

ESTIMATED CURRENT                                                               
AND LONG-TERM RETURNS 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     The Estimated Current Returns and the Estimated Long-Term Returns as of the
Date of Deposit are set forth on the cover of Prospectus Part I. Estimated      
Current Return is calculated by dividing the estimated net annual interest      
income per Unit by the Public Offering Price. The estimated net annual interest 
income per Unit will vary with changes in fees and expenses of your Trust and   
with the principal prepayment, redemption, maturity, exchange or sale of bonds. 
The Public Offering Price will vary with changes in the price of the bonds.     
Accordingly, there is no assurance that the present Estimated Current Return    
will be realized in the future. Estimated Long-Term Return is calculated using a
formula which (1) takes into consideration, and determines and factors in the   
relative weightings of, the market values, yields (which takes into account the 
amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated          
retirements of the bonds and (2) takes into account the expenses and sales      
charge associated with Units. Since the value and estimated retirements of the  
bonds and the expenses of your Trust will change, there is no assurance that the
present Estimated Long-Term Return will be realized in the future. The Estimated
Current Return and Estimated Long-Term Return are expected to differ because the
calculation of Estimated Long-Term Return reflects the estimated date and amount
of principal returned while the Estimated Current Return calculation includes   
only net annual interest income and Public Offering Price.                      

   In order to acquire certain bonds, it may be necessary for the Sponsor or
Trustee to pay amounts covering accrued interest on the bonds which exceed the  
amounts which will be made available through cash furnished by the Sponsor on   
the Date of Deposit. This cash may exceed the interest which would accrue to the
First Settlement Date. The Trustee has agreed to pay for any amounts necessary  
to cover any excess and will be reimbursed when funds become available from     
interest payments on the related bonds.                                         

PUBLIC OFFERING 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GENERAL. Units are offered at the Public Offering Price. During the initial
offering period the Public Offering Price is based on the aggregate offering    
price of the bonds, the sales charge described below, cash, if any, in the      
Principal Account and accrued interest, if any. The sales charge for an         
Intermediate-Term Trust is equal to 3.0% of the public offering price per Unit  
(3.093% of the aggregate offering price of the bonds) and the sales charge for a
Long-Term Trust is equal to 4.9% of the public offering price per Unit (5.152%  
of the aggregate offering price of the bonds). After the initial public offering
period, the secondary market public offering price is based on the bid prices of
the bonds, the sales charge described below, cash, if any, in the Principal     
Account and accrued interest, if any. The minimum purchase in the primary and   
secondary market is one Unit. In connection with fully disclosed transactions   
with the Sponsor, the minimum purchase is the number of Units stated in the     
contract between the Sponsor and the related broker or agent.                   

The sales charge applicable to quantity purchases during the initial  
offering period is reduced as follows:

   * The breakpoint sales charges are also applied on a dollar basis utilizing a
breakpoint equivalent in the above table of $1,000 per Unit and will be applied 
on whichever basis is more favorable to the investor. The breakpoints will be   
adjusted to take into consideration purchase orders stated in dollars which     
cannot be completely fulfilled due to the requirement that only whole Units be  
issued.                                                                         

     The secondary market sales charge is computed as described in the following
table based upon the estimated long-term return life of your Trust's portfolio:

   For purposes of computation of the estimated long-term return life, bonds
will be deemed to mature on their expressed maturity dates unless: (a) the bonds
have been called for redemption or are subject to redemption at an earlier call 
date, in which case this call date will be deemed to be the maturity date; or   
(b) the bonds are subject to a "mandatory tender", in which case the mandatory  
tender will be deemed to be the maturity date. The sales charges in the above   
table are expressed as a percentage of the aggregate bid prices of the bonds.   
Expressed as a percent of the Public Offering Price, the sales charge on a Trust
consisting entirely of bonds with 15 years to maturity would be 4.80%.          

    Any reduced sales charge is the responsibility of the selling Underwriter,
broker, dealer or agent. The Sponsor will, however, increase the concession or  
agency commission for quantity purchases.                                       

The reduced sales charge for quantity purchases, during the initial   
offering period table above will apply on all purchases by the same person from 
any one Underwriter or dealer of units of Van Kampen unit investment trusts     
which are being offered in the initial offering period (a) on any one day (the  
"Initial Purchase Date") or (b) on any day subsequent to the Initial Purchase   
Date, if the units purchased are of a unit investment trust purchased on the    
Initial Purchase Date. In the event units of more than one trust are purchased  
on the Initial Purchase Date, the aggregate dollar amount of such purchases will
be used to determine whether purchasers are eligible for a reduced sales charge.
Such aggregate dollar amount will be divided by the public offering price per   
unit (on the day preceding the date of purchase) of each respective trust       
purchased to determine the total number of units which such amount could have   
purchased of each individual trust. Purchasers must then consult the applicable 
trust's prospectus to determine whether the total number of units which could   
have been purchased of a specific trust would have qualified for a reduced sales
charge and, if so qualified, the amount of such reduction. Assuming a purchaser 
qualifies for a sales charge reduction or reductions, to determine the          
applicable sales charge reduction or reductions it is necessary to accumulate   
all purchases made on the Initial Purchase Date and all purchases made in       
accordance with (b) above. Units purchased in the name of the spouse of a       
purchaser or in the name of a child of such purchaser ("immediate family        
members") will be deemed for the purposes of calculating the applicable sales   
charge to be additional purchases by the purchaser. The reduced sales charges   
will also be applicable to a trustee or other fiduciary purchasing Units for one
or more trust, estate or fiduciary accounts. If you purchased Units on more than
one day to achieve the discounts described in this paragraph, the discount      
allowed on any single day will apply only to Units purchased on that day (a     
retroactive discount is not given on all prior purchases).                      

     For purposes of calculating the reduced sales charge for quantity purchases
in the table above, purchasers who have indicated their intent to purchase a    
specified amount of Units of any Van Kampen Focus Portfolios, Taxable Income    
Series or Van Kampen Focus Portfolios, Municipal Series unit investment trust   
during the initial offering period by executing and delivering a letter of      
intent to the Sponsor, which letter of intent must be in a form acceptable to   
the Sponsor and shall have a maximum duration of thirteen months, will be       
eligible to receive a reduced sales charge according to the tables above based  
on the amount of intended aggregate purchases as expressed in the letter of     
intent. By establishing a letter of intent, a Unitholder agrees that the first  
purchase of Units following the execution of such letter of intent will be at   
least 5% of the total amount of the intended aggregate purchases expressed in   
the Unitholder's letter of intent. Further, through the establishment of the    
letter of intent, the Unitholder agrees that Units representing 5% of the total 
amount of the intended purchases will be held in escrow by the Trustee pending  
completion of these purchases. All distributions on Units held in escrow will be
credited to the Unitholder's account. If total purchases prior to the expiration
of the letter of intent period equal or exceed the amount specified in a        
Unitholder's letter of intent, the Units held in escrow will be transferred to  
the Unitholder's account. A Unitholder who purchases Units during the letter of 
intent period in excess of the number of Units specified in a Unitholder's      
letter of intent, the amount of which would cause the Unitholder to be eligible 
to receive an additional sales charge reduction, will be allowed such additional
sales charge reduction on the purchase of Units which caused the Unitholder to  
reach such new breakpoint level and on all additional purchases of Units during 
the letter of intent period. If the total purchases are less than the amount    
specified, the Unitholder involved must pay the Sponsor an amount equal to the  
difference between the amounts paid for these purchases and the amounts which   
would have been paid if the higher sales charge had been applied; the Unitholder
will, however, be entitled to any reduced sales charge qualified for by reaching
any lower breakpoint level. If the Unitholder does not pay the additional amount
within 20 days after written request by the Sponsor or the Unitholder's         
securities representative, the Sponsor will instruct the Trustee to redeem an   
appropriate number of the escrowed Units to meet the required payment. By       
establishing a letter of intent, a Unitholder irrevocably appoints the Sponsor  
as attorney to give instructions to redeem any or all of the Unitholder's       
escrowed Units, with full power of substitution in the premises. A Unitholder or
his securities representative must notify the Sponsor whenever the Unitholder   
makes a purchase of Units that he wishes to be counted towards the intended     
amount.                                                                         

During the initial offering period of a Trust, unitholders of any Van 
Kampen-sponsored unit investment trust and unitholders of unaffiliated unit     
investment trusts may utilize their redemption or termination proceeds from such
a trust to purchase Units of a Trust at a reduced sales charge. The reduced     
sales charge will be equal to the lesser of $35 per Unit or 3.50% of the Public 
Offering Price per Unit for a Long-Term Trust and will be equal to the lesser of
$25 or 2.50% of the Public Offering Price per Unit for an Intermediate Term     
Trust.                                                                          

Employees, officers and directors (including their spouses, children, 
grandchildren, parents, grandparents, siblings, mothers-in-law, fathers-in-law, 
sons-in-law and daughters-in-law, and trustees, custodians or fiduciaries for   
the benefit of such persons (collectively referred to herein as "related        
purchasers")) of Van Kampen Funds Inc. and its affiliates and Underwriters and  
their affiliates may purchase Units at the Public Offering Price less the       
applicable underwriting commission or less the applicable dealer concession in  
the absence of an underwriting commission. Employees, officers and directors    
(including related purchasers) of dealers and their affiliates and vendors      
providing services to the Sponsor may purchase Units at the Public Offering     
Price less the applicable dealer concession.                                    

    Purchasers of units of any two consecutive series of a Trust may aggregate
purchases of units of such series for purposes of the sales charge reduction for
quantity purchases, provided that at the time of the initial purchase of units  
such purchaser submitted a purchase order for at least 100 units that was       
partially unfulfilled due to a lack of units of such Trust series available for 
sale at such time. The sales charge reduction shall be applied to the subsequent
purchase of units such that the aggregate sales charge reduction applicable to  
both purchases will equal the amount described in the initial offering period   
sales charge table above.                                                       

   A portion of the sales charge is waived for certain accounts described in
this paragraph. Purchases by these accounts are subject only to the portion of  
the sales charge that is retained by the Sponsor. Please refer to the section   
called "Fee Accounts" for additional information on these purchases. Units may  
be purchased in the primary or secondary market at the Public Offering Price    
(for purchases which do not qualify for a sales charge reduction for quantity   
purchases) less the concession the Sponsor typically allows to brokers and      
dealers for purchases by (1) investors who purchase Units through registered    
investment advisers, certified financial planners and registered broker-dealers 
who in each case either charge periodic fees for brokerage services, financial  
planning, investment advisory or asset management services, or provide such     
services in connection with the establishment of an investment account for which
a comprehensive "wrap fee" charge is imposed, (2) bank trust departments        
investing funds over which they exercise exclusive discretionary investment     
authority and that are held in a fiduciary, agency, custodial or similar        
capacity, (3) any person who for at least 90 days, has been an officer, director
or bona fide employee of any firm offering Units for sale to investors or their 
immediate family members (as described above) and (4) officers and directors of 
bank holding companies that make Units available directly or through            
subsidiaries or bank affiliates. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in    
this prospectus, such investors, bank trust departments, firm employees and bank
holding company officers and directors who purchase Units through this program  
will not receive sales charge reductions for quantity purchases.                

OFFERING PRICE. The Public Offering Price of Units will vary from the 
amounts stated under "Summary of Essential Financial Information" in Prospectus 
Part I in accordance with fluctuations in the prices of the bonds. The price of 
Units on the Date of Deposit was determined by adding the applicable sales      
charge to the aggregate offering price of the bonds and dividing the sum by the 
number of Units outstanding. This price determination was made on the basis of  
an evaluation of the bonds prepared by the Evaluator. During the initial        
offering period, the Evaluator will value the bonds as of the Evaluation Time on
days the New York Stock Exchange is open for business and will adjust the Public
Offering Price of Units accordingly. This Public Offering Price will be         
effective for all orders received at or prior to the Evaluation Time on each    
such day. The "Evaluation Time" is the close of trading on the New York Stock   
Exchange on each day that the Exchange is open for trading. Orders received by  
the Trustee, Sponsor or any Underwriter for purchases, sales or redemptions     
after that time, or on a day when the New York Stock Exchange is closed, will be
held until the next determination of price. The secondary market Public Offering
Price per Unit will be equal to the aggregate bid price of the bonds plus the   
applicable secondary market sales charge and dividing the sum by the number of  
Units outstanding. For secondary market purposes, this computation will be made 
by the Evaluator as of the Evaluation Time for each day on which any Unit is    
tendered for redemption and as necessary. The offering price of bonds may be    
expected to average approximately 0.35-1% more than the bid price.              

   The aggregate price of the bonds is determined on the basis of bid prices
or offering prices, as is appropriate, (a) on the basis of current market prices
obtained from dealers or brokers who customarily deal in bonds comparable to    
those held by your Trust; (b) if these prices are not available, on the basis of
current market prices for comparable bonds; (c) by causing the value of the     
bonds to be determined by others engaged in the practice of evaluation, quoting 
or appraising comparable bonds; or (d) by any combination of the above. Market  
prices of the bonds will generally fluctuate with changes in market interest    
rates. Unless bonds are in default in payment of principal or interest or in    
significant risk of default, the Evaluator will not attribute any value to the  
insurance obtained by your Trust.                                               

     The Evaluator will consider in its evaluation of bonds which are in default
in payment of principal or interest or, in the Sponsor's opinion, in significant
risk of default (the "Defaulted Bonds") the value of any insurance guaranteeing 
interest and principal payments. The value of the insurance will be equal to the
difference between (i) the market value of Defaulted Bonds assuming the exercise
of the right to obtain Permanent Insurance (less the insurance premiums and     
related expenses attributable to the purchase of Permanent Insurance) and (ii)  
the market value of Defaulted Bonds not covered by Permanent Insurance. In      
addition, the Evaluator will consider the ability of a Portfolio Insurer to meet
its commitments under any insurance policy, including commitments to issue      
Permanent Insurance. No value has been ascribed to insurance obtained by your   
Trust, if any, as of the date of this prospectus.                               

    A person will become the owner of Units on the date of settlement provided
payment has been received. Cash, if any, made available to the Sponsor prior to 
the date of settlement for the purchase of Units may be used in the Sponsor's   
business and may be deemed to be a benefit to the Sponsor, subject to the       
limitations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.                             

     ACCRUED INTEREST. Accrued interest is an accumulation of unpaid interest on
securities which generally is paid semi-annually, although your Trust accrues   
interest daily. Because of this, your Trust always has an amount of interest    
earned but not yet collected by the Trustee. For this reason, with respect to   
sales settling after the First Settlement Date, the proportionate share of      
accrued interest to the settlement date is added to the Public Offering Price of
Units. Unitholders will receive the amount of accrued interest paid on their    
Units on the next distribution date. In an effort to reduce the accrued interest
which would have to be paid by Unitholders, the Trustee will advance the amount 
of accrued interest to the Sponsor as the Unitholder of record as of the First  
Settlement Date. Consequently, the accrued interest added to the Public Offering
Price of Units will include only accrued interest from the First Settlement Date
to the date of settlement, less any distributions from the Interest Account     
after the First Settlement Date. Because of the varying interest payment dates  
of the bonds, accrued interest at any point in time will be greater than the    
amount of interest actually received by your Trust and distributed to           
Unitholders. If a Unitholder sells or redeems all or a portion of his Units, he 
will be entitled to receive his proportionate share of the accrued interest from
the purchaser of his Units.                                                     

UNIT DISTRIBUTION. Units will be distributed to the public by Underwriters,
broker-dealers and others at the Public Offering Price, plus accrued interest.  
The Sponsor intends to qualify Units for sale in a number of states. During the 
initial offering period, the Sponsor and Underwriters will sell Units to        
non-Underwriter broker-dealers and selling agents at the Public Offering Price  
(net of any sales charge discount) less the concession or agency commission     
shown in the following tables.

1,000 Units or more               20                --                        

 Non-Underwriter broker-dealers and other selling agents who purchase an
aggregate of 250 or more Units directly from the Sponsor during the initial     
offering period will receive a net concession equal to the net concession       
allowed to Underwriters described under "Sponsor and Underwriter Compensation"  
below. For individual transactions of less than 250 Units, the Sponsor will     
offer a rebate per Unit equal to the Volume Concession Rebate described in the  
tables above so that the broker-dealer or selling agent receives the appropriate
net concession or agency commission. The Sponsor will pay this rebate after the 
end of the initial offering period.                                             

    Included in the concessions and agency commissions described in the tables
are volume concessions or agency commissions of an additional $5.00 per Unit for
any broker/dealer or agent (other than Underwriters) who purchases from the     
Sponsor at least 250 Units of a Trust during the initial offering period. These 
additional concessions will be allowed at the time of purchase, provided,       
however, the additional concession applicable to initial purchases totaling less
than 250 Units will be paid retroactively at the end of the initial offering    
period. The breakpoint concessions or agency commissions are also applied on a  
dollar basis utilizing a breakpoint equivalent of $1,000 per Unit and will be   
applied on whichever basis is more favorable to the distributor. The breakpoints
will be adjusted to take into consideration purchase orders stated in dollars   
which cannot be completely fulfilled due to the requirement that only whole     
Units be issued.                                                                

 For initial offering period transactions involving unitholders of other
unit investment trusts who use their redemption or termination proceeds to      
purchase Units of a Trust, the regular concession or agency commission allowed  
to broker-dealers and other selling agents will equal $25 per Unit for a        
Long-Term Trust and $17.50 per Unit for an Intermediate Term Trust.             

In addition to the concession or agency commission and the volume     
concession rebate set forth in the tables above, all broker-dealers and other   
selling firms will be eligible to receive additional compensation based on total
initial offering period sales of all Van Kampen unit investment trusts during a 
Quarterly Period as set forth in the following table:

  "Quarterly Period" means the following periods: December - February; March -
May; June - August; and September - November. Broker-dealers and other selling  
firms will not receive these additional volume concessions on the sale of (1)   
units which are not subject to a transactional sales charge (as defined in      
appplicable prospectuses) or (2) units of Van Kampen unit investment trusts     
initially offered prior to December 17, 2001, however, such sales will be       
included in determining whether a firm has met the sales level breakpoints set  
forth in the table above. Secondary market sales of all unit investment trusts  
are excluded for purposes of these volume concessions. The Sponsor will pay     
these amounts out of its own assets within a reasonable time following each     
Quarterly Period.                                                               

   Certain commercial banks may be making Units available to their customers
on an agency basis. A portion of the sales charge paid by these customers (equal
to the agency commission referred to above) is retained by or remitted to the   
banks. Any discount provided to investors will be borne by the selling dealer or
agent. For secondary market transactions, the concession or agency commission   
will amount to 70% of the applicable sales charge. The Sponsor reserves the     
right to reject, in whole or in part, any order for the purchase of Units and to
change the amount of the concession or agency commission to dealers and others  
from time to time.                                                              

SPONSOR AND UNDERWRITER COMPENSATION. The Sponsor will sell Units to  
Underwriters at the regular Public Offering Price per Unit less a gross         
concession of $22 per Unit underwritten for Intermediate-Term Trusts and $35 per
Unit underwritten for Long-Term Trusts. The net concession earned by            
Underwriters after giving effect to sales charge discounts will equal the       
amounts shown in the tables below. For a list of the Underwriters that have     
purchased Units from the Sponsor, see "Underwriting" in Prospectus Part I.

In connection with Underwriter sales of Units to non-Underwriter      
broker-dealers and other selling agents which Units in turn are sold to         
investors in sufficient size to qualify for quantity discounts, Underwriters are
eligible to receive a rebate from the Sponsor. This rebate is intended to       
reimburse Underwriters for discounts provided to such broker-dealers and agents,
and on these transactions will equal the amount by which the sum of the related 
broker-dealer concession and the sales charge discount exceeds the regular      
Underwriter concession. The amounts of these rebates are shown in the table     
above. In addition, if a firm commits to act as an Underwriter for a Trust, the 
concessions or agency commissions allowed will equal the amounts shown above on 
all Units of a Trust distributed during the initial offering period and         
purchased directly from the Sponsor rather than the broker-dealer concessions   
described under "Unit Distribution."                                            

Each Underwriter who underwrites 1,000 or more Units in a Trust will  
receive additional compensation from the Sponsor of $1.00 for each Unit it      
underwrites. The breakpoints listed herein will also be applied on a dollar     
basis utilizing a breakpoint equivalent of $1,000 per Unit and will be applied  
on whichever basis is more favorable to the Underwriter. The breakpoints will be
adjusted to take into consideration purchase orders stated in dollars which     
cannot be completely fulfilled due to the requirement that only whole Units be  
issued.                                                                         

    In addition, the Sponsor and certain Underwriters will realize a profit or
loss, as a result of the difference between the price paid for the bonds by the 
Sponsor and the cost of the bonds to a Trust. See "Portfolio" and "Notes to
Portfolio" in Prospectus Part I. The Sponsor and the Underwriters may also      
realize profits or losses with respect to bonds which were acquired by the      
Sponsor from underwriting syndicates of which they were members. The Sponsor has
not participated as sole underwriter or as manager or as a member of the        
underwriting syndicates from which the bonds were acquired. Underwriters may    
further realize profit or loss during the initial offering period as a result of
possible fluctuations in the market value of the bonds since all proceeds       
received from purchasers of Units (excluding dealer concessions or agency       
commissions allowed, if any) will be retained by the Underwriters. Affiliates of
an Underwriter are entitled to the same dealer concessions or agency commissions
that are available to the Underwriter. In addition to any other benefits        
Underwriters may realize from the sale of Units, the Sponsor will share on a pro
rata basis among senior Underwriters (those who underwrite at least 250 Units)  
50% of any gain (less deductions for accrued interest and certain costs)        
represented by the difference between the cost of the bonds to the Sponsor and  
the evaluation of the bonds on the Date of Deposit. The Sponsor and certain of  
the other Underwriters will also realize profits or losses in the amount of any 
difference between the price at which Units are purchased and the price at which
Units are resold in connection with maintaining a secondary market for Units and
will also realize profits or losses resulting from a redemption of repurchased  
Units at a price above or below the purchase price.                             

Underwriters and broker-dealers, banks and/or others are eligible to  
participate in a program in which such firms receive from the Sponsor a nominal 
award for each of their representatives who have sold a minimum number of units 
of unit investment trusts created by the Sponsor during a specified time period.
In addition, at various times the Sponsor may implement other programs under    
which the sales forces of such firms may be eligible to win other nominal awards
for certain sales efforts, or under which the Sponsor will reallow to any such  
firms that sponsor sales contests or recognition programs conforming to criteria
established by the Sponsor, or participate in sales programs sponsored by the   
Sponsor, an amount not exceeding the total applicable sales charges on the sales
generated by such persons at the public offering price during such programs.    
Also, the Sponsor in its discretion may from time to time pursuant to objective 
criteria established by the Sponsor pay fees to qualifying firms for certain    
services or activities which are primarily intended to result in sales of Units.
Such payments are made by the Sponsor out of its own assets, and not out of the 
assets of any Trust. These programs will not change the price Unitholders pay   
for their Units or the amount that the Trust will receive from the Units sold.  
Approximately every eighteen months the Sponsor holds a business seminar which  
is open to Underwriters that sell units of trusts it sponsors. The Sponsor pays 
substantially all costs associated with the seminar, excluding Underwriter      
travel costs. Each Underwriter is invited to send a certain number of           
representatives based on the gross number of units such firm underwrites during 
a designated time period.                                                       

    MARKET FOR UNITS. Although not obligated to do so, the Sponsor intends to,
and certain of the other Underwriters may, maintain a market for Units and offer
to purchase Units at prices, subject to change at any time, based upon the      
aggregate bid prices of the bonds plus accrued interest and any principal cash  
on hand, less any amounts representing taxes or other governmental charges      
payable out of your Trust and less any accrued Trust expenses. If the supply of 
Units exceeds demand or if some other business reason warrants it, the Sponsor  
and/or the Underwriters may either discontinue all purchases of Units or        
discontinue purchases of Units at these prices. If a market is not maintained   
and the Unitholder cannot find another purchaser, a Unitholder will be able to  
dispose of Units by tendering them to the Trustee for redemption at the         
Redemption Price. See "Rights of Unitholders--Redemption of Units". A Unitholder
who wishes to dispose of his Units should inquire of his broker as to current   
market prices in order to determine whether there is in any price in excess of  
the Redemption Price and, if so, the amount thereof. The Trustee will notify the
Sponsor of any tender of Units for redemption. If the Sponsor's bid in the      
secondary market at that time equals or exceeds the Redemption Price per Unit,  
it may purchase the Units not later than the day on which the Units would       
otherwise have been redeemed by the Trustee.                                    

FEE ACCOUNTS 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Units may be available for purchase in connection with "wrap fee" accounts
and other similar accounts. You should consult your financial professional to   
determine whether you can benefit from these accounts. For these purchases you  
generally only pay the portion of the sales charge that is retained by your     
Trust's Sponsor, Van Kampen Funds Inc. You should consult the "Public
Offering--General" section for specific information on this and other sales     
charge discounts.                                                               

RIGHTS OF UNITHOLDERS 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    DISTRIBUTIONS OF INTEREST AND PRINCIPAL. Interest received by a Trust, pro
rated on an annual basis, will be distributed monthly unless a Unitholder elects
to receive semi-annual distributions. The amount and time of the first          
distribution is described under "Summary of Essential Financial Information" in 
Prospectus Part I. The plan of distribution selected by a Unitholder will remain
in effect until changed. Unitholders who purchase Units in the secondary market 
will receive distributions in accordance with the election of the prior owner.  
Unitholders may change their distribution plan by indicating the change on a    
card which may be obtained from the Trustee and return the card to the Trustee  
with their certificates and other documentation required by the Trustee.        
Certificates should be sent by registered or certified mail to avoid their being
lost or stolen. If the card and certificate are properly presented to the       
Trustee, the change will become effective on the first day after the next       
semi-annual record date and will remain effective until changed.                

  Interest received by a Trust, including that part of the proceeds of any
disposition of bonds which represents accrued interest, is credited by the      
Trustee to the Interest Account. Other receipts are credited to the Principal   
Account. After deduction of amounts sufficient to reimburse the Trustee, without
interest, for any amounts advanced and paid to the Sponsor as the Unitholder of 
record as of the First Settlement Date, interest received will be distributed on
each distribution date to Unitholders of record as of the preceding record date.
All distributions will be net of estimated expenses. Funds in the Principal     
Account will be distributed on each semi-annual distribution date to Unitholders
of record as of the preceding semi-annual record date. The Trustee is not       
required to pay interest on funds held in the Principal or Interest Account (but
may itself earn interest thereon and therefore benefits from the use of these   
funds) nor to make a distribution from the Principal Account unless the amount  
available for distribution therein shall equal at least $1.00 per Unit. However,
should the amount available for distribution in the Principal Account equal or  
exceed $10.00 per Unit, the Trustee will make a special distribution from the   
Principal Account on the next monthly distribution date to Unitholders of record
on the related monthly record date.                                             

  Because interest payments are not received by a Trust at a constant rate
throughout the year, interest distributions may be more or less than the amount 
credited to the Interest Account as of the record date. For the purpose of      
minimizing fluctuations in interest distributions, the Trustee is authorized to 
advance amounts necessary to provide interest distributions of approximately    
equal amounts. The Trustee is reimbursed for these advances from funds in the   
Interest Account on the next record date. Persons who purchase Units between a  
record date and a distribution date will receive their first distribution on the
second distribution date after the purchase, under the applicable plan of       
distribution.                                                                   

   REINVESTMENT OPTION. Unitholders may elect to have distributions on their
Units automatically reinvested in shares of certain Van Kampen mutual funds     
which are registered in the Unitholder's state of residence (the "Reinvestment  
Funds"). Each Reinvestment Fund has investment objectives that differ from those
of your Trust. The prospectus relating to each Reinvestment Fund describes its  
investment policies and the procedures to follow to begin reinvestment. A       
Unitholder may obtain a prospectus for the Reinvestment Funds from Van Kampen   
Funds Inc. at 1 Parkview Plaza, P.O. Box 5555, Oakbrook Terrace, Illinois
60181-5555.                                                                     

After becoming a participant in a reinvestment plan, each Trust       
distribution will automatically be applied on the applicable distribution date  
to purchase shares of the applicable Reinvestment Fund at a net asset value     
computed on such date. Unitholders with an existing Planned Reinvestment Option 
(PRO) Program account (whereby a sales charge is imposed on distribution        
reinvestments) may transfer their existing account into a new PRO account which 
allows purchases of Reinvestment Fund shares at net asset value. Confirmations  
of all reinvestments will be mailed to the Unitholder by the Reinvestment Fund. 
A participant may elect to terminate his or her reinvestment plan and receive   
future distributions in cash by notifying the Trustee in writing at least five  
days before the next distribution date. Each Reinvestment Fund, its sponsor and 
investment adviser have the right to terminate its reinvestment plan at any     
time.                                                                           

REDEMPTION OF UNITS. A Unitholder may redeem all or a portion of his Units
by tender to the Trustee, at its Unit Investment Trust Division, 101 Barclay    
Street, 20th Floor, New York, New York 10286, of the certificates representing  
the Units to be redeemed, duly endorsed or accompanied by proper instruments of 
transfer with signature guaranteed (or by providing satisfactory indemnity, such
as in connection with lost, stolen or destroyed certificates) and by payment of 
applicable governmental charges, if any. Redemption of Units cannot occur until 
certificates representing the Units or satisfactory indemnity have been received
by the Trustee. No later than seven calendar days following satisfactory tender,
the Unitholder will receive an amount for each Unit equal to the Redemption     
Price per Unit next computed after receipt by the Trustee of the tender of      
Units. The "date of tender" is deemed to be the date on which Units are received
by the Trustee, except that as regards Units received after the Evaluation Time 
on days of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, the date of tender is the    
next day on which that Exchange is open and the Units will be deemed to have    
been tendered to the Trustee on that day for redemption at the Redemption Price.

Under Internal Revenue Service regulations, the Trustee is required to
withhold a specified percentage of a Unit redemption if the Trustee has not     
received the Unitholder's tax identification number as required by such         
regulations. Any amount withheld is transmitted to the Internal Revenue Service 
and may be recovered by the Unitholder only when filing a return. Under normal  
circumstances the Trustee obtains the Unitholder's tax identification number    
from the selling broker. However, at any time a Unitholder elects to tender     
Units for redemption, the Unitholder should provide a tax identification number 
to the Trustee in order to avoid this possible "back-up withholding".           

The Redemption Price per Unit (as well as the secondary market Public 
Offering Price) will be determined on the basis of the bid price of the bonds as
of the Evaluation Time on days of trading on the New York Stock Exchange on the 
date any such determination is made. The Evaluator determines the Redemption    
Price per Unit on days Units are tendered for redemption. The Redemption Price  
per Unit is the pro rata share of each Unit on the basis of (i) the cash on hand
in a Trust or moneys in the process of being collected, (ii) the value of the   
bonds based on the bid prices of the bonds, except for cases in which the value 
of insurance has been included, (iii) accrued interest, less (a) amounts        
representing taxes or other governmental charges and (b) the accrued Trust      
expenses. The Evaluator may determine the value of the bonds by employing any of
the methods set forth in "Public Offering--Offering Price". In determining the  
Redemption Price per Unit no value will be assigned to the portfolio insurance  
maintained on the bonds in a Trust unless the bonds are in default in payment of
principal or interest or in significant risk of default. For a description of   
the situations in which the Evaluator may value the insurance obtained by a     
Trust, see "Public Offering--Offering Price". Accrued interest paid on          
redemption shall be withdrawn from the Interest Account or, if the balance      
therein is insufficient, from the Principal Account. All other amounts will be  
withdrawn from the Principal Account. Units so redeemed shall be cancelled.     

    The price at which Units may be redeemed could be less than the price paid
by the Unitholder and may be less than the par value of the bonds represented by
the Units redeemed. The Trustee may sell bonds to cover redemptions. When bonds 
are sold, the size and diversity of your Trust will be reduced. Sales may be    
required at a time when bonds would not otherwise be sold and might result in   
lower prices than might otherwise be realized.                                  

The right of redemption may be suspended and payment postponed for any
period during which the New York Stock Exchange is closed, other than for       
customary weekend and holiday closings, or during which the SEC determines that 
trading on that Exchange is restricted or an emergency exists, as a result of   
which disposal or evaluation of the bonds is not reasonably practicable, or for 
other periods as the SEC may by order permit. Under certain extreme             
circumstances the Sponsor may apply to the SEC for an order permitting a full or
partial suspension of the right of Unitholders to redeem their Units.           

 EXCHANGE OPTION. When you redeem Units of your Trust or when your Trust
terminates, you may be able to exchange your Units for units of other Van Kampen
unit trusts at a reduced sales charge. You should contact your financial        
professional for more information about trusts currently available for          
exchanges. Before you exchange Units, you should read the prospectus of the new 
trust carefully and understand the risks and fees. You should then discuss this 
option with your financial professional to determine whether your investment    
goals have changed, whether current trusts suit you and to dis-cuss tax         
consequences. We may discontinue this option at any time.                       

UNITS. Ownership of Units is evidenced in book entry form unless a    
Unitholder makes a written request to the Trustee that ownership be in          
certificate form. Units are transferable by making a written request to the     
Trustee and, in the case of Units in certificate form, by presentation and      
surrender of the certificate to the Trustee properly endorsed or accompanied by 
a written instrument or instruments of transfer. A Unitholder must sign the     
written request, or certificate transfer instrument, exactly as his name appears
on the records of the Trustee and on the face of any certificate with the       
signature guaranteed by a participant in the Securities Transfer Agents         
Medallion Program ("STAMP") or a signature guaranty program accepted by the     
Trustee. The Trustee may require additional documents such as, but not limited  
to, trust instruments, certificates of death, appointments as executor or       
administrator or certificates of corporate authority. Certificates will be      
issued in denominations of one Unit or any multiple thereof. Although no such   
charge is now made, the Trustee may require a Unitholder to pay a reasonable fee
for each certificate re-issued or transferred and to pay any governmental charge
that may be imposed in connection with each transfer or interchange. Destroyed, 
stolen, mutilated or lost certificates will be replaced upon delivery to the    
Trustee of satisfactory indemnity, evidence of ownership and payment of expenses
incurred. Mutilated certificates must be surrendered to the Trustee for         
replacement.                                                                    

REPORTS PROVIDED. Unitholders will receive a statement of interest and
other receipts received for each distribution. For as long as the Sponsor deems 
it to be in the best interest of Unitholders, the accounts of your Trust will be
audited annually by independent certified public accountants and the report of  
the accountants will be furnished to Unitholders upon request. Within a         
reasonable period of time after the end of each year, the Trustee will furnish  
to each person who was a registered Unitholder during that year a statement     
describing the interest and principal received on the bonds, actual Trust       
distributions, Trust expenses, a list of the bonds and other Trust information. 
Unitholders will be furnished the Evaluator's evaluations of the bonds upon     
request to the Trustee. If you have questions regarding your account or your    
Portfolio, please contact your financial adviser or the Trustee. The Sponsor    
does not have access to individual account information.                         

INSURANCE ON THE BONDS 
IN AN INSURED TRUST 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Insurance has been obtained guaranteeing prompt payment of interest and
principal, when due, in respect of the bonds in an Insured Trust. An insurance  
policy obtained by an Insured Trust is non-cancelable and will continue in force
so long as the Trust is in existence, the respective Portfolio Insurer is still 
in business and the bonds described in the policy continue to be held by the    
Trust. Any portfolio insurance premium for an Insured Trust is paid by the Trust
on a monthly basis. The premium for any Preinsured Bond insurance has been paid 
by the issuer, by a prior owner of the bonds or the Sponsor and any policy is   
non-cancelable and will continue in force so long as the bonds so insured are   
outstanding and the Preinsured Bond Insurer remains in business. The Portfolio  
Insurers and the Preinsured Bond Insurers are described in "Portfolio" for each 
Insured Trust and the notes thereto in Prospectus Part I. More detailed         
information regarding insurance on the bonds and the Preinsured Bond and        
Portfolio Insurers is included in the Information Supplement. See "Additional
Information".                                                                   

    The portfolio insurance obtained by an Insured Trust guarantees the timely
payment of principal and interest on the bonds when they fall due. For this     
purpose, "when due" generally means the stated maturity date for the payment of 
principal and interest. However, in the event (a) an issuer defaults in the     
payment of principal or interest, (b) an issuer enters into a bankruptcy        
proceeding or (c) the maturity of the bond is accelerated, the affected         
Portfolio Insurer has the option to pay the outstanding principal amount of the 
bond plus accrued interest to the date of payment and thereby retire the bond   
from an Insured Trust prior to the bond's stated maturity date. The insurance   
does not guarantee the market value of the bonds or the value of the Units. The 
Trustee, upon the sale of a bond covered under a portfolio insurance policy has 
the right to obtain permanent insurance with respect to the bond (i.e.,         
insurance to maturity of the bond regardless of the identity of the holder) (the
"Permanent Insurance") upon the payment of a single predetermined insurance     
premium and expenses from the proceeds of the sale of the bond. It is expected  
that the Trustee would exercise the right to obtain Permanent Insurance only if 
upon exercise an Insured Trust would receive net proceeds in excess of the sale 
proceeds if the bonds were sold on an uninsured basis.                          

Because the bonds are insured by Portfolio Insurers or Preinsured Bond
Insurers as to the timely payment of principal and interest, when due, and on   
the basis of the various reinsurance agreements in effect, Standard & Poor's has
assigned to the Units of an Insured Trust its "AAA" investment rating. This     
rating will be in effect for a period of thirteen months from the Date of       
Deposit and will, unless renewed, terminate at the end of such period. See      
"Description of Ratings" in the Information Supplement. This rating should not  
be construed as an approval of the offering of the Units by Standard & Poor's or
as a guarantee of the market value of an Insured Trust or of the Units.         

Each Portfolio Insurer is subject to regulation by the department of  
insurance in the state in which it is qualified to do business. Such regulation,
however, is no guarantee that each Portfolio Insurer will be able to perform on 
its contract of insurance in the event a claim should be made. At the date      
hereof, it is reported that no claims have been submitted or are expected to be 
submitted to any of the Portfolio Insurers which would materially impair the    
ability of any such company to meet its commitment pursuant to any contract of  
insurance. The information relating to each Portfolio Insurer has been furnished
by such companies. The financial information with respect to each Portfolio     
Insurer appears in reports filed with state insurance regulatory authorities and
is subject to audit and review by such authorities. No representation is made   
herein as to the accuracy or adequacy of such information or as to the absence  
of material adverse changes in such information subsequent to the dates thereof.

TRUST ADMINISTRATION 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     SPONSOR. Van Kampen Funds Inc. is the Sponsor of your Trust. The Sponsor is
a wholly owned subsidiary of Van Kampen Investments Inc., which is an indirect  
wholly owned subsidiary of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co. The Sponsor has its 
principal offices at 1 Parkview Plaza, Oakbrook Terrace, Illinois 60181-5555. As
of November 30, 2001, the total stockholders' equity of Van Kampen Funds Inc.   
was $163,449,658 (unaudited). Van Kampen Funds Inc. and your Trust have adopted 
a code of ethics requiring Van Kampen's employees who have access to information
on Trust transactions to report personal securities transactions. The purpose of
the code is to avoid potential conflicts of interest and to prevent fraud,      
deception or misconduct with respect to your Trust. The Information Supplement  
contains additional information about the Sponsor. If we fail to or cannot      
perform our duties under the trust agreement or become bankrupt, the Trustee may
appoint a new sponsor, continue to operate your Trust without a sponsor, or     
terminate your Trust and distribute the liquidation proceeds.                   

 TRUSTEE. The Trustee is The Bank of New York, a trust company organized
under the laws of New York. The Bank of New York has its unit investment trust  
division offices at 101 Barclay Street, New York, New York 10286, telephone     
(800) 221-7668. If you have questions regarding your account or your Portfolio, 
please contact the Trustee at its unit investment trust division offices or your
financial adviser. The Sponsor does not have access to individual account       
information. The Bank of New York is subject to supervision and examination by  
the Superintendent of Banks of the State of New York and the Board of Governors 
of the Federal Reserve System, and its deposits are insured by the Federal      
Deposit Insurance Corporation to the extent permitted by law. Additional        
information regarding the Trustee is set forth in the Information Supplement,   
including the Trustee's qualifications and duties, its ability to resign, the   
effect of a merger involving the Trustee and the Sponsor's ability to remove and
replace the Trustee. See "Additional Information".                              

PORTFOLIO ADMINISTRATION. Your Trust is not a managed fund and, except as
provided in the Trust Agreement, bonds generally will not be sold or replaced.  
The Sponsor may, however, direct that bonds be sold in certain limited          
situations to protect your Trust based on advice from the Supervisor. These     
situations may include default in interest or principal payments on the bonds or
other obligations of an issuer, an advanced refunding or institution of certain 
legal proceedings. In addition, the Trustee may sell bonds designated by the    
Supervisor for purposes of redeeming Units or payment of expenses. The          
Supervisor will consider a variety of factors in designating bonds to be sold   
including interest rates, market value and marketability. Except in limited     
circumstances, the Trustee must reject any offer by an issuer to issue bonds in 
exchange or substitution for the bonds (such as a refunding or refinancing      
plan). The Trustee will promptly notify Unitholders of any exchange or          
substitution. The Information Supplement contains a more detailed description of
circumstances in which bonds may be sold or replaced. See "Additional
Information".                                                                   

REPLACEMENT BONDS. No assurance can be given that a Trust will retain its
present size or composition because bonds may be sold, redeemed or mature from  
time to time and the proceeds will be distributed to Unitholders and will not be
reinvested. In the event of a failure to deliver any bond that has been         
purchased under a contract ("Failed Bonds"), the Sponsor is authorized under the
Trust Agreement to direct the Trustee to acquire other bonds ("Replacement
Bonds") to make up the original portfolio of a Trust. Replacement Bonds must be 
purchased within 20 days after delivery of the notice of the failed contract and
the purchase price (exclusive of accrued interest) may not exceed the amount of 
funds reserved for the purchase of the Failed Bonds. The Replacement Bonds must 
(i) be long-term or intermediate term, as applicable, bonds, debentures, notes  
or other straight debt obligations (whether secured or unsecured and whether    
senior or subordinated) without equity or other conversion features, with fixed 
maturity dates substantially the same as those of the Failed Bonds having no    
warrants or subscription privileges attached; (ii) be payable in United States  
currency; (iii) not be when, as and if issued obligations or restricted         
securities; (iv) be issued after July 18, 1984 if the interest is United States 
source income; (v) be issued or guaranteed by an issuer subject to or exempt    
from the reporting requirements under Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities     
Exchange Act of 1934 (or similar provisions of law) or guaranteed, directly or  
indirectly, by means of a lease agreement, agreement to buy securities, services
or products, or other similar commitment of the credit of such an issuer to the 
payment of the substitute bonds; (vi) maintain the Standard & Poor's AAA rating 
for an Insured Trust; and (vii) be eligible for (and when acquired be insured   
under) the insurance obtained by an Insured Trust. The Trustee shall notify all 
Unitholders of a Trust within five days after the acquisition of a Replacement  
Bond and shall make a pro rata distribution of the amount, if any, by which the 
cost of the Failed Bond exceeded the cost of the Replacement Bond plus accrued  
interest. If Failed Bonds are not replaced, the Sponsor will refund the sales   
charge attributable to the Failed Bonds to all Unitholders of a Trust and       
distribute the principal and accrued interest (at the coupon rate of the Failed 
Bonds to the date of removal from the Trust) attributable to the Failed Bonds   
within 30 days after removal. If Failed Bonds are not replaced, the Estimated   
Net Annual Interest Income per Unit would be reduced and the Estimated Current  
Return and Estimated Long-Term Return might be lowered. Unitholders may not be  
able to reinvest their proceeds in other securities at a yield equal to or in   
excess of the yield of the Failed Bonds.                                        

 AMENDMENT OF TRUST AGREEMENT. The Sponsor and the Trustee may amend the
Trust Agreement without the consent of Unitholders to correct any provision     
which may be defective or to make other provisions that will not adversely      
affect the interest of the Unitholders (as determined in good faith by the      
Sponsor and the Trustee). The Trust Agreement may not be amended to increase the
number of Units or to permit the acquisition of bonds in addition to or in      
substitution for any of the bonds initially deposited in a Trust, except for the
substitution of certain refunding bonds. The Trustee will notify Unitholders of 
any amendment.                                                                  

TERMINATION OF TRUST AGREEMENT. A Trust will terminate upon the redemption,
sale or other disposition of the last bond held in the Trust. A Trust may also  
be terminated at any time by consent of Unitholders of 51% of the Units then    
outstanding or by the Trustee when the value of the Trust is less than 20% of   
the original principal amount of bonds. The Trustee will notify each Unitholder 
of any termination within a reasonable time and will then liquidate any         
remaining bonds. The sale of bonds upon termination may result in a lower amount
than might otherwise be realized if the sale was not required at that time. For 
this reason, among others, the amount realized by a Unitholder upon termination 
may be less than the principal amount of bonds per Unit or value at the time of 
purchase. The Trustee will distribute to each Unitholder his share of the       
balance of the Interest and Principal Accounts after deduction of costs,        
expenses or indemnities. The Unitholder will receive a final distribution       
statement with this distribution. When the Trustee in its sole discretion       
determines that any amounts held in reserve are no longer necessary, it will    
distribute these amounts to Unitholders. The Information Supplement contains    
further information regarding termination of a Trust. See "Additional
Information".                                                                   

   LIMITATION ON LIABILITIES. The Sponsor, Supervisor, Evaluator and Trustee
shall be under no liability to Unitholders for taking any action or for         
refraining from taking any action in good faith pursuant to the Trust Agreement,
or for errors in judgment, but shall be liable only for their own willful       
misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence (negligence in the case of the       
Trustee) in the performance of their duties or by reason of their reckless      
disregard of their obligations and duties hereunder. The Trustee shall not be   
liable for depreciation or loss incurred by reason of the sale by the Trustee of
any of the bonds. In the event of the failure of the Sponsor to act under the   
Trust Agreement, the Trustee may act thereunder and shall not be liable for any 
action taken by it in good faith under the Trust Agreement. The Trustee is not  
liable for any taxes or governmental charges imposed on the bonds, on it as     
Trustee under the Trust Agreement or on a Trust which the Trustee may be        
required to pay under any present or future law of the United States of America 
or of any other taxing authority having jurisdiction. In addition, the Trust    
Agreement contains other customary provisions limiting the liability of the     
Trustee. The Trustee and Sponsor may rely on any evaluation furnished by the    
Evaluator and have no responsibility for the accuracy thereof. Determinations by
the Evaluator shall be made in good faith upon the basis of the best information
available to it; provided, however, that the Evaluator shall be under no        
liability to the Trustee, Sponsor or Unitholders for errors in judgment.        

FEDERAL TAX STATUS 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section summarizes some of the main U.S. federal income tax      
consequences of owning Units of a Trust. This section is current as of the date 
of this prospectus. Tax laws and interpretations change frequently, and these   
summaries do not describe all of the tax consequences to all taxpayers. For     
example, these summaries generally do not describe your situation if you are a  
corporation, a non-U.S. person, a broker/dealer, or other investor with special 
circumstances. In addition, this section does not describe your state or foreign
taxes. As with any investment, you should consult your own tax professional     
about your particular consequences. In addition, the Internal Revenue Service   
issued new withholding and reporting regulations effective January 1, 2001.     
Foreign investors should consult their own tax advisors regarding the tax       
consequences of these regulations.                                              

     ASSETS OF A TRUST. Each Trust will hold various debt obligations (the "Debt
Obligations"). All of the assets held by a Trust constitute the "Trust Assets." 
For purposes of this federal tax discussion, it is assumed that the Debt        
Obligations constitute debt the interest on which is includible in gross income 
for federal income tax purposes.                                                

     TRUST STATUS. A Trust will not be taxed as a corporation for federal income
tax purposes. As a Unit owner, you will be treated as the owner of a pro rata   
portion of the assets of your trust, and as such you will be considered to have 
received a pro rata share of income (e.g., interest, accruals of original issue 
discount, and capital gains, if any) from the Trust Assets when such income     
would be considered to be received by you if you directly owned the Trust       
Assets. This is true even if you elect to have your distributions automatically 
reinvested into additional Units. In addition, the income from the Trust Assets 
which you must take into account for federal income tax purposes is not reduced 
by amounts used to pay Trust expenses (including the deferred sales charge, if  
any).                                                                           

    YOUR TAX BASIS AND INCOME OR LOSS UPON DISPOSITION. If your Trust disposes
of Trust Assets, you will generally recognize gain or loss. If you dispose of   
your Units or redeem your Units for cash, you will also generally recognize gain
or loss. To determine the amount of this gain or loss, you must subtract your   
tax basis in the related Trust Assets from your share of the total amount       
received in the transaction. You can generally determine your initial tax basis 
in each Trust Asset by apportioning the cost of your Units, generally including 
sales charges, among each Trust Asset ratably according to their value on the   
date you purchase your Units. In certain circumstances, however, you may have to
adjust your tax basis after you purchase your Units (for example, in the case of
accruals of original issue discount, market discount, premium and accrued       
interest, as discussed below).                                                  

 If you are an individual, the maximum marginal federal tax rate for net
capital gain is generally 20% (10% for certain taxpayers in the 10% and 15% tax 
brackets). The 20% rate is reduced to 18% and the 10% rate is reduced to 8% for 
long-term gains from most property acquired after December 31, 2000, with a     
holding period of more than five years.                                         

 Net capital gain equals net long-term capital gain minus net short-term
capital loss for the taxable year. Capital gain or loss is long-term if the     
holding period for the asset is more than one year and is short-term if the     
holding period for the asset is one year or less. You must exclude the date you 
purchase your Units to determine your holding period of your Units. The tax     
rates for capital gains realized from assets held for one year or less are      
generally the same as for ordinary income. The Internal Revenue Code, however,  
treats certain capital gains as ordinary income in special situations.          

DISCOUNT, ACCRUED INTEREST AND PREMIUM ON DEBT OBLIGATIONS. Some Debt 
Obligations may have been sold with original issue discount. This generally     
means that the Debt Obligations were originally issued at a price below their   
face (or par) value. Original issue discount accrues on a daily basis and       
generally is treated as interest income for federal income tax purposes. Your   
basis of each Debt Obligation which was issued with original issue discount must
be increased as original issue discount accrues.                                

 Some Debt Obligations may have been purchased by you or your Trust at a
market discount. Market discount is generally the excess of the stated          
redemption price at maturity for the Debt Obligation over the purchase price of 
the Debt Obligation. Market discount can arise based on the price a Trust pays  
for a Debt Obligation or on the price you pay for your Units. Market discount is
taxed as ordinary income. You will recognize this income when your Trust        
receives principal payments on the Debt Obligation, when the Debt Obligation is 
disposed of or redeemed, or when you sell or redeem your Units. Alternatively,  
you may elect to include market discount in taxable income as it accrues.       
Whether or not you make this election will affect how you calculate your basis  
and the timing of certain interest expense deductions. "Stripped" U.S. Treasury 
obligations are subject to the original issue discount rules, rather than being 
treated as having market discount.                                              

     Alternatively, some Debt Obligations may have been purchased by you or your
Trust at a premium. Generally, if the tax basis of your pro rata portion of any 
Debt Obligation, generally including sales charges, exceeds the amount payable  
at maturity, such excess is considered premium. You may elect to amortize       
premium. If you make this election, you may reduce your interest income received
on the Debt Obligation by the amount of the premium that is amortized and your  
tax basis will be reduced.                                                      

    If the price of your Units includes accrued interest on a Debt Obligation,
you must include the accrued interest in your tax basis in that Debt Obligation.
When your Trust receives this accrued interest, you must treat it as a return of
capital and reduce your tax basis in the Debt Obligation.                       

 This discussion provides only the general rules with respect to the tax
treatment of original issue discount, market discount and premium. The rules,   
however, are complex and special rules apply in certain circumstances. For      
example, the accrual of market discount or premium may differ from the          
discussion set forth above in the case of Debt Obligations that were issued with
original issue discount.                                                        

  EXCHANGES. If you elect to reinvest amounts received from a Trust into a
future trust, it is considered a sale for federal income tax purposes, and any  
gain on the sale will be treated as a capital gain, and any loss will be treated
as a capital loss. However, any loss you incur in connection with the exchange  
of your Units of your Trust for units of a future trust will generally be       
disallowed with respect to this deemed sale and subsequent deemed repurchase, to
the extent the two trusts have substantially identical assets under the wash    
sale provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.                                   

    LIMITATIONS ON THE DEDUCTIBILITY OF TRUST EXPENSES. Generally, for federal
income tax purposes, you must take into account your full pro rata share of your
Trust's income, even if some of that income is used to pay Trust expenses. You  
may deduct your pro rata share of each expense paid by the Trust to the same    
extent as if you directly paid the expense. You may, however, be required to    
treat some or all of the expenses of your Trust as miscellaneous itemized       
deductions. Individuals may only deduct certain miscellaneous itemized          
deductions to the extent they exceed 2% of adjusted gross income.               

 FOREIGN, STATE AND LOCAL TAXES. Some distributions by your Trust may be
subject to foreign withholding taxes. Any interest withheld will nevertheless be
treated as income to you. However, because you are deemed to have paid directly 
your share of foreign taxes that have been paid or accrued by your Trust, you   
may be entitled to a foreign tax credit or deduction for U.S. tax purposes with 
respect to such taxes.                                                          

    If you are a foreign investor (i.e., an investor other than a U.S. citizen
or resident or a U.S. corporation, partnership, estate or trust), you will not  
be subject to U.S. federal income taxes, including withholding taxes, on some of
the income from your Trust or on gain from the sale or redemption of your Units,
provided that certain conditions are met. You should consult your tax advisor   
with respect to the conditions you must meet in order to be exempt for U.S. tax 
purposes.                                                                       

   In the opinion of special counsel to the Trusts for New York tax matters,
the Trusts are not associations taxable as corporations and the income of the   
Trusts will be treated as the income of the Unitholders under the existing      
income tax laws of the State and City of New York.                              

EXPENSES 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GENERAL. The Trustee will periodically deduct from the Interest Account
and, to the extent funds are not sufficient therein, from the Principal Account,
amounts necessary to pay the expenses of the Trusts. The Trustee also may       
withdraw from these Accounts such amounts, if any, as it deems necessary to     
establish a reserve for any governmental charges payable out of the Trusts.     
Amounts so withdrawn shall not be considered a part of a Trust's assets until   
such time as the Trustee shall return all or any part of such amounts to the    
appropriate Accounts. All costs and expenses incurred in creating and           
establishing the Trusts, including the cost of the initial preparation, printing
and execution of the Trust Agreement and the certificates, legal and accounting 
expenses, advertising and selling expenses, expenses of the Trustee, initial    
evaluation fees and other out-of-pocket expenses have been borne by the Sponsor 
at no cost to the Trusts.                                                       

     SPONSOR, SUPERVISOR, EVALUATOR AND TRUSTEE. The Sponsor and the Supervisor,
which is an affiliate of the Sponsor, will receive the annual fee indicated     
under "Summary of Essential Financial Information" in Prospectus Part I for     
providing bookkeeping and administrative services and for providing portfolio   
supervisory services for the Trusts. These fees may exceed the actual costs of  
providing these services for a Trust but the total amount received for providing
these services to all Van Kampen unit investment trusts will not exceed the     
total cost of providing the services in any calendar year. The Evaluator will   
receive the annual evaluation fee indicated under "Summary of Essential
Financial Information" in Prospectus Part I for evaluating each Trust's         
portfolio. For its services the Trustee will receive the fee indicated under    
"Summary of Essential Financial Information" in Prospectus Part I (which may be 
reduced as described therein). Part of the Trustee's compensation for its       
services is expected to result from the use of the funds being held in the      
Principal and Interest Accounts for future distributions, payment of expenses   
and redemptions since these Accounts are non-interest bearing to Unitholders.   
These fees are based on the outstanding principal amount of bonds and Units on  
the Date of Deposit for the first year and as of the close of business on       
January 1 for each year thereafter.                                             

INSURANCE. Premiums for any portfolio insurance are obligations of an 
Insured Trust and are payable monthly by the Trustee on behalf of the Trust. As 
bonds covered by a portfolio insurance policy in an Insured Trust are redeemed  
by their respective issuers or are sold by the Trustee, the amount of the       
premium will be reduced in respect of those bonds. If the Trustee exercises the 
right to obtain permanent insurance, the premiums payable for such permanent    
insurance will be paid solely from the proceeds of the sale of the related      
bonds.                                                                          

MISCELLANEOUS EXPENSES. The following additional charges are or may be
incurred by the Trusts: (a) fees of the Trustee for extraordinary services, (b) 
expenses of the Trustee (including legal and auditing expenses) and of counsel  
designated by the Sponsor, (c) various governmental charges, (d) expenses and   
costs of any action taken by the Trustee to protect the Trusts and the rights   
and interests of Unitholders, (e) indemnification of the Trustee for any loss,  
liability or expenses incurred by it in the administration of the Trusts without
negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on its part, (f) any special        
custodial fees payable in connection with the sale of any of the bonds in a     
Trust, (g) expenditures incurred in contacting Unitholders upon termination of  
the Trusts and (h) costs incurred to reimburse the Trustee for advancing funds  
to the Trusts to meet scheduled distributions (which costs may be adjusted      
periodically in response to fluctuations in short-term interest rates). Each    
Trust will pay the costs associated with updating its registration statement    
each year. The fees and expenses set forth herein are payable out of the Trusts.
When such fees and expenses are paid by or owing to the Trustee, they are       
secured by a lien on the portfolio of the applicable Trust. If the balances in  
the Interest and Principal Accounts are insufficient to provide for amounts     
payable by a Trust, the Trustee has the power to sell bonds to pay such amounts.

RISK FACTORS

The Trusts include certain types of bonds described below. Accordingly, an
investment in a Trust should be made with an understanding of the               
characteristics of and risks associated with such bonds. Neither the Sponsor nor
the Trustee shall be liable in any way for any default, failure or defect in any
of the bonds.                                                                   

 TAXABLE MUNICIPAL ISSUES. Certain bonds in a Trust may consist of taxable
obligations of municipal issuers. Obligations of municipal issuers can be either
general obligations of a government entity that are backed by the taxing power  
of such entity or revenue bonds payable from the income of a specific project or
authority and are not supported by the issuer's power to levy taxes.            

General obligation bonds are backed by the general taxing power of the
issuer. The issuer secures these bonds by pledging its faith, credit and        
unlimited taxing power for the payment of principal and interest.               

  Revenue bonds are payable only from the revenue of a specific project or
authority. They are not supported by the issuer's general power to levy taxes.  
The risk of default in payment of interest or principal increases if the income 
of the related project falters because that income is the only source of        
payment. All of the following bonds are revenue bonds.                          

     Airport bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate airports. The
ability of the issuer to make payments on these bonds primarily depends on the  
ability of airlines to meet their obligations under use agreements. Due to      
increased competition, deregulation, increased fuel costs and other factors,    
some airlines may have difficulty meeting these obligations.                    

     Bond banks are vehicles that pool various municipal obligations into larger
offerings. This reduces the cost of borrowing for the municipalities. The types 
of financing projects that these obligations support vary.                      

Certificates of participation are generally a type of municipal lease 
obligation. Lease payments of a governmental entity secure payments on these    
bonds. These payments depend on the governmental entity budgeting appropriations
for the lease payments. A governmental body cannot obligate future governments  
to appropriate for or make lease payments, but governments typically promise to 
take action necessary to include lease payments in their budgets. If a          
government fails to budget for or make lease payments, sufficient funds may not 
exist to pay interest or principal on these bonds.                              

Health care bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenue from 
hospitals and hospital systems. The ability of these issuers to make payments on
bonds depends on factors such as facility occupancy levels, demand for services,
competition resulting from hospital mergers and affiliations, the need to reduce
costs, government regulation, costs of malpractice insurance and claims, and    
government financial assistance (such as Medicare and Medicaid).                

     Higher education bonds are obligations of issuers that operate universities
and colleges. These issuers derive revenues from tuition, dormitories, grants   
and endowments. These issuers face problems related to declines in the number of
college-age individuals, possible inability to raise tuitions and fees,         
uncertainty of continued federal grants, state funding or donations, and        
government legislation or regulation.                                           

Industrial revenue bonds finance the cost of acquiring, building or   
improving industrial projects. Private corporations usually operate these       
projects. The ability of the issuer to make payments on these bonds depends on  
factors such as the creditworthiness of the corporation operating the project,  
revenues generated by the project, expenses of the project and environmental or 
other regulatory restrictions.                                                  

    Multi-family housing bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues
from mortgage loans on multiple family residences, retirement housing or housing
projects for low to moderate-income families. These bonds are generally         
pre-payable at any time. It is likely that their life will be less than their   
stated maturity. The ability of these issuers to make payments on bonds depends 
on such factors as rental income, occupancy levels, operating expenses, mortgage
default rates, taxes, government regulations and appropriation of subsidies.    

  Other care bonds include obligations of issuers that derive revenue from
mental health facilities, nursing homes and intermediate care facilities. These 
bonds are similar to health care bonds and the issuers face the same general    
risks.                                                                          

   Public building bonds finance the cost of acquiring, leasing, building or
improving public buildings such as offices, recreation facilities, convention   
centers, police stations, correctional institutions and parking garages. The    
ability of the issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such  
as the government budgeting sufficient funds to make lease or mortgage payments 
on the facility, user fees or rents, costs of maintenance and decreases in use  
of the facility.                                                                

    Public education bonds are obligations of issuers that operate primary and
secondary schools. The ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds 
depends primarily on ad valorem taxes. These issuers may also face problems     
related to litigation contesting state constitutionality of public education    
financing.                                                                      

    Retail electric/gas/telephone bonds are obligations of issuers that derive
revenues from the retail sale of utilities to customers. The ability of these   
issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the rates and
demand for these utilities, competition, government regulation and rate         
approvals, overhead expenses and the cost of fuels.                             

     Single family housing bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues
from mortgage loans on single family residences. Single family residences       
generally include one to four-family dwellings. These bonds are similar to      
multi-family housing bonds and the issuers face the same general risks.         

     Tax district bonds are obligations secured by a pledge of taxing power by a
municipality, such as tax increment financing or tax allocation bonds. These    
bonds are similar to general obligation bonds. Unlike general obligation bonds, 
however, the municipality does not pledge its unlimited taxing power to pay     
these bonds. Instead, the municipality pledges revenues from a specific tax to  
pay these bonds. If the tax cannot support payment of interest and principal, a 
municipality may need to raise the related tax to pay these bonds. An inability 
to raise the tax could have an adverse affect on these bonds.                   

     Transportation bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate public
transit systems, ports, highways, turnpikes, bridges and other transportation   
systems. The ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on
variations in use, the degree of government subsidization, competition from     
other forms of transportation and increased costs. Port authorities derive      
revenues primarily from fees imposed on ships using the port facilities. These  
fees can fluctuate depending on the local economy and competition from air, rail
and truck transportation. Increased fuel costs, alternative transportation modes
and competition from toll-free bridges and roads will impact revenues of issuers
that operate bridges, roads or tunnels.                                         

   Waste disposal bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from
resource recovery facilities. These facilities process solid waste, generate    
steam and convert steam to electricity. These issuers face problems such as     
costs and delays due to environmental concerns, effects of conservation and     
recycling, destruction or condemnation of a project, void or unenforceable      
contracts, changes in the economic availability of raw materials, operating     
supplies or facilities, and other unavoidable changes that adversely affect     
operation of a project.                                                         

    Water and sewer bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from
user fees from the sale of water and sewerage services. These issuers face      
problems such as the ability to obtain rate increases, population declines,     
difficulties in obtaining new fresh water supplies and "no-growth" zoning       
ordinances. These issuers also face many of the same problems of waste disposal 
issuers.                                                                        

  Wholesale electric bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues
from selling electricity to other utilities. The ability of these issuers to    
make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the rates and demand for
electric utilities, competition, overhead expenses and government regulation and
rate approvals.                                                                 

ZERO COUPON BONDS. Certain of the bonds in a Trust may be "zero coupon" 
bonds. Zero coupon bonds are purchased at a deep discount because the buyer     
receives only the right to receive a final payment at the maturity of the bond  
and does not receive any periodic interest payments. The effect of owning deep  
discount bonds which do not make current interest payments (such as the zero    
coupon bonds) is that a fixed yield is earned not only on the original          
investment but also, in effect, on all discount earned during the life of such  
income on the bond at a rate as high as the implicit yield on the discount bond,
but at the same time eliminates the holder's ability to reinvest at higher rates
in the future. For this reason, zero coupon bonds are subject to substantially  
greater price fluctuations during periods of changing market interest rates than
are securities of comparable quality which pay interest.                        

INSURANCE ON THE BONDS IN AN INSURED TRUST

  Insurance has been obtained by each Insured Trust, by the issuer of bonds in
each Insured Trust, by a prior owner of such bonds, or by the Sponsor prior the 
deposit of such bonds guaranteeing prompt payment of interest and principal,    
when due, in respect of the bonds in such Insured Trust. See "The
Trusts--Objective and Bond Selection" in the prospectus. Each insurance policy  
obtained by an Insured Trust, is non-cancellable and will continue in force so  
long as such Insured Trust is in existence, the respective Portfolio Insurer is 
still in business and the bonds described in such policy continue to be held by 
such Insured Trust (see "Portfolio" for the Trust in the Prospectus Part I).    
Non-payment of premiums on a policy obtained by an Insured Trust will not result
in the cancellation of insurance but will force the insurer to take action      
against the Trustee to recover premium payments due it. The Trustee in turn will
be entitled to recover such payments from such Insured Trust. Premium rates for 
each issue of bonds protected by the policy obtained by an Insured Trust are    
fixed for the life of an Insured Trust. The premium for any insurance policy or 
policies obtained by an issuer of bonds has been paid by such issuer, and any   
such policy or policies are non-cancellable and will continue in force so long  
as the bonds so insured are outstanding and the Portfolio Insurer remains in    
business. If the provider of an original issuance insurance policy is unable to 
meet its obligations under such policy or if the rating assigned to the         
claims-paying ability of any such insurer deteriorates, the Portfolio Insurers  
have no obligation to insure any issue adversely affected by either of the above
described events.                                                               

The aforementioned Trust insurance guarantees the timely payment of     
principal and interest on the bonds as they fall due. For the purposes of the   
Portfolio Insurance, "when due" generally means the stated maturity date for the
payment of principal and interest. However, in the event (a) an issuer of a bond
defaults in the payment of principal or interest on such bond, (b) such issuer  
enters into a bankruptcy proceeding or (c) the maturity of such bond is         
accelerated, the Portfolio Insurer involved has the option, in its sole         
discretion, for a limited period of time after receiving notice of the earliest 
to occur of such a default, bankruptcy proceeding or acceleration to pay the    
outstanding principal amount of such bond plus accrued interest to the date of  
such payment and thereby retire the bond from an Insured Trust prior to such    
bond's stated maturity date. The insurance does not guarantee the market value  
of the bonds or the value of the Units. Insurance obtained by an Insured Trust  
is only effective as to bonds owned by and held in such Insured Trust. In the   
event of a sale of any such bond by the Trustee, such insurance terminates as to
such bond on the date of sale.                                                  

Pursuant to an irrevocable commitment of the Portfolio Insurers, the    
Trustee, upon the sale of a bond covered under a portfolio insurance policy     
obtained by an Insured Trust, has the right to obtain permanent insurance with  
respect to such bond (i.e., insurance to maturity of the bonds regardless of the
identity of the holder thereof) (the "Permanent Insurance") upon the payment of 
a single predetermined insurance premium and any expenses related thereto from  
the proceeds of the sale of such bond. Accordingly, any bond in an Insured Trust
is eligible to be sold on an insured basis. It is expected that the Trustee     
would exercise the right to obtain Permanent Insurance only if upon such        
exercise an Insured Trust would receive net proceeds (sale of bond proceeds less
the insurance premium and related expenses attributable to the Permanent        
Insurance) from such sale in excess of the sale proceeds if such bonds were sold
on an uninsured basis.The insurance premium with respect to each bond eligible  
for Permanent Insurance would be determined based upon the insurability of each 
bond as of the Date of Deposit and would not be increased or decreased for any  
change in the creditworthiness of each bond.                                    

The Sponsor believes that the Permanent Insurance option provides an    
advantage to an Insured Trust in that each bond insured by an Insured Trust     
insurance policy may be sold out of the Insured Trust with the benefits of the  
insurance attaching thereto. Thus, the value of the insurance, if any, at the   
time of sale, can be realized in the market value of the bond so sold (which is 
not the case in connection with any value attributable to such Insured Trust's  
portfolio insurance). See "Public Offering--Offering Price" in the Prospectus   
Part II. Because any such insurance value may be realized in the market value of
the bond upon the sale thereof upon exercise of the Permanent Insurance option, 
the Sponsor anticipates that (a) in the event an Insured Trust were to be       
comprised of a substantial percentage of bonds in default or significant risk of
default, it is much less likely that the Insured Trust would need at some point 
in time to seek a suspension of redemptions of Units than if the Insured Trust  
were to have no such option (see "Rights of Unitholders--Redemption of Units" in
the Prospectus Part II) and (b) at the time of termination of an Insured Trust, 
if the Insured Trust were holding defaulted bonds or bonds in significant risk  
of default, the Insured Trust would not need to hold such bonds until their     
respective maturities in order to realize the benefits of the Insured Trust's   
portfolio insurance. (See "Trust Administration--Termination of Trust Agreement"
in the Prospectus Part II.)                                                     

Except as indicated below, insurance obtained by an Insured Trust has no
effect on the price or redemption value of Units. It is the present intention of
the Evaluator to attribute a value for such insurance (including the right to   
obtain Permanent Insurance) for the purpose of computing the price or redemption
value of Units if the bonds covered by such insurance are in default in payment 
of principal or interest or in significant risk of such default. The value of   
the insurance will be equal to the difference between (i) the market value of a 
bond which is in default in payment of principal or interest or in significant  
risk of such default assuming the exercise of the right to obtain Permanent     
Insurance (less the insurance premium and related expenses attributable to the  
purchase of Permanent Insurance) and (ii) the market value of such bond not     
covered by Permanent Insurance. See "Public Offering--Offering Price" in the    
Prospectus Part II for a more complete description of an Insured Trust's method 
of valuing defaulted bonds which have a significant risk of default.            

Ambac Assurance Corporation ("Ambac Assurance"). Effective July 14, 1997, 
AMBAC Indemnity Corporation changed its name to Ambac Assurance Corporation. The
Insurance Policy of Ambac Assurance obtained by an Insured Trust is             
noncancellable and will continue in force for so long as the bonds described in 
the Insurance Policy are held by an Insured Trust. A monthly premium is paid by 
an Insured Trust for the Insurance Policy obtained by it. The Trustee will pay, 
when due, successively, the full amount of each installment of the insurance    
premium. Pursuant to a binding agreement with Ambac Assurance, in the event of a
sale of a bond covered by the Ambac Assurance Insurance Policy, the Trustee has 
the right to obtain permanent insurance for such bond upon payment of a single  
predetermined premium from the proceeds of the sale of such bond.               

   Under the terms of the Insurance Policy, Ambac Assurance agrees to pay to the
Trustee that portion of the principal of and interest on the bonds insured by   
Ambac Assurance which shall become due for payment but shall be unpaid by reason
of nonpayment by the issuer of the bonds. The term "due for payment" means, when
referring to the principal of a bond so insured, its stated maturity date or the
date on which it shall have been called for mandatory sinking fund redemption   
and does not refer to any earlier date on which payment is due by reason of call
for redemption (other than by mandatory sinking fund redemption), acceleration  
or other advancement of maturity and means, when referring to interest on a     
bond, the stated date for payment of interest.                                  

 Ambac Assurance will make payment to the Trustee not later than thirty days
after notice from the Trustee is received by Ambac Assurance that a nonpayment  
of principal or of interest on a bond has occurred, but not earlier than the    
date on which the bonds are due for payment. Ambac Assurance will disburse to   
the Trustee the face amount of principal and interest which is then due for     
payment but is unpaid by reason of nonpayment by the issuer in exchange for     
delivery of bonds, not less in face amount than the amount of the payment in    
bearer form, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances and uncancelled. In   
cases where bonds are issuable only in a form whereby principal is payable to   
registered holders or their assigns, Ambac Assurance shall pay principal only   
upon presentation and surrender of the unpaid Bonds uncancelled and free of any 
adverse claim, together with an instrument of assignment in satisfactory form,  
so as to permit ownership of such bonds to be registered in the name of Ambac   
Assurance or its nominee. In cases where bonds are issuable only in a form      
whereby interest is payable to registered holders or their assigns, Ambac       
Assurance shall pay interest only upon presentation of proof that the claimant  
is the person entitled to the payment of interest of the bonds and delivery of  
an instrument of assignment, in satisfactory form, transferring to Ambac        
Assurance all right under such bonds to receive the interest of which the       
insurance payment was made.

Financial Security and its subsidiaries are engaged in the business of    
writing financial guaranty insurance, principally in respect of securities      
offered in domestic and foreign markets. Financial guaranty insurance provides a
guaranty of scheduled payments of an issuer's securities, thereby enhancing the 
credit rating of those securities, in consideration for payment of a premium to 
the insurer. Financial Security and its subsidiaries principally insure         
asset-backed, collateralized and municipal securities. Asset-backed securities  
are generally supported by residential mortgage loans, consumer or trade        
receivables, securites or other assets having an ascertainable cash flow or     
market value. Collateralized securities include public utility first mortgage   
bonds and sale/leaseback obligation bonds. Municipal securities consist largely 
of general obligation bonds, special revenue bonds and other special obligations
of state and local governments. Financial Security insures both newly issued    
securities sold in the primary market and outstanding securities sold in the    
secondary market that satisfy Financial Security's underwriting criteria.       

Financial Security is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Financial Security     
Assurance Holdings Ltd. ("Holdings"), a New York Stock Exchange listed compay.  
Major shareholders of Holdings include XL Capital Ltd. and The Tokio Marine and 
Fire Insurance Co. Ltd. On March 14, 2000, Holdings announced that it had       
entered into a merger agreement pursuant to which Holdings would become a       
wholly-owned subsidiary of Dexia S.A., a publicly held Belgian corporation,     
subject to receipt of shareholder and regulatory approvals and satisfaction of  
other closing conditions. Dexia S.A., through its bank subsidiaries, is         
primarily engaged in the business of public finance in France, Belgium and other
European countries. No shareholder of Holdings is obligated to pay any debt of  
Financial Security or any claim under any insurance policy issued by Financial  
Security or to make any additional contribution to the capital of Financial     
Security. As of September 30, 2001, the total policyholders' surplus and        
contingency reserves and the total unearned premium reserve, respectively, of   
Financial Security and its consolidated subsidiaries were, in accordance with   
statutory accounting principles, approximately $1,526,197,000 (unaudited) and   
$784,712,000 (unaudited), and the total shareholders' equity and the unearned   
premium reserve, respectively, of Financial Security and its consolidated       
subsidiaries were, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted  
in the United States, approximately $1,670,116,000 (unaudited), and $646,496,000

Pursuant to an intercompany agreement, liabilities on financial guaranty  
insurance written or reinsured from third parties by Financial Security or its  
domestic or Bermuda operating insurance company subsidiaries are generally      
reinsured among such companies on an agreed-upon percentage substantially       
proportional to their respective capital, surplus and reserves, subject to      
applicable statutory risk limitations. In addition, Financial Security reinsures
a portion of its liabilities under certain various quota share treaties and on a
transaction-by-transaction basis. This reinsurance is used by Financial Security
as a risk management device and to comply with certain statutory and rating     
agency requirements; it does not alter on limit the obligations of Financial    
Security under any financial guaranty insurance policy.                         

 Financial Security's insurance financial strength is rated "Aaa" by Moody's
Investors Service, Inc. Financial Security's insurer financial strength is rated
"AAA" by Standard & Poor's Ratings Services and Standard &Poor's (Australia)    
Pty. Ltd. Financial Security's claims-paying ability is rated "AAA" by Fitch    
IBCA, Inc. and Japan Rating and Investment Information, Inc. These ratings      
reflect only the views of the respective rating agencies, are not               
recommendations to buy, or sell or hold securities and are subject to revision  
or withdrawal at any time by those rating agencies.                             

Capital Guranty Insurance Company. On December 20, 1995, Capital Guaranty 
Corporation ("CGC") merged with a subsidiary of Financial Security Assurance    
Holdings Ltd. and Capital Guaranty Insurance Company, CGC's principal operating 
subsidiary, changed its name to Financial Security Assurance of Maryland Inc.   
("FSA Maryland") and became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Financial Security     
Assurance Inc. On September 30, 1997, Financial Security Assurance Inc. assumed 
all of the liabilities of FSA Maryland and sold the FSA Maryland "shell company"
to American Capital Access, a wholly-owned subsidiary of American Capital Access
Holdings, Incorporated.                                                         

General. Because the bonds in an Insured Trust are insured as to the timely
payment of principal and interest, when due (as more fully described above), and
on the basis of the various reinsurance agreements in effect, Standard & Poor's 
has assigned to the Units its "AAA" investment rating. Such rating will be in   
effect for a period of thirteen months from the Date of Deposit and will, unless
renewed, terminate at the end of such period. The obtaining of this rating by an
Insured Trust should not be construed as an approval of the offering of the     
Units by Standard & Poor's or as a guarantee of the market value of the Insured 
Trust or of the Units.                                                          

An objective of portfolio insurance obtained by an Insured Trust is to  
obtain a higher yield on the Insured Trust portfolio than would be available if 
all the bonds in such portfolio had Standard & Poor's "AAA" rating and yet at   
the same time to have the protection of insurance of prompt payment of interest 
and principal, when due (as more fully described above), on the bonds. There is,
of course, no certainty that this result will be achieved.                      

    In the event of nonpayment of interest or principal, when due (as more fully
described above), in respect of a bond, the appropriate Insurer shall make such 
payment within 30 days after it has been notified that such nonpayment has      
occurred. The appropriate Insurer, as regards any payment it may make, will     
succeed to the rights of the Trustee in respect thereof.                        

The information relating to the Insurers has been furnished by the      
respective Insurers. The financial information with respect to the Insurers     
appears in reports filed with state insurance regulatory authorities and is     
subject to audit and review by such authorities. No representation is made      
herein as to the accuracy or adequacy of such information or as to the absence  
of material adverse changes in such information subsequent to the dates thereof.

PORTFOLIO ADMINISTRATION

The Trustee is empowered to sell, for the purpose of redeeming Units    
tendered by any Unitholder, and for the payment of expenses for which funds may 
not be available, such of the bonds designated by the Supervisor as the Trustee 
in its sole discretion may deem necessary. The Supervisor, in designating such  
bonds, will consider a variety of factors, including (a) interest rates, (b)    
market value and (c) marketability. To the extent that bonds are sold which are 
current in payment of principal and interest in order to meet redemption        
requests and defaulted bonds are retained in the portfolio in order to preserve 
the related insurance protection applicable to said bonds, if any, the overall  
quality of the bonds remaining in a Trust's portfolio will tend to diminish. The
Sponsor is empowered, but not obligated, to direct the Trustee to dispose of    
bonds in the event of an advanced refunding.                                    

   The Sponsor is required to instruct the Trustee to reject any offer made by
an issuer of any of the bonds to issue new bonds in exchange or substitution for
any bond pursuant to a refunding or refinancing plan, except that the Sponsor   
may instruct the Trustee to accept or reject such an offer or to take any other 
action with respect thereto as the Sponsor may deem proper if (1) the issuer is 
in default with respect to such bond or (2) in the written opinion of the       
Sponsor the issuer will probably default with respect to such bond in the       
reasonably foreseeable future. Any bond so received in exchange or substitution 
will be held by the Trustee subject to the terms and conditions of the Trust    
Agreement to the same extent as bonds originally deposited thereunder. Within   
five days after the deposit of obligations in exchange or substitution for      
underlying bonds, the Trustee is required to give notice thereof to each        
Unitholder, identifying the bonds eliminated and the bonds substituted therefor.
Except as stated herein and under "Trust Administration--Replacement Bonds" in  
the Prospectus Part II regarding the substitution of Replacement Bonds for      
Failed Bonds, the acquisition by a Trust of any bonds other than the bonds      
initially deposited is not permitted.                                           

 If any default in the payment of principal or interest on any bond occurs
and no provision for payment is made therefor either pursuant to the portfolio  
insurance, or otherwise, within 30 days, the Trustee is required to notify the  
Sponsor thereof. If the Sponsor fails to instruct the Trustee to sell or to hold
such bonds within 30 days after notification by the Trustee to the Sponsor of   
such default, the Trustee may in its discretion sell the defaulted Bond and not 
be liable for any depreciation or loss thereby incurred.

records shall include the name and address of, and the certificates issued by   
the Trusts to, every Unitholder of the Trusts. Such books and records shall be  
open to inspection by any Unitholder at all reasonable times during the usual   
business hours. The Trustee shall make such annual or other reports as may from 
time to time be required under any applicable state or Federal statute, rule or 
regulation. The Trustee is required to keep a certified copy or duplicate       
original of the Trust Agreement on file in its office available for inspection  
at all reasonable times during the usual business hours by any Unitholder,      
together with a current list of the bonds held in the Trusts.                   

Under the Trust Agreement, the Trustee or any successor trustee may resign
and be discharged of the trusts created by the Trust Agreement by executing an  
instrument in writing and filing the same with the Sponsor. The Trustee or      
successor trustee must mail a copy of the notice of resignation to all          
Unitholders then of record, not less than 60 days before the date specified in  
such notice when such resignation is to take effect. The Sponsor upon receiving 
notice of such resignation is obligated to appoint a successor trustee promptly.
If, upon such resignation, no successor trustee has been appointed and has      
accepted the appointment within 30 days after notification, the retiring Trustee
may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a         
successor. The Sponsor may remove the Trustee and appoint a successor trustee as
provided in the Trust Agreement at any time with or without cause. Notice of    
such removal and appointment shall be mailed to each Unitholder by the Sponsor. 
Upon execution of a written acceptance of such appointment by such successor    
trustee, all the rights, powers, duties and bonds of the original trustee shall 
vest in the successor. The resignation or removal of a Trustee becomes effective
only when the successor trustee accepts its appointment as such or when a court 
of competent jurisdiction appoints a successor trustee. Any corporation into    
which a Trustee may be merged or with which it may be consolidated, or any      
corporation resulting from any merger or consolidation to which a Trustee shall 
be a party, shall be the successor trustee. The Trustee must be a banking       
corporation organized under the laws of the United States or any state and      
having at all times an aggregate capital, surplus and undivided profits of not  
less than $5,000,000.                                                           

TERMINATION OF THE TRUST AGREEMENT

    A Trust may be terminated at any time by consent of Unitholders representing
51% of the Units of the Trust then outstanding or by the Trustee when the value 
of the Trust, as shown by any semi-annual evaluation, is less than 20% of the   
original principal amount of bonds.                                             

A Trust will be liquidated by the Trustee in the event that a sufficient
number of Units not yet sold are tendered for redemption by the Underwriters,   
including the Sponsor, so that the net worth of the Trust would be reduced to   
less than 40% of the initial principal amount of the Trust. If a Trust is       
liquidated because of the redemption of unsold Units by the Underwriters, the   
Sponsor will refund to each purchaser of Units the entire sales charge paid by  
such purchaser.                                                                 

The Trust Agreement provides that a Trust shall terminate upon the      
redemption, sale or other disposition of the last bond held in the Trust, but in
no event shall it continue beyond the end of the year preceding the fiftieth    
anniversary of the Trust Agreement in the case of a Long-Term Trust and at the  
end of the calender year prior to the twentieth anniversary of its execution in 
the case of an Intermediate-Term Trust. In the event of termination of a Trust, 
written notice thereof will be sent by the Trustee to each Unitholder at his    
address appearing on the registration books of the Trust maintained by the      
Trustee, such notice specifying the time or times at which the Unitholder may   
surrender his certificate or certificates for cancellation. Within a reasonable 
time thereafter the Trustee shall liquidate any bonds then held in a Trust and  
shall deduct from the funds of the Trust any accrued costs, expenses or         
indemnities provided by the Trust Agreement, including estimated compensation of
the Trustee and costs of liquidation and any amounts required as a reserve to   
provide for payment of any applicable taxes or other governmental charges. The  
sale of bonds in a Trust upon termination may result in a lower amount than     
might otherwise be realized if such sale were not required at such time. For    
this reason, among others, the amount realized by a Unitholder upon termination 
may be less than the principal amount or par amount of bonds represented by the 
Units held by such Unitholder. The Trustee shall then distribute to each        
Unitholder his share of the balance of the Interest and Principal Accounts. With
such distribution the Unitholders shall be furnished a final distribution       
statement of the amount distributable. At such time as the Trustee in its sole  
discretion shall determine that any amounts held in reserve are no longer       
necessary, it shall make distribution thereof to Unitholders in the same manner.

DESCRIPTION OF RATINGS

STANDARD & POOR'S, A DIVISION OF THE MCGRAW-HILL COMPANIES. A Standard &  
Poor's corporate or municipal bond rating is a current assessment of the        
creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific debt bond. This       
assessment of creditworthiness may take into consideration obligors such as     
guarantors, insurers or lessees.                                                

The bond rating is not a recommendation to purchase or sell a security,   
inasmuch as it does not comment as to market price.                             

 The ratings are based on current information furnished to Standard & Poor's
by the issuer and obtained by Standard & Poor's from other sources it considers 
reliable. The ratings may be changed, suspended or withdrawn as a result of     
changes in, or unavailability of, such information.                             

 The ratings are based, in varying degrees, on the following considerations:

   I.   Likelihood of default--capacity and willingness of the obligor as to
the timely payment of interest and repayment of principal in
accordance with the terms of the obligation.                

II.  Nature of and provisions of the obligation.                      

III. Protection afforded by, and relative position of, the bond in the
       event of bankruptcy, reorganization or other arrangements under the
  laws of bankruptcy and other laws affecting creditors' rights.

  AAA--This is the highest rating assigned by Standard & Poor's to a debt bond
and indicates an extremely strong capacity to pay principal and interest.       

   AA--Bonds rated AA also qualify as high-quality debt obligations. Capacity to
pay principal and interest is very strong, and in the majority of instances they
differ from AAA issues only in small degree.                                    

A--Bonds rated A have a strong capacity to pay principal and interest,    
although they are somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in
circumstances and economic conditions.                                          

BBB--Bonds rated BBB are regarded as having an adequate capacity to pay   
interest and repay principal. Whereas they normally exhibit adequate protection 
parameters, adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more      
likely to lead to a weakened capacity to pay interest and repay principal for   
debt in this category than in higher rated categories.                          

Plus (+) or Minus (-): To provide more detailed indications of credit     
quality, the ratings from "AA" to "BBB" may be modified by the addition of a    
plus or minus sign to show relative standing within the major rating categories.

Provisional Ratings: A provisional rating ("p") assumes the successful    
completion of the project being financed by the issuance of the bonds being     
rated and indicates that payment of debt service requirements is largely or     
entirely dependent upon the successful and timely completion of the project.    
This rating, however, while addressing credit quality subsequent to completion, 
makes no comment on the likelihood of, or the risk of default upon failure of,  
such completion. Accordingly, the investor should exercise his own judgment with
respect to such likelihood and risk.                                            

MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE, INC. A brief description of the applicable 
Moody's rating symbols and their meanings follows:                              

  Aaa--Bonds which are rated Aaa are judged to be the best quality. They carry
the smallest degree of investment risk and are generally referred to as "gilt   
edge". Interest payments are protected by a large, or by an exceptionally       
stable, margin and principal is secure. While the various protective elements   
are likely to change, such changes as can be visualized are most unlikely to    
impair the fundamentally strong position of such issues. With the occasional    
exception of oversupply in a few specific instances, the safety of obligations  
of this class is so absolute that their market value is affected solely by money
market fluctuations.                                                            

Aa--Bonds which are rated Aa are judged to be of high quality by all      
standards. Together with the Aaa group they comprise what are generally known as
high grade bonds. They are rated lower than the best bonds because margins of   
protection may not be as large as in Aaa securities or fluctuations of          
protective elements may be of greater amplitude or there may be other elements  
present which make the long-term risks appear somewhat larger than in Aaa       
securities. These Aa bonds are high grade, their market value virtually immune  
to all but money market influences, with the occasional exception of oversupply 
in a few specific instances.                                                    

 A--Bonds which are rated A possess many favorable investment attributes and
are to be considered as higher medium grade obligations. Factors giving security
to principal and interest are considered adequate, but elements may be present  
which suggest a susceptibility to impairment sometime in the future. The market 
value of A-rated bonds may be influenced to some degree by credit circumstances 
during a sustained period of depressed business conditions. During periods of   
normalcy, bonds of this quality frequently move in parallel with Aaa and Aa     
obligations, with the occasional exception of oversupply in a few specific      
instances.                                                                      

Baa--Bonds which are rated Baa are considered as medium grade obligations;
i.e., they are neither highly protected nor poorly secured. Interest payments   
and principal security appear adequate for the present but certain protective   
elements may be lacking or may be characteristically unreliable over any great  
length of time. Such bonds lack outstanding investment characteristics and in   
fact have speculative characteristics as well.                                  

Moody's bond rating symbols may contain numerical modifiers of a generic  
rating classification. The modifier 1 indicates that the bond ranks at the high 
end of its category; the modifier 2 indicates a mid-range ranking; and the      
modifier 3 indicates that the issue ranks in the lower end of its generic rating
category.                                                                       

  Con--Bonds for which the security depends upon the completion of some act or
the fulfillment of some condition are rated conditionally. These are bonds      
secured by (a) earnings of projects under construction, (b) earnings of projects
unseasoned in operating experience, (c) rentals which begin when facilities are 
completed, or (d) payments to which some other limiting condition attaches.     
Parenthetical rating denotes probable credit stature upon completion of         
construction or elimination of basis of condition.                              

 ESTIMATED CASH FLOWS TO UNITHOLDERS

The tables below set forth the per Unit estimated monthly and semi-annual 
distributions of interest and principal to Unitholders. The tables assume no    
changes in expenses, no changes in the current interest rates, no exchanges,    
redemptions, sales or prepayments of the underlying bonds prior to maturity or  
expected retirement date and the receipt of principal upon maturity or expected 
retirement date. To the extent the foregoing assumptions change actual          
distributions will vary.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors of Van Kampen Funds Inc. and the Unitholders of Van   
Kampen Focus Portfolios, Series 390 (Central Equity Trust, Diversified Income   
Series 10):                                                                     
We have audited the accompanying statement of condition (including the    
analysis of net assets) and the related portfolio schedule of Central Equity    
Trust, Diversified Income Series 10 (included in Van Kampen Focus Portfolios,   
Series 390) as of May 31, 2006 and the related statements of operations and     
changes in net assets for the period from June 4, 2003 (Initial Date of Deposit)
through May 31, 2004 and the years ended May 31, 2005 and 2006. These statements
are the responsibility of the Trustee and the Sponsor. Our responsibility is to 
express an opinion on such statements based on our audits.                      
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public    
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the 
financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Trust is not        
required to have, nor were we engaged to perform an audit of its internal       
control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal 
control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that 
are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an  
opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust's internal control over financial     
reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes      
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in  
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and          
significant estimates made by the Trustee and Sponsor, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. Our procedures included confirmation  
of securities owned at May 31, 2006 by correspondence with the Trustee. We      
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.             
   In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Central Equity Trust,          
Diversified Income Series 10 (included in Van Kampen Focus Portfolios, Series   
390) as of May 31, 2006 and the results of operations and changes in net assets 
for the period from June 4, 2003 (Initial Date of Deposit) through May 31, 2004 
and the years ended May 31, 2005 and 2006, in conformity with accounting        
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

 VAN KAMPEN FOCUS PORTFOLIOS, SERIES 390
 Notes to Financial Statements
 May 31, 2004, 2005 and 2006
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES                             
Security Valuation - Securities are valued as described in Prospectus Part
II.                                                                             

  Security Cost - The cost of the Securities is determined based on the actual
price paid by the Trust on the various dates of deposit.                        

  Unit Valuation - The redemption price per Unit is the pro rata share of each
Unit based upon (1) the cash on hand in the Trust or monies in the process of   
being collected, (2) the Securities in the Trust based on the value as described
in Note 1 and (3) accumulated dividends thereon, less accrued expenses of the   
Trust, if any.                                                                  

Federal Income Taxes - Unitholders are considered to be the owner of a pro
rata portion of the related Trust and, accordingly, no provisions have been made
for Federal income taxes.                                                       

Other - The financial statements are presented on the accrual basis of    
accounting. Any realized gains or losses from securities transactions are       
reported on an identified cost basis.                                           

NOTE 2 - PORTFOLIO                                                              
Unrealized Appreciation and Depreciation - An analysis of net unrealized  
appreciation (depreciation) at May 31, 2006 is as follows:                      

Unrealized Appreciation       $    19,821,843                             
Unrealized Depreciation            (2,454,000)

NOTE 3- OTHER                                                                   
Marketability - Although it is not obligated to do so, the Underwriter    
intends to maintain a market for Units and to continuously offer to purchase    
Units at prices, subject to change at any time, based upon the value of the     
Securities in the portfolio of the Trust valued as described in Note 1, plus    
accumulated dividends to the date of settlement. If the supply of Units exceeds 
demand, or for other business reasons, the Underwriter may discontinue purchases
of Units at such prices. In the event that a market is not maintained for the   
Units, a Unitholder desiring to dispose of his Units may be able to do so only  
by tendering such units to the Trustee for redemption at the redemption price.  

   Cost to Investors - The cost to original investors was based on adding to the
underlying value of the Securities per Unit on the date of an investor's        
purchase, plus an amount equal to the maximum sales charge of 4.50% of the      
public offering price which is equivalent to 4.712% of the aggregate underlying 
value of the Securities. On each June 4, commencing June 4, 2004, the secondary 
market sales charge will decrease by .5 of 1% to a minimum sales charge of 2.3%.

Compensation of Sponsor and Supervisor - The Supervisor receives a fee for
providing portfolio supervisory services for the Trust ($.0025 per Unit, not to 
exceed the aggregate cost of the Supervisor for providing such services to all  
applicable Trusts). The Sponsor receives and annual fee for performing          
bookkeeping and administrative services for the Trust. Both fees may be adjusted
for increases under the category "All Services Less Rent of Shelter" in the     
Consumer Price Index.                                                           

NOTE 4 - REDEMPTION OF UNITS                                                    
   During the period from June 4, 2003 (Initial Date of Deposit) through May 31,
2004 and the years ended May 31, 2005 and 2006, 269,026 Units, 459,189 Units and
585,885 Units, respectively, were presented for redemption.

THE TRUST 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The Trust was created under the laws of the State of New York pursuant to a
Trust Indenture and Trust Agreement (the "Trust Agreement"), dated the date of  
this prospectus (the "Initial Date of Deposit"), among Van Kampen Funds Inc., as
Sponsor, Van Kampen Asset Management, as Supervisor, and The Bank of New York,  
as Trustee and, in certain cases, as Evaluator, or their predecessors. Effective
April 23, 2001 American Portfolio Evaluation Services, a division of Van Kampen 
Investment Advisory Corp., resigned as Evaluator and The Bank of New York was   
appointed successor Evaluator.                                                  

   The Trust offers the opportunity to purchase Units representing proportionate
interests in a portfolio of equity securities. The Trust may be an appropriate  
medium for investors who desire to participate in a portfolio of common stocks  
with greater diversification than they might be able to acquire individually.   

On the Initial Date of Deposit, the Sponsor deposited delivery statements 
relating to contracts for the purchase of the Securities and an irrevocable     
letter of credit in the amount required for these purchases with the Trustee. In
exchange for these contracts the Trustee delivered to the Sponsor documentation 
evidencing the ownership of Units of the Trust. Unless otherwise terminated as  
provided in the Trust Agreement, the Trust will terminate on the Mandatory      
Termination Date and any remaining Securities will be liquidated or distributed 
by the Trustee within a reasonable time. As used in this prospectus the term    
"Securities" means the securities (including contracts to purchase these        
securities) listed in the "Portfolio" in Part One and any additional securities 
deposited into the Trust.                                                       

Additional Units may be issued at any time by depositing in the Trust (i) 
additional Securities, (ii) contracts to purchase Securities together with cash 
or irrevocable letters of credit or (iii) cash (or a letter of credit or the    
equivalent) with instructions to purchase additional Securities. As additional  
Units are issued by the Trust, the aggregate value of the Securities will be    
increased and the fractional undivided interest represented by each Unit will be
decreased. The Sponsor may continue to make additional deposits into the Trust  
following the Initial Date of Deposit, provided that the additional deposits    
will be in amounts which will maintain, as nearly as practicable, the same      
percentage relationship among the number of shares of each Security in the      
Trust's portfolio as existed immediately prior to the subsequent deposit.       
Investors may experience a dilution of their investments and a reduction in     
their anticipated income because of fluctuations in the prices of the Securities
between the time of the deposit and the purchase of the Securities and because  
the Trust will pay the associated brokerage or acquisition fees.                

   Each Unit initially offered represents an undivided interest in the Trust. To
the extent that any Units are redeemed by the Trustee or additional Units are   
issued as a result of additional Securities being deposited by the Sponsor, the 
fractional undivided interest in the Trust represented by each unredeemed Unit  
will increase or decrease accordingly, although the actual interest in the Trust
will remain unchanged. Units will remain outstanding until redeemed upon tender 
to the Trustee by Unitholders, which may include the Sponsor, or until the      
termination of the Trust Agreement.                                             

The Trust consists of (a) the Securities (including contracts for the     
purchase thereof) listed under the "Portfolio" in Part One as may continue to be
held from time to time in the Trust, (b) any additional Securities acquired and 
held by the Trust pursuant to the provisions of the Trust Agreement and (c) any 
cash held in the related Income and Capital Accounts. Neither the Sponsor nor   
the Trustee shall be liable in any way for any failure in any of the Securities.

OBJECTIVES AND SECURITIES SELECTION 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The objective of the Trust is to provide capital appreciation and dividend
income. The Trust seeks to achieve its objective by investing in a portfolio of 
stocks of companies which may include United States domestic electric utilities,
natural gas utilities, water utilities, telecommunications companies, real      
estate investment trusts, technology companies, health care companies, consumer 
products companies, consumer cyclicals companies, consumer staples companies,   
energy companies, industrials companies or financial services companies. The    
portfolio consists of securities selected by research analysts at Edward D.     
Jones & Co., L.P. (the "Underwriter") and approved by the Sponsor. In selecting 
the Securities, the following factors, among others, were considered: dividend  
yield, geographic diversification, earnings growth rates, regulatory climate and
stock valuation. At the time the Securities were selected, the Underwriter's    
research analysts were currently covering all the issuers of the Securities and 
had published favorable recommendations for each of them. There can be no       
assurance that such coverage will continue for any issuer during the life of the
Trust or that the report on any such issuer will continue to be favorable. A    
downgrade in an analyst's recommendation for an issuer, or the termination of   
such coverage, could negatively affect the performance of the Trust.            

You should note that the selection criteria were applied to the Securities
for inclusion in the Trust as of the Initial Date of Deposit. After this date,  
the Securities may no longer meet the selection criteria. Should a Security no  
longer meet the selection criteria, we will generally not remove the Security   
from the portfolio. In offering the Units to the public, neither the Sponsor nor
any broker-dealers are recommending any of the individual Securities but rather 
the entire pool of Securities, taken as a whole, which are represented by the   
Units.                                                                          

 Telecommunications. The emergence of a global, networked economy appears to
be changing the face of the telecommunications industry. Telecommunications     
companies provide local, long distance and wireless telephone, as well as cable 
television and internet, services and information systems, manufacture          
telecommunications products, and operate voice, data and telecommunications     
networks. As the technology driving this industry group continues to develop and
evolve, telecommunications companies could continue to grow in both customer    
base and services offered.                                                      

  Financial Services. The Trust may invest significantly in financial services
companies. Many banks, insurance companies and other financial services         
companies have recently made changes in the products they offer. The financial  
services industry has experienced a high level of consolidations, mergers and   
acquisitions as well as other regulatory issues. This industry group may be     
appealing for reasons such as deregulation of the banking industry and          
accelerated earnings growth. These factors can potentially provide advantages to
those investing in this industry group.                                         

Utilities. The environment of the electric, natural gas and water utility 
industry appears to be adapting to include recent changes in regulatory         
requirements as well as technological changes. In the past, this industry was   
fraught with government mandated monopolies. Today, many states are deregulating
their utilities which may result in lowering some of the barriers to            
competition. Additionally, utility companies appear to be expanding their       
services and offerings to include other retail services not traditionally       
offered. The growth and expansion occurring could potentially continue as the   
utility industry proceeds through these transformations.                        

  Real Estate Investment Trusts. A real estate investment trust, or REIT, is a
company that buys, develops, finances and/or manages income-producing real      
estate such as apartments, shopping centers, offices and warehouses. A REIT can 
be a good way to invest in commercial real estate. Compared to traditional      
direct investments in real estate, which may be difficult to sell and value,    
REITs are traded on major stock exchanges making them highly liquid. REIT       
investors also gain the advantage of skilled management since REIT management   
teams tend to be experts within their specific property or geographic niches.   
Many believe that the attractive features of property ownership and stock       
ownership are combined in this investment vehicle. REITs can provide investors  
with current income, as they are currently required to distribute 90% of taxable
income annually, and can have the potential for attractive returns. They have   
historically had low relative volatility and may provide inflation protection.  

Consumer Staples. Consumer staples is a relatively mature industry, with  
growth in line with population growth. Recent waves of consolidation in the     
industry have reduced the number of competitors, which has enabled product price
increases in some sectors. Additionally, product innovation has proven key to   
growth and should lead to above-industry growth rates for successful companies. 
The industry is characterized primarily by stable, high-profit margin companies,
several of which pay attractive dividends.                                      

Industrials. The industrials industry includes capital goods, commercial  
services and transportation companies. Generally, growth prospects for the      
industry are tied to economic factors such as consumer and business spending,   
U.S. Gross Domestic Product and exports to foreign nations. The increasingly    
global economy should increase the demand for industrial products made by U.S.  
firms. Within capital goods, defense and electronics are some of the fastest    
growing areas, given the political support for higher government spending on    
defense initiatives. Many industrials companies are well-established and have   
demonstrated a track record of paying dividends and increasing the amount of    
dividends paid over time.                                                       

   Health Care. An aging population, new drug development and product innovation
should drive growth for this industry. Additionally, foreign demand for health  
care, particularly from developing nations, continues to increase. The industry 
has historically grown at a rate faster than the overall economy and that trend 
should continue. Research and development spending, supported by strong demand, 
should lead to new products. Health care companies have traditionally paid part 
of earnings as dividends, which is expected to continue. Given the growth       
prospects for the industry, dividend growth should be meaningful as well.       

  Energy. As the world economy grows, energy use is also expected to rise. The
companies that produce oil and natural gas are finding and developing new       
sources worldwide to satisfy this growing need. Oil companies also refine crude 
oil into useful products such as gasoline and jet fuel, as well as provide the  
raw materials for a wide variety of plastics. Investors benefit from the        
diversity of their businesses, their global reach, and their ability to find    
attractive opportunities in the changing energy marketplace.                    

Technology. The Trust may invest in technology companies. Technology      
companies generally include companies involved in the development, design,      
manufacture and sale of computers, computer related equipment, computer         
networks, communications systems, telecommunications products, electronic       
products, and other related products, systems and services. Technology is a     
cyclical industry, driven by corporate and consumer spending on technology      
products, services and software. New technologies have the potential to increase
productivity and enable new applications. Stable spending on traditional        
technology platforms such as personal computers, plus spending on new           
technologies, should enable the industry to grow faster than the economy.       
Several technology companies are generating substantial excess cash, which they 
have used to begin paying dividends. These companies have the potential to      
increase their dividends on a regular basis.                                    

Consumer Cyclicals. The Trust may invest in companies that manufacture or 
sell products or services, the demand for which is easily influenced by general 
economic conditions. Industries within this segment include advertising,        
airlines, auto parts, auto manufacturing, broadcasting, casinos, clothing and   
fabrics, consumer electronics, entertainment, footwear, furnishings and         
appliances, home construction, lodging, publishing, recreational products and   
services, restaurants, apparel retailers, broadline retailers, drug-based       
retailers, specialty retailers, tires and toys. These companies would be        
expected to perform well during an improving economy but may lag during a       
declining economy. Industries within this group that may hold potential for     
above-average growth include niche retailing, entertainment and media. Many     
companies within this sector are becoming more dividends-focused, and may       
increase their dividends going forward.                                         

Consumer Products. Consumer products is a relatively mature industry, with
growth in-line with population growth. Recent waves of consolidation in the     
industry have reduced the number of competitors, which has enabled product price
increases in some sectors. Additionally, product innovation has proven key to   
growth and should lead to above-industry growth rates for successful companies. 
The industry is characterized primarily by stable, high-profit margin companies,
several of which pay attractive dividends.                                      

  Underwriter Activities. The Underwriter may recommend or effect transactions
in the Securities in its day to day brokerage activities. This may have an      
adverse effect on the prices of the Securities. This also may have an impact on 
the price the Trust pays for the Securities and the price received upon Unit    
redemptions or Trust termination.                                               

The Underwriter, in its day to day activities, may act as a broker, agent,
principal or market maker in connection with the purchase and sale of equity    
securities, including the Securities. The Underwriter may also provide          
investment banking services to the issuers of, or issue reports and make        
recommendations on, the Securities. For any of these brokerage, market-making or
investment banking activities, the Underwriter may receive additional           
compensation. The Underwriter may also receive compensation based on commissions
generated by sales of Units in addition to its concession or agency commission. 
See "Public Offering--Sponsor and Underwriter Compensation".                    

RISK FACTORS 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  All investments involve risk. This section describes the main risks that can
impact the value of the securities in your Trust. You should understand these   
risks before you invest. If the value of the securities falls, the value of your
Units will also fall. We cannot guarantee that your Trust will achieve its      
objective or that your investment return will be positive over any period.      

   Market Risk. Market risk is the risk that the value of the securities in your
Trust will fluctuate. This could cause the value of your Units to fall below    
your original purchase price. Market value fluctuates in response to various    
factors. These can include changes in interest rates, inflation, the financial  
condition of a security's issuer, perceptions of the issuer, or ratings on a    
security of the issuer. Even though your Trust is supervised, you should        
remember that we do not manage your Trust. Your Trust will not sell a security  
solely because the market value falls as is possible in a managed fund.         

  Dividend Payment Risk. Dividend payment risk is the risk that an issuer of a
security is unwilling or unable to pay income on a security. Stocks represent   
ownership interests in the issuers and are not obligations of the issuers.      
Common stockholders have a right to receive dividends only after the company has
provided for payment of its creditors, bondholders and preferred stockholders.  
Common stocks do not assure dividend payments. Dividends are paid only when     
declared by an issuer's board of directors, and the amount of any dividend may  
vary over time.                                                                 

Financial Services Companies. The Trust invests significantly in banks,   
insurance companies and other financial services companies. Banks and their     
holding companies are especially subject to the adverse effects of economic     
recession, volatile interest rates, portfolio concentrations in geographic      
markets and in commercial and residential real estate loans, and competition    
from new entrants in their fields of business. In addition, banks and their     
holding companies are extensively regulated at both the federal and state level 
and may be adversely affected by increased regulations.                         

  Banks will face increased competition from nontraditional lending sources as
regulatory changes, such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley financial services overhaul  
legislation, permit new entrants to offer various financial products.           
Technological advances such as the Internet allow these nontraditional lending  
sources to cut overhead and permit the more efficient use of customer data.     
Banks are already facing tremendous pressure from mutual funds, brokerage firms 
and other financial service providers in the competition to furnish services    
that were traditionally offered by banks.                                       

Companies engaged in investment management and brokerage activities are   
subject to volatility in their earnings and share prices that often exceeds the 
volatility of the equity market in general. Adverse changes in the direction of 
the stock market, investor confidence, the financial health of customers, equity
transaction volume, the level and direction of interest rates and the outlook of
emerging markets could adversely affect the financial stability, as well as the 
stock prices, of these companies. Additionally, competitive pressures, including
increased competition with new and existing competitors, the ongoing            
commoditization of traditional businesses and the need for increased capital    
expenditures on new technology could adversely impact the profit margins of     
companies in the investment management and brokerage industries. Companies      
involved in investment management and brokerage activities are also subject to  
extensive regulation by government agencies and self-regulatory organizations,  
and changes in laws, regulations or rules, or in the interpretation of such     
laws, regulations and rules, could adversely affect the stock prices of such    
companies.                                                                      

   Companies involved in the insurance, reinsurance and risk management industry
underwrite, sell or distribute property, casualty and business insurance. Many  
factors affect insurance, reinsurance and risk management company profits,      
including interest rate movements, the imposition of premium rate caps, a       
misapprehension of the risks involved in given underwritings, competition and   
pressure to compete globally, weather catastrophes or other natural or man-made 
disasters and the effects of client mergers. Already extensively regulated,     
insurance companies' profits may be adversely affected by increased government  
regulation or tax law changes.                                                  

Utility Companies. Many utility companies, especially electric and gas and
other energy related utility companies, are subject to various uncertainties,   
including:                                                                      

o    risks of increases in fuel and other operating costs;            

    o    restrictions on operations and increased costs and delays as a result
of environmental, nuclear safety and other regulations;     

  o    regulatory restrictions on the ability to pass increasing wholesale
costs along to the retail and business customer;            

o    coping with the general effects of energy conservation;          

    o    technological innovations which may render existing plants, equipment
or products obsolete;                                       

o    the effects of local weather, maturing markets and difficulty in 
 expanding to new markets due to regulatory and other factors;

o    the potential impact of natural or man-made disasters;           

 o    difficulty obtaining adequate returns on invested capital, even if
       frequent rate increases are approved by public service commissions;

o    the high cost of obtaining financing during periods of inflation;

o    difficulties of the capital markets in absorbing utility debt and
equity securities; and                                      

o    increased competition.                                           

Any of these factors, or a combination of these factors, could affect the 
supply of or demand for energy, such as electricity or natural gas, or water, or
the ability of the issuers to pay for such energy or water which could adversely
affect the profitability of the issuers of the Securities and the performance of
the Trust.                                                                      

Utility companies are subject to extensive regulation at the federal and  
state levels in the United States. At the federal level, the Federal Energy     
Regulatory Commission (the "FERC"), the Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC"),   
the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), and the Nuclear Regulatory  
Commission (the "NRC") have authority to oversee electric and combination       
electric and gas utilities. The value of utility company stocks may decline     
because governmental regulation affecting the utilities industry can change.    
This regulation may prevent or delay the utility company from passing along cost
increases to its customers, which could hinder the utility company's ability to 
meet its obligations to its suppliers and could lead to the taking of measures, 
including the acceleration of obligations or the institution of involuntary     
bankruptcy proceedings, by its creditors against such utility company. In 2001, 
two California public utilities were threatened with such action by their       
wholesale suppliers, and one of these utilities filed a voluntary petition for  
relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code of 1978. Furthermore,       
regulatory authorities, which may be subject to political and other pressures,  
may not grant future rate increases, or may impose accounting or operational    
policies, any of which could adversely affect a company's profitability and its 
stock price. In late 2001, a trader and marketer of utilities, commodities and  
financial and risk management services filed a voluntary petition for relief    
under Chapter 11 as a result of being negatively impacted by several of these   
and other factors. Mergers in the utility industry may require approval from    
several federal and state regulatory agencies, including FERC, the FTC, and the 
SEC. These regulatory authorities could, as a matter of policy, reverse the     
trend toward deregulation and make consolidation more difficult, or cause delay 
in the merger process, any of which could cause the prices of these stocks to   
fall.                                                                           

   Real Estate Investment Trusts. Many factors can have an adverse impact on the
performance of a particular REIT, including its cash available for distribution,
the credit quality of a particular REIT or the real estate industry generally.  
The success of REITs depends on various factors, including occupancy and rent   
levels, appreciation of the underlying property and the ability to raise rents  
on those properties. Economic recession, overbuilding, tax law changes, higher  
interest rates or excessive speculation can all negatively impact REITs and     
their future earnings and share prices.                                         

Risks associated with the direct ownership of real estate include, among  
other factors,                                                                  

o    general U.S. and global as well as local economic conditions;    

o    decline in real estate values;                                   

o    the financial health of tenants;                                 

o    overbuilding and increased competition for tenants;              

o    oversupply of properties for sale;                               

o    changing demographics;                                           

 o    changes in interest rates, tax rates and other operating expenses;

o    changes in government regulations;                               

o    changes in zoning laws;                                          

   o    the ability of the owner to provide adequate management, maintenance
and insurance;                                              

 o    faulty construction and the ongoing need for capital improvements;

o    the cost of complying with the Americans with Disabilities Act;  

    o    regulatory and judicial requirements, including relating to liability
for environmental hazards;                                  

o    natural or man-made disasters;                                   

o    changes in the perception of prospective tenants of the safety,  
convenience and attractiveness of the properties;           

o    changes in neighborhood values and buyer demand; and             

o    the unavailability of construction financing or mortgage loans at
rates acceptable to developers.                             

   Variations in rental income and space availability and vacancy rates in terms
of supply and demand are additional factors affecting real estate generally and 
REITs in particular. Properties owned by a REIT may not be adequately insured   
against certain losses and may be subject to significant environmental          
liabilities, including remediation costs.                                       

   You should also be aware that REITs may not be diversified and are subject to
the risks of financing projects. The real estate industry may be cyclical, and, 
if the Trust acquires REIT Securities at or near the top of the cycle, there is 
increased risk of a decline in value of the REIT Securities and therefore the   
value of the Units. REITs are also subject to defaults by borrowers and the     
market's perception of the REIT industry generally.                             

   Because of their structure, and the legal requirement that they distribute at
least 90% of their taxable income to shareholders annually, REITs require       
frequent amounts of new funding, through both borrowing money and issuing stock.
Thus, REITs historically have frequently issued substantial amounts of new      
equity shares (or equivalents) to purchase or build new properties. This may    
have adversely affected REIT equity share market prices. Both existing and new  
share issuances may have an adverse effect on these prices in the future,       
especially when REITs continue to issue stock when real estate prices are       
relatively high and stock prices are relatively low.                            

Consumer Staples. The Trust may invest significantly in companies that    
manufacture or sell various consumer staples. General risks of these companies  
include the general state of the economy, intense competition and consumer      
spending trends. A decline in the economy or other change which results in a    
reduction of consumers' disposable income can negatively impact spending habits.
Furthermore, the failure to continue developing new products, lack of or reduced
market acceptance of new and existing products, increased raw materials costs,  
an inability to raise prices, increased or changed regulation and product       
liability claims or product recalls could also adversely impact the performance 
and stock prices of the issuers of Securities in this industry group.           

Industrials. The Trust may invest significantly in industrials companies. 
General risks of industrials companies include the general state of the economy,
intense competition, consolidation, domestic and international politics, excess 
capacity and consumer spending trends. Capital goods companies may also be      
significantly affected by overall capital spending levels, economic cycles,     
technical obsolescence, delays in modernization, limitations on supply of key   
materials, labor relations, government regulations, government contracts and    
e-commerce initiatives. Furthermore, certain companies involved in the industry 
have also faced scrutiny for alleged accounting irregularities that may have led
to the overstatement of their financial results, and other companies in the     
industry may face similar scrutiny.                                             

  Industrials companies may also be affected by factors more specific to their
individual industries. Industrial machinery manufacturers may be subject to     
declines in commercial and consumer demand and the need for modernization.      
Aerospace and defense companies may be influenced by decreased demand for new   
equipment, aircraft order cancellations, disputes over or ability to obtain or  
retain government contracts, or changes in government budget priorities, changes
in aircraft-leasing contracts and cutbacks in profitable business travel. The   
number of housing starts, levels of public and non-residential construction     
including weakening demand for new office and retail space, and overall         
construction spending may adversely affect construction materials and equipment 
manufacturers.                                                                  

Health Care Issuers. The Trust may invest significantly in health care    
companies. These issuers include companies involved in advanced medical devices 
and instruments, drugs and biotec hnology, managed care, hospital               
management/health services and medical supplies. These companies face           
substantial government regulation and approval procedures. Congress and the     
President have proposed, and in some cases approved, a variety of legislative   
changes concerning health care issuers from time to time, including, but not    
limited to, cost and prescription drug price controls and more rigorous approval
processes for new pharmaceuticals and devices. Additional government regulation,
or any change in existing regulation, can have a significantly unfavorable      
effect on the price and availability of products and services.                  

Drug and medical products companies also face the risk of increasing      
competition from new products or services, generic drug sales, termination of   
patent protection for drug or medical supply products and the risk that a       
product will never come to market. The research and development costs of        
bringing a new drug or medical product to market are substantial. This process  
involves lengthy government review with no guarantee of approval. These         
companies may have losses and may not offer proposed products for several years,
if at all. The failure to gain approval for a new drug or product can have a    
substantial negative impact on a company and its stock.                         

Energy Issuers. The Trust may invest significantly in energy companies.   
Energy companies face risks related to political conditions in oil producing    
regions (such as the Middle East), the actions of the Organization of Petroleum 
Exporting Countries (OPEC), the price and worldwide supply of oil and natural   
gas, the price and availability of alternative fuels, the ability to find and   
acquire oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable, operating       
hazards, government regulation and the level of consumer demand. Political      
conditions of some oil producing regions have been unstable in the past.        
Political instability or war in these regions could have a negative impact on   
your investment. Oil and natural gas prices can be extremely volatile. OPEC     
controls a substantial portion of world oil production. OPEC may take actions to
increase or suppress the price or availability of oil. Various domestic and     
foreign government authorities and international cartels also impact these      
prices. Any substantial decline in these prices could have an adverse effect on 
energy companies. Energy companies depend on their ability to find and acquire  
additional energy reserves. The exploration and recovery process involves       
significant operating hazards and can be very costly. An energy company has no  
assurance that it will find reserves or that any reserves found will be         
economically recoverable. The industry also faces substantial government        
regulation, including environmental regulation. These regulations have increased
costs and limited production and usage of certain fuels. Furthermore, certain   
companies involved in the industry have also faced scrutiny for alleged         
accounting irregularities that may have led to the overstatement of their       
financial results, and other companies in the industry may face similar         
scrutiny.                                                                       

Technology Companies. Technology companies face risks related to rapidly  
changing technology, rapid product obsolescence, cyclical market patterns,      
evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions. An          
unexpected change in technology can have a significant negative impact on a     
technology company. The failure of a technology company to introduce new        
products or technologies or keep pace with rapidly changing technology, can have
a negative impact on the company's results. Technology stocks tend to experience
substantial price volatility and speculative trading. Announcements about new   
products, technologies, operating results or marketing alliances can cause stock
prices to fluctuate dramatically. At times, however, extreme price and volume   
fluctuations may occur in the Securities of companies in this industry group    
that are unrelated to the operating performance of the company.                 

 The market for certain products may have only recently begun to develop, is
rapidly evolving or is characterized by an increase in suppliers. Key components
of some technology products are available only from limited sources. This can   
impact the cost of and ability to acquire these components. Some technology     
companies service highly concentrated customer bases of only a limited number of
large companies. Any failure to meet the standards of these customers could     
result in a significant loss or reduction in sales. Many products and           
technologies are incorporated into other products. As a result, some companies  
are sometimes highly dependent on the performance of other technology companies.
We cannot guarantee that these customers will continue to place additional      
orders or will place orders in similar quantities as in the past.               

The life cycle of a new technology product or service tends to be short,  
resulting in volatile sales, earnings and stock prices for many technology      
companies. Additionally, with the rapid evolution of technologies, competitive  
advantages tend to be short lived and product pricing usually falls.            
Historically, many of the benefits from new technologies have gone to the       
consumer, as their creators have been unable to retain differentiation or       
pricing power. Some of the large technology companies have been involved in     
antitrust litigation and may continue to be in the future. A slowdown in        
corporate or consumer spending on technology will likely hurt technology company
revenues. Technology companies rely on international sales for a meaningful part
of their revenues. Any economic slowdown could hurt revenues.                   

   Consumer Cyclicals. The success of companies in the consumer cyclicals sector
depends heavily on consumer spending and disposable household income and is     
subject to severe competition. Therefore, the success of consumer cyclicals     
companies is tied closely to the performance of the domestic and international  
economy, interest rates, competition and consumer confidence. A slowdown in the 
economy would likely hurt the consumer cyclicals industry. The success of       
companies in the consumer cyclicals segment is also strongly affected by changes
in demographics and consumer tastes.                                            

Consumer Products. The Trust may invest significantly in companies that   
manufacture or sell various consumer products. General risks of these companies 
include the general state of the economy, intense competition and consumer      
spending trends. A decline in the economy which results in a reduction of       
consumers' disposable income can negatively impact spending habits. Furthermore,
the failure to continue developing new products, lack of or reduced market      
acceptance of new and existing products, increased raw materials costs, an      
inability to raise prices, increased or changed regulation and product liability
claims or product recalls could also adversely impact the performance and stock 
prices of the issuers of Securities in this industry group.                     

Telecommunications Companies. The Trust invests significantly in          
telecommunications companies. These companies are subject to substantial        
governmental regulation. For example, the United States government and state    
governments regulate permitted rates of return and the kinds of services that a 
company may offer. This industry has experienced substantial deregulation in    
recent years. Deregulation may lead to fierce competition for market share and  
can have a negative impact on certain companies. Recent federal legislation     
governing the United States telecommunications industry remains subject to      
judicial review and additional interpretation, which may adversely affect the   
companies whose securities are held by the Trust. Competitive pressures are     
intense and telecommunications stocks can experience rapid volatility. Certain  
telecommunications products may become outdated very rapidly. A company's       
performance can be hurt if the company fails to keep pace with technological    
advances.                                                                       

Several recent high-profile bankruptcies of large telecommunications      
companies have illustrated the potentially unstable condition of                
telecommunications companies. High debt loads that were accumulated during the  
industry growth spurt of the 1990s are catching up to the industry, causing debt
and stock prices to trade at distressed levels for many telecommunications      
companies and increasing the cost of capital for needed additional investment.  
At the same time, demand for some telecommunications services has fallen        
sharply, as several key markets have become oversaturated, some local customers 
have switched to substitute providers and technologies, and corporate profits   
and the economy generally remain weak. To meet increasing competition, companies
may have to commit substantial capital, particularly in the formulation of new  
products and services using new technologies. As a result, many companies have  
been compelled to cut costs by reducing their workforce, outsourcing,           
consolidating and/or closing existing facilities and divesting low selling      
product lines. Furthermore, certain companies involved in the industry have also
faced scrutiny for alleged accounting irregularities that may have led to the   
overstatement of their financial results, and other companies in the industry   
may face similar scrutiny. Due to these and other factors, the risk level of    
owning the securities of telecommunications companies has increased             
substantially and may continue to rise.                                         

Certain smaller companies in the portfolio may involve greater risk than  
larger, established issuers. Smaller companies may have limited product lines,  
markets or financial resources. Their securities may trade in lower volumes than
larger companies. As a result, the prices of these securities may fluctuate more
than the prices of other issuers.                                               

No FDIC Guarantee. An investment in the Trust is not a deposit of any bank
and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or
any other government agency.                                                    

PUBLIC OFFERING 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

General. Units are offered at the Public Offering Price which includes the
underlying value of the Securities, the sales charge, and cash, if any, in the  
Income and Capital Accounts. The maximum sales charge assessed to each          
Unitholder is set forth under "Summary of Essential Financial Information" in   
Part One. The secondary market sales charge will reduce annually by 0.5% to a   
minimum of 2.30% as set forth under "Summary of Essential Financial Information"
in Part One. The actual sales charge that may be paid by an investor may differ 
slightly from the sales charges shown herein due to rounding that occurs in the 
calculation of the Public Offering Price and in the number of Units purchased.  

   Employees, officers and directors (including their spouses and children under
21 living in the same household, and trustees, custodians or fiduciaries for the
benefit of such persons) of Van Kampen Funds Inc. and its affiliates, the       
Underwriter, and dealers and their affiliates may purchase Units at the Public  
Offering Price less the applicable dealer concession.                           

The minimum purchase is 200 Units but may vary by selling firm.           

Unit Price. The Public Offering Price of Units will vary from the amounts 
stated under "Summary of Essential Financial Information" in Prospectus Part One
in accordance with fluctuations in the prices of the underlying Securities in   
the Trust. The initial price of the Securities was determined by the Trustee.   
The Trustee will generally determine the value of the Securities as of the      
Evaluation Time on each business day and will adjust the Public Offering Price  
of Units accordingly. The Evaluation Time is the close of the New York Stock    
Exchange on each business day. The term "business day", as used herein and under
"Rights of Unitholders--Redemption of Units", excludes Saturdays, Sundays and   
holidays observed by the New York Stock Exchange. The Public Offering Price per 
Unit will be effective for all orders received prior to the Evaluation Time on  
each business day. Orders received by the Sponsor prior to the Evaluation Time  
and orders received by authorized financial professionals prior to the          
Evaluation Time that are properly transmitted to the Sponsor by the time        
designated by the Sponsor, are priced based on the date of receipt. Orders      
received by the Sponsor after the Evaluation Time, and orders received by       
authorized financial professionals after the Evaluation Time or orders received 
by such persons that are not transmitted to the Sponsor until after the time    
designated by the Sponsor, are priced based on the date of the next determined  
Public Offering Price per Unit provided they are received timely by the Sponsor 
on such date. It is the responsibility of authorized financial professionals to 
transmit orders received by them to the Sponsor so they will be received in a   
timely manner.                                                                  

The value of portfolio securities is based on the securities' market price
when available. When a market price is not readily available, including         
circumstances under which the Trustee determines that a security's market price 
is not accurate, a portfolio security is valued at its fair value, as determined
under procedures established by the Trustee or an independent pricing service   
used by the Trustee. In these cases, the Trust's net asset value will reflect   
certain portfolio securities' fair value rather than their market price. With   
respect to securities that are primarily listed on foreign exchanges, the value 
of the portfolio securities may change on days when you will not be able to     
purchase or sell Units. The value of any foreign securities is based on the     
applicable currency exchange rate as of the Evaluation Time. The Sponsor will   
provide price dissemination and oversight services to the Trust.                

   Unit Distribution. Units will be distributed to the public by the Sponsor and
the Underwriter at the Public Offering Price.                                   

The Sponsor intends to qualify Units for sale in a number of states. The  
Underwriter will be allowed a concession or agency commission in connection with
the distribution of Units as described under "Sponsor and Underwriter
Compensation".                                                                  

 Except as provided in this section, any discount provided to investors will
be borne by the selling dealer or agent as indicated under "General" above.     
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in no case shall the total of  
any concessions, agency commissions and any additional compensation allowed or  
paid to any broker, dealer or other distributor of Units with respect to any    
individual transaction exceed the total sales charge applicable to such         
transaction. The Sponsor reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any 
order for the purchase of Units and to change the amount of the concession or   
agency commission to dealers and others from time to time.                      

We may provide, at our own expense and out of our own profits, additional 
compensation and benefits to broker-dealers who sell Units of the Trusts and our
other products. This compensation is intended to result in additional sales of  
our products and/or compensate broker-dealers and financial advisors for past   
sales. We may make these payments for marketing, promotional or related         
expenses, including, but not limited to, expenses of entertaining retail        
customers and financial advisors, advertising, sponsorship of events or         
seminars, obtaining shelf space in broker-dealer firms and similar activities   
designed to promote the sale of the Trust and our other products. Fees may      
include payment for travel expenses, including lodging, incurred in connection  
with trips taken by invited registered representatives for meetings or seminars 
of a business nature. These arrangements will not change the price you pay for  
your Units.                                                                     

Sponsor and Underwriter Compensation. The Sponsor will receive a gross sales
commission equal to the total sales charge applicable to each transaction. The  
Underwriter will be allowed a concession or agency commission in connection with
the distribution of Units equal to 65% of the sales charge applicable to the    
transaction. Any sales charge discount provided to investors will be borne by   
the selling dealer or agent. In addition, the Sponsor will realize a profit or  
loss as a result of the difference between the price paid for the Securities by 
the Sponsor and the cost of the Securities to the Trust on the Initial Date of  
Deposit as well as on subsequent deposits. The Sponsor has not participated as  
sole underwriter or as manager or as a member of the underwriting syndicate or  
as an agent in a private placement for any of the Securities. The Underwriter   
may benefit from, or receive compensation in connection with, activities        
described under "Objectives and Securities Selection". The Sponsor may realize  
profit or loss as a result of the possible fluctuations in the market value of  
the Securities, since all proceeds received from purchasers of Units are        
retained by the Underwriter. In maintaining a secondary market, the Underwriter 
will realize profits or losses in the amount of any difference between the price
at which Units are purchased and the price at which Units are resold (which     
price includes the applicable sales charge) or from a redemption of repurchased 
Units at a price above or below the purchase price. Cash, if any, made available
to the Sponsor prior to the date of settlement for the purchase of Units may be 
used in the Sponsor's business and may be deemed to be a benefit to the Sponsor,
subject to the limitations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.              

The Sponsor, the Underwriter or an affiliate of either of them may have   
participated in a public offering of one or more of the Securities. The Sponsor,
the Underwriter or an affiliate of either of them or their employees may have a 
long or short position in these Securities or related securities. The Sponsor,  
the Underwriter or an affiliate of either of them may act as a specialist or    
market maker for these Securities. An officer, director or employee of the      
Sponsor, the Underwriter or an affiliate of either of them may be an officer or 
director for issuers of the Securities.                                         

Purchases and sales of Securities by the Trust may impact the value of the
Securities. This may especially be the case during the initial offering of      
Units, upon Trust termination and in the course of satisfying large Unit        
redemptions. Any publication of a list of Securities, or a list of anticipated  
Securities, to be included in the Trust may also cause increased buying activity
in certain Securities. Once this information becomes public, investors may      
purchase individual Securities appearing in such a publication and may do so    
during or prior to the initial offering of Units. It is possible that these     
investors could include investment advisory and brokerage firms of the Sponsor, 
the Underwriter or the affiliates of either of them or firms that are           
distributing Units. This activity may cause the Trust to purchase stocks at a   
higher price than those buyers who effect purchases prior to purchases by the   
Trust.                                                                          

  Market for Units. Although it is not obligated to do so, the Underwriter may
maintain a market for Units and purchase Units at the secondary market          
repurchase price, which is described under "Rights of Unitholders--Redemption of
Units". The Underwriter may discontinue purchases of Units or discontinue       
purchases at this price at any time. In the event that a secondary market is not
maintained, a Unitholder will be able to dispose of Units by tendering them to  
the Trustee for redemption at the Redemption Price. See "Rights of
Unitholders--Redemption of Units". Unitholders should contact their broker to   
determine the best price for Units in the secondary market. The Trustee will    
notify the Underwriter of any Units tendered for redemption. If the             
Underwriter's bid in the secondary market equals or exceeds the Redemption Price
per Unit, it may purchase the Units not later than the day on which Units would 
have been redeemed by the Trustee. The Underwriter may sell repurchased Units at
the secondary market Public Offering Price per Unit.                            

RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Units are available for purchase in connection with certain types of      
tax-sheltered retirement plans, including Individual Retirement Accounts for    
individuals, Simplified Employee Pension Plans for employees, qualified plans   
for self-employed individuals, and qualified corporate pension and profit       
sharing plans for employees. The purchase of Units may be limited by the plans' 
provisions and does not itself establish such plans.                            

RIGHTS OF UNITHOLDERS 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Distributions. Dividends and any net proceeds from the sale of Securities 
received by the Trust will generally be distributed to Unitholders on each      
Distribution Date to Unitholders of record on the preceding Record Date. These  
dates appear under "Summary of Essential Financial Information" in Part One. A  
person becomes a Unitholder of record on the date of settlement (generally three
business days after Units are ordered). Unitholders may elect to receive        
distributions in cash or to have distributions reinvested into additional Units.

Dividends received by the Trust are credited to the Income Account of the 
Trust. Other receipts (e.g., capital gains, proceeds from the sale of           
Securities, etc.) are credited to the Capital Account. Proceeds received on the 
sale of any Securities, to the extent not used to meet redemptions of Units or  
to pay fees or expenses, will be distributed to Unitholders. Proceeds received  
from the disposition of any Securities after a Record Date and prior to the     
following Distribution Date will be held in the Capital Account and not         
distributed until the next Distribution Date. Any distribution to Unitholders   
consists of each Unitholder's pro rata share of the available cash in the Income
and Capital Accounts as of the related Record Date.                             

   Estimated Distributions. The estimated initial distribution and estimated net
annual distribution per Unit may be shown under "Summary of Essential Financial 
Information" in Prospectus Part One. The estimate of the income a Trust may     
receive is based on the most recent ordinary quarterly dividends declared by an 
issuer, the most recent interim and final dividends declared for certain foreign
issuers, or scheduled income payments (in all cases accounting for any          
applicable foreign withholding taxes). The actual net annual distributions are  
expected to decrease over time. Securities may also be sold to pay regular fees 
and expenses during a Trust's life. Dividend and income conventions for certain 
companies and/or certain countries differ from those typically used in the      
United States and in certain instances, dividends/income paid or declared over  
several years or other periods may be used to estimate annual distributions. The
actual net annual income distributions you receive will vary from the estimated 
amount due to changes in a Trust's fees and expenses, in actual income received 
by a Trust, currency fluctuations and with changes in a Trust such as the       
acquisition, call, maturity or sale of Securities. Due to these and various     
other factors, actual income received by a Trust will most likely differ from   
the most recent dividends or scheduled income payments.                         

Reinvestment Option. Unitholders may have distributions automatically     
reinvested in additional Units under the Automatic Reinvestment Option (to the  
extent Units may be lawfully offered for sale in the state in which the         
Unitholder resides). To participate in this reinvestment option, a Unitholder   
must file with the Trustee a written notice of election, together with any      
certificate representing Units and other documentation that the Trustee may then
require, at least five days prior to the related Record Date. A Unitholder's    
election will apply to all Units owned by the Unitholder and will remain in     
effect until changed by the Unitholder. If Units are unavailable for            
reinvestment, distributions will be paid in cash.                               

  In addition, under the Guaranteed Reinvestment Option Unithholders may elect
to have distributions automatically reinvested in certain Van Kampen mutual     
funds (the "Reinvestment Funds"). Each Reinvestment Fund has investment         
objectives which differ from those of the Trust. The prospectus relating to each
Reinvestment Fund describes its investment policies and how to begin            
reinvestment. A Unitholder may obtain a prospectus for the Reinvestment Funds   
from the Sponsor. Purchases of shares of a Reinvestment Fund will be made at a  
net asset value computed on the Distribution Date. Unitholders with an existing 
Guaranteed Reinvestment Option account (whereby a sales charge is imposed on    
distribution reinvestments) may transfer their existing account into a new      
account which allows purchases of Reinvestment Fund shares at net asset value.  

   A participant may elect to terminate his or her reinvestment plan and receive
future distributions in cash by notifying the Trustee in writing no later than  
five days before a Distribution Date. The Sponsor, each Reinvestment Fund, and  
its investment adviser shall have the right to suspend or terminate these       
reinvestment plans at any time.                                                 

Redemption of Units. A Unitholder may redeem all or a portion of his Units by
tender to the Trustee at Unit Investment Trust Division, 101 Barclay Street,    
20th Floor, New York, New York 10286. Certificates must be tendered to the      
Trustee, duly endorsed or accompanied by proper instruments of transfer with    
signature guaranteed (or by providing satisfactory indemnity in connection with 
lost, stolen or destroyed certificates) and by payment of applicable            
governmental charges, if any. No later than the seventh day following the       
tender, the Unitholder will be entitled to receive in cash an amount for each   
Unit equal to the Redemption Price per Unit next computed on the date of tender.
The "date of tender" is deemed to be the date on which Units are received by the
Trustee, except that with respect to Units received by the Trustee after the    
Evaluation Time or on a day which is not a Trust business day, the date of      
tender is deemed to be the next business day. Redemption requests received by   
authorized financial professionals prior to the Evaluation Time that are        
properly transmitted to the Trustee by the time designated by the Trustee, are  
priced based on the date of receipt. Redemption requests received by the Trustee
after the Evaluation Time, and redemption requests received by authorized       
financial professionals after the Evaluation Time or redemption requests        
received by such persons that are not transmitted to the Trustee until after the
time designated by the Trustee, are priced based on the date of the next        
determined redemption price provided they are received timely by the Trustee on 
such date. It is the responsibility of authorized financial professionals to    
transmit redemption requests received by them to the Trustee so they will be    
received in a timely manner. Certain broker-dealers or selling firms may charge 
an order handling fee for processing redemption requests. Units redeemed        
directly through the Trustee are not subject to such fees.                      

Unitholders tendering 2,500 or more Units (or $25,000) of the Trust for   
redemption may request an in-kind distribution of Securities equal to the       
Redemption Price per Unit on the date of tender. Unitholders may not request an 
in-kind distribution during the five business days preceding the Trust's        
termination. An in-kind distribution will be made by the Trustee through the    
distribution of each of the Securities in book-entry form to the account of the 
Unitholder's broker-dealer at Depository Trust Company. Amounts representing    
fractional shares will be distributed in cash. The Trustee may adjust the number
of shares of any Security included in a Unitholder's in-kind distribution to    
facilitate the distribution of whole shares.                                    

The Trustee may sell Securities to satisfy Unit redemptions. To the extent
that Securities are redeemed in-kind or sold, the size of the Trust will be, and
the diversity of the Trust may be, reduced. Sales may be required at a time when
Securities would not otherwise be sold and may result in lower prices than might
otherwise be realized. The price received upon redemption may be more or less   
than the amount paid by the Unitholder, depending on the value of the Securities
at the time of redemption. Special federal income tax consequences will result  
if a Unitholder requests an in-kind distribution. See "Taxation".               

 The Redemption Price per Unit and the secondary market repurchase price per
Unit are equal to the pro rata share of each Unit in the Trust, determined on   
the basis of (i) the cash on hand in the Trust, (ii) the value of the Securities
in the Trust and (iii) dividends receivable on the Securities in the Trust      
trading ex-dividend as of the date of computation, less (a) amounts representing
taxes or other governmental charges payable out of the Trust and (b) the accrued
expenses of the Trust. For these purposes, the Evaluator or Trustee will        
determine the value of the Securities in the manner set forth under "Public
Offering--Unit Price".                                                          

   The right of redemption may be suspended and payment postponed for any period
during which the New York Stock Exchange is closed, other than for customary    
weekend and holiday closings, or any period during which the SEC determines that
trading on that Exchange is restricted or an emergency exists, as a result of   
which disposal or evaluation of the Securities is not reasonably practicable, or
for other periods as the SEC may permit.                                        

   Units. Ownership of Units is evidenced in book-entry form unless a Unitholder
makes a written request to the Trustee that ownership be in certificate form.   
Units are transferable by making a written request to the Trustee and, in the   
case of Units in certificate form, by presentation of the certificate to the    
Trustee properly endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument or instruments 
of transfer. A Unitholder must sign the written request, and certificate or     
transfer instrument, exactly as his name appears on the records of the Trustee  
and on the face of any certificate with the signature guaranteed by a           
participant in the Securities Transfer Agents Medallion Program ("STAMP") or a  
signature guarantee program accepted by the Trustee. In certain instances the   
Trustee may require additional documents, including but not limited to, trust   
instruments, certificates of death, appointments as executor or administrator or
certificates of corporate authority. Fractional certificates will not be issued.
The Trustee may require a Unitholder to pay a reasonable fee for each           
certificate reissued or transferred and to pay any governmental charge that may 
be imposed in connection with each transfer or interchange. Destroyed, stolen,  
mutilated or lost certificates will be replaced upon delivery to the Trustee of 
satisfactory indemnity, evidence of ownership and payment of expenses incurred. 
Mutilated certificates must be surrendered to the Trustee for replacement.      

   Reports Provided. Unitholders will receive a statement of dividends and other
amounts received by the Trust for each distribution. Within a reasonable time   
after the end of each year, each person who was a Unitholder during that year   
will receive a statement describing dividends and capital received, actual Trust
distributions, Trust expenses, a list of the Securities and other Trust         
information. Unitholders may obtain evaluations of the Securities upon request  
to the Trustee. If you have questions regarding your account or your Trust,     
please contact your financial advisor or the Trustee. The Sponsor does not have 
access to individual account information.                                       

TRUST ADMINISTRATION 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Portfolio Administration. The Trust is not an actively managed fund and,  
except as provided in the Trust Agreement, Securities generally will not be sold
or replaced after the initial deposit. The Sponsor may, however, direct that    
Securities be sold in certain limited circumstances to protect the Trust based  
on advice from the Supervisor. These situations may include events such as the  
issuer having defaulted on payment of any of its outstanding obligations or the 
price of a Security having declined to such an extent, or other credit factors  
exist, so that in the opinion of the Supervisor retention of the Security would 
be detrimental to the Trust. If a public tender offer has been made for a       
Security or a merger or acquisition has been announced affecting a Security, the
Trustee may either sell the Security or accept a tender offer for cash if the   
Supervisor determines that the sale or tender is in the best interest of        
Unitholders. The Trustee will distribute any cash proceeds to Unitholders. In   
addition, the Trustee may sell Securities to redeem Units or pay Trust expenses.
The Trustee must reject any offer for securities or property other than cash in 
exchange for the Securities. If securities or property are nonetheless acquired 
by the Trust, the Sponsor may direct the Trustee to sell the securities or      
property and distribute the proceeds to Unitholders or to accept the securities 
or property for deposit in the Trust. Should any contract for the purchase of   
any of the Securities fail, the Sponsor will (unless substantially all of the   
moneys held in the Trust to cover the purchase are reinvested in substitute     
Securities in accordance with the Trust Agreement) refund the cash and sales    
charge attributable to the failed contract to all Unitholders on or before the  
next Distribution Date.                                                         

When the Trust sells Securities, the composition and diversity of the     
Securities in the Trust may be altered. In order to obtain the best price for   
the Trust, it may be necessary for the Supervisor to specify minimum amounts    
(generally 100 shares) in which blocks of Securities are to be sold. In         
effecting purchases and sales of the Trust's portfolio securities, the Sponsor  
may direct that orders be placed with and brokerage commissions be paid to      
brokers, including brokers which may be affiliated with the Trust, the Sponsor, 
the Underwriter or dealers participating in the offering of Units. In addition, 
in selecting among firms to handle a particular transaction, the Sponsor may    
take into account whether the firm has sold or is selling units of unit         
investment trusts which it sponsors.                                            

Pursuant to an exemptive order, when each Trust terminates, it may be     
permitted to sell Securities to a new trust series if those Securities meet the 
investment strategy of the new trust. The exemption may enable each Trust to    
eliminate commission costs on these transactions. The price for those securities
will be the closing sale price on the sale date on the exchange where the       
Securities are principally traded, as certified by the Sponsor.                 

 Amendment of the Trust Agreement. The Trustee and the Sponsor may amend the
Trust Agreement without the consent of Unitholders to correct any provision     
which may be defective or to make other provisions that will not adversely      
affect Unitholders (as determined in good faith by the Sponsor and the Trustee).
The Trust Agreement may not be amended to increase the number of Units or permit
acquisition of securities in addition to or substitution for the Securities     
(except as provided in the Trust Agreement). The Trustee will notify Unitholders
of any amendment.                                                               

 Termination. Each Trust will terminate on the Mandatory Termination Date or
upon the sale or other disposition of the last Security held in the Trust. A    
Trust may be terminated at any time with consent of Unitholders representing    
two-thirds of the outstanding Units or by the Trustee when the value of the     
Trust is less than $500,000 ($3,000,000 if the value of the Trust has exceeded  
$15,000,000) (the "Minimum Termination Value"). Unitholders will be notified of 
any termination. The Trustee may begin to sell Securities in connection with a  
Trust termination nine business days before, and no later than, the Mandatory   
Termination Date. Approximately thirty days before this date, the Trustee will  
notify Unitholders of the termination and provide a form enabling qualified     
Unitholders to elect an in kind distribution of Securities. You are qualified to
elect an in kind distribution of Securities at termination if you own at least  
1,000 Units of your Trust on the termination date (or such higher amount as may 
be required by your broker-dealer or selling agent). Any in kind distribution of
Securities at termination will be made in the manner and subject to the         
restrictions described under "Rights of Unitholders--Redemption of Units". In   
order to receive an in kind distribution of Securities at termination, this form
or other notice acceptable to the Trustee must be received by the Trustee at    
least five business days prior to the Mandatory Termination Date. Unitholders   
will receive a final cash distribution within a reasonable time after the       
Mandatory Termination Date. All distributions will be net of Trust expenses and 
costs. Unitholders will receive a final distribution statement following        
termination. The Information Supplement contains further information regarding  
termination of the Trust. See "Additional Information".                         

 Limitations on Liabilities. The Sponsor, Underwriter, Supervisor Evaluator,
if any, and Trustee are under no liability for taking any action or for         
refraining from taking any action in good faith pursuant to the Trust Agreement,
or for errors in judgment, but shall be liable only for their own willful       
misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence (negligence in the case of the       
Trustee) in the performance of their duties or by reason of their reckless      
disregard of their obligations and duties hereunder. The Trustee is not liable  
for depreciation or loss incurred by reason of the sale by the Trustee of any of
the Securities. In the event of the failure of the Sponsor to act under the     
Trust Agreement, the Trustee may act thereunder and is not liable for any action
taken by it in good faith under the Trust Agreement. The Trustee is not liable  
for any taxes or other governmental charges imposed on the Securities, on it as 
Trustee under the Trust Agreement or on the Trust, which the Trustee may be     
required to pay under any present or future law of the United States of America 
or of any other taxing authority having jurisdiction. In addition, the Trust    
Agreement contains other customary provisions limiting the liability of the     
Trustee. The Sponsor, Underwriter, and Supervisor may rely on any evaluation    
furnished by the Evaluator, if any, or the Trustee and have no responsibility   
for the accuracy thereof. Determinations by the Trustee shall be made in good   
faith upon the basis of the best information available to it.                   

  Sponsor. Van Kampen Funds Inc. is the Sponsor of the Trust. The Sponsor is a
wholly owned subsidiary of Van Kampen Investments Inc. ("Van Kampen
Investments"). Van Kampen Investments is a diversified asset management company 
that administers more than three million retail investor accounts, has extensive

 Van Kampen Funds Inc. and the Trust have adopted a code of ethics requiring
Van Kampen's employees who have access to information on Trust transactions to  
report personal securities transactions. This code is intended to avoid         
potential conflicts of interest and to prevent fraud, deception or misconduct   
with respect to the Trust. The Information Supplement contains additional       
information about the Sponsor.                                                  

If the Sponsor shall fail to perform any of its duties under the Trust    
Agreement or become incapable of acting or shall become bankrupt or its affairs 
are taken over by public authorities, then the Trustee may (i) appoint a        
successor Sponsor at rates of compensation deemed by the Trustee to be          
reasonable and not exceeding amounts prescribed by the Securities and Exchange  
Commission, (ii) terminate the Trust Agreement and liquidate the Trust as       
provided therein or (iii) continue to act as Trustee without terminating the    
Trust Agreement.                                                                

Underwriter. Edward D. Jones & Co., L.P., a Missouri limited partnership, is
the Underwriter for the Units. The Underwriter is a member of the National      
Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. and has its principal office at 12555   
Manchester Road, St. Louis, Missouri, 63131, (314) 515-2000.                    

The Underwriter, in its day to day activities, may act as a broker, agent,
principal, specialist or market maker in connection with the purchase and sale  
of equity securities, including the Securities. The Underwriter may also provide
investment banking services to, and may expect to receive or intend to seek     
compensation for underwriting services in the next three months from, some of   
the issuers of the Securities. Principals of the Underwriter may serve as a     
member of the board of directors of one or more issuers of the Securities or of 
affiliates of such issuers. Furthermore, the Underwriter may issue reports and  
make recommendations on the Securities. For any of these brokerage, specialist, 
market-making or investment banking activities, the Underwriter may receive     
additional compensation. The Underwriter may also receive compensation based on 
commissions generated by sales of Units in addition to its concession or agency 
commission. See "Public Offering--Sponsor and Underwriter Compensation".        

   Trustee. The Trustee is The Bank of New York, a trust company organized under
the laws of the State of New York. The Bank of New York has its principal unit  
investment trust division offices at 2 Hanson Place, 12th Floor, Brooklyn, New

and examination by the Superintendent of Banks of the State of New York and the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and its deposits are insured  
by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to the extent permitted by law.    
Additional information regarding the Trustee is set forth in the Information    
Supplement, including the Trustee's qualifications and duties, its ability to   
resign, the effect of a merger involving the Trustee and the Sponsor's ability  
to remove and replace the Trustee. See "Additional Information".                

TAXATION 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   This section summarizes some of the main U.S. federal income tax consequences
of owning Units of a Trust. This section is current as of the date of this      
prospectus. Tax laws and interpretations change frequently, and these summaries 
do not describe all of the tax consequences to all taxpayers. For example, these
summaries generally do not describe your situation if you are a corporation, a  
non-U.S. person, a broker/dealer, or other investor with special circumstances. 
In addition, this section does not describe your state, local or foreign tax    
consequences.                                                                   

   This federal income tax summary is based in part on the advice and opinion of
counsel to the Sponsor. The Internal Revenue Service could disagree with any    
conclusions set forth in this section. In addition, our counsel was not asked to
review, and has not reached a conclusion with respect to the federal income tax 
treatment of the assets to be deposited in the Trust. This may not be sufficient
for you to use for the purpose of avoiding penalties under federal tax law.     

As with any investment, you should seek advice based on your individual   
circumstances from your own tax advisor.                                        

Assets of the Trust. The Trust is expected to hold one or more of the     
following: (i) shares of stock in corporations (the "Stocks") that are treated  
as equity for federal income tax purposes, and (ii) equity interests in real    
estate investment trusts (the "REIT Shares") that constitute interests in       
entities treated as real estate investment trusts for federal income tax        
purposes.                                                                       

 It is possible that the Trust will also hold other assets, including assets
that are treated differently for federal income tax purposes from those         
described above, in which case you will have federal income tax consequences    
different from or in addition to those described in this section. All of the    
assets held by the Trust constitute the "Trust Assets". Neither our counsel nor 
we have analyzed the proper federal income tax treatment of the Trust Assets and
thus neither our counsel nor we have reached a conclusion regarding the federal 
income tax treatment of the Trust Assets.                                       

Trust Status. If the Trust is at all times operated in accordance with the
documents establishing the Trust and certain requirements of federal income tax 
law are met, the Trust will not be taxed as a corporation for federal income tax
purposes. As a Unit owner, you will be treated as the owner of a pro rata       
portion of each of the Trust Assets, and as such you will be considered to have 
received a pro rata share of income (e.g., dividends and capital gains, if any) 
from each Trust Asset when such income would be considered to be received by you
if you directly owned the Trust Assets. This is true even if you elect to have  
your distributions reinvested into additional Units. In addition, the income    
from Trust Assets that you must take into account for federal income tax        
purposes is not reduced by amounts used to pay sales charges or Trust expenses. 

   Your Tax Basis and Income or Loss Upon Disposition. If your Trust disposes of
Trust Assets, you will generally recognize gain or loss. If you dispose of your 
Units or redeem your Units for cash, you will also generally recognize gain or  
loss. To determine the amount of this gain or loss, you must subtract your tax  
basis in the related Trust Assets from your share of the total amount received  
in the transaction. You can generally determine your initial tax basis in each  
Trust Asset by apportioning the cost of your Units, including sales charges,    
among the Trust Assets ratably according to their values on the date you acquire
your Units. In certain circumstances, however, you may have to adjust your tax  
basis after you acquire your Units (for example, in the case of certain         
dividends that exceed a corporation's accumulated earnings and profits, or in   
the case of certain distributions with respect to REIT Shares that represent a  
return of capital, as discussed below).                                         

If you are an individual, the maximum marginal federal tax rate for net   
capital gain is generally 15% (generally 5% for certain taxpayers in the 10% and
15% tax brackets). These capital gains rates are generally effective for taxable
years beginning before January 1, 2009. For later periods, if you are an        
individual, the maximum marginal federal tax rate for net capital gain is       
generally 20% (10% for certain taxpayers in the 10% and 15% tax brackets). The  
20% rate is reduced to 18% and the 10% rate is reduced to 8% for long-term      
capital gains from most property acquired after December 31, 2000 with a holding
period of more than five years.                                                 

Net capital gain equals net long-term capital gain minus net short-term   
capital loss for the taxable year. Capital gain or loss is long-term if the     
holding period for the asset is more than one year and is short-term if the     
holding period for the asset is one year or less. You must exclude the date you 
purchase your Units to determine your holding period. The tax rates for capital 
gains realized from assets held for one year or less are generally the same as  
for ordinary income. The Internal Revenue Code, however, treats certain capital 
gains as ordinary income in special situations. Capital gain received from      
assets held for more than one year that is considered "unrecaptured section 1250
gain" (which may be the case, for example, with some capital gains attributable 
to the REIT Shares) is taxed at a maximum stated tax rate of 25%. In the case of
capital gains dividends, the determination of which portion of the capital gains
dividend, if any, is subject to the 25% tax rate, will be made based on rules   
prescribed by the United States Treasury.                                       

  Dividends From Stocks. Certain dividends received with respect to the Stocks
may qualify to be taxed at the same rates that apply to net capital gain (as    
discussed above), provided certain holding period requirements are satisfied.   
These special rules relating to the taxation of dividends at capital gains rates
generally apply to taxable years beginning before January 1, 2009.              

Dividends From REIT Shares. Some dividends on the REIT Shares may be      
designated as "capital gain dividends," generally taxable to you as long-term   
capital gains. If you hold a Unit for six months or less or if your Trust holds 
a REIT Share for six months or less, any loss incurred by you related to the    
disposition of such REIT Share will be treated as a long-term capital loss to   
the extent of any long-term capital gain distributions received (or deemed to   
have been received) with respect to such REIT Share. Distributions of income or 
capital gains declared on the REIT Shares in October, November or December will 
be deemed to have been paid to you on December 31 of the year they are declared,
even when paid by the REIT during the following January. Other dividends on the 
REIT Shares will generally be taxable to you as ordinary income, although in    
limited circumstances, some of the ordinary income dividends from a REIT may    
also qualify to be taxed at the same rates that apply to net capital gains (as  
discussed above), provided certain holding period requirements are satisfied.   
These special rules relating to the taxation of ordinary income dividends from  
real estate investment trusts generally apply to taxable years beginning before 
January 1, 2009.                                                                

Dividends Received Deduction. A corporation that owns Units generally will
not be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to many        
dividends received by the Trust, because the dividends received deduction is not
available for dividends from most foreign corporations or from REITs.           

In-kind Distributions. Under certain circumstances as described in this   
prospectus, you may request an in-kind distribution of Trust Assets when you    
redeem your Units or at your Trust's termination. By electing to receive an     
in-kind distribution, you will receive Trust Assets, plus, possibly, cash. You  
will not recognize gain or loss if you only receive whole Trust Assets in       
exchange for the identical amount of your pro rata portion of the same Trust    
Assets held by your Trust. However, if you also receive cash in exchange for a  
Trust Asset or a fractional portion of a Trust Asset, you will generally        
recognize gain or loss based on the difference between the amount of cash you   
receive and your tax basis in such Trust Asset or fractional portion.           

Exchanges. If you elect to have your proceeds from your Trust rolled over 
into a future series of the Trust, it is considered a sale for federal income   
tax purposes and any gain on the sale will be treated as a capital gain, and any
loss will be treated as a capital loss. However, any loss you incur in          
connection with the exchange of your Units of your Trusts for units of the next 
series will generally be disallowed with respect to this deemed sale and        
subsequent deemed repurchase, to the extent the two trusts have substantially   
identical Trust Assets under the wash sale provisions of the Internal Revenue   
Code.                                                                           

Limitations on the Deductibility of Trust Expenses. Generally, for federal
income tax purposes, you must take into account your full pro rata share of your
Trust's income, even if some of that income is used to pay Trust expenses. You  
may deduct your pro rata share of each expense paid by your Trust to the same   
extent as if you directly paid the expense. You may be required to treat some or
all of the expenses of your Trust as miscellaneous itemized deductions.         
Individuals may only deduct certain miscellaneous itemized deductions to the    
extent they exceed 2% of adjusted gross income.                                 

Foreign Taxes. Distributions by your Trust that are treated as U.S. source
income (e.g., dividends received on Stocks of domestic corporations) will       
generally be subject to U.S. income taxation and withholding in the case of     
Units held by nonresident alien individuals, foreign corporations or other      
non-U.S. persons, subject to any applicable treaty. If you are a foreign        
investor (i.e., an investor other than a U.S. citizen or resident or a U.S.     
corporation, partnership, estate or trust), you may not be subject to U.S.      
federal income taxes, including withholding taxes, on some of the income from   
your Trust or on any gain from the sale or redemption of your Units, provided   
that certain conditions are met. You should consult your tax advisor with       
respect to the conditions you must meet in order to be exempt for U.S. tax      
purposes. You should also consult your tax advisor with respect to other U.S.   
tax withholding and reporting requirements.                                     

   Some distributions by your Trust may be subject to foreign withholding taxes.
Any income withheld will still be treated as income to you. Under the grantor   
trust rules, you are considered to have paid directly your share of any foreign 
taxes that are paid. Therefore, for U.S. tax purposes, you may be entitled to a 
foreign tax credit or deduction for those foreign taxes.                        

New York Tax Status. Based on the advice of Katten Muchin Rosenman, LLP,  
special counsel to the Trust for New York tax matters, under the existing income
tax laws of the State and City of New York, your Trust will not be taxed as a   
corporation, and the income of your Trust will pass through to the Unit holders 
in the same manner as for federal income tax purposes. You should consult your  
tax advisor regarding potential foreign, state or local taxation with respect to
your Units.                                                                     

TRUST OPERATING EXPENSES 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

General. The fees and expenses of the Trust will accrue on a daily basis. The
fees and expenses are generally paid out of the Capital Account of the Trust. It
is expected that Securities will be sold to pay these amounts, which will result
in capital gains or losses to Unitholders. See "Taxation". The Sponsor's,       
Evaluator's, Supervisor's and Trustee's fees may be increased without approval  
of the Unitholders by amounts not exceeding proportionate increases under the   
category "All Services Less Rent of Shelter" in the Consumer Price Index or, if 
this category is not published, in a comparable category.                       

Trustee's Fee. For its services the Trustee will receive the fee from the 
Trust set forth under "Summary of Essential Financial Information" in Part One. 
The Trustee benefits to the extent there are funds in the Capital and Income    
Accounts since these Accounts are non-interest bearing to Unitholders and the   
amounts earned by the Trustee are retained by the Trustee. Part of the Trustee's
compensation for its services to the Trust is expected to result from the use of
these funds.                                                                    

Compensation of Sponsor, Evaluator and Supervisor. The Sponsor and the    
Supervisor, which is an affiliate of the Sponsor, will receive the annual fee   
for providing bookkeeping and administrative services and portfolio supervisory 
services set forth under "Summary of Essential Financial Information" in Part   
One. These fees may exceed the actual costs of providing these services to the  
Trust but at no time will the total amount received for these services rendered 
to all Van Kampen unit investment trusts in any calendar year exceed the        
aggregate cost of providing these services in that year. The Evaluator will     
receive the annual fee for providing evaluation services set forth under        
"Summary of Essential Financial Information" in Part One.                       

Miscellaneous Expenses. The following additional charges are or may be    
incurred by the Trust: (a) normal expenses (including the cost of mailing       
reports to Unitholders) incurred in connection with the operation of the Trust, 
(b) fees of the Trustee for extraordinary services, (c) expenses of the Trustee 
(including legal and auditing expenses) and of counsel designated by the        
Sponsor, (d) various governmental charges, (e) expenses and costs of any action 
taken by the Trustee to protect the Trust and the rights and interests of       
Unitholders, (f) indemnification of the Trustee for any loss, liability or      
expenses incurred in the administration of the Trust without negligence, bad    
faith or wilful misconduct on its part, (g) foreign custodial and transaction   
fees, (h) costs associated with liquidating the securities held in the Trust,   
(i) any offering costs incurred after the end of the initial offering period and
(j) expenditures incurred in contacting Unitholders upon termination of the     
Trust. The Trust may pay the expenses of updating its registration statement    
each year.

RISK FACTORS 

  Price Volatility. Because the Trust invests in common stocks, you should
understand the risks of investing in common stocks before purchasing Units.     
These risks include the risk that the financial condition of the company or the 
general condition of the stock market may worsen and the value of the stocks    
(and therefore Units) will fall. Common stocks are especially susceptible to    
general stock market movements. The value of common stocks often rises or falls 
rapidly and unpredictably as market confidence and perceptions of companies     
change. These perceptions are based on factors including expectations regarding 
government economic policies, inflation, interest rates, economic expansion or  
contraction, political climates and economic or banking crises. The value of    
Units will fluctuate with the value of the stocks in the Trust and may be more  
or less than the price you originally paid for your Units. As with any          
investment, we cannot guarantee that the performance of the Trust will be       
positive over any period of time. Because the Trust is not actively managed, the
Trustee will not sell stocks in response to market fluctuations as is common in 
managed investments.                                                            

     Dividends. Common stocks represent ownership interests in a company and are
not obligations of the company. Accordingly, common stockholders have a right to
receive payments from the company that is subordinate to the rights of          
creditors, bondholders or preferred stockholders of the company. This means that
common stockholders have a right to receive dividends only if a company's board 
of directors declares a dividend and the company has provided for payment of all
of its creditors, bondholders and preferred stockholders. If a company issues   
additional debt securities or preferred stock, the owners of these securities   
will have a claim against the company's assets before common stockholders if the
company declares bankruptcy or liquidates its assets even though the common     
stock was issued first. As a result, the company may be less willing or able to 
declare or pay dividends on its common stock.                                   

   Financial Services. An investment in Units of the Trust should be made with
an understanding of the problems and risks inherent in the bank, insurance and  
financial services sector in general.                                           

Banks and their holding companies are especially subject to the adverse   
effects of economic recession, volatile interest rates, portfolio concentrations
in geographic markets and in commercial and residential real estate loans, and  
competition from new entrants in their fields of business. Banks are highly     
dependent on net interest margin. Bank profits have come under pressure as net  
interest margins have contracted. There is no certainty that such conditions    
will continue. Banks had received significant consumer mortgage fee income as a 
result of activity in mortgage and refinance markets. As initial home purchasing
and refinancing activity subsided as a result of increasing interest rates and  
other factors, this income diminished. Economic conditions in the real estate   
markets, which have been weak in the past, can have a substantial effect upon   
banks because they generally have a portion of their assets invested in loans   
secured by real estate. Banks and their holding companies are subject to        
extensive federal regulation and, when such institutions are state-chartered, to
state regulation as well. Such regulations impose strict capital requirements   
and limitations on the nature and extent of business activities that banks may  
pursue. Furthermore, bank regulators have a wide range of discretion in         
connection with their supervisory and enforcement authority and may             
substantially restrict the permissible activities of a particular institution if
deemed to pose significant risks to the soundness of such institution or the    
safety of the federal deposit insurance fund. Regulatory actions, such as       
increases in the minimum capital requirements applicable to banks and increases 
in deposit insurance premiums required to be paid by banks and thrifts to the   
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC"), can negatively impact earnings  
and the ability of a company to pay dividends. Neither federal insurance of     
deposits nor governmental regulations, however, insures the solvency or         
profitability of banks or their holding companies, or insures against any risk  
of investment in the securities issued by such institutions.                    

The statutory requirements applicable to, and regulatory supervision of,  
banks and their holding companies have increased significantly and have         
undergone substantial change in recent years. To a great extent, these changes  
are embodied in the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act,
enacted in August 1989; the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement   
Act of 1991, and the regulations promulgated under these laws. The impact of    
these laws on the business, financial condition and prospects of the Securities 
in the Trust's portfolio cannot be predicted with certainty. The                
Gramm-Leach-Bliley financial services overhaul legislation allows banks,        
securities firms and insurance companies to form one-stop financial             
conglomerates marketing a wide range of financial service products to investors.
This legislation will likely result in increased merger activity and heightened 
competition among existing and new participants in the field. Legislation to    
liberalize interstate banking has been enacted in recent years. Under the       
legislation, banks are able to purchase or establish subsidiary banks in any    
state. Since mid-1997, banks have been allowed to turn existing banks into      
branches. Consolidation may continue. The Securities and Exchange Commission and
the Financial Accounting Standards Board require the expanded use of market     
value accounting by banks and have imposed rules requiring market accounting for
investment securities held in trading accounts or available for sale. Adoption  
of additional such rules may result in increased volatility in the reported     
health of the industry, and mandated regulatory intervention to correct such    
problems. Additional legislative and regulatory changes may be forthcoming. For 
example, the bank regulatory authorities have proposed substantial changes to   
the Community Reinvestment Act and fair lending laws, rules and regulations, and
there can be no certainty as to the effect, if any, that such changes would have
on the Securities in the Trust's portfolio. In addition, from time to time the  
deposit insurance system is reviewed by Congress and federal regulators, and    
proposed reforms of that system could, among other things, further restrict the 
ways in which deposited moneys can be used by banks or reduce the dollar amount 
or number of deposits insured for any depositor. Such reforms could reduce      
profitability, as investment opportunities available to bank institutions become
more limited and as consumers look for savings vehicles other than bank         
deposits. Banks face significant competition from other financial institutions  
such as mutual funds, credit unions, mortgage banking companies and insurance   
companies, and increased competition may result from legislative broadening of  
regional and national interstate banking powers. Among other benefits, such     
legislation allows banks and bank holding companies to acquire across previously
prohibited state lines and to consolidate their various bank subsidiaries into  
one unit. Neither the Sponsor nor the Underwriter makes any prediction as to    
what, if any, manner of bank regulatory actions might ultimately be adopted or  
what ultimate effect such actions might have on the Trust's portfolio.          

The Federal Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 generally prohibits a bank   
holding company from (1) acquiring, directly or indirectly, more than 5% of the 
outstanding shares of any class of voting securities of a bank or bank holding  
company, (2) acquiring control of a bank or another bank holding company, (3)   
acquiring all or substantially all the assets of a bank, or (4) merging or      
consolidating with another bank holding company, without first obtaining Federal
Reserve Board ("FRB") approval. In considering an application with respect to   
any such transaction, the FRB is required to consider a variety of factors,     
including the potential anti-competitive effects of the transaction, the        
financial condition and future prospects of the combining and resulting         
institutions, the managerial resources of the resulting institution, the        
convenience and needs of the communities the combined organization would serve, 
the record of performance of each combining organization under the Community    
Reinvestment Act and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, and the prospective      
availability to the FRB of information appropriate to determine ongoing         
regulatory compliance with applicable banking laws. In addition, the federal    
Change In Bank Control Act and various state laws impose limitations on the     
ability of one or more individuals or other entities to acquire control of banks
or bank holding companies.                                                      

The FRB has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by 
bank holding companies. In the policy statement, the FRB expressed its view that
a bank holding company experiencing earnings weaknesses should not pay cash     
dividends which exceed its net income or which could only be funded in ways that
would weaken its financial health, such as by borrowing. The FRB also may impose
limitations on the payment of dividends as a condition to its approval of       
certain applications, including applications for approval of mergers and        
acquisitions. Neither the Sponsor nor the Underwriter makes any prediction as to
the effect, if any, such laws will have on the Securities or whether such       
approvals, if necessary, will be obtained.                                      

Companies engaged in investment management and brokerage activities are   
subject to the adverse effects of economic recession, volatile interest rates,  
and competition from new entrants in their fields of business. Adverse changes  
in the direction of the stock market, investor confidence, the financial health 
of customers, equity transaction volume, the level and direction of interest    
rates and the outlook of emerging markets could adversely affect the financial  
stability, as well as the stock prices, of these companies. Additionally,       
competitive pressures, including increased competition with new and existing    
competitors, the ongoing commoditization of traditional businesses and the need 
for increased capital expenditures on new technology could adversely impact the 
profit margins of companies in the investment management and brokerage          
industries. Companies involved in investment management and brokerage activities
are also subject to extensive regulation by government agencies and             
self-regulatory organizations, and changes in laws, regulations or rules, or in 
the interpretation of such laws, regulations and rules could adversely affect   
the stock prices of such companies.                                             

   Companies involved in the insurance, reinsurance and risk management industry
underwrite, sell or distribute property, casualty and business insurance. Many  
factors affect insurance, reinsurance and risk management company profits,      
including but not limited to interest rate movements, the imposition of premium 
rate caps, a misapprehension of the risks involved in given underwritings,      
competition and pressure to compete globally, weather catastrophes or other     
natural or man-made disasters and the effects of client mergers. Individual     
companies may be exposed to material risks including reserve inadequacy and the 
inability to collect from reinsurance carriers. Insurance companies are subject 
to extensive governmental regulation, including the imposition of maximum rate  
levels, which may not be adequate for some lines of business. Proposed or       
potential tax law changes may also adversely affect insurance companies' policy 
sales, tax obligations and profitability. In addition to the foregoing, profit  
margins of these companies continue to shrink due to the commoditization of     
traditional businesses, new competitors, capital expenditures on new technology 
and the pressure to compete globally.                                           

In addition to the normal risks of business, companies involved in the    
insurance and risk management industry are subject to significant risk factors, 
including those applicable to regulated insurance companies, such as:           

o    the inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing          
       property-liability loss reserves, and the fact that ultimate losses
         could materially exceed established loss reserves, which could have a
  material adverse effect on results of operations and financial
condition;                                                  

o    the fact that insurance companies have experienced, and can be   
          expected in the future to experience, catastrophic losses, which could
         have a material adverse impact on their financial conditions, results
of operations and cash flow;                                

o    the inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing          
   property-liability loss reserves due to changes in loss payment
patterns caused by new claim settlement practices;          

  o    the need for insurance companies and their subsidiaries to maintain
        appropriate levels of statutory capital and surplus, particularly in
  light of continuing scrutiny by rating organizations and state
         insurance regulatory authorities, and in order to maintain acceptable
financial strength or claims-paying ability ratings;        

    o    the extensive regulation and supervision to which insurance companies
are subject, and various regulatory and other legal actions;

    o    the adverse impact that increases in interest rates could have on the
   value of an insurance company's investment portfolio and on the
attractiveness of certain of its products; and              

     o    the uncertainty involved in estimating the availability of reinsurance
and the collectability of reinsurance recoverables.         

   The state insurance regulatory framework has, during recent years, come under
increased federal scrutiny, and certain state legislatures have considered or   
enacted laws that alter and, in many cases, increase state authority to regulate
insurance companies and insurance holding company systems. Further, the National
Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC") and state insurance regulators  
are re-examining existing laws and regulations, specifically focusing on        
insurance companies, interpretations of existing laws and the development of new
laws. In addition, Congress and certain federal agencies have investigated the  
condition of the insurance industry in the United States to determine whether to
promulgate additional federal regulation. The Sponsor is unable to predict      
whether any state or federal legislation will be enacted to change the nature or
scope of regulation of the insurance industry, or what effect, if any, such     
legislation would have on the industry.                                         

All insurance companies are subject to state laws and regulations that    
require diversification of their investment portfolios and limit the amount of  
investments in certain investment categories. Failure to comply with these laws 
and regulations would cause non-conforming investments to be treated as         
non-admitted assets for purposes of measuring statutory surplus and, in some    
instances, would require divestiture.                                           

     Utility Issuers. An investment in Units of the Trust should be made with an
understanding of the characteristics of the public utility industry and the     
risks which such an investment may entail. General problems of the public       
utility industry include the difficulty in obtaining an adequate return on      
invested capital despite frequent increases in rates which have been granted by 
the public service commissions having jurisdiction, the difficulty in financing 
large construction programs during an inflationary period, the restrictions on  
operations and increased cost and delays attributable to environmental, nuclear 
safety and other regulatory considerations, the difficulty of the capital       
markets absorbing utility debt and equity securities, the difficulty in         
obtaining fuel for electric generation at reasonable prices, regulatory         
restrictions on the ability to pass increasing wholesale costs along to the     
retail and business customer, and the effects of energy conservation. There is  
no assurance that public service commissions will grant rate increases in the   
future or that any such increases will be timely or adequate to cover operating 
and other expenses and debt service requirements. All of the public utilities   
which are issuers of the Securities have been experiencing many of these        
problems in varying degrees. Furthermore, utility stocks are particularly       
susceptible to interest rate risk, generally exhibiting an inverse relationship 
to interest rates. As a result, electric utility stock prices may be adversely  
affected as interest rates rise. Similarly, the success of certain companies is 
tied to a relatively small concentration of products or technologies with       
intense competition between companies. There can be no assurance that these     
customers will place additional orders, or that an issuer of Securities will    
obtain orders of similar magnitude as past orders from other customers.         
Accordingly, a decline in demand of such products, technologies or from such    
customers could have a material adverse impact on issuers of the Securities.    

  Utilities are generally subject to extensive regulation by state utility
commissions which, for example, establish the rates which may be charged and the
appropriate rate of return on an approved asset base, which must be approved by 
the state commissions. Certain utilities have had difficulty from time to time  
in persuading regulators, who are subject to political pressures, to grant rate 
increases necessary to maintain an adequate return on investment. Any unexpected
limitations could negatively affect the profitability of utilities whose budgets
are planned far in advance. In addition, gas pipeline and distribution companies
have had difficulties in adjusting to short and surplus energy supplies,        
enforcing or being required to comply with long-term contracts and avoiding     
litigation with their customers, on the one hand, or suppliers, on the other. In
2001, two California public electric utilities claimed inability to meet their  
obligations to their suppliers in the deregulated wholesale market for          
electricity due to regulatory restrictions on their ability to pass increasing  
costs along to their customers in the retail market. These defaults led their   
wholesale suppliers to threaten to institute involuntary bankruptcy proceedings 
against the utility companies. Subsequently, one of the utility companies filed 
a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code of 
1978. Furthermore, regulatory authorities, which may be subject to political and
other pressures, may not grant future rate increases, or may impose accounting  
or operational policies, any of which could adversely affect a company's        
profitability and its stock price. In late 2001, a trader and marketer of       
utilities, commodities and financial and risk management services filed a       
voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 as a result of being negatively  
impacted by several of these and other factors.                                 

Certain of the issuers of the Securities may own or operate nuclear   
generating facilities. Governmental authorities may from time to time review    
existing, and impose additional, requirements governing the licensing,          
construction and operation of nuclear power plants. Nuclear generating projects 
in the electric utility industry have experienced substantial cost increases,   
construction delays and licensing difficulties. These have been caused by       
various factors, including inflation, high financing costs, required design     
changes and rework, allegedly faulty construction, objections by groups and     
governmental officials, limits on the ability to finance, reduced forecasts of  
energy requirements and economic conditions. This experience indicates that the 
risk of significant cost increases, delays and licensing difficulties remain    
present until completion and achievement of commercial operation of any nuclear 
project. Also, nuclear generating units in service have experienced unplanned   
outages or extensions of scheduled outages due to equipment problems or new     
regulatory requirements sometimes followed by a significant delay in obtaining  
regulatory approval to return to service. A major accident at a nuclear plant   
anywhere could cause the imposition of limits or prohibitions on the operation, 
construction or licensing of nuclear units.                                     

 In view of the uncertainties discussed above, there can be no assurance
that any utility company's share of the full cost of nuclear units under        
construction ultimately will be recovered in rates or the extent to which a     
company could earn an adequate return on its investment in such units. The      
likelihood of a significantly adverse event occurring in any of the areas of    
concern described above varies, as does the potential severity of any adverse   
impact. It should be recognized, however, that one or more of such adverse      
events could occur and individually or collectively could have a material       
adverse impact on a company's financial condition, the results of its           
operations, its ability to make interest and principal payments on its          
outstanding debt or to pay dividends.                                           

  Other general problems of the electric, gas and water utility industries
(including state and local joint action power agencies) include rising costs of 
rail transportation to transport fossil fuels, the uncertainty of transmission  
service costs for both interstate and intrastate transactions, changes in tax   
laws which adversely affect a utility's ability to operate profitably, increased
competition in service costs, recent reductions in estimates of future demand   
for electricity and gas in certain areas of the country, restrictions on        
operations and increased cost and delays attributable to environmental          
considerations, uncertain availability and increased cost of capital,           
unavailability of fuel for electric generation at reasonable prices, including  
the steady rise in fuel costs and the costs associated with conversion to       
alternate fuel sources such as coal, availability and cost of natural gas for   
resale, technical and cost factors and other problems associated with           
construction, licensing, regulation and operation of nuclear facilities for     
electric generation, including, among other considerations, the problems        
associated with the use of radioactive materials and the disposal of radioactive
wastes, and the effects of energy and environmental conservation efforts. Each  
of the problems referred to could adversely affect the ability of the issuers of
any Securities to make dividend payments and the value of such Securities on    
redemption of your Units.                                                       

Real Estate Investment Trusts. The Trust will invest in shares issued by  
REITs, domestic corporations or business trusts which invest primarily in income
producing real estate or real estate related loans or mortgages. REITs are      
financial vehicles that have as their objective the pooling of capital from a   
number of investors in order to participate indirectly in real estate ownership 
or financing. Thus, an investment in the Trust will be subject to risks similar 
to those associated with the direct ownership of real estate, in addition to    
securities markets risks, because of the Trust's investment in the securities of
companies in the real estate industry. These risks include:                     

o    declines in the value of real estate;                            

o    illiquidity of real property investments;                        

 o    risks related to general U.S. and global as well as local economic
conditions;                                                 

o    dependency on management skill;                                  

o    heavy cash flow dependency;                                      

o    possible lack of availability of mortgage funds;                 

o    excessive levels of debt or overleveraged financial structure;   

o    overbuilding;                                                    

o    extended vacancies, or obsolescence, of properties;              

o   increase in competition;                                          

o   increases in property taxes and operating expenses;               

o   changes in zoning laws;                                           

o   losses due to costs resulting from the clean-up of environmental  
problems;                                                     

 o   liability to third parties for damages resulting from environmental
problems;                                                     

o   casualty or condemnation losses;                                  

o   natural or man-made disasters;                                    

o   economic or regulatory impediments to raising rents;              

o   changes in neighborhood values and buyer demand;                  

o   changes in the appeal of properties to tenants; and               

o   changes in interest rates, tax rates or operating expenses.       

   In addition to these risks, equity REITs may be more likely to be affected by
changes in the value of the underlying property owned by the trusts. Further,   
REITs are dependent upon the management skills of the issuers and generally may 
not be diversified.                                                             

  The above factors may also adversely affect a borrower's or lessee's ability
to meet its obligations to the REIT. In the event of a default by a borrower or 
lessee, the REIT may experience delays in enforcing its rights as a mortgagee or
lessor and may incur substantial costs associated with protecting its           
investments.                                                                    

 A significant amount of the assets of a REIT may be invested in investments
in specific geographic areas or in specific property types, e.g., hotels,       
shopping malls, residential complexes, and office buildings. The impact of      
economic conditions on REITs also varies with geographic location and property  
type. Variations in rental income and space availability and vacancy rates in   
terms of supply and demand are additional factors affecting real estate         
generally and REITs in particular. In addition, you should be aware that REITs  
may not be diversified and are subject to the risks of financing projects. REITs
are also subject to                                                             

o    defaults by borrowers,                                           

o    the market's perception of the REIT industry generally,          

 o    the possibility of failing to qualify for tax-free pass-through of
income under the Internal Revenue Code, and                 

   o    the possibility of failing to maintain exemption from the Investment
Company Act of 1940.                                        

  A default by a borrower or lessee may cause the REIT to experience delays in
enforcing its rights as mortgagee or lessor and to incur significant costs      
related to protecting its investments.                                          

Some REITs in the Trust may be structured as UPREITs. An UPREIT owns an   
interest in a partnership that owns real estate. This can result in a potential 
conflict of interest between (1) shareholders of the REIT who may want to sell  
an asset and (2) other partnership interest holders who would be subject to tax 
liability if the REIT sells the property. In some cases, REITs have entered into
"no sell" agreements, which are designed to avoid taxing the holders of         
partnership units by preventing the REIT from selling the property. This        
arrangement may mean that the REIT would refuse a lucrative offer for an asset  
or be forced to hold on to a poor asset. Since parties to "no sell" agreements  
often do not disclose them, the Sponsor does not know whether any of the REITs  
in the Trust have entered into this kind of arrangement.                        

A REIT generally maintains comprehensive insurance on presently owned and 
subsequently acquired real property assets, including (1) liability, (2) fire   
and (3) extended coverage. However, there are certain types of losses, generally
of a catastrophic nature, such as earthquakes and floods, that may be           
uninsurable or not economically insurable, as to which the REIT's properties are
at risk in their particular locales. The management of a REIT uses its          
discretion in determining (1) amounts, (2) coverage limits and (3) deductibility
provisions of insurance. They generally aim to acquire appropriate insurance on 
their investments at reasonable costs and on suitable terms. This may result in 
insurance coverage that, in the event of a substantial loss, would not be       
sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement cost of  
the lost investment. Inflation, changes in building codes and ordinances,       
environmental considerations, and several other factors might make it unfeasible
to use insurance proceeds to replace a facility after it has been damaged or    
destroyed. Under such circumstances, the insurance proceeds that a REIT receives
might not be adequate to restore its economic position with respect to that     
property.                                                                       

Under various federal, state, and local environmental laws, ordinances and
regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be    
liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances 
on, under or in such property. Such laws often impose liability (1) whether or  
not the owner or operator caused or knew of the presence of the hazardous or    
toxic substances and (2) whether or not the storage of the substances was in    
violation of a tenant's lease. In addition, (1) the presence of hazardous or    
toxic substances, or (2) the failure to remediate the property properly, may    
hinder the owner's ability to borrow using that real property as collateral. We 
cannot give any assurance that one or more of the REITs in the Trust may not be 
currently liable or potentially liable for any of these costs in connection with
real estate assets they presently own or subsequently acquire while the shares  
of those REITs are held in the Trust.                                           

Consumer Staples. Your Trust may invest significantly in issuers that   
manufacture or sell consumer staples. The profitability of these companies will 
be affected by various factors including the general state of the economy and   
consumer spending trends. Weakness in the banking or real estate industry, a    
recessionary economic climate with the consequent slowdown in employment growth,
less favorable trends in unemployment or a marked deceleration in real          
disposable personal income growth could result in significant pressure on both  
consumer wealth and consumer confidence, adversely affecting consumer spending  
habits. Furthermore, the failure to continue developing new products, lack of or
reduced market acceptance of new and existing products, increased raw materials 
costs, an inability to raise prices, increased or changed regulation and product
liability claims or product recalls could also adversely impact the performance 
and stock prices of the issuers of Securities in this industry group.           

Industrials. Your Trust may invest significantly in industrials companies.
General risks of industrials companies include the general state of the economy,
intense competition, consolidation, domestic and international politics, excess 
capacity and consumer spending trends. In addition, capital goods companies may 
also be significantly affected by overall capital spending levels, economic     
cycles, technical obsolescence, delays in modernization, limitations on supply  
of key materials, labor relations, government regulations, government contracts 
and e-commerce initiatives. Furthermore, certain companies involved in the      
industry have also faced scrutiny for alleged accounting irregularities that may
have led to the overstatement of their financial results, and other companies in
the industry may face similar scrutiny.                                         

  Industrials companies may also be affected by factors more specific to their
individual industries. Industrial machinery manufacturers may be subject to     
declines in commercial and consumer demand and the need for modernization.      
Aerospace and defense companies may be influenced by decreased demand for new   
equipment, aircraft order cancellations, disputes over or ability to obtain or  
retain government contracts, or changes in government budget priorities, changes
in aircraft-leasing contracts and cutbacks in profitable business travel. The   
number of housing starts, levels of public and non-residential construction     
including weakening demand for new office and retail space, and overall         
construction spending may adversely affect construction equipment manufacturers.

   Health Care Issuers. An investment in Units of your Trust should be made with
an understanding of the problems and risks inherent in the healthcare industry  
in general. Health care companies involved in advanced medical devices and      
instruments, drugs and biotech, managed care, hospital management/health        
services and medical supplies have potential risks unique to their sector of the
healthcare field. These companies are subject to governmental regulation of     
their products and services, a factor which could have a significant and        
possibly unfavorable effect on the price and availability of such products or   
services. Furthermore, such companies face the risk of increasing competition   
from new products or services, generic drug sales, termination of patent        
protection for drug or medical supply products and the risk that technological  
advances will render their products obsolete. The research and development costs
of bringing a drug to market are substantial, and include lengthy governmental  
review processes with no guarantee that the product will ever come to market.   
Many of these companies may have losses and not offer certain products for      
several years. Such companies may also have persistent losses during a new      
product's transition from development to production, and revenue patterns may be
erratic.                                                                        

Legislative proposals concerning healthcare are proposed in Congress from 
time to time. These proposals span a wide range of topics, including cost and   
price controls (which might include a freeze on the prices of prescription      
drugs), national health insurance, incentives for competition in the provision  
of healthcare services, tax incentives and penalties related to healthcare      
insurance premiums and promotion of pre-paid healthcare plans. The Sponsor and  
the Underwriter are unable to predict the effect of any of these proposals, if  
enacted, on the issuers of Securities in your Portfolio.                        

     Energy Issuers. Energy companies face risks related to political conditions
in oil producing regions (such as the Middle East), the actions of the          
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), the price and worldwide   
supply of oil and natural gas, the price and availability of alternative fuels, 
the ability to find and acquire oil and gas reserves that are economically      
recoverable, operating hazards, government regulation and the level of consumer 
demand. Political conditions of some oil producing regions have been unstable in
the past. Political instability or war in these regions could have a negative   
impact on your investment. Oil and natural gas prices can be extremely volatile.
OPEC controls a substantial portion of world oil production. OPEC may take      
actions to increase or suppress the price or availability of oil. Various       
domestic and foreign government authorities and international cartels also      
impact these prices. Any substantial decline in these prices could have an      
adverse effect on energy companies. Energy companies depend on their ability to 
find and acquire additional energy reserves. The exploration and recovery       
process involves significant operating hazards and can be very costly. An energy
company has no assurance that it will find reserves or that any reserves will be
economically recoverable. The industry also faces substantial government        
regulation, including environmental regulation. These regulations have increased
costs and limited production and usage of certain fuels. Furthermore, certain   
companies involved in the industry have also faced scrutiny for alleged         
accounting irregularities that may have led to the overstatement of their       
financial results, and other companies in the industry may face similar         
scrutiny.                                                                       

Technology companies. The market for technology products and services,
especially those related to the Internet, is characterized by rapidly changing  
technology, rapid products obsolescence, cyclical market patterns, evolving     
industry standards and frequent new product introductions. The success of       
technology companies depends in substantial part on the timely and success      
introduction of new products. An unexpected change in one or more of the        
technologies affecting an issuer's products or in the market for products based 
on a particular technology could have a material adverse affect on an issuer's  
operating results. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that companies will be
able to respond timely to compete in the rapidly developing marketplace.        

The market for certain technology products and services may have only 
recently begun to develop, is rapidly evolving and is characterized by an       
increasing number of market entrants. Additionally, certain technology companies
may have only recently commenced operations or offered equity securities to the 
public. Such companies are in the early stage of development and have a limited 
operating history on which to analyze future operating results. It is important 
to note that following its initial public offering, a security is likely to     
experience substantial stock price volatility and speculative trading.          
Accordingly, there can be no assurance that, upon redemption of your Units or   
termination of the Trust, you will receive an amount greater than or equal to   
your initial investment.                                                        

    Based on trading history, factors such as announcements of new products or
development of new technologies and general conditions of the industry have     
caused and are likely to cause the market price of technology common stocks to  
fluctuate substantially. In addition, technology company stocks have experienced
extreme price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated to the     
operating performance of such companies. This market volatility may adversely   
affect the market price of the Securities and therefore your ability to redeem  
your Units, or roll over your Units into a new trust, at a price equal to or    
greater than the original price paid for such Units.                            

     Some key components of certain products of technology issuers are currently
available only from a single source. There can be no assurance that in the      
future suppliers will be able to meet the demand for components in a timely and 
cost effective manner. Accordingly, an issuer's operating results and customer  
relationships could be adversely affected by either an increase in price for, or
any interruption or reduction in supply of, any key components. Additionally,   
many technology issuers are characterized by a highly concentrated customer base
consisting of a limited number of large customers who may require product       
vendors to comply with rigorous and constantly developing industry standards.   
Any failure to comply with such standards may result in a significant loss or   
reduction of sales. Because many products and technology are incorporated into  
other related products, certain companies are often highly dependent on the     
performance of other computer, electronics and communications companies. There  
can be no assurance that these customers will place additional orders, or that  
an issuer of Securities will obtain orders of similar magnitude as past orders  
from other customers. Similarly, the success of certain companies is tied to a  
relatively small concentration of products or technology with intense           
competition between companies. Accordingly, a decline in demand for such        
products or technology from such customers could have a material adverse impact 
on issuers of the Securities.                                                   

  The life cycle of a new technology product or service tends to be short,
resulting in volatile sales, earnings and stock prices for many technology      
companies. Additionally, with the rapid evolution of technologies, competitive  
advantages tend to be short lived and product pricing usually falls.            
Historically, many of the benefits from new technologies have gone to the       
consumer, as their creators have been unable to retain differentiation or       
pricing power. Some of the large technology companies have been involved in     
antitrust litigation and may continue to be in the future. A slowdown in        
corporate or consumer spending on technology will likely hurt technology company
revenues. Technology companies rely on international sales for a meaningful part
of their revenues. Any slowdown in international economies could hurt revenues. 

Consumer Cyclicals. The success of companies in the consumer cyclicals
sector depends heavily on consumer spending and disposable household income and 
is subject to severe competition. Therefore, the success of consumer cyclicals  
companies is tied closely to the performance of the domestic and international  
economy, and to interest rates, competition and consumer confidence. A slowdown 
in the economy would likely hurt the consumer cyclicals industry. The success of
companies in the consumer cyclicals segment are also strongly affected by       
changes in demographics and consumer tastes.                                    

Consumer Products. Your Trust may invest significantly in issuers that  
manufacture or sell consumer products. The profitability of these companies will
be affected by various factors including the general state of the economy and   
consumer spending trends. Weakness in the banking or real estate industry, a    
recessionary economic climate with the consequent slowdown in employment growth,
less favorable trends in unemployment or a marked deceleration in real          
disposable personal income growth could result in significant pressure on both  
consumer wealth and consumer confidence, adversely affecting consumer spending  
habits. Furthermore, the failure to continue developing new products, lack of or
reduced market acceptance of new and existing products, increased raw materials 
costs, an inability to raise prices, increased or changed regulation and product
liability claims or product recalls could also adversely impact the performance 
and stock prices of the issuers of Securities in this industry group.           

   Telecommunications Issuers. Because the Portfolio is also concentrated in the
telecommunications industry, the value of the Units may be susceptible to       
factors affecting the telecommunications industry. The telecommunications       
industry is subject to governmental regulation, and the products and services of
telecommunications companies may be subject to rapid obsolescence. These factors
could affect the value of Units. Telephone companies in the United States, for  
example, are subject to both state and federal regulations affecting permitted  
rates of returns and the kinds of services that may be offered. Certain types of
companies represented in a portfolio are engaged in fierce competition for a    
share of the market of their products. As a result, competitive pressures are   
intense and the stocks are subject to rapid price volatility.                   

Several recent high-profile bankruptcies of large telecommunications    
companies have illustrated the potentially unstable condition of                
telecommunications companies. High debt loads that were accumulated during the  
industry growth spurt of the 1990s are catching up to the industry, causing debt
and stock prices to trade at distressed levels for many telecommunications      
companies and increasing the cost of capital for needed additional investment.  
At the same time, demand for some telecommunications services has fallen        
sharply, as several key markets have become oversaturated, some local customers 
have switched to substitute providers and technologies, and corporate profits   
and the economy generally remain weak. To meet increasing competition, companies
may have to commit substantial capital, particularly in the formulation of new  
products and services using new technologies. As a result, many companies have  
been compelled to cut costs by reducing their workforce, outsourcing,           
consolidating and/or closing existing facilities and divesting low selling      
product lines. Furthermore, certain companies involved in the industry have also
faced scrutiny for alleged accounting irregularities that may have led to the   
overstatement of their financial results, and other companies in the industry   
may face similar scrutiny. Due to these and other factors, the risk level of    
owning the securities of telecommunications companies has increased             
substantially and may continue to rise.                                         

    While a portfolio concentrates on the securities of established suppliers of
traditional telecommunication products and services, the Trust may also invest  
in smaller telecommunications companies which may benefit from the development  
of new products and services. These smaller companies may present greater       
opportunities for capital appreciation, and may also involve greater risk than  
large, established issuers. Such smaller companies may have limited product     
lines, market or financial resources, and their securities may trade less       
frequently and in limited volume than the securities of larger, more established
companies. As a result, the prices of the securities of such smaller companies  
may fluctuate to a greater degree than the prices of securities of other        
issuers.                                                                        

In addition, recent federal legislation governing the United States     
telecommunications industry remains subject to judicial review and additional   
interpretation, which may adversely affect the companies whose securities are   
held by the Trust.                                                              

 Liquidity. Whether or not the stocks in the Trust are listed on a stock
exchange, the stocks may delist from the exchange or principally trade in an    
over-the-counter market. As a result, the existence of a liquid trading market  
could depend on whether dealers will make a market in the stocks. We cannot     
guarantee that dealers will maintain a market or that any market will be liquid.
The value of the stocks could fall if trading markets are limited or absent.    

  Voting. Only the Trustee may sell or vote the stocks in the Trust. While
you may sell or redeem your Units, you may not sell or vote the stocks in the   
Trust. The Sponsor will instruct the Trustee how to vote the stocks. The Trustee
will vote the stocks in the same general proportion as shares held by other     
shareholders if the Sponsor fails to provide instructions.                      

    No FDIC Guarantee. An investment in the Trust is not a deposit of any bank
and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or

relates only to the Sponsor and not to the Trust or to any other Series thereof.
The information is included herein only for the purpose of informing investors  
as to the financial responsibility of the Sponsor and its ability to carry out  
its contractual obligations. More detailed financial information will be made   
available by the Sponsor upon request).                                         

Van Kampen Funds Inc. and your Trust have adopted a code of ethics    
requiring Van Kampen's employees who have access to information on Trust        
transactions to report personal securities transactions. This code is intended  
to avoid potential conflicts of interest and to prevent fraud, deception or     
misconduct with respect to your Trust.                                          

If the Sponsor shall fail to perform any of its duties under the Trust
Agreement or become incapable of acting or shall become bankrupt or its affairs 
are taken over by public authorities, then the Trustee may (i) appoint a        
successor Sponsor at rates of compensation deemed by the Trustee to be          
reasonable and not exceeding amounts prescribed by the Securities and Exchange  
Commission, (ii) terminate the Trust Agreement and liquidate the Trust as       
provided therein or (iii) continue to act as Trustee without terminating the    
Trust Agreement.                                                                

TRUSTEE INFORMATION                                                             

  The Trustee is The Bank of New York, a trust company organized under the
laws of the State of New York. The Bank of New York has its principal unit      
investment trust division offices at 2 Hanson Place, 12th Floor, Brooklyn, New
York 11217, (800) 221-7668. The Bank of New York is subject to supervision and  
examination by the Superintendent of Banks of the State of New York and the     
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and its deposits are insured  
by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to the extent permitted by law.    

   The duties of the Trustee are primarily ministerial in nature. It did not
participate in the selection of Securities for the Trust portfolio.             

     In accordance with the Trust Agreement, the Trustee shall keep proper books
of record and account of all transactions at its office for the Trust. Such     
records shall include the name and address of, and the number of Units of the   
Trust held by, every Unitholder. Such books and records shall be open to        
inspection by any Unitholder at all reasonable times during the usual business  
hours. The Trustee shall make such annual or other reports as may from time to  
time be required under any applicable state or federal statute, rule or         
regulation. The Trustee is required to keep a certified copy or duplicate       
original of the Trust Agreement on file in its office available for inspection  
at all reasonable times during the usual business hours by any Unitholder,      
together with a current list of the Securities held in the Trust.               

    Under the Trust Agreement, the Trustee or any successor trustee may resign
and be discharged of its responsibilities created by the Trust Agreement by     
executing an instrument in writing and filing the same with the Sponsor. The    
Trustee or successor trustee must mail a copy of the notice of resignation to   
all Unitholders then of record, not less than 60 days before the date specified 
in such notice when such resignation is to take effect. The Sponsor upon        
receiving notice of such resignation is obligated to appoint a successor trustee
promptly. If, upon such resignation, no successor trustee has been appointed and
has accepted the appointment within 30 days after notification, the retiring    
Trustee may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a 
successor. The Sponsor may remove the Trustee and appoint a successor trustee as
provided in the Trust Agreement at any time with or without cause. Notice of    
such removal and appointment shall be mailed to each Unitholder by the Sponsor. 
Upon execution of a written acceptance of such appointment by such successor    
trustee, all the rights, powers, duties and obligations of the original trustee 
shall vest in the successor. The resignation or removal of a Trustee becomes    
effective only when the successor trustee accepts its appointment as such or    
when a court of competent jurisdiction appoints a successor trustee.            

    Any corporation into which a Trustee may be merged or with which it may be
consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger or consolidation to  
which a Trustee shall be a party, shall be the successor trustee. The Trustee   
must be a banking corporation organized under the laws of the United States or  
any state and having at all times an aggregate capital, surplus and undivided   
profits of not less than $5,000,000.                                            

TRUST TERMINATION                                                               

The Trust may be liquidated at any time by consent of Unitholders     
representing 66 2/3% of the Units of such Trust then outstanding or by the      
Trustee when the value of the Securities owned by the Trust, as shown by any    
evaluation, is less than $500,000 ($3,000,000 if the value of the Trust has     
exceeded $15,000,000). The Trust will be liquidated by the Trustee in the event 
that a sufficient number of Units of the Trust not yet sold are tendered for    
redemption by the Sponsor, so that the net worth of such Trust would be reduced 
to less than 40% of the value of the Securities at the time they were deposited 
in the Trust. If the Trust is liquidated because of the redemption of unsold    
Units by the Sponsor, the Sponsor will refund to each purchaser of Units the    
entire sales charge paid by such purchaser. The Trust Agreement will terminate  
upon the sale or other disposition of the last Security held thereunder, but in 
no event will it continue beyond the Mandatory Termination Date.                

    Commencing during the period beginning nine business days prior to, and no
later than, the Mandatory Termination Date, Securities may begin to be sold in  
connection with the termination of the Trust. The Sponsor will determine the    
manner, timing and execution of the sales of the Securities. The Sponsor shall  
direct the liquidation of the Securities in such manner as to effectuate orderly
sales and a minimal market impact. In the event the Sponsor does not so direct, 
the Securities shall be sold within a reasonable period and in such manner as   
the Trustee, in its sole discretion, shall determine. At least 30 days before   
the Mandatory Termination Date the Trustee will provide written notice of any   
termination to all Unitholders of the appropriate Trust and in the case of a    
Trust will include with such notice a form to enable Unitholders owning the     
minimum number of Units described in the Prospectus to request an in-kind       
distribution of the Securities. To be effective, this request must be returned  
to the Trustee at least five business days prior to the Mandatory Termination   
Date. On the Mandatory Termination Date (or on the previous business day if a   
holiday) the Trustee will deliver each requesting Unitholder's pro rata number  
of whole shares of the Securities in the Trust to the account of the            
broker-dealer or bank designated by the Unitholder at Depository Trust Company. 
The value of the Unitholder's fractional shares of the Securities will be paid  
in cash. Unitholders not requesting an in-kind distribution will receive a cash 
distribution from the sale of the remaining Securities within a reasonable time 
following the Mandatory Termination Date. Regardless of the distribution        
involved, the Trustee will deduct from the funds of the Trust any accrued costs,
expenses, advances or indemnities provided by the Trust Agreement, including    
estimated compensation of the Trustee, costs of liquidation and any amounts     
required as a reserve to provide for payment of any applicable taxes or other   
governmental charges. Any sale of Securities in the Trust upon termination may  
result in a lower amount than might otherwise be realized if such sale were not 
required at such time. The Trustee will then distribute to each Unitholder of   
each Trust his pro rata share of the balance of the Income and Capital Accounts.

  Within 60 days of the final distribution Unitholders will be furnished a
final distribution statement of the amount distributable. At such time as the   
Trustee in its sole discretion will determine that any amounts held in reserve  
are no longer necessary, it will make distribution thereof to Unitholders in the
same manner.                                                                    

                                                                       EMSPRO390

Key Stats



Weighted Avg P/E

Weighted Avg P/B

Weighted Avg Market Cap (MM) 
$92,265.90




Each Key Stat shows the weighted average of a particular metric attributable to the underlying securities included in the portfolio of the trust, and does not represent a statistic of the trust itself.



1The Portfolio will make distributions of income and capital on each specified Distribution Date to unitholders of record on the preceding Record Date, provided that the total cash held for distribution meets or exceeds any applicable minimum that may be specified in the prospectus. Undistributed income and capital will be distributed on the next Distribution Date in which the total cash held for distribution meets or exceeds any applicable minimum that may be specified in the prospectus.  The Estimated Annual Income per Unit is as of the date listed in the prospectus during the trust's initial offering period, and is updated each calendar quarter thereafter. This amount is based on the most recently declared dividends or interim and final dividends accounting for any foreign withholding taxes, but may also be based upon several recently declared dividends. The actual net annual distributions you receive will vary from the estimate set forth above with changes in the trust's fees and expenses, in dividends and distributions received, currency fluctuations and with the sale of trust securities. The actual net annual distributions are expected to decrease over time because a portion of the securities included in the trust will be sold over time to pay for organization costs. Securities may also be sold to pay regular fees and expenses during the trust's life.  The Portfolio may make distributions that represent a return of capital for tax purposes to the extent of the Unitholder's basis in the Units, and any additional amounts in excess of basis would be taxed as a capital gain. Generally, you will treat all capital gains dividends as long-term capital gains regardless of how long you have owned your Units. Unitholders should consult with their individual tax advisors.
2As of the close of business day prior to Initial Date of Deposit. The actual distributions you may receive will vary from the estimated amount due to changes in the Portfolio's fees and expenses, in actual income received by the Portfolio, currency fluctuations and with changes in the Portfolio such as acquisition or liquidation of securities.


The trust portfolio is provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell the individual securities shown above.



 Important Information About Benchmarks





About risk



There is no assurance the trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit investment trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged and its portfolio is not intended to change during the trust's life except in limited circumstances. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust.The Trust is concentrated in securities issued by companies in the industrials, energy, financial services, healthcare, consumer staples and utility industries. Negative developments in these industries will affect the value of your investment more than would be the case in a more diversified investment.An issuer of Securities held by the Trust may be unwilling or unable to declare dividends in the future, or may reduce the level of dividends declared. This could result in a reduction in the value of your Units. The Trust may be more sensitive to changes in interest rates than the broader market. The Trust invests significantly in securities issued by companies in the financial services and utility industries, and, as a result of its expected higher dividend yield relative to the broader market, the trust is expected to exhibit greater sensitivity to movements in interest rates than the broader market.

Securities may also be sold to pay regular fees and expenses during the trust's life.  The Portfolio may make distributions that represent a return of capital for tax purposes to the extent of the Unitholder's basis in the Units, and any additional amounts in excess of basis would be taxed as a capital gain. Generally, you will treat all capital gains dividends as long-term capital gains regardless of how long you have owned your Units. Unitholders should consult with their individual tax advisors.
2As of the close of business day prior to Initial Date of Deposit. The actual distributions you may receive will vary from the estimated amount due to changes in the Portfolio's fees and expenses, in actual income received by the Portfolio, currency fluctuations and with changes in the Portfolio such as acquisition or liquidation of securities.


 Important Information About Benchmarks





About risk



There is no assurance the trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit investment trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged and its portfolio is not intended to change during the trust's life except in limited circumstances. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust.The Trust is concentrated in securities issued by companies in the industrials, energy, financial services, healthcare, consumer staples and utility industries. Negative developments in these industries will affect the value of your investment more than would be the case in a more diversified investment.An issuer of Securities held by the Trust may be unwilling or unable to declare dividends in the future, or may reduce the level of dividends declared. This could result in a reduction in the value of your Units. The Trust may be more sensitive to changes in interest rates than the broader market. The Trust invests significantly in securities issued by companies in the financial services and utility industries, and, as a result of its expected higher dividend yield relative to the broader market, the trust is expected to exhibit greater sensitivity to movements in interest rates than the broader market.
