What are analysts saying about Sysco Corporation stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Sysco Corporation stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Despite declining shares over the past one year due to macroeconomic headwinds, the drop is narrower than the industry owing to its strong fundamentals. The company’s growth is supported by a wide portfolio of brands across a wide array of business segments. Solid growth in key categories such as beef, pork and poultry alongside of cost reduction initiatives have benefitted the company as evident from its positive gross margins in the last eight consecutive quarters. Sysco’s strategic acquisitions, especially London-based Brakes acquisition have aided the growth of its distribution network and customer base and drove long-term growth. However, the company remains concerned about the deflationary trend that is likely to continue in fiscal 2017, along with stiff competition and promotional environment. Nevertheless, estimates have remained stable since the past thirty days, ahead of its fourth quarter results." (7/21/2017)
2. BMO Capital Markets analysts commented, "DRI posted F4Q17 (May) pro forma EPS of $1.18, above the $1.15 consensus, but below our $1.19 estimate. Excluding the Cheddar’s acquisition, DRI’s blended comp of +3.3% beat our +2.5% estimate and the +2.4% Street mean. This was led by comps of +4.4% at Olive Garden and +3.5% at LongHorn." (6/27/2017)
3. Credit Suisse Group analysts commented, "SYY's stock is well off its high, despite generally strong earnings performances and an impressive increase in the company's 2018 earnings outlook. We see the sell-off as an opportunity to own a blue-chip company in an attractive industry, with solid underlying operating momentum, and insulation from many of the structural issues plaguing the consumer sector today. Weak industry volume growth is the big push back, but the headwind seems overstated. With the stock now trading at about 17.5x our new fiscal 2018 estimate, the valuation is more appealing than it's been in some time. We upgraded the stock to Outperform from Neutral and raised our target price to $59 from $55." (2/6/2017)
4. Royal Bank Of Canada analysts commented, "We are initiating on Sysco with a Sector Perform rating and $47 price target. Despite a softening category and an unsustainable gross margin trajectory, Sysco trades at an all-time high and with the smallest post-recession gap to restaurant valuations. While we think the $500m three-year EBIT growth goal is achievable/raisable, we believe this is already factored into consensus numbers." (1/24/2017)

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Sysco Corporation (NYSE:SYY) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 7 Hold Ratings, 7 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 2.50)Consensus Price Target: $56.42 (7.97% upside)

APPROACH  –  Intersect






















































                    Enterprise resources and network connections for a unique set of clients.                

 
 





            APPROACH        

First let us say that we are not for everyone. We’re specialists, not generalists. Our clients have attained a place in life where their achievements and their opportunities have never been greater. For them, the bar has been raised.
That’s why we created Intersect — an innovative combination of tools and resources designed to find the new synergies and possibilities in life. Our clients need expertise, range and depth of service that typical financial planning and family office doesn’t deliver. They require a wider network of enterprise resources and of connections to potential new business partners. Basically, they demand more.
At Intersect, we believe you are the CEO of your own wealth. As CEO you must create the right business model and choose the right partners for success. Intersect is that model and that partner.
Our range of specialization in wealth management and administration, tax and estate planning, risk management, and concierge-style services is unique in the marketplace. And behind it is a network of connections, constructed and nurtured over many years of working with an elite set of clients, which reach across a spectrum of professional expertise.
As we said, we’re not for everyone. But for those who wish to find a new Intersection of possibility, we are for you.

OUR SERVICES  –  Intersect






















































                    Uncommon expertise. Extraordinary resources: We're redefining business.                

 
 





            OUR SERVICES        

Minding your money is an art, a discipline and a science. At Intersect, our seasoned experts excel in combining all three. With client relationships founded on trust and collaboration, we are your valued partner, focused on what’s right for you. Your Intersect plan is custom-designed, the product of energetic research that defines your financial landscape and works to fulfill your dreams.
Our mission: Advanced Planning, to map your financial future. Risk Management, to assess and meet your insurance needs. Investment Management, to get the most for your money, over a lifetime. Family Office, to sort through and achieve your priorities large and small. As your trusted adviser, our commitment is to always ask the right questions and find the best answers.
Advanced Planning
Sustaining wealth takes meticulous planning and specialized knowledge. And in your busy world, you need trusted advisers who can foster both security and growth. At Intersect, our business is crafting a customized plan for your financial future, your tax status and your estate, including the steps that are designed to make it work.
We’ll assess where you are and where you want to be in the near and long term. We’ll compile an exacting inventory of what you own and what you owe. And we’ll present you a holistic program of wealth management that aligns your assets with your aspirations. Your independent, objective Intersect adviser will sort out the myriad financial expectations and consequences of earning, buying, selling and giving. Solid, comprehensive planning – by experts committed to your best interests.
Risk Management
Great wealth brings with it many responsibilities – for family, businesses, property, even for the special joys prosperity brings. It also carries great risks. Yet many wealthy people don’t have enough insurance to protect themselves. For effective risk management, you need objective, independent advisers who can customize a comprehensive insurance plan specific to your needs. Some of the things we consider:
The best coverage for the best price. Protecting your homes. Collections, jewelry and other such valuables. Personal security and lawsuit threats. Coverage for extraordinary loss. The hidden risks of recreation. Caring for your survivors. With much to protect, the stakes are high. Intersect can shield you with a thoroughly researched insurance plan unique to your situation. It’s advice you can trust with your future.
Investment Management
It all starts with you – where you are now and where you want to go. We’ll help you chart a course for your financial future, based on an in-depth analytics and an understanding of your obligations and goals. Backing us is an extensive network of professional relationships developed over years of careful planning and hard work.
We are objective and independent. Our services are fee-only; we don’t sell our own investment or insurance products. Our focus is strictly on you and your unique priorities, with plans fully customized to match. We set goals, monitor progress, and keep you updated, one-on-one and with written reports. And yes, we promptly return your calls and emails. At Intersect, we take great pride in doing what we say we’ll do: Helping you achieve the goals that matter to you.
Family Office
Success like yours brings new horizons, fresh opportunities, and more choices for what comes next. Getting ahead of the game demands skill, finesse, strategy and teamwork. But you’ve got plenty to do, and time is money. Pulling everything together – and mastering the next challenge – calls for expert assistance and support.
That’s where Intersect comes in. We specialize in taking our select clients – top executives, shrewd entrepreneurs, gifted athletes – to new heights. Keen minds in the financial business, backed by a sophisticated network of service providers, design and help manage your custom success plan, from property management, to legal affairs to bill pay. With our manifold resources, we smooth the way across the full spectrum of wealth and lifestyle management. It’s our job to help keep you on top.
