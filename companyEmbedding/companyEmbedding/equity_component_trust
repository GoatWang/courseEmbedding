About this Film 
This film asks America to talk about the causes and consequences of systemic inequity. Designed for dialogue, the film works to disentangle internal beliefs, attitudes and pre-judgments within, and it builds skills to address the structural drivers of social and economic inequities.
 Read More


Cracking the Codes supports institutions and communities to deepen and shift the framing of racial disparities. The current conversation is not only shallow, but actually harmful. We continue to primarily focus on individuals, when institutional and structural inequities are the bigger problem.
The film contains three sections that correspond to World Trust’s framing of the self-perpetuating system of racial inequity:
Section 1: Social Determinants: History, Identity & Culture
Section 2: Internal Components: Bias, Privilege, Internalized Racism
Section 3: External Relationships: Interpersonal, Institutional, Structural
The film features moving stories from twenty-four racial justice leaders including Amer Ahmed, Michael Benitez, Barbie-Danielle DeCarlo, Joy DeGruy, Harley Eagle, Ericka Huggins, Yuko Kodama, Peggy McIntosh, Rinku Sen, Tillman Smith and Tim Wise.

What is 'Brand Equity'
Brand equity refers to a value premium that a company generates from a product with a recognizable name, when compared to a generic equivalent. Companies can create brand equity for their products by making them memorable, easily recognizable, and superior in quality and reliability. Mass marketing campaigns also help to create brand equity.

      
BREAKING DOWN 'Brand Equity'
      Brand equity has three basic components: consumer perception, negative or positive effects, and the resulting value. First and foremost, brand equity is built by consumer perception, which includes both knowledge and experience with a brand and its products. The perception that a consumer segment holds about a brand directly results in either positive or negative effects. If the brand equity is positive, the organization, its products and its financials can benefit. If the brand equity is negative, the opposite is true.Finally, these effects can turn into either tangible or intangible value. If the effect is positive, tangible value is realized as increases in revenue or profits and intangible value is realized as marketing as awareness or goodwill. If the effects are negative, the tangible or intangible value is also negative. For example, if consumers are willing to pay more for a generic product than for a branded one, the brand is said to have negative brand equity. This might happen if a company has a major product recall or causes a widely publicized environmental disaster.General Example of Brand EquityA general example of a situation where brand equity is important is when a company wants to expand its product line. If the brand's equity is positive, the company can increase the likelihood that customers might buy its new product by associating the new product with an existing, successful brand. For example, if Campbell's releases a new soup, the company is likely to keep it under the same brand name rather than inventing a new brand. The positive associations customers already have with Campbell's make the new product more enticing than if the soup has an unfamiliar brand name.Specific Example of Brand EquityBrand equity is a major indicator of company strength and performance, specifically in the public markets. Often times companies in the same industry or sector compete on brand equity. For example, an EquiTrend survey conducted on July 14, 2016, found that The Home Depot was the number one hardware company in terms of brand equity. Lowe's Companies, Inc. came in second, with The Ace Hardware Corporation scoring below average.A large component of brand equity in the hardware environment is consumer perception of the strength of a company's ecommerce business. The Home Depot is an industry leader in this category. It was also found that, in addition to ecommerce, The Home Depot has the highest familiarity among consumers, allowing it to further penetrate the industry and increase its brand equity.

Components of Stockholders' Equity


    By Investopedia 






Share



















































 Within this section we'll identify the components that comprise the contributed capital part of stockholders' equity.
 Contributed CapitalContributed capital is the total legal capital of the corporation (par value of preferred and common stock) plus the paid-in capital. Par value - This is a value of preferred and common stock that is arbitral (artificial); it is set by management on a per share basis. This artificial value has no relation or impact on the market value of the shares.

 Legal capital of the corporation - This is par value per share multiplied by the total number of shares issued.

 Additional paid-in capital (paid-in capital) - This is the difference between the actual value the company sold the shares for and their par value.
 Example: Company XYZ issued 15,000 preferred shares to investors for $300,000.Company XYZ issued 30,000 common shares to investors for $600,000.Par value of preferred shares is $7 per share.Par value of common shares is $15 per share.
 Legal capital:Preferred shares: $105,000(15,000 x $7)Common shares: $450,000(30,000 x $15)Legal capital $555,000
 Paid-in capital:Preferred shares: $195,000 ($300,000-$105,000)Common shares: $150,000 ($600,000-$450,000)Paid-in capital $345,000 Legal capital + Paid-in capital = Contributed Capital
 
 Look Out!
 If issued common shares have no par value, the amount the stock is sold for constitutes common stock. Preferred stock is always sold with a stated par value.

This question has been a signiﬁcant andrecurrent theme in the branding literature over the past twodecades, resulting in a vast body of research on the salientconcept of brand equity. However, since the late 1990s, newresearch streams in marketing (e.g. long-term relationships,the creation of added value based on knowledge andexperience, the role of marketing resources in ﬁrmperformance, etc.) have allowed for a new way ofapproaching the question of what makes a brand strong,thereby enriching our understanding of brand equity.Speciﬁcally, it is within a resource-based approach andrelationship marketing perspective that we analyze brandequity.The most recent literature (Falkenberg, 1996; Hooley et al.,2005; Srivastava et al., 1998, 2001) considers brand equity asa relational market-based asset because it exists outside theﬁrm and resides in the relationships of ﬁnal users with brands.At the same time, the emergence of relationship marketing asa dominant focus of both marketing theorists andpractitioners suggests that trust is the main factor on whicha relationship is based. Connecting, then, the relationshipprinciples with a resource-based approach to brand equity, wepropose the following research question: Does brand trustmatter to brand equity?The study of brand trust in the branding literature has notﬂourished. Much of the interest in this issue has beenconceptual or theoretical in nature, and there has been littleempirical research into it. This lack of research is pointed outby Chaudhuri and Holbrook (2001) who afﬁrm that the roleof brand trust in the brand equity processes has not beenexplicitly considered. Nevertheless, its importance has beentheoretically highlighted in the branding literature (seeAmbler, 1997; Sheth and Parvatiyar, 1995) and in thecurrent brand management practices (see Bainbridge, 1997;Kamp, 1999; Scott, 2000).On the basis of these considerations, and connecting boththe resource-based approach of the ﬁrm and the relationshipmarketing literatures, this study aims to ﬁll this gap byexamining the importance of brand trust in the developmentof brand equity.To address this objective, the rest of this paper is thereforeorganized as follows. We begin by analyzing brand equity froma resource-based approach. Its consideration as a relationalmarket-based asset leads us to focus on brand trust.Consequently, we present a deﬁnition of brand trust, andThe Emerald Research Register for this journal is available atwww.emeraldinsight.com/researchregisterThe current issue and full text archive of this journal is available atwww.emeraldinsight.com/1061-0421.htmJournal of Product & Brand Management14/3 (2005) 187– 196qEmerald Group Publishing Limited [ISSN 1061-0421][DOI 10.1108/10610420510601058]This research was funded by grant SEC2002-04321-CO2-01 from theSpanish Ministry of Science and Technology.187


we discuss the manner in which brand trust contributes to thedevelopment of brand equity. Based on this discussion, atheoretical model of brand equity is proposed and the mainhypotheses of this study are presented. Subsequently, the datacollection, the method used to test the hypotheses and theresults are described. Finally, we discuss the results in termsof their implications for managerial practice, their limitationsand directions for further research on the branding literature.Brand equity as a relational market-based assetA ﬁrm’s survival and wealth is determined by its ability tocreate a superior value to the market. From a resource-basedview of the ﬁrm, the sources of wealth creation are found inthe resources endowment that enable the ﬁrm to efﬁcientlyand/or effectively produce a market offering that has value forsome market segments (Hunt and Morgan, 1995). By doingso, the ﬁrm achieves superior ﬁnancial performance that isreﬂected in higher dividends and value of stocks (Falkenberg,1996).There is a growing recognition, regarding the resources inwhich this superior ﬁnancial performance lies, that asigniﬁcant proportion of organizational performance isdetermined by intangible assets such as: the quality andexperience of personnel, corporate culture, knowledge, brandequity, and so forth (Falkenberg, 1996; Lusch and Harvey,1994; Srivastava et al., 1998). As with other intangible assets,brand equity exhibits the qualities required for creating asustainable competitive advantage. It adds value forcustomers, helps to create defensible competitive positions,takes time to develop, is inherently complex, and cannot beeasily transferred to other organizations (De Chernatony andMacDonald, 1992). Therefore, its value as an asset isreﬂected in superior ﬁnancial performance in so it leads tohigher margins (Farquhar, 1989), greater sales and marketshares (Hooley et al., 2005; Park and Srinivasan, 1994),advertising and promotions that are more responsive (Keller,1993), earlier market penetration (Robertson, 1993) andcheaper product line extensions (Keller and Aaker, 1992). Asa consequence, a positive inﬂuence of brand equity on theﬁrm value has also been found by Simon and Sullivan (1993).The most recent literature (Hunt, 1997; Srivastava et al.,1998, 2001) speciﬁcally characterizes brand equity as arelational market-based asset. It is primarily relationalbecause, according to the branding literature (Aaker, 1991;Keller, 1993), much of its value is a result of the brand’sexternal relationships with other members of the value chain(e.g. the distribution system and the ﬁnal users). Thisrelational nature makes brand equity be an external asset tothe ﬁrm because it is often merely “available” and not“owned” by the ﬁrm. In other words, brand equity ultimatelyderives in the market place from the set of brand associationsand behaviors that have been developed towards the brand.In summary, as a relational market-based asset, brandequity may be expressed as a function of brand-consumerrelationships (Ambler, 1997), and as such the introduction oftrust as a key relational variable enriches our understanding ofbrand equity and may provide better performance predictionsand assessment of brand equity.What is brand trust?Trust has received a great deal of attention from scholars inseveral disciplines such as psychology, sociology, economics,as well as in more applied areas such as management andmarketing. This multidisciplinary interest has added richnessto the construct, but has also made it difﬁcult to integrate thevarious perspectives on trust and to ﬁnd a consensus on itsnature. Nevertheless, a careful review of the extant literaturereveals that conﬁdent expectations and risk are criticalcomponents of a deﬁnition of trust. Trust therefore isdeﬁned as the conﬁdence that one will ﬁnd what is desiredfrom another, rather that what is feared (Deutsch, 1973). Itrepresents the conﬁdence that the relational party in anexchange will not exploit another’s vulnerability. Accordingly,to trust a brand implicitly means that there is a highprobability or expectancy that the brand will result in positiveoutcomes for the consumer.Considering brand trust as expectancy, it is based on theconsumer’s belief that the brand has speciﬁc qualities thatmake it consistent, competent, honest, responsible and so on,which is in line with the research on trust (e.g. Andaleeb,1992; Doney and Cannon, 1997; Larzelere and Huston,1980). This research suggests that trust is based on thedispositional attributions made to the partner about his/herintentions, behaviors and qualities. The key issue, then, is toknow which speciﬁc attributions form brand trust.Drawing on the research on brand trust developed byDelgado et al. (2003), we consider that these speciﬁcattributions have a technical and intentional nature, which isin line with a two-dimensional idea of trust more commonlyfound in management and marketing literature (see Doneyand Cannon, 1997; Ganesan, 1994; Morgan and Hunt,1994). Therefore, the ﬁrst dimension of brand trust(reliability) has a technical or competence-based nature,involving the ability and willingness to keep promises andsatisfy consumers’ needs. The second dimension (intentions)comprises the attribution of good intentions to the brand inrelation to the consumers’ interests and welfare, for examplewhen unexpected problems with the product arise.Consequently, a trustworthy brand is one that consistentlykeeps its promise of value to consumers through the way theproduct is developed, produced, sold, serviced andadvertised. Even in bad times when some kind of brandcrisis arises.In summary, brand trust is deﬁned as addressed by Delgadoet al. (2003):The conﬁdent expectations of the brand’s reliability and intentions.Brand trust is therefore conceptualized as having two distinctdimensions that reﬂect different perspectives from which abrand may be considered trustworthy.The contribution of brand trust to brand equityTo accomplish our aim of analyzing the role of brand trust inthe development of brand equity, we examine therelationships network in which brand trust is embedded,and speciﬁcally the relationships that have with its mainantecedent and the main asset of brand equity: brand loyalty.Brand trust evolves from past experience and priorinteraction (Garbarino and Johnson, 1999) because itsdevelopment is portrayed most often as an individual’sexperiential process of learning over time. Therefore itsummarizes the consumers’ knowledge and experiences withthe brand. As an experience attribute, it is inﬂuenced by theconsumer’s evaluation of any direct (e.g. trial, usage) andDoes brand trust matter to brand equity?Elena Delgado-Ballester and Jose´Luis Munuera-Alema´nJournal of Product & Brand ManagementVolume 14 · Number 3 · 2005 · 187 – 196188


indirect contact (e.g. advertising, word of mouth) with thebrand (Keller, 1993; Krishnan, 1996). Among all thesedifferent contacts, the consumption experience is the mostrelevant and important source of brand trust, because itgenerates associations, thoughts and inferences that are moreself-relevant and held with more certainty (Dwyer et al., 1987;Krishnan, 1996). In this sense, it can be postulated that theoverall satisfaction, as a general evaluation of theconsumption experience with the brand, generates brandtrust (Ganesan, 1994; Selnes, 1998). This leads us to proposethe following hypothesis:H1. The consumer’s overall satisfaction with the brand hasa positive effect on brand trust.Considering brand equity as a relational market-based assetimplies that building and maintaining trust is at the core ofbrand equity, because it is a key characteristic of anysuccessful long-term relationship (Garbarino and Johnson,1999; Larzelere and Huston, 1980; Morgan and Hunt, 1994).Taking into account the conceptual connections ofrelationship aspects and the notion of loyalty (Fournier andYao, 1997), the prevailing idea in these studies (Chaudhuriand Holbrook, 2001; Delgado et al., 2003; Garbarino andJohnson, 1999; Lau and Lee, 1999) is that trust is the cardinaldriver of loyalty because it creates exchange relationships thatare highly valued. In this context, brand loyalty does notexclusively focus on repeated purchases, but on the internaldispositions or attitude towards the brand, the focus onbehavior would otherwise not provide an adequate basis for acomplete understanding of the brand-consumer relationship.Consequently, brand loyalty underlies the ongoing process ofcontinuing and maintaining a valued and importantrelationship that has been created by trust (Chaudhuri andHolbrook, 2001).This is fairly well supported by several authors in thebranding literature. For example, Sheth and Parvatiyar (1995)assert that the logic behind the existence of the brand is totransmit trust to the market, especially when direct contactbetween consumers and companies are not possible. Anothertelling argument in support of this viewpoint is that theunique value perceived in a brand by consumers may bederived from greater trust in that particular brand that otherbrands do not provide (Chaudhuri and Holbrook, 2001).From a managerial perspective, companies have also begunto consider the idea of wining consumers’ trust in order tobuild a relationship. In the consumer market, there are toomany anonymous consumers, making it unlikely that thecompany could develop personal relationships with each one.Thus, consumers develop a relationship with the brand,which becomes a substitute for human contact between theorganization and its customers (Sheth and Parvatiyar, 1995).Trust, therefore, can be developed through this relationshipwith the brand. The current practices of companies inmanaging their brands illustrate this idea. For example,MacLeod (2000) considers that much of the vocabulary ofmodern brand building uses words associated with personalrelationships such as trust and Blackston (1992) views trust tobe one component of consumers’ relationships with brands.More recently, Hiscock (2001, p. 1) has claimed that “theultimate goal of marketing is to generate an intense bondbetween the consumer and the brand, and the mainingredient of this bond is trust”.Based on these ideas, we put forward the hypothesis thatbrand trust will contribute to brand loyalty as the maximumexpression of a successful relationship between the consumerand the brand.H2. The consumer’s trust in a brand has a positive effect onbrand loyalty.Finally, one characteristic of brands with high levels of equityis that consumers are very loyal to them. In fact, brand loyaltyis the main driver of brand equity because it is considered tobe the path that leads to certain marketing advantages andoutcomes (e.g. reduced marketing costs, price premiums,market share, greater trade leverage), which have been closelyassociated with brand equity (Aaker, 1991; Bello andHolbrook, 1995; Park and Srinivasan, 1994). Therefore, wepropose another hypothesis describing the relationshipbetween brand loyalty and brand equity:H3. The consumer’s loyalty to the brand has a positiveeffect on brand equity.MethodData collectionThe data are based on a survey done in a Region of 1,100,000inhabitants in the south-eastern part of Spain. Aquestionnaire was administered through the use of acomputer-aided telephone interviewing (CATI) program bya market research ﬁrm. The participants were real consumerswho reported their consumption experience with one of twodifferent product categories: shampoo and beer. Theseproducts were chosen because they are frequentlypurchased, and most people are familiar with them andhave experienced different brands. Respondents wereassigned to one product and were asked which brands theyused. They were interviewed with reference to one of thebrands mentioned. To obtain reliable answers, the sample unitwas composed of those individuals who were active decisionmakers of the brand they consumed.By random phone-calls with the use of the CATI program,we obtained 271 completed questionnaires (134 for shampooand 137 for beer), yielding a response rate of 67 percent – areasonable response rate given that the survey was completelyvoluntary and the participants received no compensation foranswering the questionnaire.Thesamplewaswellbalancedintermsofmostdemographic and socio-economic characteristics (e.g. age,incomes, education) except for gender. Speciﬁcally, 23percent of the sample was male and 77 percent was female.Although a random sampling process was used to select eachparticipant in the study, there is a disproportionalrepresentation of women to men. This can be explained bythe cultural and social values of the geographical area in whichthe survey was administered. Signiﬁcant gender differencesstill exist in the sense that there is a large proportion ofhousewives. In addition, both stay-at-home and workingwomen retain the vast majority of traditional responsibilitiesfor the care of the household including most forms ofshopping. However, most people are familiar with bothshampoo (because it is a personal hygiene product) and beer(because the geographical area of this study is one with thehighest levels of beer consumption in Spain).Table I provides a detailed description of the sample.Does brand trust matter to brand equity?Elena Delgado-Ballester and Jose´Luis Munuera-Alema´nJournal of Product & Brand ManagementVolume 14 · Number 3 · 2005 · 187 – 196189


MeasuresBrand trustBased on previous research (Delgado, 2004; Delgado et al.,2003) a set of four items was used to measure each dimensionof this construct. As in the case with all of the multi-itemmeasures, each item was framed as an agree/disagreestatement.Brand loyaltyA four-item scale was used to measure the dispositionalcommitment to maintaining an ongoing relationship with abrand (e.g. Bloemer and Kasper, 1995; Dick and Basu,1994). Each item was framed as an agree/disagree statement.Brand equityBrand equity was measured with a four-item Likert scaledeveloped by Yoo and Donthu (2001) which is in line with thedeﬁnition of brand equity proposed by Keller (1993). Thefour items measure the difference in consumer choicebetween the focal branded product and an unbrandedproduct given the same level of product features. In linewith our view of brand equity as a relational market-basedasset, this deﬁnition explicitly relies on brand knowledgestructures in the minds of consumers as the foundation ofbrand equity.Overall satisfactionIn line with Anderson et al. (1994, p. 54), overall satisfactionis deﬁned as an overall evaluation based on the total purchaseand consumption experience with a product or service overtime. Therefore, we used an overall satisfaction measure as asummary evaluation of the entire brand use experience (seeTable II). This measure involves not only the valence (positiveand negative) but also the intensity and is represented bythree items measured on a fvie-point scale (Oliver, 1997;Spreng et al., 1996).Table II also reports information about the reliability andconvergent validity of the different measures. Discriminantvalidity is also indicated since the conﬁdence interval (^2£standard errors) around the correlation estimate betweenany two latent indicators never includes 1.0 (Anderson andGerbing, 1988).ResultsThe proposed structural model is speciﬁed by the hypothesizedrelationships in Figure 1, discussed in the text as H1-H3.Thepath linking overall satisfaction and brand loyalty is alsoestimated, which is in line with previous research on brandloyalty (see Anderson and Sullivan, 1993; Bloemer and Kasper,1995; Oliver, 1999)[1]. Conventional maximum likelihoodestimation techniques were used to test the model. The ﬁt ofthe model is satisfactory (x2ð146Þ¼399:08; GFI ¼0.87;SRMR ¼0.046; RMSEA ¼0.08; CFI ¼0.92; TLI (NNFI)¼0.91), thereby suggesting that the nomological network ofrelationships ﬁts our data.In terms of our hypotheses (see Table III), the ﬁndings forH1 (overall satisfaction !brand reliability;g11 ¼0:88,p,0:05; overall satisfaction !brand intentions;g21 ¼0:55,p,0:05) suggest that brand trust is rooted in the result ofpast experience with the brand (i.e. overall satisfaction). Assuggested by Singh and Sirdeshmukh (2000), we obser ve thatthe effects of overall satisfaction are not speciﬁc to a singledimension of brand trust.Speciﬁcally, as the squared multiple correlations (SMCs)reveal, overall satisfaction explains a substantial amount of thevariance of brand trust: brand reliability ¼0:78, and brandintentions ¼0:30. The fact that brand reliability, as perceivedby consumers, relies more heavily on overall satisfaction thanbrand intentions do is in line with Rempel et al.’s (1985)statements about how trust evolves. According to theirreasoning, brand reliability is heavily related to theconsistency of brand performance as signaled by the overallsatisfaction consumers have with the brand. In comparison withbrand reliability, brand intentions capture the essence of brandtrust that is not securely rooted in past experience. However,the fact that past experience (e.g. satisfaction with the brand) isnot an exact barometer of brand intentions does not imply thatpast experience plays no role in explaining brand intentions.Continuing with the consequences of brand trust, it isfound to be positively associated with brand loyalty, givingsupport to H2 (brand reliability !brand loyalty;b31 ¼0:42,p,0:05; brand intentions !brand loyalty;b32 ¼0:20,p,0:05).H3 is also supported, with brand loyalty signiﬁcantlyassociated with an increase in brand equity (b43 ¼0:87,p,0:05). This suggests that the postulated relationship ofbrand loyalty and brand equity is conﬁrmed.Nevertheless, the question of interest is to determine therelevance of brand trust in the development of brand equity.For this purpose we speciﬁed different models that, from atheoretical perspective, give alternative interpretations of therelative importance attributed to brand trust when explainingthe bond between consumers and brands.Speciﬁcally, we test out theoretical model (MT) againstalternative model speciﬁcations (MA).

of a chi-square difference test (CDT) to test the nullhypothesis: MT 2MA ¼0.In comparison with the theoretical model, the constrainedmodel (MA2) identiﬁes brand trust as the primary precursorof brand loyalty because it plays a full mediating role betweenoverall satisfaction and brand loyalty, which is in line with thecommitment-trust theory (Morgan and Hunt, 1994). Incontrast, the constrained model (MA3) is in line with theliterature that considers overall satisfaction as the keyconstruct in explaining brand loyalty. Consequently, in thismodel brand trust is only just a peripheral evaluation of thepast experience with the brand that does not have furthereffects on brand loyalty.The top section of Table IV offers the chi-square ﬁtcomparisons among these models. In the ﬁrst step, thetheoretical model (Figure 1) was compared with a lessparsimonious MA1. A non-signiﬁcant CDT would lead to theacceptance of the more parsimonious MT. Table IV reports anon-signiﬁcant change in chi-square between our model andthe CFA, leading us to consider MT as a better speciﬁcation.Next, we contrasted MT with a constrained model MA2 (i.e.withg31path equal to zero) and the difference in chi-squareﬁt between the two models was signiﬁcant. This result leadsus to stay with the less parsimonious theoretical modelbecause it has a signiﬁcant better ﬁt. Finally, we comparedMT with an alternative model (MA3) where it is proposedthat brand trust has no effect on brand loyalty. In this case weare comparing MT with a more parsimonious model.According to the CDT, the theoretical model (MT)provided a signiﬁcantly better ﬁt to the data (p,0:01) thanthe model MA3. Therefore, the theoretical model wasdeemed the best representation of the network relationshipsin which brand trust is embedded.DiscussionsThe beneﬁts of developing and exploiting marketing resourceshave been a signiﬁcant theme in the marketing literature. Byleveraging marketing resources, it is argued that ﬁrms will bein a stronger position to succeed in the marketplace(Srivastava et al., 1998). Among these resources we identifybrand equity, which is viewed as a relational market-basedasset because it lies in the relationships between the brand andkey external stakeholders for example end consumers. Underthis framework we theorized the role of an importantrelationship variable such as trust in the development ofbrand equity. We developed a causal model containing threehypotheses and structural equation modeling supported all ofthem.Because an emerging consensus in structural equationsmodeling is that researchers should compare alternativemodels, not just test a proposed model, we analyzedalternative models. To better know the role of brand trust inbrand equity processes we compared the proposed model withother alternative models in which the central nomologicalstatus for brand trust and brand loyalty varies. In thealternative model MA2, the direct effect of overall satisfactionon brand loyalty is not allowed. Therefore, brand trust isidentiﬁed as a key full mediating variable to develop brandloyalty and consequently brand equity. In the alternativemodel MA3, on the contrary, the direct effect of brand truston brand loyalty is not identiﬁed. Then, brand trust is notallowed to mediate, being overall satisfaction the main driverof brand loyalty, and brand equity.Compared to these more parsimonious models, theproposed model is preferred because it has a bettersigniﬁcant ﬁt. Consequently, although brand trust does notplay a full mediating role as suggested by Morgan and Hunt(1994), it contributes to a better explanation of brand equity.These results have signiﬁcant implications for bothscholarship and practice.Implications for scholarship and limitationsThe results obtained about the role of brand trust in thedevelopment of brand equity enrich branding literaturethrough the integration with the literature on the resource-based view of the ﬁrm. For instance, the empirical evidenceabout the fact that brand equity is best explained when brandtrust is taken into account reinforces the idea that brandequity is a relational market-based asset. Morgan and Hunt(1996) proposed that resources such as loyalty and trust areimmobile and cannot be purchased or replicated. Theseresources can therefore be combined in order to form higherorder resources (e.g. brand equity) from which sustainableresource-based competitive advantages will result. Some openquestions on this topic warrant further research.First, stakeholder theory says that the ﬁrm is reliant on anetwork of relations in which it becomes obliged to themembers of this network. Therefore, as a relational market-based asset, the analysis of brand equity must also considerthe relationships with other members of the value chain,including employees (especially in service companies),investors or even suppliers.Second, because there are interconnections amongstakeholders, an interesting point is that a ﬁrm might buildup strong brand equity based on the relationships developedwith consumers that could be undermined by the ﬁrmneglecting its relationships with other stakeholders groups. Inother words, to what extend does brand equity depend onrelationships with stakeholders groups other than the focalgroup; that is consumers? To what extent is it important tomanage each relationship?

all of relationships? If that is the case, then, how is trustdeﬁned?Third, research on branding industrial products has beenlimited. The fact that, in today’s competitive businessenvironment, industrial ﬁrms are increasingly usingbranding to differentiate their products and also developrelationships with their customers makes apparent the need ofexpanding the body of knowledge of the subject. A point ofdeparture is to examine the research on consumer branding.Therefore, our ﬁndings offer industrial branding researcherssome ideas that can be applied in the industrial sector.On a more general level, there is also room for additionalstudies that overcome the limitations of this research. Thesample is not representative of the entire population ofconsumers. As discussed previously, the sample was randomlyselected by phone-calls interviewing only those individualswho were active decision makers in the products analyzed.This resulted in a disproportional representation of womenversus men. Being so, our results may reﬂect a gender biasthat limits the external validity of this study. Thegeneralizability of the results could be extended byconsidering other demographic groups. Finally, thegeneralizability of the results could be extended bybroadening the list of products, for example durable goodsand services in which brand trust may be even moreimportant in developing brand equity.Implications for practiceThis study has several managerial implications regardingbrand equity. First, in order to enjoy the substantialcompetitive and economic advantages provided by brandequity as a relational market-based asset, companies mustbuild brand trust. To that purpose a promise-centric approachis needed when managing the brand. It implies to position thebrand as a promise, as a set of expectations that the brandoffers a certain type and level of value. Providing this value ona consistent basis is at the heart of building strongrelationships with consumers because they develop a senseof trust that the brand will continue to deliver that value.When this happens, the brand can serve as a catalyst forstrengthening the relationship and for forming a bond thatcompetitors will ﬁnd difﬁcult to break. This will be thefoundation for the ongoing success and sustained competitiveadvantage.However, companies must take care not to promiseeverything for all people. They have to consider their owncapabilities and the desires of their target consumer segmentsbefore deﬁning their promises of value. Once they are deﬁnedthese promises have to be kept consistently, especially whenthings change quickly and buyers face great uncertainty.Second, since trust is built through experience, the morepositive experiences the consumer has with the brand, themore trusting he or she is likely to become. As such,investments in satisfaction programs, complaint handling andin the design of communication and merchandising strategies,that aid in creating and informing consumers about theresponsive attitudes and behaviors of the brands, are ways ofbuilding brand trust.Third, history has proven that consumers will give secondchances to brands they trust (Harvin, 2000). The consumeroutrage at contaminated Coca-Cola cans in some westernEuropean countries in 1998 and Perrier mineral watercontaining unacceptable levels of benzene in 1990 are casesin point. Because of the strength of both brands they continueto enjoy a substantial reputation despite of the unexpectedproduct-harm crises. Consequently, as far as the brandingliterature suggests that trust is the essence of the value that astrong brand provides for consumers, paying attention to howmuch consumers trust in a brand might be considered as atool to manage brand equity. This is particularly important inhealthcare, legal services and in durable products.Our ﬁndings are of special relevance in the business-tobusiness arena as far as a number of studies (see Henthorneet al., 1993; McQuiston and Dickson, 1991) have shown thatindustrial buyers will choose recognized brand names fromestablished companies as a way to reduce both corporate andpersonal risk.Finally, companies with trusted off-line brands also beneﬁtfrom a “halo effect” in trying to establish a presence on theweb. The anonymity of the Internet makes branding morecrucial because consumers are likely to be more receptive totrying on-line offerings from a trusted brand name. In otherwords, having a trusted brand gave companies a relativelysmooth and successful transition to the Net as in the case ofBarnes & Noble and Toys R Us (Harvin, 2000).Note1 Recently, researchers have begun to document that thissatisfaction-loyalty relationship is not a simple linear effect(Oliva et al., 1992). However, as pointed by Singh andSirdeshmukh (2000), sufﬁcient research does not exist tospecify the nature of this no linearity or to suggestconditions that favor it. Consequently, we specify adirectional relationship only.ReferencesAaker, D.A. (1991), Managing Brand Equity: Capitalizing onthe Value of a Brand Name, Free Press, New York, NY.Ambler, T.

Thosewith a particular interest in the topic covered may then read thearticle in toto to take advantage of the more comprehensivedescription of the research undertaken and its results to get the fullbeneﬁt of the material present.Getting and protecting brand trust – a challenge formarketersThose of you who followed the recent UK General Electionwill know that during the campaign a great deal of time wasdevoted to the question of “trust” (as in “Do you trust TonyBlair?”). The argument goes that if we cannot trust Tony Blairto be straight and honest on one issue (the Iraq war), how canwe trust him on other important domestic issues? Theconsensus was that, while Mr Blair’s “brand” was damaged,the damage to the bigger Labour “brand” was limitedallowing Mr Blair to win – albeit with a smaller share of thevote.We know – at least intuitively, that the extent to which we“trust” a brand inﬂuences our propensity to purchase thatbrand. And this mistrust therefore impacts on brand equity.However, as Delgado-Ballester and Munuera-Aleman pointout, there is limited empirical study – and henceunderstanding – of the connection between brand trust andbrand equity. We take the relationship on trust!Keeping our promisesAny brand contains – either implicitly or explicitly – apromise or promises. Sometimes these promises are tangibleand measurable, but more often the promise contains asigniﬁcant element of intangibility. When a car manufacturermakes claims about safety these can be substantiated (e.g. as aresult of crash testing) and the buyer – one hopes – is notintending to put such claims to deliberate test! On the otherhand promises that imply glamour, status or other self-imagebeneﬁts are less measurable.As brand managers we need to consider the extent to whichour brand promise is realistic and deliverable. A trusted brandis one that, as the authors here conclude: “... that consistentlykeeps its promise of value to consumers through the way theproduct is developed, produced, sold, serviced andadvertised”. If we do what we say we will do – more oftenthan not – we will beneﬁt from this through being moretrusted.It is all in the consumer’s mind!Brand equity sits in the mind of the consumer consisting ofthose associations, attitudes and behaviors linking to thebrand. And we want the consumer to know that our promiseis what we say it is not for that consumer to disbelieve whatwe say. When the consumer is confronted with our brand wewant a positive response to the message conveyed by thebrand and for that consumer to trust our promise.The evolution of trust in this context not only increases theattention given to our brand claim, but also offers a degree ofprotection to our brand that a less trusted brand would notreceive. As the authors here point out, trusted brands aremore likely to be given a second chance by the consumerfollowing a failure or bad publicity. For example, it isinteresting to note the continuing brand strength of Nescafe´despite a long-term campaign by various pressure groupsagainst the company. The brand promise (consistently highquality instant coffee) protects against the accusations ofunfair trade and third world exploitation.A less well-trusted brand lacks this protection. Rover, forexample, was unable to take full advantage of the patrioticappeal of being the last British-owned mass car manufacturerbecause prospective buyers did not trust the wider brandappeal – reliability, image, style, etc. Past impressions ofunreliability, labour unrest, poor service and unattractivestyling afforded the brand little or no protection.You only get tr usted over timeAt the beginning of a brand’s life, it should sit in a neutralspace – neither trusted nor mistrusted. This might bequaliﬁed where the new brand is associated with or extendedfrom an existing brand but it provides the basis for decisionsabout brand trust. However, while messages that implytrustworthiness can be applied, the measure of trust requires(as ever) for the consumer to believe the claim.Trust is engendered on one level by product or serviceperformance (it does what it says it does), by the consistencyof this performance and by other objective factors. At thesame time less tangible aspects of brand communication canact to generate trust – this represents those aspects of valuethat cannot be assessed in utilitarian terms.All this takes time and effort especially since it is far easierto destroy trust than it is to create trust. As the authorsobserve, trust is determined only by experience – we baseour assessment as to the extent of trustworthiness on whathas happened in the past. If we have no experience, weaccept that we are taking a risk.

It is important thatwe are prepared for the occasion when, for whatever reason,there is a failure to deliver a promise. A prompt response isvital and it will be sensible to remind consumers of thebrand’s history of delivering on promises. Loss of trust is amajor risk to brand equity and brand managers must work toprevent such losses and to store up levels of trust that canaccommodate occasional failures.(A pre´cis of the article “Does brand tr ust matter to brand equity?”.Supplied by Marketing Consultants for Emerald.)Does brand trust matter to brand equity?Elena Delgado-Ballester and Jose´Luis Munuera-Alema´nJournal of Product & Brand ManagementVolume 14 · Number 3 · 2005 · 187 – 196196

By successfully doing so the refrigeration companies can harvest profits for them, including less spending on advertising activities, higher margins and more noteworthy brand expansion prospect (Ballester and Munuera-Alemán, 2005; Van Riel et al., 2005). Environmental consciousness and brand equity: An impact assessment using analytical hierarchy process (AHP)[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the activities of environmental consciousness from socio-psychographic perspectives and hence evaluates its effect on brand equity through intervening elements of environmental attributes (EAt). It further attempts to research the effect of the environmental performance, environmental communication and environmental positioning in enhancing brand equity. Indian refrigeration industry, particularly the air conditioners and refrigerator brands are chosen to convey and receive the research inputs as their impact on environment is easily interpretable. Design/methodology/approach: A hypothesized model comprising the environment consciousness and association dimensions with brand equity is framed. In total, 74 expert respondents from four state capital cities of India participated in the survey and the model has been tested in the scope of analytical hierarchy process (AHP). Findings: The result shows that the EAt and activities can be prioritized and subsequently efficient resource allocation can be done. It also gives theoretical arguments to legitimize the environmental practices. Practical implications: On the other hand, clients have numerous options, and a competitive advantage may not be maintained. Regardless of the fact that clients are environmentally conscious of a given refrigeration brand at the present time that they are utilizing, they may observe that they are much more charmed with a competitors’ enhanced environmental dimensions. All methods that take a try at an enhanced brand equity must be continually determined by environmental consciousness. The above can be accomplished if the evaluations of competitors by the clients are known. The AHP-ECBE technique depicted in this study accordingly helps refrigeration organization to devise and keep up a pertinent, focused plan for persistent improvements in environmental dimensions. It offers a “greater image” in brand equity administration. Originality/value: If legitimately done in a generalized way, environmental activities like eco-literacy, interpersonal influence and value orientation can impact EAt and contribute in building brand equity.

Furthermore, trust has been shown to affect the establishment and development of customer relationships; customer loyalty, and brand equity (e.g.Chaudhuri and Holbrook 2001;Delgado-Ballester andMunuera-Alemán, 2005, Albert andMerunka, 2013;Veloutsou, 2015). Also, previous studies have posited that satisfaction is an antecedent of trust (e.g. DRIVERS OF CUSTOMER LOYALTY IN FAST FASHION RETAILING: DO THEY VARY ACROSS CUSTOMERS? DRIVERS OF CUSTOMER LOYALTY IN FAST FASHION RETAILING: DO THEY VARY ACROSS CUSTOMERS?[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: Although consumer behaviour patterns have become very important in retailing, consumer-driven research is still limited in this area. The purpose of this paper is to empirically test the effects of perceived value; satisfaction, and trust on customer loyalty in fast fashion retailing and to investigate the stability of these effects across different customer segments. A total of 700 customers of a fast fashion retail chain were interviewed and PLS-PM was used for data analysis. Results show that customer loyalty is mainly affected by perceived value and satisfaction and to a lesser extent by trust. Perceived value is the main driver of satisfaction and trust, while satisfaction exerts a significant but small effect on trust. Cluster analysis resulted in four specific customer segments with different behaviour, performance-oriented; value-oriented; experience-oriented, and relationship-oriented. Results present important managerial implications for fast fashion retailers.

GiovanisPinelopi AthanasopoulouRead full-textWhen customers possess a high level of trust in a brand, they confidently demonstrate expectation of the brand's reliability and intentions (Chaudhuri and Holbrook, 2001; Pauwels-Delassus and Descotes, 2013; So et al, 2013). Brand trust has been identified as a key determinant of brand loyalty, which in turn positively influences brand performance such as brand equity, market share, and relative price (e.g., Chaudhuri and Holbrook, 2001 ; Delgado- Ballester and Alemán, 2005). On the other hand, brand avoidance is a negative response to a brand, indicating customers' effort to reduce their patronage of a brand (Grégoire et al, 2009). Brand trust and avoidance following brand crisis: A quasi-experiment on the effect of franchisor statements[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: Although franchising has become an important growth strategy in several industries over the last few decades, there are few empirical studies about the effects of franchisor communication strategy on customer responses in the context of franchise brand crisis. Two quasi-experimental studies were conducted to test the effect of a franchisor ownership separation statement on brand trust and brand avoidance following a brand crisis situation. Results show that a franchisor’s explicit communication of the franchise brand’s individual ownership business structure is useful in preventing further negative spillover effect throughout the franchised chain when the brand crisis occurs at a single franchise location. The authors also investigate the mechanism through which such communication influences customer behavior and the moderating effect of the brand crisis severity in affecting brand evaluation. These results offer guidance to franchise brand managers by providing insight into how to overcome a franchise brand crisis and by suggesting franchise context-specific managerial recommendations. Full-text · Article · Aug 2016 Hyunju ShinRiza CasidyAlyssa YoonSo-Hyang YoonSo-Hyang YoonRead full-textWe offer researchers three main theoretical contributions. First, with regard to the role of brand trust in an industrial co-branding context, our empirical findings revealed that it was determined by the seller's responsiveness, underlining the past experiential nature of the brand trust (Delgado-Ballester & Munuera-Alemán, 2005; Garbarino & Johnson, 1999; Morgan & Hunt, 1994). In a similar vein, we found that the ingredient brand strength affects the ingredient brand trust, indicating that the strong image of the ingredient brand, being a signal of quality, affects the brand trust in an industrial context (Doney & Cannon, 1997; Kirmani & Rao, 2000; Nelson, 1974; Rao & Ruekert, 1994; Singh & Sirdeshmukh, 2000). Industrial Ingredient Co-branding: A Brand Relationship Approach[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: Existing research on industrial ingredient co-branding alliances has largely focused on the functional andtransactional value that ingredient brands provide to ingredient buyers and sellers. The current research draws on the brand relationship perspective to investigate how the relational assets of ingredient brands generate value for both ingredient buyers and for the ingredient supplier itself. For the former, such value manifests in ingredient co-branding value, and for the latter, the value lies in brand equity. The results are derived from a survey of 107 ingredient buyers from a multinational ingredient manufacturer aiming to initiate ingredient co-branding agreements in the energy component industry. The results of the structural equation model reveal that ingredient brand trust directly affects both ingredient brand loyalty and ingredient co-branding value, but indicate no significant effect between brand loyalty and ingredient co-branding value. Moreover, ingredient co-branding value proved to be a driver of ingredient supplier brand equity.

Whereas former studies investigated the antecedents of brand equity in marketing in general (Yoo et al. 2000; Delgado-Ballester and Munuera-Alemán 2005; Aaker 1992), there is only little research conducted in the field of green marketing: To this point, only four models of green brand equity and its antecedents have been published (Kang and Hur 2011; Chen 2010; Chang and Chen 2013; Ng et al. 2013). Two of the four models reveal a considerable overlap using green trust and green satisfaction as predictors of green brand equity (Kang and Hur 2011; Chen 2010). Greening the competitive advantage: Antecedents and consequences of green brand equity[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: The concept of green brand equity has recently been introduced to business research. Chen (J Bus Ethics 93:307–319, 2010) found green brand equity to be positively influenced by green brand image via green satisfaction and green trust as parallel mediators in an Asian electronic product customer sample. Our research aims at replicating and extending these findings. Based on a German sample (N = 358), we replicate this mediation model in a different cultural context (a Western culture), extend it to service brands, and show that the model is valid for female as well as male consumers. Furthermore, we extend the original model by providing first empirical evidence for the relevance of green brand equity as a predictor of key economic indicators of consumer response (i.e., brand attitude, positive word-of-mouth communication). Finally, we discuss the implications of green brand equity for management as one determinant of a company’s success in a highly competitive business world.

Unique identity in market can be achieved with the help of strong and remarkable brand (Aaker, 1996) which helps to increase the profit margins and boost better intermediate cooperation as well as intensifying the chance for further brand extension (Delgado-Ballester and Alemán, 2005). Marketers would develop retail brands with exceptional image in order to distinguish one brand from another, so as to sustain and growth with increased reputation and market share (Abend, 2000; Ailawadi, 2001; Corstjens and Lal, 2000). Identification of influential quality management variables using ISM approach[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: This paper aims to explain the relationship between the influential
variables which affects the quality in supply chain. It proposes modelling the
quality variables and outlining how these variables influence quality in context
with a typical supply chain. Interpretive structural modelling (ISM) is used in
this study to derive the interrelationship among the influential variables to
improve the quality in supply chain. It is found that out of 14 selected variables
the top management commitment, employee training and involvement, best
practices, market sensitiveness and supply chain coordination are the key
variables which greatly affect the return on investment and brand value of an
organisation. The above model gives important guidelines to the supply chain
managers to tackle these variables on priority basis for effective supply chain
quality management. The results can give good learning insight for
practitioners about driving and dependence power of variables in supply chain

Each Key Stat shows the weighted average of a particular metric attributable to the underlying securities included in the portfolio of the trust, and does not represent a statistic of the trust itself.



1The Portfolio will make distributions of income and capital on each specified Distribution Date to unitholders of record on the preceding Record Date, provided that the total cash held for distribution meets or exceeds any applicable minimum that may be specified in the prospectus. Undistributed income and capital will be distributed on the next Distribution Date in which the total cash held for distribution meets or exceeds any applicable minimum that may be specified in the prospectus.  The Estimated Annual Income per Unit is as of the date listed in the prospectus during the trust's initial offering period, and is updated each calendar quarter thereafter. This amount is based on the most recently declared dividends or interim and final dividends accounting for any foreign withholding taxes, but may also be based upon several recently declared dividends. The actual net annual distributions you receive will vary from the estimate set forth above with changes in the trust's fees and expenses, in dividends and distributions received, currency fluctuations and with the sale of trust securities. The actual net annual distributions are expected to decrease over time because a portion of the securities included in the trust will be sold over time to pay for organization costs. Securities may also be sold to pay regular fees and expenses during the trust's life.  The Portfolio may make distributions that represent a return of capital for tax purposes to the extent of the Unitholder's basis in the Units, and any additional amounts in excess of basis would be taxed as a capital gain. Generally, you will treat all capital gains dividends as long-term capital gains regardless of how long you have owned your Units. Unitholders should consult with their individual tax advisors.
2As of the close of business day prior to Initial Date of Deposit. The actual distributions you may receive will vary from the estimated amount due to changes in the Portfolio's fees and expenses, in actual income received by the Portfolio, currency fluctuations and with changes in the Portfolio such as acquisition or liquidation of securities.
3The estimated annual expenses are based upon the estimated trust size for the Portfolio determined as of the initial date of deposit. Because certain of the operating expenses are fixed amounts, if the trust does not reach that estimated size, the amount of the estimated annual expenses per unit may exceed the amounts reflected. On the business day following the end of the initial offering period, the Sponsor and/or the Supervisor will waive their respective fees, and/or the Sponsor will reimburse the Portfolio operating expenses, in an amount so that the total estimated annual expenses calculated on that date do not exceed $0.0350 per unit.However, subsequent to that date the value of the Portfolio as well as the number of outstanding units may decline, and/or the actual amount of the operating expenses may exceed the estimated amounts, any of which could result in the actual amount of the total annual expenses exceeding $0.0350 per unit.


The trust portfolio is provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell the individual securities shown above.



 Important Information About Benchmarks





About risk



There is no assurance the trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit investment trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged and its portfolio is not intended to change during the trust's life except in limited circumstances. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust. The trust should be considered as part of a long-term investment strategy and you should consider your ability to pursue it by investing in successive trusts, if available. You will realize tax consequences associated with investing from one series to the next.
You could experience dilution of your investment if the size of the portfolio is increased as Units are sold. There is no assurance that your investment will maintain its proportionate share in the Portfolio's profits and losses.
The financial condition of an issuer of Securities held by the Trust may worsen or its credit ratings may drop, resulting in a reduction in the value of your Units. This may occur at any point in time, including during the initial offering period.
The Trust is concentrated in securities issued by companies in the financials, health care, consumer discretionary, consumer staples and industrials. Negative developments in these industries will affect the value of your investment more than would be the case in a more diversified investment.
Common stocks do not assure dividend payments. Dividends are paid only when declared by an issuer’s board of directors and the amount of any dividend may vary over time. There can be no guarantee or assurance that companies will declare dividends in the future or that if declared, they will remain at current levels or increase over time.
The Trust may be more sensitive to changes in interest rates than the broader market. The Trust invests significantly in securities issued by financials companies and utilities companies, and, as a result of their potentially higher dividend yield relative to the broader market, the trust may exhibit greater sensitivity to movements in interest rates than the broader market. 
Investing in foreign securities involves certain risks not typically associated with investing solely in the United States. This may magnify volatility due to changes in foreign exchange rates, the political and economic uncertainties in foreign countries, and the potential lack of liquidity, government supervision and regulation.
Central Equity Trust securities are offered by Edward Jones. As described more fully in the prospectus, Edward Jones may have received compensation in other capacities from, or have other relationships with, the issuers of the common stocks held by a Trust. The opinions expressed may change at anytime.

1The Portfolio will make distributions of income and capital on each specified Distribution Date to unitholders of record on the preceding Record Date, provided that the total cash held for distribution meets or exceeds any applicable minimum that may be specified in the prospectus. Undistributed income and capital will be distributed on the next Distribution Date in which the total cash held for distribution meets or exceeds any applicable minimum that may be specified in the prospectus.  The Estimated Annual Income per Unit is as of the date listed in the prospectus during the trust's initial offering period, and is updated each calendar quarter thereafter. This amount is based on the most recently declared dividends or interim and final dividends accounting for any foreign withholding taxes, but may also be based upon several recently declared dividends. The actual net annual distributions you receive will vary from the estimate set forth above with changes in the trust's fees and expenses, in dividends and distributions received, currency fluctuations and with the sale of trust securities. The actual net annual distributions are expected to decrease over time because a portion of the securities included in the trust will be sold over time to pay for organization costs. Securities may also be sold to pay regular fees and expenses during the trust's life.  The Portfolio may make distributions that represent a return of capital for tax purposes to the extent of the Unitholder's basis in the Units, and any additional amounts in excess of basis would be taxed as a capital gain. Generally, you will treat all capital gains dividends as long-term capital gains regardless of how long you have owned your Units. Unitholders should consult with their individual tax advisors.
2As of the close of business day prior to Initial Date of Deposit. The actual distributions you may receive will vary from the estimated amount due to changes in the Portfolio's fees and expenses, in actual income received by the Portfolio, currency fluctuations and with changes in the Portfolio such as acquisition or liquidation of securities.
3The estimated annual expenses are based upon the estimated trust size for the Portfolio determined as of the initial date of deposit. Because certain of the operating expenses are fixed amounts, if the trust does not reach that estimated size, the amount of the estimated annual expenses per unit may exceed the amounts reflected. On the business day following the end of the initial offering period, the Sponsor and/or the Supervisor will waive their respective fees, and/or the Sponsor will reimburse the Portfolio operating expenses, in an amount so that the total estimated annual expenses calculated on that date do not exceed $0.0350 per unit.However, subsequent to that date the value of the Portfolio as well as the number of outstanding units may decline, and/or the actual amount of the operating expenses may exceed the estimated amounts, any of which could result in the actual amount of the total annual expenses exceeding $0.0350 per unit.


The trust portfolio is provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell the individual securities shown above.



 Important Information About Benchmarks





About risk



There is no assurance the trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit investment trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged and its portfolio is not intended to change during the trust's life except in limited circumstances. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust. The trust should be considered as part of a long-term investment strategy and you should consider your ability to pursue it by investing in successive trusts, if available. You will realize tax consequences associated with investing from one series to the next.
You could experience dilution of your investment if the size of the portfolio is increased as Units are sold. There is no assurance that your investment will maintain its proportionate share in the Portfolio's profits and losses.
The financial condition of an issuer of Securities held by the Trust may worsen or its credit ratings may drop, resulting in a reduction in the value of your Units. This may occur at any point in time, including during the initial offering period.
The Trust is concentrated in securities issued by companies in the financials, health care, consumer discretionary, consumer staples and industrials. Negative developments in these industries will affect the value of your investment more than would be the case in a more diversified investment.
Common stocks do not assure dividend payments. Dividends are paid only when declared by an issuer’s board of directors and the amount of any dividend may vary over time. There can be no guarantee or assurance that companies will declare dividends in the future or that if declared, they will remain at current levels or increase over time.
The Trust may be more sensitive to changes in interest rates than the broader market. The Trust invests significantly in securities issued by financials companies and utilities companies, and, as a result of their potentially higher dividend yield relative to the broader market, the trust may exhibit greater sensitivity to movements in interest rates than the broader market. 
Investing in foreign securities involves certain risks not typically associated with investing solely in the United States. This may magnify volatility due to changes in foreign exchange rates, the political and economic uncertainties in foreign countries, and the potential lack of liquidity, government supervision and regulation.
Central Equity Trust securities are offered by Edward Jones. As described more fully in the prospectus, Edward Jones may have received compensation in other capacities from, or have other relationships with, the issuers of the common stocks held by a Trust. The opinions expressed may change at anytime.

In these cases, returns will not reflect a sales charge if a trust was not actually offered for sale to the public on the first day of the applicable period because units of the trust could not have been purchased by an investor at that time.

Generally, you will treat all capital gains dividends as long-term capital gains regardless of how long you have owned your Units. Unitholders should consult with their individual tax advisors.
2As of the close of business day prior to Initial Date of Deposit. The actual distributions you may receive will vary from the estimated amount due to changes in the Portfolio's fees and expenses, in actual income received by the Portfolio, currency fluctuations and with changes in the Portfolio such as acquisition or liquidation of securities.
3The estimated annual expenses are based upon the estimated trust size for the Portfolio determined as of the initial date of deposit. Because certain of the operating expenses are fixed amounts, if the trust does not reach that estimated size, the amount of the estimated annual expenses per unit may exceed the amounts reflected. On the business day following the end of the initial offering period, the Sponsor and/or the Supervisor will waive their respective fees, and/or the Sponsor will reimburse the Portfolio operating expenses, in an amount so that the total estimated annual expenses calculated on that date do not exceed $0.0350 per unit.However, subsequent to that date the value of the Portfolio as well as the number of outstanding units may decline, and/or the actual amount of the operating expenses may exceed the estimated amounts, any of which could result in the actual amount of the total annual expenses exceeding $0.0350 per unit.

About risk



There is no assurance the trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit investment trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged and its portfolio is not intended to change during the trust's life except in limited circumstances. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust. The trust should be considered as part of a long-term investment strategy and you should consider your ability to pursue it by investing in successive trusts, if available. You will realize tax consequences associated with investing from one series to the next.
You could experience dilution of your investment if the size of the portfolio is increased as Units are sold. There is no assurance that your investment will maintain its proportionate share in the Portfolio's profits and losses.
The financial condition of an issuer of Securities held by the Trust may worsen or its credit ratings may drop, resulting in a reduction in the value of your Units. This may occur at any point in time, including during the initial offering period.
The Trust is concentrated in securities issued by companies in the financials, health care, consumer discretionary, consumer staples and industrials. Negative developments in these industries will affect the value of your investment more than would be the case in a more diversified investment.
Common stocks do not assure dividend payments. Dividends are paid only when declared by an issuer’s board of directors and the amount of any dividend may vary over time. There can be no guarantee or assurance that companies will declare dividends in the future or that if declared, they will remain at current levels or increase over time.
The Trust may be more sensitive to changes in interest rates than the broader market. The Trust invests significantly in securities issued by financials companies and utilities companies, and, as a result of their potentially higher dividend yield relative to the broader market, the trust may exhibit greater sensitivity to movements in interest rates than the broader market. 
Investing in foreign securities involves certain risks not typically associated with investing solely in the United States. This may magnify volatility due to changes in foreign exchange rates, the political and economic uncertainties in foreign countries, and the potential lack of liquidity, government supervision and regulation.
Central Equity Trust securities are offered by Edward Jones. As described more fully in the prospectus, Edward Jones may have received compensation in other capacities from, or have other relationships with, the issuers of the common stocks held by a Trust. The opinions expressed may change at anytime.








1The Portfolio will make distributions of income and capital on each specified Distribution Date to unitholders of record on the preceding Record Date, provided that the total cash held for distribution meets or exceeds any applicable minimum that may be specified in the prospectus. Undistributed income and capital will be distributed on the next Distribution Date in which the total cash held for distribution meets or exceeds any applicable minimum that may be specified in the prospectus.  The Estimated Annual Income per Unit is as of the date listed in the prospectus during the trust's initial offering period, and is updated each calendar quarter thereafter. This amount is based on the most recently declared dividends or interim and final dividends accounting for any foreign withholding taxes, but may also be based upon several recently declared dividends. The actual net annual distributions you receive will vary from the estimate set forth above with changes in the trust's fees and expenses, in dividends and distributions received, currency fluctuations and with the sale of trust securities.
