Utilities

Our Experience
The City of Mishawaka's municipally owned sewage works is working to make a nearly 60-year-old wastewater treatment facility meet federal guidelines of the Clean Water Act.  Umbaugh analyzed various cost scenarios as the utility negotiated with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of Justice and the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) to find a workable solution.

Governmental units are constantly seeking new, better and more cost-effective solutions to the demand for energy and other services. UMBAUGH takes a comprehensive approach that begins with constructing a customized financial plan for your utility. We then effectively and clearly communicate the financial plan to help you get the necessary support to make your plan successful.

Our Services for Utilities
If only it were as simple as turning on a faucet and letting an endless supply of resources flow to customers. But your job as the utility owner gets more difficult every day. Constantly increasing quality standards, new federal mandates and regulatory compliance are just the beginning. When times are good, you must plan ahead to serve more customers to support economic development.  But when customers are closing their doors, you must reduce operations and budgets – and balance good service with rates your customers can afford.
Financial Management – UMBAUGH can make your day-to-day financial management easier with:

Accounting Systems Design, Implementation and Training
Audit Preparation and Financial Reporting
Financial Planning and Budget Assistance
Financial Feasibility Studies
Financial Management Reports
GASB 34 Compliance
Litigation Support Services/Expert Testimony


Negotiating Inter-Governmental Agreements
Performance Management Studies
Privatization Analysis
Studies of Impact and Fairness in Utility Wholesale Charges
Studies Relating to Purchase of Private Utilities by Municipalities
Utility Flow-Through Systems Analysis, Fuel Cost Charges and Tracking
Utility Rate Studies and Cost-of-Service Analysis

Capital Planning – Utilities are capital-intensive. Like most municipal utilities, you may have aging infrastructure and equipment, need to grow and improve services or need to comply with ever-changing federal and state mandates. You need to find the resources to make those things happen.  UMBAUGH can help you with:

Long-Range Capital Planning
Project Planning and Financial Development
Developing and Evaluating Funding Alternatives
Projects Financed by Federal Grants and Loans


Capital Investment Funding Through System Development Charges
Refinancing Existing Debt
Financial Presentations to Elected Officials and the Public

Bond Issuance – Your don’t issue bonds every day, and you’ve got to get it right. The stakes are too high to risk a mistake or miss an opportunity to save. Since UMBAUGH is an independent advisor, our only priority is doing what’s best for the municipal and cooperatively -owned utilities we represent. We can provide:

Official Statements and Bond Sale Preparations
Presentations to Bond Ratings Agencies
Evaluation of Bond Insurance Proposals
Competitive Bond Sales and Electronic Bidding Services


Negotiated Bond Sales and Private Placements
Coordination of Bond Closings
Assistance to the Trustee bank

Post Issuance – Unfortunately, paperwork does not go away after the bonds are sold. You as the bond issuer have a great deal of responsibility for reporting and compliance, at a time when you’d much rather pay attention to your bond-funded project. UMBAUGH can take those worries off your plate as well with:

In-Progress Construction Reports
Arbitrage Rebate Calculations
Continuing Disclosure Filings


Post Issuance Tax Compliance
Escrow Verifications
Parity Reports



Representative Projects
UMBAUGH has completed over a thousand bond issues ranging from $50,000 to over $500 million.

Counties/Townships

Our Experience
"Business as it used to run in the counties can no longer happen," says Ken Paust, county commissioner in Wayne County, Indiana. 
          He's speaking of how local governments in Indiana were affected when property tax caps began taking effect just as a general economic downturn reduced other revenue sources.

Counties and Townships always have challenges and opportunities. You may be looking for, projecting changes in tax revenue, finding new revenue sources, working on long-range planning, funding buildings and improvements, or structuring the most advantageous economic development package. Our years of experience in helping others in similar situations make us uniquely qualified to help you today — and with tomorrow’s challenges.

Our Services for Counties/Townships
Financial Management – No one who works in local government would say that financial management is “simple.”   Your constituents never think about how time consuming your day-to-day tasks are.  Umbaugh can help you with:

Budget Preparation Assistance
Comprehensive Financial Planning
User Fee Development
Fire Territories — Townships


Audit Preparation
CAFR Preparation
Financial Reporting
Tax Revenue Analysis and Management

Capital Planning – Every unit of government has projects that need to be done – and equipment that needs to be upgraded or replaced.

Debt Management Studies
Project Planning and Financial Development
Refinancing of Existing Debt


Long-Range Capital Planning and Implementation
Developing and Evaluating Funding Alternatives
Financial Presentations to Elected Officials and the Public

Bond Issuance – Bond issues are not something you do every day, and you’ve got to get it right. The stakes are literally too high to risk a mistake or miss an opportunity to save. Since Umbaugh is an independent advisor, our only priority is doing what’s best for the local governments we represent. We can provide:

Official Statements and Bond Sale Preparations
Presentations to Bond Ratings Agencies
Evaluation of Bond Insurance Proposals

Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.

Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.

BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry

                    1. Follow federal, state/provincial and local advertising laws.
                

                    2. Abide by the BBB Code of Advertising. Supply, upon request, substantiation for advertising and selling claims. Correct advertising and selling practices, when recommended by BBB.

4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Promptly respond to all complaints forwarded by BBB by: 
1. Resolving the complaint directly with the complainant and notifying BBB, or

                            2. Providing BBB with a response that BBB determines: 

                                    1. is professional,
                                
2. addresses all of the issues raised by the complainant,

                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB. Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed. BBB may consider a business' willingness to participate in recommended dispute resolution options in determining compliance with these standards.
                

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.
                

                    4. Cooperate with BBB in efforts to eliminate the underlying cause of patterns of customer complaints that are identified by BBB.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.
