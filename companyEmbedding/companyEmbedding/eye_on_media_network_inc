(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements.  This quarterly report on Form 10-Q of Eye On Media Network, Inc. for the period ended November 30, 2016 contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ("Exchange Act"), which are intended to be covered by the safe harbors created thereby. To the extent that such statements are not recitations of historical fact, such statements constitute forward-looking statements which, by definition, involve risks and uncertainties. In particular, statements under the Sections: Description of Business, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contain forward-looking statements. Where, in any forward-looking statement, the Company expresses an expectation or belief as to future results or events, such expectation or belief is expressed in good faith and believed to have a reasonable basis, but there can be no assurance that the statement of expectation or belief will result or be achieved or accomplished.  The following are factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those anticipated, and include but are not limited to: general economic, financial and business conditions; changes in and compliance with governmental regulations; changes in tax laws; and the costs and effects of legal proceedings.  You should not rely on forward-looking statements in this quarterly report. This quarterly report contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. We use words such as "anticipates," "believes," "plans," "expects," "future," "intends," and similar expressions to identify these forward-looking statements. Prospective investors should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this report. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements for many reasons, including the risks faced by Eye On Media Network, Inc. Financial information provided in this Form 10-Q, for periods subsequent to August 31, 2016, is preliminary and remains subject to audit. As such, this information is not final or complete, and remains subject to change, possibly materially.  Our Business Overview.  Eye On Media Network, Inc. is a company that was incorporated in the State of Florida on August 2, 2013. Since inception on August 2, 2013, the Company has been engaged in organizational efforts and obtaining initial financing. The Company was formed as a vehicle to pursue a business combination with an existing company. The Company selected August 31 as its fiscal year end. On September 3, 2013 we filed a Registration Statement on Form 10-12G with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. We are a reporting company and file all reports required under sections 13 and 15d of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. On January 22, 2014 we entered into share exchange agreements with the shareholders of Eye On South Florida, Inc. ("EOSF"), pursuant to which we acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of EOSF. EOSF is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of our Company.  Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company  We qualify as an emerging growth company as that term is used in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act. An emerging growth company may take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other burdens that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. These provisions included:  (i) A requirement to have only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related Management Discussion & Analysis disclosures;  (ii) Exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of the emerging growth company's internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;  (iii) Reduced disclosure about the emerging growth company's executive compensation arrangements; and  (iv) No non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements.  Table of Contents  We have already taken advantage of these reduced reporting burdens, which are also available to us as a smaller reporting company as defined under Rule 12b-2of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act").  In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") for complying with new or revised accounting standards. We are choosing to utilize the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(2) of the JOBS Act. This election allows our Company to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.  We could remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a "large accelerated filer" as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (iii) which issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three-year period.  Business of Issuer  The Company was organized as a vehicle to investigate and, if such investigation warrants, acquire a target company or business seeking the perceived advantages of being a publicly held corporation. On January 22, 2014, the Company entered into Share Exchange Agreements (collectively referred to as the "Exchange Agreement") with the shareholders ("Shareholders") of Eye On South Florida, Inc. Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, the Shareholders agreed to exchange each of their shares of EOSF common stock (the "Target Shares") for one (1) share of restricted common stock of the Company. The Shareholders collectively held a total of 24,725,000 Target Shares. The Shareholders are all friends, business associates or family members of our sole officer and director, Jack Namer. Each Shareholder is a sophisticated investor and except as otherwise designated, was a founding member or vendor of EOSF. As of the consummation of the Exchange Agreements, EOSF became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Our principal business activities are now conducted through our operation of EOSF.  Consideration for the Exchange Agreement consisted of one share of restricted common stock of the Company for each Target Share tendered by the Shareholders in the exchange. A total of 24,725,000 shares of restricted Company common stock were issued to forty-three (43) Shareholders for the Target Shares. The receipt of the Target Shares by the Company was determined by the Company Board of Directors to constitute adequate consideration for issuance of the Company common stock as a result of the value of the assets of EOSF. Prior to the execution of the Exchange Agreement there were three million (3,000,000) shares or our common stock issued and outstanding. Upon completion of the transaction involving the Exchange Agreement, there were 27,725,000 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding. The acquisition was accounted for by the Company as a reverse merger wherein an operating, private company (Eye on South Florida, Inc.) was acquired by the Registrant.  Our subsidiary, Eye On South Florida, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Florida on January 18, 2013. EOSF is actively engaged in the acquisition, development, production and distribution of television and multi-media programming content.  EOSF is generating revenue from banner advertisements on our website (www.eyeonsouthflorida.com), commercial productions, event planners, corporate videos, infomercials, public announcements, pay-per-view live broadcasted transmissions and advertisers, desiring to promote their productions, events and brands alongside the various distribution mediums. In addition, the Company is generating revenue from other production companies and/or television networks that request on-site filming and/or our original feeds with the use of our communication technology and equipment.

In addition, these multi-level marketing opportunities will be targeted to both local and national audiences. With more than 180 million households and the backing of Eye On Media Network, Bunji(TM) gives potential advertisers the trust and confidence of an established company and proof of distribution.  Plan of Operation  Our plan of operation for the next twelve months will be to expand our client base. As we continue to grow we will need to raise additional funds. We do anticipate obtaining additional financing to fund operations through common stock offerings, to the extent available, or to obtain additional financing to the extent necessary to augment our working capital. We intend to continue to use the income from our current clients to continue to meet our operating expenses. We do not have need for the purchase of any property or equipment at this time. We will not have any significant changes in the current number of employees.  Our director has verbally agreed to continue to fund our operations as needed over the next 12 months until cash flows are sufficient to sustain operations. Our Plan of Operation for the next twelve months is to raise capital to continue to expand our operations. Although we are not presently engaged in any capital raising activities, we anticipate that we may engage in one or more private offering of our company's securities after the completion of this offering. We would most likely rely upon the transaction exemptions from registration provided by Regulation D, Rule 506 or conduct another private offering under  Table of Contents  While a strategic and wisely executed marketing campaign is key to expanding our customer base; providing new, cutting-edge, innovative strategies developed and implemented for our clients, will provide a solid platform upon which our operations will continue to grow and deliver long-term success. There is no guarantee that we will be able to fund the Company's expenses out of operations. In that case our CEO has agreed to fund the projects. We also will most likely rely upon the transaction exemptions from registration provided by Regulation D, Rule 506 or conduct another private offering under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933.  Results of Operations for the three months ended November 30, 2016 and 2015  Revenues.  Total Revenue. Total revenues for the three months ended November 30, 2016 and 2015 were $10,275 and $10,950, respectively. Revenues were the results of operations.  Expenses.  Total Expenses. Total expenses for the three months ended November 30, 2016 and 2015 were $267,066 and $164,645, respectively. Total expenses included contractor costs of $450 and $7,935, respectively; professional fees of $7,599 and $52,891, respectively; general and administrative of $4,596 and $19,022, respectively; depreciation of $84,797 and $84,797, respectively and impairment of long-lived assets of $169,624 and $0, respectively. Contractor cost decreased by approximately 94%. The primary reason for the decrease was due to a decline in the number of media events the Company participated in and the Company being more proficient in their editing and production process. Professional fees decreased by approximately 86%. This decrease is directly related to operations. General and administrative fees decreased by approximately 76%. This decrease is the result of production cost directly related to operations. Impairment of long-lived assets increased by 100%. This increase is due to the annual testing of long-lived assets and recording impairment for two groups of assets, software and server.  Financial Condition.  Total Assets. Total assets at November 30, 2016 and August 31, 2016 were $739,366 and $993,757, respectively. Total assets consist of cash of $2,101 and $2,071, respectively and property and equipment, net of depreciation in the amount of $737,265 and $991,686, respectively. The property and equipment was acquired through the issuance of stock.  Total Liabilities. Total liabilities at November 30, 2016 and August 31, 2016 were $9,025 and $6,625, respectively. Total liabilities consist entirely of accounts payable.  Liquidity and Capital Resources.  The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern which contemplates, among other things, the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the ordinary course of business.  The Company sustained a loss for the three months ended November 30, 2016 of $256,791 as compared to the loss for the three months ended November 30, 2015 of $153,695. In addition, the Company has an accumulated deficit of $2,232,622 at November 30, 2016. Because of the absence of positive cash flows from operations, the Company will require additional funding for continuing the development and marketing of products. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.  We are presently unable to meet our obligations as they come due. At November 30, 2016, we had a working capital deficit of $6,924. Our working capital deficit is due to operations.  Net cash used in operating activities for the three months ended November 30, 2016 and 2015 was $30 and ($65,073), respectively. Net cash used in operating activities is our net loss, less depreciation and amortization, impairment of long-lived assets, and further adjusted by increases and decreases in certain assets and liabilities. Cash for operating activities was provided by operating activities.  Table of Contents  Net cash provided by financing activities for the three months ended November 30, 2016 and 2015 was $0 and $105,000, respectively. Net cash provided by financing for the three months ended November 30, 2016 included proceeds from the issuance of common stock of $0. Net cash provided by financing for the three months ended November 30, 2015 included proceeds from the issuance of common stock of $105,000.  We anticipate that our future liquidity requirements will arise from the need to fund our growth from operations, pay current obligations and future capital expenditures. The primary sources of funding for such requirements are expected to be cash generated from operations and raising additional funds from the private sources and/or debt financing. However, we can provide no assurances that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations and/or obtain additional financing on terms satisfactory to us, if at all, to remain a going concern. Our continuation as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our obligations on a timely basis and ultimately to attain profitability. Our Plan of Operation for the next twelve months is to raise capital to continue to expand our operations and to seek merger candidates and/or acquisitions. Although we are not presently engaged in any capital raising activities, we anticipate that we may engage in one or more private offering of our company's securities. We would most likely rely upon the transaction exemptions from registration provided by Regulation D, Rule 506 or conduct another private offering under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933. See "Note 2 - Going Concern" in our financial statements for additional information as to the possibility that we may not be able to continue as a "going concern."  We have no known demands or commitments and are not aware of any events or uncertainties that will result in or that are reasonably likely to materially increase or decrease our current liquidity.  We are not aware of any trends or known demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that will result in or that are reasonably likely to result in material increases or decreases in liquidity.  We had no material commitments for capital expenditures as of November 30, 2016.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements.  We have made no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.

	Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements


	For the period ended November 30, 2016


	(Unaudited)


	 



	NOTE 1: NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION





	 


	EYE ON MEDIA NETWORK INC. (“EYE” or the “Company”) was incorporated in Florida on August 2, 2013, with an objective to acquire, or merge with, an operating business. On January 22, 2014 the Company acquired an operating company, Eye on South Florida in a reverse merger.


	 


	Eye on South Florida, Inc. (EOSF), a corporation, was chartered in the State of Florida on January 18, 2013 as a media organization for the purpose of providing television services as an independent producer and distributor of television programming locally and nationally. The programming is based on content that is produced and filmed in South Florida, on subjects that are relevant to the South Florida area.


	 


	As of January 22, 2014, the Company is in the business of providing television services to areas around the state and the country.


	 


	These consolidated conensed financial statements include the activity of Eye on South Florida from inception (January 18, 2013) and the activity of Eye on Media Network as of January 22, 2014, the date of the reverse merger. The balance sheet as of November 30, 2016 and August 31, 2016 contains the combined accounts both companies.


	 


	All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been elimminated in consolidation.


	 



	NOTE 2


	: GOING CONCERN



	 


	The Company’s consolidated financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating cost and allow it to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced, to cease operations.


	 


	In order to continue as a going concern, the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Management’s plan to obtain such resources for the Company include, obtaining capital from management and significant stockholders sufficient to meet its minimal operating expenses. However, management cannot provide any assurance that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans.


	 


	There is no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain sufficient additional funds when needed or that such funds, if available will be obtainable on terms satisfactory to the Company. In addition, profitability will ultimately depend upon the level of revenues received from business operations. However, there is no assurance that the Company will attain profitability. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.

	Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements


	For the period ended November 30, 2016


	(Unaudited)


	 



	NOTE


	3: SUMMARY OF


	SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES



	 




	Unaudited Interim Financial Statements




	 


	The accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Regulation S-X. Accordingly, the financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. The interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the annual financial statements included in the Form 10K as of August 31, 2016 and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 14, 2016. 


	 


	In the opinion of management, all adjustments consisting of normal recurring entries necessary for a fair statement of the periods presented for: (a) the financial position; (b) the result of operations; and (c) cash flows, have been made in order to make the financial statements presented not misleading. The results of operations for such interim periods are not necessarily indicative of operations for a full year.


	 




	Basis of Presentation and Use of Estimates




	 


	The Company prepares its consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"), which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.


	 




	Fiscal Year End






	 


	The Company elected August 31 as its fiscal year ending date.


	 




	Cash and Cash Equivalents




	 


	The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of acquisition to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $2,101 at November 30, 2016 and $2,071 at August 31, 2016.


	 


	Credit risk associated with cash deposits are insured under FDIC up to $250,000 per depositor, per FDIC insured bank, per ownership category. At such time, as the Company’s cash deposits exceed FDIC limits, the Company will reassess their credit risk.


	 




	Cash Flows Reporting




	 


	The Company follows ASC 230, Statement of Cash Flows, for cash flows reporting, classifies cash receipts and payments according to whether they stem from operating, investing, or financing activities and provides definitions of each category, and uses the indirect or reconciliation method (“Indirect method”) as defined by ASC 230, Statement of Cash Flows, to report net cash flow from operating activities by adjusting net income to reconcile it to net cash flow from operating activities by removing the effects of (a) all deferrals of past operating cash receipts and payments and all accruals of expected future operating cash receipts and payments and (b) all items that are included in net income that do not affect operating cash receipts and payments


	 




	Financial Instruments




	 


	The Company’s balance sheet includes certain financial instruments, including cash and accounts payable. The carrying amounts of current assets and current liabilities approximate their fair value because of the relatively short period of time between the origination of these instruments and their expected realization.

	(Unaudited)


	 


	ASC 820,

	Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures

	, defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between (1) market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs) and (2) an entity’s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances (unobservable inputs). The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels, which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:


	 









	Level 1




	Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities.


	 








	Level 2




	Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (e.g., interest rates); and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.


	 








	Level 3




	Inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable.





	 


	Fair value estimates discussed herein are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management as of November 30, 2016. The respective carrying value of certain on-balance-sheet financial instruments approximated their fair values due to the short-term nature of these instruments.


	 




	Revenue Recognition








	 


	The Company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned.


	 


	The Company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met:




	 











	o




	persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists










	 








	o




	the product has been shipped or the services have been rendered to the customer










	 








	o




	the sales price is fixed or determinable










	 








	o




	collectability is reasonably assured.





	 


	The Company generates revenue through four processes: (1) Media Production, (2) Commercial Production, Distribution and (3) Advertising Sales and Distribution (4) Live Broadcasting of Events.


	 










	·





	Revenue for media production of original content. The company recognizes a sale when the production is completed and ready for distribution. The burden of distribution and risk of loss has passed to the customer.










	 









	·





	Revenue for production of television grade HD Commercials. Revenue is recognized when the services have been performed and passed on to the customer.










	 









	·





	Revenue for distribution of commercials and content service fees is recognized ratably over the term of the advertising agreement.










	 









	·





	Revenue for live broadcasting of original content. The company recognizes a sale when the live broadcast / production is contracted and completed. The burden of distribution and risk of loss has passed to the customer.





	 






	Property and Equipment








	 


	Property and equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation is computed by the straight-line method over estimated useful lives.


	 


	Long-lived assets such as property, equipment and identifiable intangibles are reviewed for impairment at least annually or whenever facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. When required, impairment losses on assets to be held and used are recognized based on the fair value of the asset. The fair value is determined based on estimates of future cash flows, market value of similar assets, if available, or independent appraisals, if required. If the carrying amount of the long-lived asset is not recoverable, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset. The Company recognized impairment losses of $169,624 and $0 for the periods ending November 30, 2016 and August 31, 2016, respectively.

	Deferred Income Taxes and Valuation Allowance








	 


	The Company accounts for income taxes under ASC 740,

	Income Taxes

	. Under the asset and liability method of ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period the enactment occurs. A valuation allowance is provided for certain deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize tax assets through future operations. No deferred tax assets or liabilities were recognized as of November 30, 2016.


	 




	Net Income (Loss) Per Common Share








	 


	Net income (loss) per share is calculated in accordance with ASC 260, “Earnings Per Share.” The weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during each period is used to compute basic earning or loss per share. Diluted earnings or loss per share is computed using the weighted average number of shares and diluted potential common shares outstanding. Dilutive potential common shares are additional common shares assumed to be exercised.


	 


	Basic net income (loss) per common share is based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding at November 30, 2016. At November 30, 2016, there were 50,000,000 of preferred convertible shares that were not included because they would be anti-dilutive.


	 




	Share-Based Expense








	 


	ASC 718,

	Compensation - Stock Compensation

	, prescribes accounting and reporting standards for all share-based payment transactions in which employee services are acquired. Transactions include incurring liabilities, or issuing or offering to issue shares, options, and other equity instruments such as employee stock ownership plans and stock appreciation rights. Share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, are recognized as compensation expense in the financial statements based on their fair values. That expense is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award, known as the requisite service period (usually the vesting period).


	 


	The Company accounts for stock-based compensation issued to non-employees and consultants in accordance with the provisions of ASC 505-50,

	Equity - Based Payments to Non-Employees.

	Measurement of share-based payment transactions with non-employees is based on the fair value of whichever is more reliably measurable:(a) the goods or services received; or (b) the equity instruments issued. The fair value of the share-based payment transaction is determined at the earlier of performance commitment date or performance completion date.


	 


	Share-based expense for the three months ended November 30, 2016 and 2015 was $0 and $0, respectively.


	 




	Recent Accounting Pronouncements










	 


	From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued that we adopt as of the specified effective date. We believe that the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective may have an impact on our results of operations and financial statements.


	 


	ASU Update 2014-09

	Revenue from Contracts with Customers

	(Topic 606) issued May 28, 2014 by FASB and IASB converged guidance on recognizing revenue in contracts with customers on an effective date after December 31, 2017 will be evaluated as to impact and implemented accordingly.


	 


	ASU Update 2014-15

	Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern

	(Sub Topic 205-40) issued August 27, 2014 by FASB defines management’s responsibility to evaluate whether there is a substantial doubt about an organization’s ability to continue as a going concern. The additional disclosure required is effective after December 31, 2016 and will be evaluated as to impact and implemented accordingly.

	Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations




	 



	Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements.



	 


	This quarterly report on Form 10-Q of Eye On Media Network, Inc. for the period ended November 30, 2016 contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”), which are intended to be covered by the safe harbors created thereby. To the extent that such statements are not recitations of historical fact, such statements constitute forward-looking statements which, by definition, involve risks and uncertainties. In particular, statements under the Sections: Description of Business, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contain forward-looking statements. Where, in any forward-looking statement, the Company expresses an expectation or belief as to future results or events, such expectation or belief is expressed in good faith and believed to have a reasonable basis, but there can be no assurance that the statement of expectation or belief will result or be achieved or accomplished.


	 


	The following are factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those anticipated, and include but are not limited to: general economic, financial and business conditions; changes in and compliance with governmental regulations; changes in tax laws; and the costs and effects of legal proceedings.


	 


	You should not rely on forward-looking statements in this quarterly report. This quarterly report contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. We use words such as “anticipates,” “believes,” “plans,” “expects,” “future,” “intends,” and similar expressions to identify these forward-looking statements. Prospective investors should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this report. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements for many reasons, including the risks faced by Eye On Media Network, Inc. Financial information provided in this Form 10-Q, for periods subsequent to August 31, 2016, is preliminary and remains subject to audit. As such, this information is not final or complete, and remains subject to change, possibly materially.


	 




	Our Business Overview.




	 


	Eye On Media Network, Inc. is a company that was incorporated in the State of Florida on August 2, 2013. Since inception on August 2, 2013, the Company has been engaged in organizational efforts and obtaining initial financing. The Company was formed as a vehicle to pursue a business combination with an existing company. The Company selected August 31 as its fiscal year end. On September 3, 2013 we filed a Registration Statement on Form 10-12G with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. We are a reporting company and file all reports required under sections 13 and 15d of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. On January 22, 2014 we entered into share exchange agreements with the shareholders of Eye On South Florida, Inc. (“EOSF”), pursuant to which we acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of EOSF. EOSF is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of our Company.


	 




	Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company




	 


	We qualify as an emerging growth company as that term is used in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act. An emerging growth company may take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other burdens that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. These provisions included:


	 









	(i)




	A requirement to have only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related Management Discussion & Analysis disclosures;










	 








	(ii)




	Exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of the emerging growth company’s internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;










	 








	(iii)




	Reduced disclosure about the emerging growth company’s executive compensation arrangements; and










	 








	(iv)




	No non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements.





	  






	 




	12














	Table of Contents





	 


	We have already taken advantage of these reduced reporting burdens, which are also available to us as a smaller reporting company as defined under Rule 12b-2of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).


	 


	In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) for complying with new or revised accounting standards. We are choosing to utilize the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(2) of the JOBS Act. This election allows our Company to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.


	 


	We could remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (iii) which issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three-year period.


	 




	Business of Issuer




	 


	The Company was organized as a vehicle to investigate and, if such investigation warrants, acquire a target company or business seeking the perceived advantages of being a publicly held corporation. On January 22, 2014, the Company entered into Share Exchange Agreements (collectively referred to as the “Exchange Agreement”) with the shareholders (“Shareholders”) of Eye On South Florida, Inc. Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, the Shareholders agreed to exchange each of their shares of EOSF common stock (the “Target Shares”) for one (1) share of restricted common stock of the Company. The Shareholders collectively held a total of 24,725,000 Target Shares. The Shareholders are all friends, business associates or family members of our sole officer and director, Jack Namer. Each Shareholder is a sophisticated investor and except as otherwise designated, was a founding member or vendor of EOSF. As of the consummation of the Exchange Agreements, EOSF became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Our principal business activities are now conducted through our operation of EOSF.


	 


	Consideration for the Exchange Agreement consisted of one share of restricted common stock of the Company for each Target Share tendered by the Shareholders in the exchange. A total of 24,725,000 shares of restricted Company common stock were issued to forty-three (43) Shareholders for the Target Shares. The receipt of the Target Shares by the Company was determined by the Company Board of Directors to constitute adequate consideration for issuance of the Company common stock as a result of the value of the assets of EOSF. Prior to the execution of the Exchange Agreement there were three million (3,000,000) shares or our common stock issued and outstanding. Upon completion of the transaction involving the Exchange Agreement, there were 27,725,000 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding.

	Plan of Operation




	 


	Our plan of operation for the next twelve months will be to expand our client base. As we continue to grow we will need to raise additional funds. We do anticipate obtaining additional financing to fund operations through common stock offerings, to the extent available, or to obtain additional financing to the extent necessary to augment our working capital. We intend to continue to use the income from our current clients to continue to meet our operating expenses. We do not have need for the purchase of any property or equipment at this time. We will not have any significant changes in the current number of employees.


	 


	Our director has verbally agreed to continue to fund our operations as needed over the next 12 months until cash flows are sufficient to sustain operations. Our Plan of Operation for the next twelve months is to raise capital to continue to expand our operations. Although we are not presently engaged in any capital raising activities, we anticipate that we may engage in one or more private offering of our company’s securities after the completion of this offering. We would most likely rely upon the transaction exemptions from registration provided by Regulation D, Rule 506 or conduct another private offering under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933. See “Note 2 - Going Concern” in our financial statements for additional information as to the possibility that we may not be able to continue as a “going concern.”

	While a strategic and wisely executed marketing campaign is key to expanding our customer base; providing new, cutting-edge, innovative strategies developed and implemented for our clients, will provide a solid platform upon which our operations will continue to grow and deliver long-term success. There is no guarantee that we will be able to fund the Company’s expenses out of operations. In that case our CEO has agreed to fund the projects. We also will most likely rely upon the transaction exemptions from registration provided by Regulation D, Rule 506 or conduct another private offering under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933.


	 




	Results of Operations for




	the three months




	ended




	November 30,




	201




	6 and 2015








	 




	Revenues.






	 



	Total Revenue.

	Total revenues for the three months ended November 30, 2016 and 2015 were $10,275 and $10,950, respectively. Revenues were the results of operations.


	 




	Expenses.






	 



	Total Expenses.

	Total expenses for the three months ended November 30, 2016 and 2015 were $267,066 and $164,645, respectively. Total expenses included contractor costs of $450 and $7,935, respectively; professional fees of $7,599 and $52,891, respectively; general and administrative of $4,596 and $19,022, respectively; depreciation of $84,797 and $84,797, respectively and impairment of long-lived assets of $169,624 and $0, respectively. Contractor cost decreased by approximately 94%. The primary reason for the decrease was due to a decline in the number of media events the Company participated in and the Company being more proficient in their editing and production process. Professional fees decreased by approximately 86%. This decrease is directly related to operations. General and administrative fees decreased by approximately 76%. This decrease is the result of production cost directly related to operations. Impairment of long-lived assets increased by 100%. This increase is due to the annual testing of long-lived assets and recording impairment for two groups of assets, software and server.


	 




	Financial Condition.






	 



	Total Assets.

	Total assets at November 30, 2016 and August 31, 2016 were $739,366 and $993,757, respectively. Total assets consist of cash of $2,101 and $2,071, respectively and property and equipment, net of depreciation in the amount of $737,265 and $991,686, respectively. The property and equipment was acquired through the issuance of stock.


	 



	Total Liabilities.

	Total liabilities at November 30, 2016 and August 31, 2016 were $9,025 and $6,625, respectively. Total liabilities consist entirely of accounts payable.


	 




	Liquidity and Capital Resources.






	 


	The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern which contemplates, among other things, the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the ordinary course of business.


	 


	The Company sustained a loss for the three months ended November 30, 2016 of $256,791 as compared to the loss for the three months ended November 30, 2015 of $153,695. In addition, the Company has an accumulated deficit of $2,232,622 at November 30, 2016. Because of the absence of positive cash flows from operations, the Company will require additional funding for continuing the development and marketing of products. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.


	 


	We are presently unable to meet our obligations as they come due. At November 30, 2016, we had a working capital deficit of $6,924. Our working capital deficit is due to operations.


	 


	Net cash used in operating activities for the three months ended November 30, 2016 and 2015 was $30 and ($65,073), respectively. Net cash used in operating activities is our net loss, less depreciation and amortization, impairment of long-lived assets, and further adjusted by increases and decreases in certain assets and liabilities. Cash for operating activities was provided by operating activities.

	Table of Contents





	 


	Net cash provided by financing activities for the three months ended November 30, 2016 and 2015 was $0 and $105,000, respectively. Net cash provided by financing for the three months ended November 30, 2016 included proceeds from the issuance of common stock of $0. Net cash provided by financing for the three months ended November 30, 2015 included proceeds from the issuance of common stock of $105,000.


	 


	We anticipate that our future liquidity requirements will arise from the need to fund our growth from operations, pay current obligations and future capital expenditures. The primary sources of funding for such requirements are expected to be cash generated from operations and raising additional funds from the private sources and/or debt financing. However, we can provide no assurances that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations and/or obtain additional financing on terms satisfactory to us, if at all, to remain a going concern. Our continuation as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our obligations on a timely basis and ultimately to attain profitability. Our Plan of Operation for the next twelve months is to raise capital to continue to expand our operations and to seek merger candidates and/or acquisitions. Although we are not presently engaged in any capital raising activities, we anticipate that we may engage in one or more private offering of our company’s securities. We would most likely rely upon the transaction exemptions from registration provided by Regulation D, Rule 506 or conduct another private offering under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933. See “Note 2 - Going Concern” in our financial statements for additional information as to the possibility that we may not be able to continue as a “going concern.”


	 


	We have no known demands or commitments and are not aware of any events or uncertainties that will result in or that are reasonably likely to materially increase or decrease our current liquidity.


	 


	We are not aware of any trends or known demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that will result in or that are reasonably likely to result in material increases or decreases in liquidity.


	 


	We had no material commitments for capital expenditures as of November 30, 2016.


	 




	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements.




	 


	We have made no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.



	 






	Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.




	 


	We are a Smaller Reporting Company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide the information under this item.



	 






	Item 4. Controls and Procedures

	.



	 




	Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures.




	 


	The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate disclosure controls and procedures. The Company’s disclosure controls and procedures is a process designed under the supervision of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Company’s financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.


	 


	With respect to the period ending November 30, 2016, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operations of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.


	 


	Based upon our evaluation regarding the period ending November 30, 2016, the Company’s management, including its Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, has concluded that its disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the Company’s limited internal resources and lack of ability to have multiple levels of transaction review. Material weaknesses noted are lack of an audit committee, lack of a majority of outside directors on the board of directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; and management is dominated by two individuals, without adequate compensating controls. Through the use of external consultants and the review process, management believes that the financial statements and other information presented herewith are materially correct.


	 




	Changes in internal control over financial reporting




	 


	We have not made any significant changes to our internal controls subsequent to the Evaluation Date. We have not identified any significant deficiencies or material weaknesses or other factors that could significantly affect these controls, and therefore, no corrective action was taken.

Eye On Media Network, Inc. (OTC: EOMN) News -
May 3, 2017
 


EYE ON MEDIA NETWORK TO LAUNCH 
“PLANET 411” FOR FLORIDA ATLANTIC UNIVERSITY






FORT LAUDERDALE, FL -- MAY 3, 2017-- Eye-On-Media 
Network, Inc., (OTC PINK: 
EOMN) a South Florida-based digital (IPTV) television production and 
distribution company, announces a partnership with Florida Atlantic University (FAU 
Pine Jog) to launch Planet 411. Planet 411 is a 24/7, personalized online 
digital media and broadcasting channel customized to highlight the nation’s 
environmental challenges. 

“FAU will be the gateway to launch additional channels with universities, 
nonprofit organizations, school systems, community groups, and municipalities,” 
said Jack Namer, CEO of EOMN. “The ‘Powered by BUNJI’ Platform is the 
cornerstone of Eye On Media Network’s OTT/IPTV network and distribution and will 
play a large part in the introduction of Planet 411.”

With a universe of over 4,000 colleges and universities, EOMN’s target is to 
secure just 1% of the college market in the first year, which is projected at 
over $1,750,000 in revenue. With the inclusion of other community groups, 
schools and other individuals or companies that want to have their own channel, 
actual revenue could be 3 to 4 times that in the first year.

“BUNJI will be the rebranding name of EOMN, and ‘Powered by BUNJI’ will be the 
industry leader for content distribution,” Namer said.

ABOUT FLORIDA ATLANTIC UNIVERSITY: Florida Atlantic University engages in 
research, education, and the development of engineered solutions to benefit the 
natural world. South Florida is an environmental “ground zero” destined for 
catastrophic effects if allowed to continue on its current path of development. 
FAU is proud to be one of the largest schools in Florida and around the country, 
with over 30,000 students attending from all parts of the world. 

ABOUT PLANET 411: “Sea level rise, climate change, poor water and air quality, 
increasing solid waste, the loss of habitat, destruction of the Everglades, 
toxic algal blooms, coastal degradation, and reef breakdown are just some of the 
challenges we’re facing,” said Ray Coleman, Executive Director of FAU Pine Jog. 
“The list continues to grow as an ever increasing population jams into an 
already crowded land mass.” Forbes magazine recently identified America’s 
fastest growing cities for 2017, and eight of the top 15 cities are in Florida, 
underscoring Florida census data that about 1,000 people per day move to the 
Sunshine State. Planet 411 will expose and explain these life-threatening issues 
when it goes live on June 1, 2017 at http://www.Planet411.org.

WHY “PLANET 411”: Research underscores the steady trend: Internet TV viewing, 
particularly among young people, is dramatically rising, dealing a blow to cable 
and broadcast. With the backing of Eye On Media Network, Inc., a publicly traded 
company with access to more than 180 million households, FAU and our national 
partners will have a fluid platform on which to share the realities of the 
status of our natural world. 

Planet 411 organizers are currently recruiting national content partners 
consisting of nonprofit organizations, universities, school systems, community 
groups and municipalities.

About Eye On Media Network, Inc.:

About Us

Eye On South Florida (EOSF) TELEVISION NETWORK, is here to set a new stage in 
the ever-changing network television, satellite, cable, web, and mobile 
applications world of broadcasting, marketing and distribution, to provide, 
uncontrolled news and real stories of society that connects, communicates, 
entertains and creates social community hope and positive change for the NOW and 
FUTURE generations.
The Networks’ approach is unique and has an advantage in the marketplace because 
of the valuable airtime that is being provided by each channel pro bono to help 
raise awareness and funds for charitable organizations in each community, 
raising the bar on feel good programming that is conducive and positive to 
society at large, unlike other channels that flood the screens at home with 
content that involves violence, sex, drugs and evil. When it comes to children 
and youth, who look to listen to all mediums as a form of learning and 
visualizing the world and all things in it, communicators must be responsible 
and ensure that what their communicating is conducive to the wellbeing of 
mankind. EOSF will not compete for negative energy that is transmitted daily, 
via other frequencies. Instead, EOSF wishes to communicate positive news and 
entertainment via the many frequencies owned and operated in the United States.
A critical factor in the production of content is that the team understands that 
television, technology, new trends in marketing, social media advertising, the 
World Wide Web, video games and the big screens are playing the biggest role in 
molding our kids. EOSF feels it is their moral duty and obligation as 
communicators to transmit positive information and content that is focused on 
news and entertainment that is not only fun, but also educates and delivers what 
is right for the people, instead of what is wrong!
The Network vows to roll out programming that invokes safety on all levels. 
Programming is smart with moral family values, modeled after a bygone era of 
Television, where it was safe for our children to watch TV. Interactive 
educational programs that help to empower the audiences are at the top of the 
list at EOSF. The Network is open to produce reality, comedy, drama, talk, news, 
live variety shows and even produce and distribute indie films from independent 
producers looking for a window to broadcast their content, as long as they are 
giving back to the community something that is worthy of their viewing and 
entertainment. EOSF’s mission is to help groom the future of communication with 
less gloom, while helping to promote the beautiful essence of the arts, music, 
theater, education, lifestyle, tourism, nutrition and all things good that can 
create generations of successful community leaders that enjoy healthy living.
EOSF is in its 2nd year of operation and the introductory stage has been very 
well received by the market. Due to the Networks’ proven track record with Eye 
On South Florida’s’ Channel 16, test.www.eyeonsouthflorida.com negotiations with 
cable operators are currently underway. The advantage points are focused on 
keeping an EYE on new trends and all things good, while exposing what is not 
good and potentially dangerous or hazardous in each community. Creating a window 
of opportunity for important information and positive news and entertainment 
content to flow… attracting special interest groups and advertisers. Keeping an 
Eye On all things that main stream media does not, will help position EOSF to 
compete with other main stream media companies like FOX.
The standard of excellence will continue to revolve around the EYE ON brand in 
each community, which has become the driving force within each channel. Keeping 
an EYE ON all things that matter in a community is important and each station 
plans to transmit the type of content that is relevant to local news and 
entertainment, as well as national and international. The idea is to create a 
powerful stage capable of carrying the weight that comes from positive 
programming and continue to keep an EYE ON the Scene of all things “GOOD”, 
producing content worthy of broadcasting and then leave a legacy behind for many 
generations to follow.

distribution outlet for the type of senseless productions, which have captivated 
our youth and has created undesirable cultures by promoting undesirable content.

We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the common stock offered 
through this Prospectus by the selling shareholders.


We compete with similar enterprises in our areas of operation. Our competitors 
may expand or construct sales systems and associated infrastructure that would 
create additional competition for the services we provide to our customers. Our 
ability to renew or replace existing contracts with our customers at rates 
sufficient to maintain current revenue and cash flows could be adversely 
affected by the activities of our competitors and our customers. Uncertainty 
and possible adverse publicity may make us more susceptible to the loss of 
customers to our competitors. All of these competitive pressures could have a 
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial 
condition.

 Special
Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements.

 

This
annual report on Form 10-K of Eye On Media Network, Inc.
(“EOMN”) for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016
contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of
Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section
21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which are
intended to be covered by the safe harbors created thereby. To the
extent that such statements are not recitations of historical fact,
such statements constitute forward-looking statements which, by
definition involve risks and uncertainties. In particular,
statements under the Sections; Description of Business,
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations contain forward-looking statements. Where
in any forward-looking statements, the Company expresses an
expectation or belief as to future results or events, such
expectation or belief is expressed in good faith and believed to
have a reasonable basis, but there can be no assurance that the
statement of expectation or belief will result or be achieved or
accomplished.

 

The
following are factors that could cause actual results or events to
differ materially from those anticipated, and include but are not
limited to: general economic, financial and business conditions;
changes in and compliance with governmental regulations; changes in
tax laws; and the cost and effects of legal
proceedings.

 

You should
not rely on forward looking statements in this annual report. This
annual report contains forward-looking statements that involve
risks and uncertainties. We use words such as
“anticipates,” “believes,”
“plans,” “expects,” “future,”
“intends,” and similar expressions to identify these
forward-looking statements. Prospective investors should not place
undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which apply
only as of the date of this annual report. Our actual results could
differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking
statements for many reasons, including the risks faced by Eye On
Media Network, Inc.

 PART
I

 


 Item 1.
Business.

 

Eye On
Media Network, Inc. (“we”, “us”,
“our”, or the “Company”) is a company that
was incorporated in the State of Florida on August 2, 2013. Since
inception on August 2, 2013, the Company has been engaged in
organizational efforts and obtaining initial financing. The Company
was formed as a vehicle to pursue a business combination with an
existing company. The business purpose of the Company had been to
seek the acquisition of or merger with, an existing company. The
Company selected August 31 as its fiscal year end. On September 3,
2013 we filed a Registration Statement on Form 10-12G with the
United States Securities and Exchange Commission. We are a
reporting company and file all reports required under sections 13
and 15d of the Exchange Act. On January 22, 2014 we entered into
share exchange agreements with the shareholders of Eye On South
Florida, Inc. (“EOSF”), pursuant to which we acquired
all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of EOSF. EOSF is
now a wholly-owned subsidiary of our Company.

 

Implications
of Being an Emerging Growth Company

 

We qualify
as an emerging growth company as that term is used in the Jumpstart
Our Business Startups Act. An emerging growth company may take
advantage of specified reduced reporting and other burdens that are
otherwise applicable generally to public companies. These
provisions included:

 

  




 



(i)



A
requirement to have only two years of audited financial statements
and only two years of related Management Discussion & Analysis
disclosures;





 



 



 





 



(ii)



Exemption
from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of the
emerging growth company’s internal control over financial
reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002;





 



 



 





 



(iii)



Reduced
disclosure about the emerging growth company’s executive
compensation arrangements; and





 



 



 





 



(iv)



No
non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden
parachute arrangements.




 

 

We have
already taken advantage of these reduced reporting burdens, which
are also available to us as a smaller reporting company as defined
under Rule 12b-2of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the “Exchange Act”).

 

In
addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an
emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended
transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) for
complying with new or revised accounting standards. We are choosing
to utilize the extended transition period for complying with new or
revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(2) of the JOBS
Act. This election allows our Company to delay the adoption of new
or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates
for public and private companies until those standards apply to
private companies. As a result of this election, our financial
statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with
public company effective dates.

 

We could
remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, or until
the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which
our annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (ii) the date that we
become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule
12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value
of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700
million as of the last business day of our most recently completed
second fiscal quarter, or (iii) which issued more than $1 billion
in non-convertible debt during the preceding three-year
period.

Business
of Issuer

 

The
Company was organized as a vehicle to investigate and, if such
investigation warrants, acquire a target company or business
seeking the perceived advantages of being a publicly held
corporation. On January 22, 2014, the Company entered into Share
Exchange Agreements (collectively referred to as the
“Exchange Agreement”) with the shareholders
(“Shareholders”) of Eye On South Florida, Inc. Pursuant
to the Exchange Agreement, the Shareholders agreed to exchange each
of their shares of EOSF common stock (the “Target
Shares”) for one (1) share of restricted common stock of the
Company. The Shareholders collectively held a total of 24,725,000
Target Shares. The Shareholders are all friends, business
associates or family members of our sole officer and director, Jack
Namer. Each Shareholder is a sophisticated investor and except as
otherwise designated, was a founding member or vendor of EOSF. As
of the consummation of the Exchange Agreements, EOSF became a
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Our principal business
activities are now conducted through our operation of

for the Exchange Agreement consisted of one share of restricted
common stock of the Company for each Target Share tendered by the
Shareholders in the exchange. A total of 24,725,000 shares of
restricted Company common stock were issued to forty-three (43)
Shareholders for the Target Shares. The receipt of the Target
Shares by the Company was determined by the Company Board of
Directors to constitute adequate consideration for issuance of the
Company common stock as a result of the value of the assets of
EOSF. Prior to the execution of the Exchange Agreement there were
three million (3,000,000) shares or our common stock issued and
outstanding. Upon completion of the transaction involving the
Exchange Agreement, there were 27,725,000 shares of our common
stock issued and outstanding. The acquisition was accounted for by
the Company as a reverse merger wherein an operating, private
company (Eye on South Florida, Inc.) was acquired by the
Registrant.

EOSF is
generating revenue from banner advertisements on our website
(www.eyeonsouthflorida.com), commercial productions, event
planners, corporate videos, infomercials, public announcements,
pay-per-view live broadcasted transmissions and advertisers,
desiring to promote their productions, events and brands alongside
the various distribution mediums, whereby content is being aired
and/or shared via any and all mediums that the network controls. In
addition, the Company is generating revenue from other production
companies and/or television networks that request on-site filming
and/or our original feeds with the use of our communication
technology and equipment. Among these types of programming is
“feel good” programming and transmission that we
produce and other stations want, due to the type of news and
entertainment in the community that we promote. Eye On South
Florida has been assisting and providing valuable airtime pro-bono
to non-profit organizations with sponsored ads, in order to promote
their fund raising events for important causes in the community.
Some of our clients currently include Hard Rock Hotel & Casino,
AutoNation, Florida Metro Rail, Fort Lauderdale Chamber of
Commerce, Shino Bay Dermatology, DelVecchio Pizza and Universal
Insurance.

 

The EOSF
Network is producing and distributing original news as it unfolds,
along with live and live on tape entertainment programming specials
and content that delivers what main stream does not, to include
informative educational programming for people of all ages in the
community, by way of all its vertically integrated communication
mediums. Other sources of revenue such as branded merchandising
and/or licensing fees derived from sharing original programming
content with other affiliate TV and Satellite stations are being
considered.

 

EOSF
distribution platforms include conventional network television,
over the air digital, cable television, as well as satellite
networks. Our technology of simulcasting, delivers content to all
mediums, e.g.: web, mobile phones, tablets and any smart device
with 4G or wireless connectivity, thus providing a wide array of
original content programming, news, marketing merchandising,
advertising and distribution.

 

Each EOSF
medium has its own advertising rates and revenue models, depending
on the production clients’ and advertisers’ preferred
demographics and target markets. In addition, EOSF will seek to
receive licensure fees from the use of any technology that is
sub-contracted under a co-production agreement, coupled with
ongoing royalties from original programming and merchandising that
the network negotiates and sells via any and all mediums that the
network controls. Pay-Per-View, live streaming productions are
another source of revenue for EOSF and each transmission, utilizing
all of our tools and solutions that will be marketed and promoted
for optimum results.

 

The EOSF
television and multi-media content development and production slate
will be financed by the revenues derived from its own media
content, commercial production services, advertiser’s
revenues, licensing fees and distribution capabilities. Additional
revenue will be derived through selling programming and developing
quality productions whether originally produced, or co-produced
with other producers and clients interested in producing their own
content for distribution in any of the EOSF Television &
Multi-Media mediums that the Network controls.

 

The
business is developing programming which we believe will provide
all of the necessary capital for the development of our projects.
Upon receiving the necessary capital, the business will be able to
operate at the current demand level as well as continue to produce
programming, according to comprehensive budgets and be able to
solicit advertisers to participate in versatile mediums in return
for multiple revenue streams. Each of our productions, whether
consisting of commercials or programming of any kind, has a
separate financial budget. Each production leverages this business
value and generates more capital for ongoing operations of the
Company.

 

EOSF
management wants to ensure that it develops the proper content for
the proper advertisers and distribution channels, before it heavily
engages in the production of original programming for this
business. In the meantime, the EOSF Network is currently airing
content 24/7 in all of the channels that the Network currently
controls including, but not limited to, archiving community news
and entertainment within its www.eyeonsouthflorida.com Internet
portal, hence generating unprecedented viewers from the world wide
web, while promoting the brand and the advertisers whom have
already entrusted us to promote their brands alongside the EOSF
Network.

Competitive
Business Conditions And The Smaller Reporting Company’s
Competitive Position In The Industry And Methods Of
Competition

 

We believe
that our competitors usually give people in the communities
programming which is of negative impact and which does not engage
them. Few channels cover the positive things that the community is
doing to help the less fortunate, or even to help themselves. Cable
Networks specialize in specific genres and usually have great
overheads and liabilities to contend with, in order to fulfill
their programming agendas, while meeting the demands of
advertisers. Additionally, most of the current news media networks
show bias for one side or the other, whether it is the liberal
point of view or the conservative point of view. Our goal is to
serve all sides of the equation with equal opportunity news and
entertainment programming for all opinions and voices in each
community that we reach.

 

EOSF
covers and promotes up-lifting and empowering content, as well as
promotion of proactive safety matters and public announcements. In
each market, there are different needs in the community and the
people and their issues have a right to be heard! The essence of
EOSF Network is to bring people together that is by them and for
them.

 

The use of
our software technology provides EOSF many solutions when it comes
to attracting viewers to watch our TV stations, live streaming
programming, smart device promotions and/or to engage in its
website portals that promote their EYE On Network content. For
example www.eyeonsouthflorida.com delivers simultaneous live
streaming in between live events and makes it possible for vast
amounts of traffic to be generated, long after the events are
archived on the websites.

 

EOSF is
currently positioned in South Florida as a leader in its genre, as
we continue to be the voice of the people, giving them back what
they want and need in their communities. The EYE On brand will
continue to offer non-profit organizations and their sponsored
advertisers a medium from which to promote their production events.
Sponsored brands can broaden their audience, especially during live
streaming events, which are open to hundreds of millions of viewers
from the World Wide Web. News like this does not get around to
mainstream media, but at EOSF it does matter and it will always
matter because it is what we do! We have no direct competition with
the type of alternative programming we produce, benefiting the
community and non-profit organizations. As a matter of fact, other
main stream media networks have solicited us to re-broadcast our
content on their networks, because they now started to see the
importance of what we are doing and more important how the
community has reacted!

 

Our
strategy is to be a resource for other media networks to continue
to approach our organization, as a source of content for their
programming. We will accomplish this by making sure that we are on
the cutting edge of communication, community news and entertainment
and new technology. Our platform is designed to give the
advertisers multiple ways and methods to broadcast their commercial
messages and promote their brands to a wide audience with ease and
efficiency, which translates into a time saving and more cost
efficient method of producing and distributing commercial
advertising and content to all the targeted people, places and even
things, which will equate to a better ROI.

 

Patents,
Trademarks, Licenses, Franchises, Concessions, Royalty Agreements
Or Labor Contracts, Including Duration

 

As EOSF
develops its programming property portfolio, management fully
intends to license and develop strategic relationships with
affiliate networks and or satellite cable networks that desire to
participate in licensing EOSF’s slate of original
programming. If our marketing campaigns are successful, we will be
able to offer licensing of our trademarked and copyright protected
proprietary works, to include new and innovative communication
platforms designed to distribute content by way of versatile and
vertically integrated mediums as described herein as a part of this
business plan to other Networks and communication and technology
service providers worldwide. Said proprietary works will be made
available to other businesses and as such the fees and licensing
percentages will greatly increase our profitability.

Number Of
Total Employees And Number Of Full-Time
Employees

 

At this
time, the Company has five part-time contracted
employees.

 

How long
can we satisfy our cash requirements and will we need to raise
additional funds in the next 12 months?

 

Our Plan
of Operation for the next twelve months is to raise capital to
continue to expand our operations and client base. We anticipate
that we may engage in one or more private offering of our
company’s securities. We would most likely rely upon the
transaction exemptions from registration provided by Regulation D,
Rule 506 or conduct a private offering under Section 4(a)(2) of the
Securities Act of 1933.

 

In the
event we raise additional capital, we will be able to implement our
expansion in accordance with our business plan. We anticipate that
we will use the funds raised to fund marketing activities and
working capital. Our failure to market and promote our services
will harm our business and future financial performance. If we are
unable to expand our operations within the next twelve months, we
will likely see a decrease in the ability of increasing our
revenues. We cannot guarantee that additional funding will be
available on favorable terms, if at all. If adequate funds are not
available, then we may not be able to expand our operations. If
adequate funds are not available, we believe that our officers and
directors will contribute funds to pay for some of our expenses.
Our director has verbally agreed to continue to fund our operations
as needed over the next 12 months until cash flows are sufficient
to sustain operations. Pursuant to the agreement our CEO has agreed
to only the return of his capital with no interest or other
consideration. Thus far there has not been any need for funds
beyond the $6,000 in loans previously provided to the Company by
our CEO, Jack Namer. In the event we require additional funding in
the form of loans from our CEO, we do not know whether we will
issue stock for the loans or whether we will merely prepare and
sign promissory notes.

 

The
implementation of our business strategy is estimated to take
approximately 12-18 months. Currently we have only a few paying
clients. Some of our clients currently include Hard Rock Hotel
& Casino, AutoNation, Florida Metro Rail, Fort Lauderdale
Chamber of Commerce, Shino Bay Dermatology, DelVecchio Pizza and
Universal Insurance. However, our CEO has been involved in the
television media industry for many years and has commenced making
initial contact with his previous associates. Once we are able to
secure additional funding, implementation of our business strategy
will begin immediately. We anticipate that it will take 30 days to
be in a stage of full operational activity to gain additional
clients. The major parts of the strategy to be immediately
implemented will be the sales and marketing and office equipment
and human resource procurement.

 

Our lack
of revenues has affected the Company directly. Without a strong or
known market demand, it was considered a risk to expand in any new
geographical areas, since there was realistic probability that
costs would not be recovered upon completion and sales
generated.

 

Summary
of product research and development

 

We are not
currently nor do we anticipate in the future to be conducting any
research and development activities.

 

Marketing

 

We have
developed a multi-pronged, targeted marketing program aimed at
informing potential customers of the Company’s
services.

Internet
Promotions

 

We will
utilize our website and email database for both educational and
promotional activities. We will promote all of our upcoming company
events such as workshops, seminars, business clubs, etc. and
include testimonials from our client base. Our primary means of
promoting the website is the registration with all major and most
minor search engines, insuring that web users are directed to the
site when they search for information regarding business
consulting. Finally, the Company’s web address will be
featured on all printed materials, including advertisements,
stationary, etc.

 

Strategic
Alliances

 

We will
gain a significant amount of leads through developing strategic
alliance relationships with companies offering complimentary
services and products to the small to medium size business markets.
This will enable us to market its services into the customer
database of the partnering company leveraging the trust developed
between the strategic partner and their customers.

 

We are a
reporting company and file all reports required under sections 13
and 15d of the Exchange Act.

Our
Business Overview.

 

Eye On
Media Network, Inc. is a company that was incorporated in the State
of Florida on August 2, 2013. Since inception on August 2, 2013,
the Company has been engaged in organizational efforts and
obtaining initial financing. The Company was formed as a vehicle to
pursue a business combination with an existing company. The Company
selected August 31 as its fiscal year end. On September 3, 2013 we
filed a Registration Statement on Form 10-12G with the United
States Securities and Exchange Commission. We are a reporting
company and file all reports required under sections 13 and 15d of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. On January 22, 2014 we entered
into share exchange agreements with the shareholders of Eye On
South Florida, Inc. (“EOSF”), pursuant to which we
acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of EOSF.
EOSF is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of our
Company.

Implications
of Being an Emerging Growth Company

 

We qualify
as an emerging growth company as that term is used in the Jumpstart
Our Business Startups Act. An emerging growth company may take
advantage of specified reduced reporting and other burdens that are
otherwise applicable generally to public companies. These
provisions included:

 

  




 



(i)



A
requirement to have only two years of audited financial statements
and only two years of related Management Discussion & Analysis
disclosures;





 



 



 





 



(ii)



Exemption
from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of the
emerging growth company’s internal control over financial
reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002;





 



 



 





 



(iii)



Reduced
disclosure about the emerging growth company’s executive
compensation arrangements; and





 



 



 





 



(iv)



No
non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden
parachute arrangements.




 

 

We have
already taken advantage of these reduced reporting burdens, which
are also available to us as a smaller reporting company as defined
under Rule 12b-2of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the “Exchange Act”).

 

In
addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an
emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended
transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) for
complying with new or revised accounting standards. We are choosing
to utilize the extended transition period for complying with new or
revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(2) of the JOBS
Act. This election allows our Company to delay the adoption of new
or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates
for public and private companies until those standards apply to
private companies. As a result of this election, our financial
statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with
public company effective dates.

 

We could
remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, or until
the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which
our annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (ii) the date that we
become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule
12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value
of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700
million as of the last business day of our most recently completed
second fiscal quarter, or (iii) which issued more than $1 billion
in non-convertible debt during the preceding three-year
period.

 

Business
of Issuer

 

The
Company was organized as a vehicle to investigate and, if such
investigation warrants, acquire a target company or business
seeking the perceived advantages of being a publicly held
corporation. On January 22, 2014, the Company entered into Share
Exchange Agreements (collectively referred to as the
“Exchange Agreement”) with the shareholders
(“Shareholders”) of Eye On South Florida, Inc. Pursuant
to the Exchange Agreement, the Shareholders agreed to exchange each
of their shares of EOSF common stock (the “Target
Shares”) for one (1) share of restricted common stock of the
Company. The Shareholders collectively held a total of 24,725,000
Target Shares. The Shareholders are all friends, business
associates or family members of our sole officer and director, Jack
Namer. Each Shareholder is a sophisticated investor and except as
otherwise designated, was a founding member or vendor of EOSF. As
of the consummation of the Exchange Agreements, EOSF became a
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Our principal business
activities are now conducted through our operation of
EOSF.

 

Consideration
for the Exchange Agreement consisted of one share of restricted
common stock of the Company for each Target Share tendered by the
Shareholders in the exchange. A total of 24,725,000 shares of
restricted Company common stock were issued to forty-three (43)
Shareholders for the Target Shares. The receipt of the Target
Shares by the Company was determined by the Company Board of
Directors to constitute adequate consideration for issuance of the
Company common stock as a result of the value of the assets of
EOSF. Prior to the execution of the Exchange Agreement there were
three million (3,000,000) shares or our common stock issued and
outstanding. Upon completion of the transaction involving the
Exchange Agreement, there were 27,725,000 shares of our common
stock issued and outstanding. The acquisition was accounted for by
the Company as a reverse merger wherein an operating, private
company (Eye on South Florida, Inc.) was acquired by the
Registrant.
