Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement.

What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

With over 20 million telephone access lines in 40 states, the communications conglomerate was America's leading provider of local telephone services. The $6.6 billion acquisition of Contel Corporation in 1990 nearly doubled GTE's Mobilnet cellular operations, making it the second-largest provider of cellular telephone services in the United States, with over two million customers. GTE's strategy for the mid- to late 1990s focused on technological enhancement of wireline and wireless systems, expansion of data services, global expansion, and diversification into video services. On June 30, 2000, Bell Atlantic Corporation (BNTR) and GTE Corporation (GTTC) merged into one company, Verizon Communications (VCTR).

Errol Samuelson
President
realtor.com
Errol Samuelson, president of realtor.com, took on an expanded role as chief strategy officer in 2013 at the site’s operator real estate heavyweight Move Inc. In July, he helped Move negotiate its realtor.com operating agreement with the National Association of Realtors that led to amendments that gave the firm more flexibility in how it managed the site. Though it eventually didn’t succeed, realtor.com boldly experimented with an agent-ranking site AgentMatch in the second half of the year that used agents’ multiple service performance data to rank them by city, ZIP code and neighborhood in two test markets. Samuelson became president of realtor.com in February 2007 and was appointed chief revenue officer of Move in May 2009. Samuelson has been with Move since 2003, where he previously served as president of Move subsidiary Top Producer Systems. Previously, Samuelson was director of sales, marketing and product management at GTE Enterprise Solutions.
