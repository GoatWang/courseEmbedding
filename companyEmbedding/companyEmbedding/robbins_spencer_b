    Robbins Flying The Nest?  





 








              By Tom Maras
                (Patch Poster) - 




 Updated March 3, 2014  10:09 am ET










 












 





The word going around Woodbridge Township, and well beyond, is that
Judge Spencer Robbins, the Head Judge in Woodbridge Township’s Courts, who has
a law practice in Woodbridge, and sits on the board of the BCB Community Bank (formerly
the Allegiance Bank) Woodbridge, has resigned his seat on the bench in
Woodbridge Township.  Interestingly, Robbins'
business associate and former shareholder in the Allegiance Bank, James P. Nolan,
Esq., still serves as the Woodbridge Township attorney, and may now hold shares in
BCB. There are no indications, at this time, that Nolan is involved in Robbins' trials and tribulations.
There is a certain irony in the fact that Robbins, as a
lawyer and sitting judge in three municipalities, those being, Woodbridge, So.
Plainfield and Sayerville, as of January 2013, has found himself on the other
side of the bench, so to speak, on more than one occasion.  The details of his ‘record’ can be found in
articles published by NJ.Com, the Home News Tribune, and the Woodbridge
Patch.  As the Woodbridge Patch article may
well be the most informative,  it follows hereinafter:Judge Who Voted in Wrong Town Gets New Term on the Woodbridge Bench
Judge Spencer B. Robbins lives in Chatham but voted from his law office in Woodbridge for 12 years

 in 1998 but continued voting from his Woodbridge law office for 12 
years, was reappointed to another three-year term as a municipal judge.
Robbins' reappointment was buried in a New Year flurry of resolutions
 that the council voted on at their reorganization meeting earlier this 
month. He makes approximately $77,000 in the position, according to a Home News Tribune report.
The trouble came about when it was learned that Robbins, who owns a 
law practice in Woodbridge, had been voting from his office address 
since 1998, four years after he was appointed to a judgeship here. He 
was stopped after Christopher Struben, the Republican candidate for 
mayor who lost in the 2011 election, complained about Robbins' illegally
 voting from his Woodbridge law office. 
Struben and several town residents demanded that Mayor John McCormac 
or the town council remove Robbins from the bench. Council Attorney 
Craig Coughlin said that the council had no power to discipline Robbins.
The Middlesex County Board of Elections unanimously ruled that 
Robbins was in the wrong, and the matter afterwards was taken up by 
the state judicial ethics panel. 
Their decisions are considered to be confidential, unless a judge is removed from the bench.
It wasn't Robbins' first brush with ethics panels. In 2004, he was admonished by the Disciplinary Review Board (DRB)
 of the NJ Supreme Court. They charged that Robbins had failed to comply
 with an investigator's request for a grievance filed against him; 
failed to sign an agreement in lieu of being disciplined; and failed to 
file a timely answer to a formal ethics complaint.
An admonishment is considered to be the least severe form of discipline that can be meted out to an attorney, according to the DRB report.
Struben also pointed out that Robbins was chairman of the board of 
directors of Allegiance Bank, a financial institution with which the 
township does business. Allegiance merged with BCB Community Bank in 2011, and Robbins sits on their board of directors.
Robbins' financial interest in the bank was a conflict of interest, 
Struben said. The township still holds accounts in the institution.
Robbins was admitted to the bar
 in New York and New Jersey in 1981. He served as municipal prosecutor 
in Woodbridge from 1988 to 1994, when he was appointed as a municipal 
judge. He also serves as a municipal judge in South Plainfield and 
Sayreville. ENDIt is uncertain which one or more of Robbins’ legal
woes, including a recent law suit filed by a prominent local businessman
alleging Robbins committed a $500,000.00 fraud against him, may be behind
Robbins rumored resignation.  
It is believed that Robbins may have been granted PTI (Pre
Trial Intervention), but the details of that claim have yet to be confirmed.
It remains to be seen if Robbins will still hold onto his municipal
pensions or license to practice law in New Jersey, if in fact he has been, or
may, be found guilty of ethics and/or other serious criminal violations.One thing is certain, there are many you will
revel at Robbins having to take a seat on a park bench, rather than one as a
judge in any court!

About Peer Rating
Martindale-Hubbell® Peer Review Ratings™ are the gold standard in attorney ratings, and have been for more than a century. These ratings indicate attorneys who are widely respected by their peers for their ethical standards and legal expertise in a specific area of practice.


The Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings process is the gold standard due to its objectivity and comprehensiveness. Lawyers solicited for peer reviews include both those selected by the attorney being reviewed and lawyers independently selected by Martindale-Hubbell. All reviewers are verified as attorneys through Martindale-Hubbell's extensive attorney database. Only attorneys practicing at least three years and receiving a sufficient number of reviews from non-affiliated attorneys are eligible to receive a Rating.
What are the different Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings?
AV Preeminent®: The highest peer rating standard. This rating signifies that a large number of the lawyer's peers rank him or her at the highest level of professional excellence for their legal knowledge, communication skills and ethical standards.
Distinguished: An excellent rating for a lawyer with some experience. This rating indicates the attorney is widely respected by their peers for high professional achievement and ethical standards.
Notable: This rating indicates that the lawyer has been recognized by a large number of their peers for strong ethical standards.
Lawyers who have received peer reviews after 2009 will display more detailed information, including practice areas, summary ratings, detailed numeric ratings and written feedback (if available). Details for individual reviews received before 2009 are not displayed.
Attorneys that receive reviews from their peers, but not a sufficient number to establish a Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Rating, will have those reviews display on our websites.

About Client Rating
The Martindale-Hubbell® Client Review Ratings™ display reviews submitted by clients of lawyers and law firms.


The Client Review Rating score is determined through aggregation of validated responses. People who submit reviews are clients of law firms who hired a lawyer within the last year, whose matter is not pending and who want to share their experience of that lawyer or law firm with other potential clients. Reviewers can be anyone who hires a lawyer including in-house counsel, corporate executives, small business owners and private individuals.
Martindale-Hubbell validates that the reviewer is a person with a valid email address. As part of the review process, respondents must affirm that they have been a client of the lawyer or law firm identified within the past year, although Martindale-Hubbell cannot confirm the lawyer/client relationship as it is often confidential. The content of the responses are entirely from client reviewers.
Prior results do not guarantee a similar outcome and Martindale-Hubbell accepts no responsibility for the content or accuracy of any review.
