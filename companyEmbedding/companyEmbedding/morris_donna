 Donna Morris

Executive Vice President, Customer and Employee Experience
 
“Disrupt or be disrupted” is Donna’s rallying cry. From abolishing Adobe’s annual performance reviews to dramatically expanding its family leave policy, she has set the industry agenda while making Adobe a great place to work. She leads the product, customer service, and technical support experience for all Adobe products, in addition to all aspects of human resources and the workplace. She holds a bachelor’s degree in political science from Carleton University, and her “north of the border” accent gives her away as a native of Ottawa, Canada.
 
If Donna were not at Adobe, she would have a home decorating show on HGTV.

Adobe’s New Customer & Employee Experience organization
In late 2015, Donna Morris launched a new Adobe team focused on the people who make the company’s success possible: its customers and employees. At the same time that Adobe helps its customers build great experiences, Donna wants to ensure that the company builds its own great experience where customers and employees get what they need — and even more than they expect. “A team of diverse and engaged employees is the secret to serving our customers in a standout way, and I’m excited about the possibilities we have ahead,” she says.

Become a Corporate Partner - Girls Who Code

girlswhocode








Become a Corporate Partner

With the support of our sponsors, Girls Who Code is building the largest pipeline of future female engineers.














Let's Work Together


Our organization relies on support from partners to drive our work. Based on thoughtful conversation with your organization, we’ll develop a customized partnership to direct your donation to initiatives and programs within Girls Who Code. If you make a commitment to generally support Girls Who Code, your funding will go toward our overall operation and management of our programs across the country, reaching thousands of girls each year.

















							Diversity and inclusiveness are essential in every industry, and they are critical in tech. Building companies that are as diverse as the people who rely on our products is not only the right thing to do, it is good business. Girls Who Code helps us create a stronger community around girls and women that will empower the next generation to be leaders in technology.						



Jack Dorsey
Co-Founder and CEO of Square and Twitter





							As a company committed to building a diverse workforce and as an early supporter of Girls Who Code, AT&T has seen first-hand the power of nurturing young women’s careers in high tech fields. By supporting the Girls Who Code Alumnae Network, we are giving these girls – the first of whom are just beginning their collegiate journey – a way to stay connected to the program and to each other.						



Marissa Shorenstein
New York State President of AT&T





							Girls Who Code not only provides thousands of young women with the opportunity to learn and grow their skills in computer science, they also provide underrepresented groups with incredible access to the tech industry. Having the opportunity to learn and work at tech companies is a valuable experience, and Facebook looks forward to continuing to collaborate with GWC as they work to close the gender gap in technology.						



Maxine Williams
Facebook Global Director of Diversity





							Silicon Valley companies are clamoring for technical women. But not enough women are pursuing these careers. Girls Who Code has found the magic in building 1:1 relationships for girls with strong mentors, and their results have been impressive. We’re excited to invest in mentoring and eventually hiring Girls Who Code graduates as part of our workforce.						

Donna Morris

Donna Morris
Senior Vice President, People & Places





							The Prudential Foundation’s support for Girls Who Code is aimed at not only helping solve the gender and skills gaps in STEM, but also solving a real business challenge for our industry. Most people don’t think of a company like Prudential when they consider the impact of the tech skills shortage on the private sector, but the financial services industry is increasingly reliant on technology to deliver the convenient and customized services our customers demand.						



Lata Reddy
Vice President of Corporate Social Responsibility and President of The Prudential Foundation
