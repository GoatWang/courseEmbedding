 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Eagle LNG Pre-Filing Request Approved 



Jacksonville, Florida (December 3, 2014) – Eagle LNG Partners (Eagle LNG) is pleased to announce their request to commence the pre-filing review process for the Jacksonville LNG project has been approved by the United States Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). The approval from FERC follows Eagle LNG’s request filed on November 26, 2014.
FERC is the lead federal agency that reviews proposals for the development of liquefied natural gas (LNG) export facilities. The review process ensures that approved LNG projects, associated gas pipelines and LNG transportation efforts meet safety and environmental requirements during construction and operation.
The FERC pre-filing process involves FERC, other federal agencies, state and local agencies, stakeholders, and community groups. Following the pre-filing process, Eagle LNG may submit a formal approval application to FERC.
The proposed LNG facility will serve domestic and international markets. Eagle LNG will receive and liquefy natural gas, temporarily store the produced LNG, and periodically load the product onto ocean-going vessels for use in marine fueling trade. The company is seeing increased demand for LNG to serve small scale export markets while domestic demand for LNG continues to develop.
Eagle LNG strives to maintain a public, transparent application process. Interested parties will be able to monitor the Jacksonville LNG project application process on our website www.eaglelng.com.
