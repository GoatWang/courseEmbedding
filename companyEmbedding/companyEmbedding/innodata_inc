History[edit]
Innodata Inc. was founded in 1988 in New York City to provide digitized content and created quality assurance and audit procedures.[citation needed]
By 1992, the year the company went public, Innodata had grown to more than 1,000 employees worldwide. Throughout the decade, the company opened major facilities in the Philippines, Sri Lanka and India.[citation needed]
The company tripled its revenue to $60 million from $20 million between 1999 and 2001.[2]
Innodata acquired Isogen International in 2001 and integrated both of the company’s content management and publishing technologies, structured information standards and outsourcing services. In 2003, the name of Innodata Isogen Inc. was formally adopted by the company.
Starting in 2007, the company started taking advantage of the growing popularity of e-books to become a producer of technology and processes for transforming books into e-book formats for distribution and sell-through on tablets and e-readers. Innodata has produced over 1.2 million e-books and is distributing more than 1,500 e-books per day across 25 global platforms and e-bookstores.[citation needed]
Innodata Advanced Data Solutions (IADS)[edit]
In 2011, the company launched a new segment, Innodata Advanced Data Solutions, to develop products designed to help companies outside the information and publishing industries adapt to the public’s rapid adoption of digital and mobile devices.[3] Within this segment, they started two new subsidiaries, Synodex and DocGenix.
In 2012, the company changed its name back to “Innodata”. This move became official on June 5, 2012 when Innodata’s stockholders approved an amendment to the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation to change the Company’s name from “Innodata Isogen, Inc.” to “Innodata Inc.”[4]
In July 2014, Innodata acquired MediaMiser Ltd. (“MediaMiser”),[5] a media monitoring and analysis company based in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada that provides software and professional services for public relations and marketing professionals.
In December 2014, Innodata acquired intellectual property and related assets of Bulldog Reporter,[6] a PR company providing PR industry newsletters, journalist databases, media intelligence and professional development programs.

History[edit]
Innodata Inc. was founded in 1988 in New York City to provide digitized content and created quality assurance and audit procedures.[citation needed]
By 1992, the year the company went public, Innodata had grown to more than 1,000 employees worldwide. Throughout the decade, the company opened major facilities in the Philippines, Sri Lanka and India.[citation needed]
The company tripled its revenue to $60 million from $20 million between 1999 and 2001.[2]
Innodata acquired Isogen International in 2001 and integrated both of the company’s content management and publishing technologies, structured information standards and outsourcing services. In 2003, the name of Innodata Isogen Inc. was formally adopted by the company.
Starting in 2007, the company started taking advantage of the growing popularity of e-books to become a producer of technology and processes for transforming books into e-book formats for distribution and sell-through on tablets and e-readers. Innodata has produced over 1.2 million e-books and is distributing more than 1,500 e-books per day across 25 global platforms and e-bookstores.[citation needed]
Innodata Advanced Data Solutions (IADS)[edit]
In 2011, the company launched a new segment, Innodata Advanced Data Solutions, to develop products designed to help companies outside the information and publishing industries adapt to the public’s rapid adoption of digital and mobile devices.[3] Within this segment, they started two new subsidiaries, Synodex and DocGenix.
In 2012, the company changed its name back to “Innodata”. This move became official on June 5, 2012 when Innodata’s stockholders approved an amendment to the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation to change the Company’s name from “Innodata Isogen, Inc.” to “Innodata Inc.”[4]
In July 2014, Innodata acquired MediaMiser Ltd. (“MediaMiser”),[5] a media monitoring and analysis company based in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada that provides software and professional services for public relations and marketing professionals.
In December 2014, Innodata acquired intellectual property and related assets of Bulldog Reporter,[6] a PR company providing PR industry newsletters, journalist databases, media intelligence and professional development programs.

History[edit]
Innodata Inc. was founded in 1988 in New York City to provide digitized content and created quality assurance and audit procedures.[citation needed]
By 1992, the year the company went public, Innodata had grown to more than 1,000 employees worldwide. Throughout the decade, the company opened major facilities in the Philippines, Sri Lanka and India.[citation needed]
The company tripled its revenue to $60 million from $20 million between 1999 and 2001.[2]
Innodata acquired Isogen International in 2001 and integrated both of the company’s content management and publishing technologies, structured information standards and outsourcing services. In 2003, the name of Innodata Isogen Inc. was formally adopted by the company.
Starting in 2007, the company started taking advantage of the growing popularity of e-books to become a producer of technology and processes for transforming books into e-book formats for distribution and sell-through on tablets and e-readers. Innodata has produced over 1.2 million e-books and is distributing more than 1,500 e-books per day across 25 global platforms and e-bookstores.[citation needed]
Innodata Advanced Data Solutions (IADS)[edit]
In 2011, the company launched a new segment, Innodata Advanced Data Solutions, to develop products designed to help companies outside the information and publishing industries adapt to the public’s rapid adoption of digital and mobile devices.[3] Within this segment, they started two new subsidiaries, Synodex and DocGenix.
In 2012, the company changed its name back to “Innodata”. This move became official on June 5, 2012 when Innodata’s stockholders approved an amendment to the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation to change the Company’s name from “Innodata Isogen, Inc.” to “Innodata Inc.”[4]
In July 2014, Innodata acquired MediaMiser Ltd. (“MediaMiser”),[5] a media monitoring and analysis company based in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada that provides software and professional services for public relations and marketing professionals.
In December 2014, Innodata acquired intellectual property and related assets of Bulldog Reporter,[6] a PR company providing PR industry newsletters, journalist databases, media intelligence and professional development programs.
