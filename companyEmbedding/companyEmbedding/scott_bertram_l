Pradaxa Cases | Kansas City Product Liability Attorney

888.398.2277











Pradaxa




Home > Dangerous Drugs > Pradaxa



Kansas City Product Liability Attorneys for Pradaxa Cases
Have You or a Loved One Been Harmed After Taking Pradaxa?
Pradaxa is a blood-thinning medication that is given to patients to prevent
	 a stroke. Recently, the drug has been at the center of much investigation,
	 as patients have reported side effects from using the drug, including
	 internal bleeding and excessive bleeding. If you have experienced harm
	 from Pradaxa, Bertram & Graf, L.L.C. can help you.

	Our
	Kansas City product liability lawyers have helped victims of defective or
	dangerous drugs and assist them in finding justice after a medication that promised to
	 aid their health had the opposite effect.


We urge you to contact our team soon as possible to
		begin a review
of your case! We are ready to help you.

What Are the Side Effects of Pradaxa?
Pradaxa was created as an alternative, to Warfarin, another blood-thinning
	 medication used to prevent blood clots, as it was much less complicated
	 to administer, safer, and much more effective. The problems concerning
	 Pradaxa arose when patients began complaining of both internal and external
	 bleeding. It became very apparent that once administered, the blood-thinning
	 mechanism could not be reversed unless the patient undergoes dialysis,
	 causing a patient to suffer from extensive bleeding.
Other reported side effects of Pradaxa include the following:

Internal bleeding
Gastrointestinal issues
Cerebral hemorrhage
Heart attacks
Stroke
Death

If you believe that you may have a case against Pradaxa and may be eligible
	 to make a claim for compensation, let our Kansas City product liability
	 attorneys review your case. There is no time to waste when reviewing injury
	 cases, so be sure you get in touch with a lawyer. We fight relentlessly
	 to help our clients find appropriate financial recovery and we work on
	 a contingency fee basis. This means that you pay us nothing unless we
	 win your case!

Bertram & Graf, L.L.C. is known for world-class legal services and
		 going above and beyond to help our clients.
		Reach out to our Kansas City firm and request an appointment.

   Executive Vice President, Product Management   TIAA-CREFHealth care giant Cigna Corp., with operations in Bloomfield, announced  Wednesday it hired veteran insurance-financial executive Bertram L.  "Bert'' Scott to develop and expand its domestic product lines.    Cigna created the new post of president, U.S. Commercial, for Scott to oversee its U.S. products; marketing; national accounts; regional, individual, select and senior segments, said CEO David M.

He and his family will reside in the Hartford area, Cigna said. Scott previously was executive vice president and chief institutional development and sales officer of TIAA-CREF in New York. Scott began his career in 1975 with Prudential Insurance Co., rising to vice president, managed care in 1994. In 1996, he became president and chief executive officer of the Horizon/Mercy Health Plan, a joint Medicaid managed care program between Mercy Health Plan of Pennsylvania and Blue Cross/Blue Shield of New Jersey. Scott joined TIAA-CREF in 2000 as president of its life insurance business, and later served as the company's executive vice president for product management and strategy implementation. He has a bachelor's degree in business administration from DePaul University and participated in advanced business management programs at Harvard University, Columbia University and the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. He is a board member of medical-device maker Becton, Dickinson & Co. He is also member of the board of trustees of DePaul University, a member of the board of trustees of University of North Carolina Charlotte, and a member of the board of directors of the Foundation For The Carolinas.
