Freshpet is an American manufacturer of refrigerated food and treats for dogs and cats using natural ingredients, and are the first in the fresh and refrigerated category to be distributed across North America.[1] It was founded in 2006 and combines meats with fruits and vegetables to make foods and treats for pets.[2][3] Freshpet stock is traded on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol "FRPT".[4]
Pet foods manufactured by this company are available in over 10,000 stores in North America,[5] including mass-market stores, natural food retailers, pet specialty stores, and retailers Target, Whole Foods, petco,[6] petsmart[7] and Walmart.[2][8]
While sales in other pet food categories were declining due to the recession, the frozen/refrigerated dog food market grew by 10% in 2010, with similar growth in the refrigerated cat food market. According to Pet Market Outlook 2011-2012, "this growth is attributable almost exclusively to the efforts of Freshpet." While frozen/refrigerated pet food still represents less than one percent of total pet food sales, sales in this particular segment are expected to grow by 25% on a compounded annual basis through 2015.[9] Freshpet also has Freshpet Vet site where veterinarians can gain detailed information on which fresh pet food is best to recommend to pet patients.[10]
Freshpet foods are packed fresh and must be served accordingly. Just like the refrigerated food that humans eat, "Pet parents" must ensure that purchase and serving is within expiration date.

Manufacturing facility[edit]
In 2013, Freshpet opened a new manufacturing facility, the Freshpet Kitchens, located in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. This new $25 million facility was built to resemble human-grade manufacturing standards. All Freshpet food recipes are manufactured in this facility.[3]
Products[edit]
Freshpet food makes refrigerated dog and cat foods and dog treats under the brands Freshpet Select, Dog Joy, Vital, Nature's Fresh and Dognation. Freshpet Select foods and Dog Joy treats are sold at grocery and mass merchandise retailers. Vital foods, and Dognation treats are sold at pet specialty retailers. Nature's Fresh foods are sold at natural retailers. Freshpet Vital Raw selection consists of ready to serve refrigerated raw meals for dogs. The recipes include probiotics with raw chicken or beef and kale, spinach and sweet potatoes.
Freshpet Vital Whole Blends are mix-ins for dogs, dedicated to specific needs such as dental health, immunity and digestion. They can be added on top of Freshpet dog food or any other food for added nutrition.
Fresh Baked is Freshpet’s dry dog food recipe range. According to Freshpet it is made with 100% fresh poultry, real fruits and vegetables. Freshpet also claims it does not contain any processed meat meals and is made using the latest technology that allows cooking at low temperatures.
Freshpet announced in 2016 that more recipe options for cats would be offered. New recipes would include slice and serve rolls and reseal able cat cups in gravy.
Minimal processing[edit]
Unlike traditional shelf-stable pet foods, Freshpet ingredients are cooked once at lower temperatures. Thus, similar to less-processed foods such as milk, natural cooked meats and yogurt, the meals have a shorter shelf life.
Media exposure[edit]
During the 2007 pet food recalls, being one of the few pet food companies not affected, Freshpet capitalized on the opportunity and had record-high sales.[11] The New York Times reported that as of April 2013, Freshpet sales revenue grew more than 44 percent.[3] In the fall of 2013, the Associated Press wrote a feature article on Freshpet food and the growing trend of buying holistic food for pets.[5] In September 2014 Freshpet placed at number 8 on Google’s YouTube Ad Leaderboard, which ranks the 10 most-viewed commercials posted to the site in that month. The commercial starred YouTube celebrity, Noah Ritter - nicknamed "Apparently Kid," garnering 3.2 million views.[12] In 2011 Freshpet signed with Darling Agency of New York as its first agency of record. The agency created a TV campaign that aired on ABC, CBS and NBC. The 30 sec and two 15 seconds spots ran during The View,[13] Good Morning America, The Today Show and Rachael Ray. Fresh Pet ads also ran on cable networks. According to Kathryn Winstanley, VP of Marketing at Freshpet, the target audience for Freshpet food is ‘empty nesters’[14] between the ages 45 – 54, whose household income is in excess of $100,000.
Viral YouTube Video[edit]
On December 7, 2015, Freshpet uploaded the Santa Elves video on their YouTube page with 458,618 views so far.[15] The video was made in collaboration with the Salt Lake County Animal Services[16] and Freshpet donated one meal of Freshpet food for every share the video generated. Freshpet has been a leader in the utilization of digital viral videos which gain many millions of views and in addition significant levels of PR in Mashable,[17] Huffington post,[18] previously Freshpet has released the Freshpet Holiday Feast – 13 Dogs and 1 Cat Eating with Human Hands and the Apparently Kid’s First Ever TV Commercial. According to Katie Tyson,[19] Freshpet’s Marketing Manager, Apparently Kid’s First Ever TV Commercial was released to "drive brand awareness."
Philanthropic Activities[edit]
In April 2014, it was reported in MediaPost[20] that Freshpet in partnership with Whole Foods Market intends to introduce a national poster contest. Each Whole Foods Market store will design a poster and Freshpet will make donation to the winning store’s favorite pet charity.
The Youtube video “Le Holiday Feast” was a joint venture between Freshpet and the Humane Society of Utah[21] to help animals find permanent homes. This collaborative effort was able to collect supplies and donations for many animal shelters. Freshpet also offered to pay the adoption fees and provide the families with a supply of pet food to get them started.[22] In June 2015, Richard Thompson, Freshpet’s CEO, presented a check of $6,500 to Colonial Regional Police Department Chief Roy Seiple in support of the department's K-9 Unit.[23]

On December 7, 2015, Freshpet uploaded the Santa Elves video on their YouTube page with 458,618 views so far.[15] The video was made in collaboration with the Salt Lake County Animal Services[16] and Freshpet donated one meal of Freshpet food for every share the video generated. Freshpet has been a leader in the utilization of digital viral videos which gain many millions of views and in addition significant levels of PR in Mashable,[17] Huffington post,[18] previously Freshpet has released the Freshpet Holiday Feast – 13 Dogs and 1 Cat Eating with Human Hands and the Apparently Kid’s First Ever TV Commercial. According to Katie Tyson,[19] Freshpet’s Marketing Manager, Apparently Kid’s First Ever TV Commercial was released to "drive brand awareness."
Philanthropic Activities[edit]
In April 2014, it was reported in MediaPost[20] that Freshpet in partnership with Whole Foods Market intends to introduce a national poster contest. Each Whole Foods Market store will design a poster and Freshpet will make donation to the winning store’s favorite pet charity.
The Youtube video “Le Holiday Feast” was a joint venture between Freshpet and the Humane Society of Utah[21] to help animals find permanent homes. This collaborative effort was able to collect supplies and donations for many animal shelters. Freshpet also offered to pay the adoption fees and provide the families with a supply of pet food to get them started.[22] In June 2015, Richard Thompson, Freshpet’s CEO, presented a check of $6,500 to Colonial Regional Police Department Chief Roy Seiple in support of the department's K-9 Unit.[23]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Freshpet is an American manufacturer of refrigerated food and treats for dogs and cats using natural ingredients, and are the first in the fresh and refrigerated category to be distributed across North America.[1] It was founded in 2006 and combines meats with fruits and vegetables to make foods and treats for pets.[2][3] Freshpet stock is traded on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol "FRPT".[4]
Pet foods manufactured by this company are available in over 10,000 stores in North America,[5] including mass-market stores, natural food retailers, pet specialty stores, and retailers Target, Whole Foods, petco,[6] petsmart[7] and Walmart.[2][8]
While sales in other pet food categories were declining due to the recession, the frozen/refrigerated dog food market grew by 10% in 2010, with similar growth in the refrigerated cat food market. According to Pet Market Outlook 2011-2012, "this growth is attributable almost exclusively to the efforts of Freshpet." While frozen/refrigerated pet food still represents less than one percent of total pet food sales, sales in this particular segment are expected to grow by 25% on a compounded annual basis through 2015.[9] Freshpet also has Freshpet Vet site where veterinarians can gain detailed information on which fresh pet food is best to recommend to pet patients.[10]
Freshpet foods are packed fresh and must be served accordingly. Just like the refrigerated food that humans eat, "Pet parents" must ensure that purchase and serving is within expiration date.

Manufacturing facility[edit]
In 2013, Freshpet opened a new manufacturing facility, the Freshpet Kitchens, located in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. This new $25 million facility was built to resemble human-grade manufacturing standards. All Freshpet food recipes are manufactured in this facility.[3]
Products[edit]
Freshpet food makes refrigerated dog and cat foods and dog treats under the brands Freshpet Select, Dog Joy, Vital, Nature's Fresh and Dognation. Freshpet Select foods and Dog Joy treats are sold at grocery and mass merchandise retailers. Vital foods, and Dognation treats are sold at pet specialty retailers. Nature's Fresh foods are sold at natural retailers. Freshpet Vital Raw selection consists of ready to serve refrigerated raw meals for dogs. The recipes include probiotics with raw chicken or beef and kale, spinach and sweet potatoes.
Freshpet Vital Whole Blends are mix-ins for dogs, dedicated to specific needs such as dental health, immunity and digestion. They can be added on top of Freshpet dog food or any other food for added nutrition.
Fresh Baked is Freshpet’s dry dog food recipe range. According to Freshpet it is made with 100% fresh poultry, real fruits and vegetables. Freshpet also claims it does not contain any processed meat meals and is made using the latest technology that allows cooking at low temperatures.
Freshpet announced in 2016 that more recipe options for cats would be offered. New recipes would include slice and serve rolls and reseal able cat cups in gravy.
Minimal processing[edit]
Unlike traditional shelf-stable pet foods, Freshpet ingredients are cooked once at lower temperatures. Thus, similar to less-processed foods such as milk, natural cooked meats and yogurt, the meals have a shorter shelf life.
Media exposure[edit]
During the 2007 pet food recalls, being one of the few pet food companies not affected, Freshpet capitalized on the opportunity and had record-high sales.[11] The New York Times reported that as of April 2013, Freshpet sales revenue grew more than 44 percent.[3] In the fall of 2013, the Associated Press wrote a feature article on Freshpet food and the growing trend of buying holistic food for pets.[5] In September 2014 Freshpet placed at number 8 on Google’s YouTube Ad Leaderboard, which ranks the 10 most-viewed commercials posted to the site in that month. The commercial starred YouTube celebrity, Noah Ritter - nicknamed "Apparently Kid," garnering 3.2 million views.[12] In 2011 Freshpet signed with Darling Agency of New York as its first agency of record. The agency created a TV campaign that aired on ABC, CBS and NBC. The 30 sec and two 15 seconds spots ran during The View,[13] Good Morning America, The Today Show and Rachael Ray. Fresh Pet ads also ran on cable networks. According to Kathryn Winstanley, VP of Marketing at Freshpet, the target audience for Freshpet food is ‘empty nesters’[14] between the ages 45 – 54, whose household income is in excess of $100,000.
Viral YouTube Video[edit]
On December 7, 2015, Freshpet uploaded the Santa Elves video on their YouTube page with 458,618 views so far.[15] The video was made in collaboration with the Salt Lake County Animal Services[16] and Freshpet donated one meal of Freshpet food for every share the video generated. Freshpet has been a leader in the utilization of digital viral videos which gain many millions of views and in addition significant levels of PR in Mashable,[17] Huffington post,[18] previously Freshpet has released the Freshpet Holiday Feast – 13 Dogs and 1 Cat Eating with Human Hands and the Apparently Kid’s First Ever TV Commercial. According to Katie Tyson,[19] Freshpet’s Marketing Manager, Apparently Kid’s First Ever TV Commercial was released to "drive brand awareness."
Philanthropic Activities[edit]
In April 2014, it was reported in MediaPost[20] that Freshpet in partnership with Whole Foods Market intends to introduce a national poster contest. Each Whole Foods Market store will design a poster and Freshpet will make donation to the winning store’s favorite pet charity.
The Youtube video “Le Holiday Feast” was a joint venture between Freshpet and the Humane Society of Utah[21] to help animals find permanent homes. This collaborative effort was able to collect supplies and donations for many animal shelters. Freshpet also offered to pay the adoption fees and provide the families with a supply of pet food to get them started.[22] In June 2015, Richard Thompson, Freshpet’s CEO, presented a check of $6,500 to Colonial Regional Police Department Chief Roy Seiple in support of the department's K-9 Unit.[23]

Freshpet food makes refrigerated dog and cat foods and dog treats under the brands Freshpet Select, Dog Joy, Vital, Nature's Fresh and Dognation. Freshpet Select foods and Dog Joy treats are sold at grocery and mass merchandise retailers. Vital foods, and Dognation treats are sold at pet specialty retailers. Nature's Fresh foods are sold at natural retailers. Freshpet Vital Raw selection consists of ready to serve refrigerated raw meals for dogs.

Freshpet Vital Whole Blends are mix-ins for dogs, dedicated to specific needs such as dental health, immunity and digestion. They can be added on top of Freshpet dog food or any other food for added nutrition.
Fresh Baked is Freshpet’s dry dog food recipe range. According to Freshpet it is made with 100% fresh poultry, real fruits and vegetables. Freshpet also claims it does not contain any processed meat meals and is made using the latest technology that allows cooking at low temperatures.
Freshpet announced in 2016 that more recipe options for cats would be offered. New recipes would include slice and serve rolls and reseal able cat cups in gravy.
Minimal processing[edit]
Unlike traditional shelf-stable pet foods, Freshpet ingredients are cooked once at lower temperatures. Thus, similar to less-processed foods such as milk, natural cooked meats and yogurt, the meals have a shorter shelf life.
Media exposure[edit]
During the 2007 pet food recalls, being one of the few pet food companies not affected, Freshpet capitalized on the opportunity and had record-high sales.[11] The New York Times reported that as of April 2013, Freshpet sales revenue grew more than 44 percent.[3] In the fall of 2013, the Associated Press wrote a feature article on Freshpet food and the growing trend of buying holistic food for pets.[5] In September 2014 Freshpet placed at number 8 on Google’s YouTube Ad Leaderboard, which ranks the 10 most-viewed commercials posted to the site in that month. The commercial starred YouTube celebrity, Noah Ritter - nicknamed "Apparently Kid," garnering 3.2 million views.[12] In 2011 Freshpet signed with Darling Agency of New York as its first agency of record. The agency created a TV campaign that aired on ABC, CBS and NBC. The 30 sec and two 15 seconds spots ran during The View,[13] Good Morning America, The Today Show and Rachael Ray. Fresh Pet ads also ran on cable networks. According to Kathryn Winstanley, VP of Marketing at Freshpet, the target audience for Freshpet food is ‘empty nesters’[14] between the ages 45 – 54, whose household income is in excess of $100,000.
Viral YouTube Video[edit]
On December 7, 2015, Freshpet uploaded the Santa Elves video on their YouTube page with 458,618 views so far.[15] The video was made in collaboration with the Salt Lake County Animal Services[16] and Freshpet donated one meal of Freshpet food for every share the video generated. Freshpet has been a leader in the utilization of digital viral videos which gain many millions of views and in addition significant levels of PR in Mashable,[17] Huffington post,[18] previously Freshpet has released the Freshpet Holiday Feast – 13 Dogs and 1 Cat Eating with Human Hands and the Apparently Kid’s First Ever TV Commercial. According to Katie Tyson,[19] Freshpet’s Marketing Manager, Apparently Kid’s First Ever TV Commercial was released to "drive brand awareness."
Philanthropic Activities[edit]
In April 2014, it was reported in MediaPost[20] that Freshpet in partnership with Whole Foods Market intends to introduce a national poster contest. Each Whole Foods Market store will design a poster and Freshpet will make donation to the winning store’s favorite pet charity.
The Youtube video “Le Holiday Feast” was a joint venture between Freshpet and the Humane Society of Utah[21] to help animals find permanent homes. This collaborative effort was able to collect supplies and donations for many animal shelters. Freshpet also offered to pay the adoption fees and provide the families with a supply of pet food to get them started.[22] In June 2015, Richard Thompson, Freshpet’s CEO, presented a check of $6,500 to Colonial Regional Police Department Chief Roy Seiple in support of the department's K-9 Unit.[23]

Freshpet is an American manufacturer of refrigerated food and treats for dogs and cats using natural ingredients, and are the first in the fresh and refrigerated category to be distributed across North America.[1] It was founded in 2006 and combines meats with fruits and vegetables to make foods and treats for pets.[2][3] Freshpet stock is traded on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol "FRPT".[4]
Pet foods manufactured by this company are available in over 10,000 stores in North America,[5] including mass-market stores, natural food retailers, pet specialty stores, and retailers Target, Whole Foods, petco,[6] petsmart[7] and Walmart.[2][8]
While sales in other pet food categories were declining due to the recession, the frozen/refrigerated dog food market grew by 10% in 2010, with similar growth in the refrigerated cat food market. According to Pet Market Outlook 2011-2012, "this growth is attributable almost exclusively to the efforts of Freshpet." While frozen/refrigerated pet food still represents less than one percent of total pet food sales, sales in this particular segment are expected to grow by 25% on a compounded annual basis through 2015.[9] Freshpet also has Freshpet Vet site where veterinarians can gain detailed information on which fresh pet food is best to recommend to pet patients.[10]
Freshpet foods are packed fresh and must be served accordingly. Just like the refrigerated food that humans eat, "Pet parents" must ensure that purchase and serving is within expiration date.

Manufacturing facility[edit]
In 2013, Freshpet opened a new manufacturing facility, the Freshpet Kitchens, located in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. This new $25 million facility was built to resemble human-grade manufacturing standards. All Freshpet food recipes are manufactured in this facility.[3]
Products[edit]
Freshpet food makes refrigerated dog and cat foods and dog treats under the brands Freshpet Select, Dog Joy, Vital, Nature's Fresh and Dognation. Freshpet Select foods and Dog Joy treats are sold at grocery and mass merchandise retailers. Vital foods, and Dognation treats are sold at pet specialty retailers. Nature's Fresh foods are sold at natural retailers. Freshpet Vital Raw selection consists of ready to serve refrigerated raw meals for dogs. The recipes include probiotics with raw chicken or beef and kale, spinach and sweet potatoes.
Freshpet Vital Whole Blends are mix-ins for dogs, dedicated to specific needs such as dental health, immunity and digestion. They can be added on top of Freshpet dog food or any other food for added nutrition.
Fresh Baked is Freshpet’s dry dog food recipe range. According to Freshpet it is made with 100% fresh poultry, real fruits and vegetables. Freshpet also claims it does not contain any processed meat meals and is made using the latest technology that allows cooking at low temperatures.
Freshpet announced in 2016 that more recipe options for cats would be offered. New recipes would include slice and serve rolls and reseal able cat cups in gravy.
Minimal processing[edit]
Unlike traditional shelf-stable pet foods, Freshpet ingredients are cooked once at lower temperatures. Thus, similar to less-processed foods such as milk, natural cooked meats and yogurt, the meals have a shorter shelf life.
Media exposure[edit]
During the 2007 pet food recalls, being one of the few pet food companies not affected, Freshpet capitalized on the opportunity and had record-high sales.[11] The New York Times reported that as of April 2013, Freshpet sales revenue grew more than 44 percent.[3] In the fall of 2013, the Associated Press wrote a feature article on Freshpet food and the growing trend of buying holistic food for pets.[5] In September 2014 Freshpet placed at number 8 on Google’s YouTube Ad Leaderboard, which ranks the 10 most-viewed commercials posted to the site in that month. The commercial starred YouTube celebrity, Noah Ritter - nicknamed "Apparently Kid," garnering 3.2 million views.[12] In 2011 Freshpet signed with Darling Agency of New York as its first agency of record. The agency created a TV campaign that aired on ABC, CBS and NBC. The 30 sec and two 15 seconds spots ran during The View,[13] Good Morning America, The Today Show and Rachael Ray. Fresh Pet ads also ran on cable networks. According to Kathryn Winstanley, VP of Marketing at Freshpet, the target audience for Freshpet food is ‘empty nesters’[14] between the ages 45 – 54, whose household income is in excess of $100,000.
Viral YouTube Video[edit]
On December 7, 2015, Freshpet uploaded the Santa Elves video on their YouTube page with 458,618 views so far.[15] The video was made in collaboration with the Salt Lake County Animal Services[16] and Freshpet donated one meal of Freshpet food for every share the video generated. Freshpet has been a leader in the utilization of digital viral videos which gain many millions of views and in addition significant levels of PR in Mashable,[17] Huffington post,[18] previously Freshpet has released the Freshpet Holiday Feast – 13 Dogs and 1 Cat Eating with Human Hands and the Apparently Kid’s First Ever TV Commercial. According to Katie Tyson,[19] Freshpet’s Marketing Manager, Apparently Kid’s First Ever TV Commercial was released to "drive brand awareness."
Philanthropic Activities[edit]
In April 2014, it was reported in MediaPost[20] that Freshpet in partnership with Whole Foods Market intends to introduce a national poster contest. Each Whole Foods Market store will design a poster and Freshpet will make donation to the winning store’s favorite pet charity.
The Youtube video “Le Holiday Feast” was a joint venture between Freshpet and the Humane Society of Utah[21] to help animals find permanent homes. This collaborative effort was able to collect supplies and donations for many animal shelters. Freshpet also offered to pay the adoption fees and provide the families with a supply of pet food to get them started.[22] In June 2015, Richard Thompson, Freshpet’s CEO, presented a check of $6,500 to Colonial Regional Police Department Chief Roy Seiple in support of the department's K-9 Unit.[23]

Freshpet is an American manufacturer of refrigerated food and treats for dogs and cats using natural ingredients, and are the first in the fresh and refrigerated category to be distributed across North America.[1] It was founded in 2006 and combines meats with fruits and vegetables to make foods and treats for pets.[2][3] Freshpet stock is traded on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol "FRPT".[4]
Pet foods manufactured by this company are available in over 10,000 stores in North America,[5] including mass-market stores, natural food retailers, pet specialty stores, and retailers Target, Whole Foods, petco,[6] petsmart[7] and Walmart.[2][8]
While sales in other pet food categories were declining due to the recession, the frozen/refrigerated dog food market grew by 10% in 2010, with similar growth in the refrigerated cat food market. According to Pet Market Outlook 2011-2012, "this growth is attributable almost exclusively to the efforts of Freshpet." While frozen/refrigerated pet food still represents less than one percent of total pet food sales, sales in this particular segment are expected to grow by 25% on a compounded annual basis through 2015.[9] Freshpet also has Freshpet Vet site where veterinarians can gain detailed information on which fresh pet food is best to recommend to pet patients.[10]
Freshpet foods are packed fresh and must be served accordingly. Just like the refrigerated food that humans eat, "Pet parents" must ensure that purchase and serving is within expiration date.

Manufacturing facility[edit]
In 2013, Freshpet opened a new manufacturing facility, the Freshpet Kitchens, located in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. This new $25 million facility was built to resemble human-grade manufacturing standards. All Freshpet food recipes are manufactured in this facility.[3]
Products[edit]
Freshpet food makes refrigerated dog and cat foods and dog treats under the brands Freshpet Select, Dog Joy, Vital, Nature's Fresh and Dognation. Freshpet Select foods and Dog Joy treats are sold at grocery and mass merchandise retailers. Vital foods, and Dognation treats are sold at pet specialty retailers. Nature's Fresh foods are sold at natural retailers. Freshpet Vital Raw selection consists of ready to serve refrigerated raw meals for dogs. The recipes include probiotics with raw chicken or beef and kale, spinach and sweet potatoes.
Freshpet Vital Whole Blends are mix-ins for dogs, dedicated to specific needs such as dental health, immunity and digestion. They can be added on top of Freshpet dog food or any other food for added nutrition.
Fresh Baked is Freshpet’s dry dog food recipe range. According to Freshpet it is made with 100% fresh poultry, real fruits and vegetables. Freshpet also claims it does not contain any processed meat meals and is made using the latest technology that allows cooking at low temperatures.
Freshpet announced in 2016 that more recipe options for cats would be offered. New recipes would include slice and serve rolls and reseal able cat cups in gravy.
Minimal processing[edit]
Unlike traditional shelf-stable pet foods, Freshpet ingredients are cooked once at lower temperatures. Thus, similar to less-processed foods such as milk, natural cooked meats and yogurt, the meals have a shorter shelf life.
Media exposure[edit]
During the 2007 pet food recalls, being one of the few pet food companies not affected, Freshpet capitalized on the opportunity and had record-high sales.[11] The New York Times reported that as of April 2013, Freshpet sales revenue grew more than 44 percent.[3] In the fall of 2013, the Associated Press wrote a feature article on Freshpet food and the growing trend of buying holistic food for pets.[5] In September 2014 Freshpet placed at number 8 on Google’s YouTube Ad Leaderboard, which ranks the 10 most-viewed commercials posted to the site in that month.

The agency created a TV campaign that aired on ABC, CBS and NBC. The 30 sec and two 15 seconds spots ran during The View,[13] Good Morning America, The Today Show and Rachael Ray.

About Freshpet




Our Mission & Values
Our Story
Meet the Team
Our Commercials









Mission & Values
Our Mission
To improve the lives of dogs and cats everywhere through the
power of fresh, natural food.
Our Values

We seek to revolutionize the pet food industry through innovation. We challenge accepted wisdom about what’s best for our pets. We work to be transparent and honest in every facet of our business. We strive to do what’s right for pets, people, and the planet. 







Mission & Values














Our Story
When we started Freshpet, we knew we could make better foods for pets. In the process of building the company, we wanted to change the industry through positive innovation that is good for pets, pet parents and the planet all at the same time.

We set out on a mission to revolutionize the way all pets are fed by making fresh, natural food. We gathered a team of the best in both pet and human food and in October 2006, we were cooking nutritious, fresh meals for pets. Soon, our little company started to grow and we found ourselves delivering fresh, refrigerated pet food to more and more stores.

We are incredibly proud and humbled that over 1 million pet parents now use our food from our retail network of over 15,000 fridges across North America. 

It’s amazing what can happen when you start completely fresh!

                                                            Discard the packaging around the cut slices

Since Freshpet is gently cooked without any chemical preservatives, it must be sealed or covered and stored in the fridge. 
Freshpet Slice and Serve Rolls: Freshpet rolls can be stored in the fridge in a variety of ways:

Wrap the open end of the roll in plastic wrap
                                                    Cap the end of the roll to protect from oxygenation
                                                    Place either the whole roll or cut up slices into a plastic bag
                                                




Freshpet Meals 




Using a standard measuring cup, pour the morsels into the measuring cup to reach the calculated food amount for your pet, then serve
                                            
Freshpet Meals:

Freshpet meals come with a convenient seal along the top of the bag. Just close the seal and store in the fridge after meal time

We are thrilled that you’re considering switching your pet to fresh food. But it’s still important to transition slowly so the change is gentle on your pet’s tummy.

Start by feeding both Freshpet and your pet’s current food, and increase the amount of Freshpet every few days, while decreasing your pet’s current food. Then enjoy the change in your pet’s appetite at feeding time, and the lasting benefits you’ll notice from our nutritionally balanced meals.

The Company’s core fresh refrigerated product offering grew 12.2% as compared to the same period in the prior year.

Gross profit was $15.8 million, or 45.8% as a percentage of net sales for the first quarter of 2017, compared to $14.9 million, or 47.3% as a percentage of net sales, in the same period last year. For the first quarter 2017, Adjusted Gross Profit was $17.2 million, or 49.9% as a percentage of net sales, compared to $15.8 million, or 50.2% as a percentage of net sales, in the prior year period.

Adjusted SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased to 51.1% compared to 49.4% in the first quarter of 2016. The increase in SG&A is primarily due to the Company’s planned increased media spend. Adjusted SG&A is a Non-GAAP financial measure defined under “Non-GAAP Measures,” and is reconciled to SG&A in the financial tables that accompany this release. Net Loss was $2.9 million for the first quarter of 2017 compared to a net loss of $1.8 million for the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA was $1.9 million for the first quarter of 2017, compared to $2.5 million in the first quarter 2016.  Adjusted EBITDA is a Non-GAAP financial measure defined under “Non-GAAP Measures,” and is reconciled to net earnings in the financial tables that accompany this release. Cash and Net Debt For the first quarter ended March 31, 2017, the Company generated cash from operations of $2.1 million compared to $2.0 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2016, and reduced its outstanding debt by $1.3 million to $5.8 million.  The Company continues to have $30.0 million available under it Credit Facility.    At March 31, 2017 the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $2.0 million. Outlook  Mr. Cyr continued, “Consistent with our Feed the Growth strategic plan, we expect to increase our media spend in 2017 by approximately 60% to drive higher awareness and capitalize on Freshpet’s high repeat rate. To date, we are very encouraged by the results and expect that over time this spend will more rapidly increase same store sales and more quickly increase new store penetration. That will position the Company well to drive long term shareholder value.” For full year 2017, the Company reiterated its guidance and continues to expect the following results compared to the prior year: To exceed Net Sales of $153 million, an increase of approximately 15%, (17% for its fresh refrigerated product offering) with an increased rate of growth throughout the year.To exceed Adjusted EBITDA of $16 million, a decrease of approximately 10%. To exceed Freshpet Fridges of over 18,200, an increase of approximately 10%. The Company does not provide guidance for the most directly comparable GAAP measure, net income, and similarly cannot provide a reconciliation between its forecasted Adjusted EBITDA and net income metrics without unreasonable effort due to the unavailability of reliable estimates for certain items, such as non-cash gains or losses resulting from mark-to-market adjustments of warrants. These items are not within the Company’s control and may vary greatly between periods and could significantly impact future financial results. Conference Call and Webcast The Company will host a conference call and webcast with the executive management team to discuss these results with additional comments and details today at 4:30 p.m. ET. The conference call webcast will be available live over the Internet through the “Investors” section of the Company’s website at www.freshpet.com.

These statements are based on management's current opinions, expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, assumptions or projections regarding future events or future results. These forward-looking statements are only predictions, not historical fact, and involve certain risks and uncertainties, as well as assumptions. Actual results, levels of activity, performance, achievements and events could differ materially from those stated, anticipated or implied by such forward-looking statements. While Freshpet believes that its assumptions are reasonable, it is very difficult to predict the impact of known factors, and, of course, it is impossible to anticipate all factors that could affect actual results. There are several risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements made herein including, most prominently, the risks discussed under the heading “Risk Factors” in the Company's latest annual report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Such forward-looking statements are made only as of the date of this release. Freshpet undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement because of new information, future events or otherwise, except as otherwise required by law. If we do update one or more forward-looking statements, no inference should be made that we will make additional updates with respect to those or other forward-looking statements. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Freshpet uses the following non-GAAP financial measures in its financial communications. These non-GAAP financial measures (collectively, “the non-GAAP financial measures”) should be considered as supplements to the GAAP reported measures, should not be considered replacements for, or superior to, the GAAP measures and may not be comparable to similarly named measures used by other companies. Adjusted Gross ProfitAdjusted Gross Profit as a % of net sales (Adjusted Gross Margin)Adjusted SG&A Adjusted SG&A as a % of net salesEBITDAAdjusted EBITDA Adjusted Gross Profit: Freshpet defines Adjusted Gross Profit as Gross Profit before plant start-up expenses and processing and plant depreciation expense. Adjusted SG&A Expenses: Freshpet defines Adjusted SG&A as SG&A expenses before non-cash items related to share-based compensation, leadership transition expenses, and fees related to a secondary offering. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA: EBITDA represents net loss plus depreciation and amortization, interest expense, and income tax expense, and Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA plus loss on disposal of equipment, plant startup expense, share-based compensation, warrant fair valuation, secondary fees, leadership transition expenses, and launch expenses. Management believes that the non-GAAP measures, are meaningful to investors because they provide a view of the Company with respect to ongoing operating results. The non-GAAP financial measures are shown as supplemental disclosures in this release because they are widely used by the investment community for analysis and comparative evaluation and provides additional metrics to evaluate the Company’s operations and, when considered with both the Company’s GAAP results and the reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measures, provides a more complete understanding of the Company’s business than could be obtained absent this disclosure. The non-GAAP measures are not and should not be considered an alternative to the most comparable GAAP measures or any other figure calculated in accordance with GAAP, or as an indicator of operating performance. The Company’s calculation of the non-GAAP financial measures may differ from methods used by other companies. Management believes that the non-GAAP measures are important to an understanding of the Company's overall operating results in the periods presented. The non-GAAP financial measures are not recognized in accordance with GAAP and should not be viewed as an alternative to GAAP measures of performance.  FRESHPET INC.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Manny'sstory
“I just wanted to say that Freshpet saved Manny's little life. He is a 3 year old 3 pound chiweenie. He was having severe stomach issues and was not doing well at all. We switched to Freshpet and now he is AWESOME and hasn't had any issues since. He has so much more energy and has even gained weight. Freshpet saved my Manny's life, thank you.”
