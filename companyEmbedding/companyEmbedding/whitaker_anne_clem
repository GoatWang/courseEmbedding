DURHAM, N.C., Jan. 26, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- KNOW Bio, LLC, a company created in late 2015 from the separation of all non- dermatological assets from Novan, Inc (NASDAQ:   NOVN), announces the hiring of Anne Clem Whitaker as CEO of its Respiratory Business. Whitaker is a seasoned bio-pharmaceutical leader with over 25 years of experience in the life science industry including senior leadership roles with large pharmaceutical, biotech and specialty pharmaceutical companies. Anne joins KNOW Bio from Valeant where she was Executive Vice President, Company Group Chairman for the past 18 months overseeing the Branded Pharmaceutical businesses. Prior to Valeant, she was the President and CEO of Synta Pharmaceuticals, a development stage oncology company which is now part of Madrigal Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Previous to her experience as CEO, she served as President of North America Pharmaceuticals at Sanofi where she oversaw all pharmaceutical and consumer healthcare operations for the region.  She also held several commercial leadership roles at GlaxoSmithKline.








Whitaker stated, "I am thrilled to be joining a company that I believe can have a dramatic impact on the lives of Cystic Fibrosis patients and their families. While there has been significant advancement in understanding cystic fibrosis, these patients continue to battle severe, chronic lung inflammation and infections. All too often, these infections and flare-ups are associated with rapid disease progression. KNOW Bio's nitric oxide technology offers the promise of multiple new therapies with the potential to make a significant impact in patients' lives, as well as the broader healthcare system. We've got a great team and I look forward to building the Company so we can improve and in some cases, save the lives of patients with Cystic Fibrosis and those with other respiratory diseases."
Neal Hunter, Chairman of KNOW Bio, LLC said, "To be able to attract someone of the caliber of Anne Whitaker speaks to the magnitude of what we've created. Anne has a long history with Cystic Fibrosis both personally and professionally. We believe this unique background when combined with her numerous leadership experiences gives us the greatest chance for success."
The technology is based on a nitric oxide platform which can be delivered as a drug in a variety of doses and release time frames. The therapeutic areas that could be impacted by this platform are immense. KNOW Bio, LLC was created to develop and optimize these applications.
Forward-looking Statements
Except for historical information, all of the statements, expectations, and assumptions contained in this press release are forward-looking statements. Actual results might differ materially from those explicit or implicit in the forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include: reliance on key personnel; the early stage of our business; risks associated with the drug development process; competition; and other risks described in other Company press releases and presentations. KNOW Bio assumes no obligation and does not intend to update these forward-looking statements, except as required by law.
