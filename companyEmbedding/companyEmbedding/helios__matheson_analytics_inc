Helios & Matheson's stock nearly doubles after acquiring facial recognition technology licensing rights
Shares of Helios & Matheson Analytics Inc.  rocketed 91% toward a 3 1/2-month high in premarket trade Tuesday, after predictive analytics company said it has acquired the licensing rights to IsItYou's facial recognition technology in the field of crime and terrorism. The technology will be integrated with RedZone's navigation app, RedZone Map, which is used for situational awareness to improve safety. "Through artificial intelligence and facial recognition technology, we will seek to develop the capability to identify dangerous people entering an area and notify our users in real time," said RedZone founder Ted Farnsworth. Helios & Matheson's stock had tumbled 26% year to date through Monday, while the S&P 500  had gained 6.9%.

Helios & Matheson's stock nearly doubles after acquiring facial recognition technology licensing rights
Shares of Helios & Matheson Analytics Inc.  rocketed 91% toward a 3 1/2-month high in premarket trade Tuesday, after predictive analytics company said it has acquired the licensing rights to IsItYou's facial recognition technology in the field of crime and terrorism. The technology will be integrated with RedZone's navigation app, RedZone Map, which is used for situational awareness to improve safety. "Through artificial intelligence and facial recognition technology, we will seek to develop the capability to identify dangerous people entering an area and notify our users in real time," said RedZone founder Ted Farnsworth. Helios & Matheson's stock had tumbled 26% year to date through Monday, while the S&P 500  had gained 6.9%.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades.

MIAMI and NEW YORK, June 6, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Helios and Matheson Analytics Inc. (NASDAQ:   HMNY), a provider of integrated Big Data technology, advanced analytics and data visualization solutions to Fortune 500 companies, and Zone Technologies, Inc., creator of RedZone Maps, a GPS-driven, real-time crime and navigation map application, announced today that they plan to merge. With the new partnership, Helios and Matheson plans to leverage its artificial intelligence capabilities and deep learning and analytics expertise to enable RedZone Maps to further expand its crime mapping capabilities globally. The pending merger is subject to approval by the NASDAQ Stock Market, among other customary closing conditions.


Having achieved fourth place in the App Store's navigation category behind Google and Waze in its first week out of beta, RedZone Maps' GPS-driven, real-time crime and navigation map application empowers consumers to identify "red zones" – concentrations of highly reported crime in an area – and helps navigators obtain optimal cautionary alerts that can be shared with others. In addition to expanding RedZone Maps' mapping capabilities, RedZone Maps expects Helios and Matheson's expertise to enable it to monitor chatter on all social media platforms internationally and instantaneously retrieve real-time crime data from around the world. 
In discussing the pending merger, Ted Farnsworth, Founder and CEO of RedZone Maps, said, "Upon discovering Helios and Matheson's cutting edge capabilities in Big Data analytics and artificial intelligence, we saw the synergy immediately. I believe the combined company will be able to offer the most sophisticated and advanced technology in global crime mapping. Our mission is to enhance personal safety worldwide."
Pat Krishnan, Helios and Matheson's CEO agrees. "With my many years of computer sciences and engineering management experience in Silicon Valley, I recognized our synergy immediately. Helios and Matheson has worked tirelessly to empower its clients and customers to unlock the value of data to make better decisions.  We plan to expand that mission through our pending merger with RedZone Maps."

	Item 1.01     Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.





	 




	On May 18, 2017, Helios and Matheson Analytics Inc. (the “Company”) entered into an Amended and Restated License Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Is It You Ltd., an Israeli company (“Licensor”), which is engaged in developing and marketing software that enables face recognition authentication and verification of users on mobile smartphones. Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company was granted a perpetual, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive right and license (a) to integrate the licensed software with the Company’s RedZone Map™


	family of products, applications, and services (the “RedZone Apps”) to create integrated service offerings that integrate and/or incorporate the licensed software with the RedZone Apps (the “Integrated Offerings”); (b) to commercialize, distribute, and sell the Integrated Offerings to customers worldwide; (c) to use the licensed software internally to create a non-commercial lab/testing environment; and (d) to use the licensed software to provide maintenance and support services to customers of the Integrated Offerings.




	 




	Pursuant to the Agreement, Licensor agreed to not license, sell or transfer the licensed software to any third party that wishes to integrate the licensed software with applications that compete with the Company’s Integrated Offerings relating to crime and terrorism mapping applications.




	 




	In consideration of the license, the Company shall pay Licensor a one-time license fee in the amount of $** (the “License Fee”) for up to 1.6 million end-user licenses (the “License Fee”). In addition, (i) in the event that the Company exceeds 1.6 million users of the Integrated Offerings, it shall pay Licensor an additional one-time license fee




	of $** for up to an aggregate of 20 million end-user licenses; (ii) in the event that the Company exceeds 20 million users of the Integrated Offerings, it shall pay Licensor an additional one-time license fee of $** for up to an aggregate of 100 million end-user licenses; and (iii) in the event the Company exceeds 100 million users of the Integrated Offerings, it will negotiate with Licensor the additional compensation to be paid to Licensor.




	 




	Under the Agreement, at no additional charge, Licensor will provide professional services for a 30-day period in connection with the installation, testing and integration of the licensed software. Licensor will also provide maintenance and support services for the licensed software, including providing updates and enhancements and assisting with identifying and correcting errors. The License Fee includes maintenance and support during the first year of the Agreement. Beginning with the first anniversary of delivery of the licensed software, the Company will pay Licensor an annual maintenance fee which shall be **.



	 



	The Agreement has an initial term of 5 years and shall be automatically renewed for additional one-year terms unless either party gives the other party 60 days advanced notice of termination prior to the expiration of the then-current term. Except for termination of the Agreement by Licensor for breach by the Company, notwithstanding any termination or expiration of the Agreement, (i) the perpetual license shall remain in effect; and (ii) the Company shall have the right to order and Licensor shall have the obligation to provide annual support services at the price set forth in the Agreement for up to 5 years from the effective date of termination. The Agreement may be terminated at any time by either party (i) if the other party materially breaches the Agreement and continues in such breach for 30 days after receiving notice from the non-breaching party; or (ii) for a period of 90 consecutive days, the other party is declared to be insolvent or is the subject of bankruptcy or liquidation proceedings, or has a receiver, judicial administrator or similar officer appointed over all or any material part of its assets, or any security holder or encumbrance lawfully takes possession of any property of or in possession of the other party, or if the other party ceases to carry on its business.




	 






	The Agreement also includes certain customary representations and warranties and indemnification obligations of each party.

	a) that the Integrated Offerings (other than the Licensed Software component) infringes any patent, copyright, or trademark or misappropriates a trade secret of a third party, or (b) that arises out of or relates to any actual or alleged personal or bodily injury (including, without limitation, death) or damage to tangible property caused by the Integrated Offerings (other than the Licensed Software component), and will indemnify and hold harmless the Licensor Indemnified Parties against all Damages against the Licensor Indemnified Parties by a court of competent jurisdiction, or agreed to in a written settlement agreement, arising out of such Claim.




	 




	9.4     

	Defense

	. The indemnified party will provide the indemnifying party with (a) prompt written notice if it learns of such claim (provided that failure to provide timely notice shall not relieve the indemnifying party of its indemnity obligations to the extent the indemnifying party is not prejudiced by such failure), (b) information and reasonable assistance (at the indemnifying party's expense) necessary to settle and/or defend any such claim or action, and (c) the authority to control the defense or settlement of such claim, provided that: (i) the indemnifying party permits the indemnified party to participate in the defense and settlement of any such claim, at its own expense, with counsel of its choosing; (ii) the indemnifying party shall not enter into or acquiesce to any settlement containing any admission of or stipulation to any guilt, fault, liability or wrongdoing on the part of any indemnified party or otherwise purporting to create any obligation on the indemnified party without the indemnified party's prior written consent (to be given or withheld in the indemnified party's reasonable discretion).

	10.2     EXCEPT WITH REGARD TO A BREACH OF CONFIDENTIALITY OR A PARTY'S INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS HEREUNDER, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY’S LIABILITY TO THE OTHER EXCEED THE AMOUNT PAID BY LICENSEE FOR THE LICENSED SOFTWARE.

	11.







	Confidentiality







	 




	11.1     Each party hereby acknowledges that it may be exposed to confidential and proprietary information of the other party including, without limitation, software and other technical information (including functional and technical specifications, designs, drawings, analysis, research, processes, computer programs, algorithms, methods, ideas, "know how" and the like); business information (sales and marketing research, materials, plans, accounting and financial information, personnel records and the like); trade secrets; and other information designated as confidential expressly or by the circumstances in which it is provided or which is confidential by nature ("

	Confidential Information

Each party shall use at least the same degree of care in safeguarding the other party's Confidential Information as it uses in safeguarding its own confidential information.




	 




	11.3     Each party acknowledges that the unauthorized use, commercialization or disclosure of the other party's Confidential Information would cause irreparable harm to such other party. The parties acknowledge that remedies at law would be inadequate to redress the actual or threatened unauthorized use, commercialization, or disclosure of such Confidential Information and that the foregoing restrictions may be enforced by temporary and permanent injunctive relief without necessity of posting bond. In addition, any award of injunctive relief shall include recovery of associated costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees).




	 







	12.

	EXHIBIT A






	 





	THE LICENSED SOFTWARE





	 




	 




	Licensor develops and markets software that enables face recognition authentication and verification of users on mobile smartphones (Android and iOS). This software is provided as a Software Development Kit ("

	SDK

	") that can be used by third parties to add face recognition authentication to their own applications.




	 




	The Licensed Software is designed, at its core, to allow the biometric enrollment of one user per device (although more can be allowed) and verify that user’s identity based on face recognition technology that Licensor developed.




	 




	Additionally, the SDK includes what is commonly known in the biometrics industry as “anti-spoof” functionality. Anti-spoof, in this context, means the ability of the face recognition software to distinguish between a real person and a facsimile of that same person. As an example, when properly deployed, the software would be able to distinguish between a real person’s face, and a photograph of that same person presented on a screen.

	Helios and Matheson Analytics and RedZone






	Acquire License to Facial Recognition Technology






	From Israeli Biometrics Technology Company, IsItYou™






	 






	RedZone Map



	TM



	to Integrate Facial Recognition Technology with Its Proprietary






	Artificial Intelligence Solution to Enhance Situational Awareness






	 






	MIAMI & NEW YORK (May 23, 2017)—

	Helios and Matheson Analytics Inc. (NASDAQ: HMNY) and RedZone, creator of the RedZone Map™ navigation app, a tool for situational awareness and enhancement of personal safety, announced today that Helios and Matheson Analytics has acquired global licensing rights to IsItYou’s facial recognition technology in the field of crime and terrorism for integration with RedZone Map.




	 




	RedZone plans to integrate RedZone Map’s artificial intelligence technology and proprietary real-time crime database with IsItYou’s facial recognition technology. Through the integration of IsItYou and RedZone Map, RedZone plans to enable RedZone Map users to identify persons whose image they are able to capture on the user’s smartphone camera or video, if the identification can be obtained through RedZone’s available data sources and artificial intelligence technology.




	 




	In the future, RedZone plans to develop the capability of delivering real-time notifications of criminally active individuals in a user’s area – such as large events or public spaces, by seeking permitted access to publicly located surveillance cameras operated by private enterprises or government entities.




	 




	RedZone expects that the integration of IsItYou’s facial recognition technology with RedZone’s real time crime map will further enhance the personal safety of its users in the United States and internationally.




	 






	 


	 




	 




	 




	“Through artificial intelligence and facial recognition technology, we will seek to develop the capability to identify dangerous people entering an area and notify our users in real time,” said Ted Farnsworth, founder of RedZone. “Sending notifications to our users of when their safety is more likely at risk, whether at a concert, in a shopping mall, or simply walking down the street, would greatly increase the utility of RedZone Map to our users. This is a key goal in our continuing development of RedZone Map.”




	 




	RedZone has begun integrating and plans to continue integrating the facial recognition technology with its real-time crime/navigation app over the coming months.




	 





	About RedZone Map





	RedZone (Zone Technologies, Inc.) is a state-of-the-art mapping and spatial analysis company with operations in the U.S. and Israel. It has created a community-based ecosystem that features a socially empowered safety map app that enhances mobile GPS navigation using advanced proprietary technology to guide users to their destinations, giving them a choice of a safer route vs. a riskier route.
