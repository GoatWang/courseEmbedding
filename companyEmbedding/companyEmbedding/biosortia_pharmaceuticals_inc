It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer. But what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality.
Rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy, immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread. Research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients, including kidney and lung cancer. In fact, research from the American Association for Cancer Research shows that for advanced-melanoma patients, survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options.
"It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer." Tweet
Biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types.
With 836 medicines and vaccines in development for cancer, 80 percent of which have the potential to be first-in-class treatments, millions of Americans living with cancer have hope for a brighter future.
Welcome to the new era of medicine.
For all of us.

HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

















HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

Diabetes is a serious condition that effects more than 30 million Americans. While complications of the disease can be dire, there is hope. Biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments.
Diabetes: the patient perspective
Diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose (sugar) in the blood. Normally, the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy. With diabetes, the body either does not make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or does not use it properly (type 2 diabetes), leading to high blood glucose levels. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications, such as heart attack, lower-limb amputation, vision impairment and blindness.
Endocrinologist Dr. William "Bill" Chin has experience treating endocrine disorders, including diabetes. As chief medical officer at PhRMA, he works to ensure that patient voices are heard, drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes. When Dr. Chin's son, Danny, was 15, he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst. Dr. Chin diagnosed his son himself with type 1 diabetes.
He says, "I don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease, particularly one that will be chronic. In many ways it’s forever, but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed."
The changing landscape of diabetes treatment
The medications that Danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years. A decade ago, a number of insulin options were available to patients, as well as oral and injected medications. Successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels. To control their glucose, patients needed multiple daily injections and/or multiple oral medicines.
In recent years, researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients, from fewer pills to less frequent injections. Careful monitoring and treatment are still needed, but current medicines in development offer a promising future.
There are 171 medicines currently in development for type 1 and type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related conditions. A new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels. Other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetes-related complications that affect the kidneys, blood vessels and eyes. All of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the FDA.
While these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type 1 diabetes, ongoing research remains critical. In fact, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2013.
Dr. Chin says, "Collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes ... we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease. This can only be achieved by having academic scientists and physician scientists working closely with scientists in the biopharmaceutical industry."

Biosortia Finds New Medicines
Biosortia Pharmaceuticals is the only company directly bringing the deep dark chemistry of any microbiome
into drug discovery with the most sought after drug-like molecules that are generally unobtainable to researchers.
Biosortia is digging into actual unknown microbiome chemistry at 100,000 to 1,000,000 times deeper than
science has typically explored. We have proprietary technologies and capabilities to rapidly fill a discovery pipeline
with high priority unmet needs in key therapeutic areas. There is an unfilled continuous need by Pharma and
investment groups to find and exploit IND stage assets. Biosortia Pharmaceuticals is focused on early stage
drug discovery to generally an IND stage exit for risk share licensing to pharma or spinning-out into a new
company.
This is the most exciting breakthrough in access to new meaningful natural product chemistry for drugs, potentially
opening the 99% of unculturable microorganisms in situ to discovery. As a reference; the 1% of culturable
microorganisms have led directly or indirectly to more the 25% of the drugs on the market today.
Our Vision is to improve human health with our new valuable chemistry!



Researchers around the world recognize the opportunity
to find new medicines from various microbiome habitats.

What is a microbiome?
Simply put it is “the microbial community occupying a reasonably well-defined habitat which has distinct Physico-chemical properties. The term thus not only refers to the microorganisms involved but also encompasses their theaters of activity.” *The term was first used in 2000 and
in print 2001.
Historically, Microbiome has Delivered a Wealth of New Drugs.
Microbiome Access via Culturing: Historically More than 25% of the drugs on the shelf have directly or indirectly came from culturable organisms.  Even today, culturing microorganism is a successful approach to obtaining elicited chemistry from the 1% of microbes that can be cultured and the 2% of those that elicit chemistry in a culture which leaves greater than 99% of microorganisms that can’t be cultured as virtually inaccessible.  Various strategies to encourage growth of unculturable microorganisms with elicited chemistry could improve rates and many researchers around the world continue to investigate. 


Genetic Mining of the Microbiome: Research in the early 1990's and various follow-on attempts to commercialize have advanced the general science of combinatorial genetics, but like combinatorial chemistry, the mathematical likelihood of delivering predictable success is near infinity. The brilliance of natural evolutionary design and the complexity of the process and results are not easy to construct with various snippets of genetics and chemistry in a lab. Thus progress toward meaningful drug-like compounds will likely remain evasive for decades


Combinatorial chemistry has a minimum of  1 x 10500 options for small molecules less than 500 Da and combinatorial genetics has options well in excess of that of combinatorial chemistry when including environmental factors and external precursor chemistry (real world).  So what does 1 x 10500  really mean in terms of testing a new compound?  Well if you had a laboratory create enough starting material and test (assay) a billion x billion (1,000,000,000,000,000,000) compounds per second for the next 8 billion years you will have only tested 2.52288 x 1035 or a miniscule and meaningless fraction of the possibilities.   These numbers alone explain why combinatorial chemistry has been such a bust with billions spent annually for decades and only one drug on the market.  Proven to be a complete non-starter driving up the costs of approved drugs dramatically.


So why does nature (natural products) have such an advantage - simply evolution has done more than 1 x 10500 testing per second for 3.4 billion years because of all the tried mutations but rarely kept.  This simply says the chemistry we seek for new drugs is there for the taking.  Look in the right places and a wealth of new cures will be found. 

.


Biosortia’s Prospecting of Microbiome Chemistry
Currently Biosortia’s unique technologies allow for recovery of the actual microorganisms of the microbiome from the aquatic environment** at a quality and quantity that allows direct chemical prospecting.  This approach is similar to culturing except the culture is the natural habitat of the aquatic microbiome.  The previous phenomenal successes in finding new drugs from the 1% culturable microorganisms allow a incredibly high probability of finding new meaningful opportunities from new access to the 99% that has remained truly inaccessible.

*http://www.microbe.net/2015/04/08/what-does-the-term-microbiome-mean-and-where-did-it-come-from-a-bit-of-a-surprise/

HISTORY

SEC FILINGS





Biosortia Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
It is our mission to find new compounds for high priority unmet needs in pharmaceuticals.

Advancement of the resulting derivatives of new previously unobtainable drug-like natural

compounds from various natural aquatic microbiomes to a licensable revenue event near

IND (investigational new drug - a start of development and the end of discovery) is the

company’s business. The initial focus is immuno-oncology, oncology, and anti-inflammatory

opportunities. We recognize the unparalleled access to the microbiome will

present opportunities in various therapeutic areas with

desperate needs for discovery.

The company has unique capabilities to recover

massive amounts of microbiome (consortia of

microorganisms biomass) in situ while preserving the

integrity and access to the drug-like secondary

metabolites opening the door to undiscovered

chemistry from nature. The deconvolu-
tion processing of the biomass begins with

preservation, extraction, fractionation and

initial testing. We are continuing to scale our capabilities to deconvolute the resulting

chemical materials to match the bioprospecting harvesting capacity.
Funding is the major limit to Biosortia’s current capacity to discover and advance novel

pharmaceutical discovery opportunities.









History
Biosortia Pharmaceuticals, Inc. focused efforts as drug discovery company in 2012. During

2012-14 the company worked hard to adapt and advance the original AVS technology for the in

situ recovery of microorganisms. Proof and technological improvement of deep access to the

dark chemical material of secondary metabolites were conducted by our scientists simultaneously.

The original technology was supported by ARPA-E (Advanced Research Project Agency of the

U.S. Department of Energy) during 2009-2011.




By the mid-2015, the company completed of the final designs of the proprietary harvesting technology along with the construction of a full-scale system. Biosortia’s team recognized the historical success of finding drug-like compounds from the minuscule number of culturable micro-organisms (the 1%) and believed a substantial increase in access to unculturable microorganisms (the 99%) would equate to more opportunities to find new drugs. The belief was simple: if you could recover unculturable microorganisms on a scale to obtain the actual chemistry, it would open the door to discovery, much like the Hubble telescope opened the doors to the previously unseen Universe.
Biosortia unlocks the aquatic microbial environment, the new drug frontier of discovery in a new and completely different strategy than researchers have ever pursued.

Now is the time to put the accelerator to the floor. The best is yet to come – like advancements in personalized medicine and immunotherapy – and it's coming faster than we can imagine.
Welcome to the future of medicine. Where disease is no match for tenacity. No match for ingenuity. Where together, we go boldly.

This is the most exciting time in the history of medicine. Millions of people around the world are benefiting from breakthrough treatments that save, extend and improve life.
Research, technology and genomics are coming together to create a platform that allows researchers to decipher the cause of disease as never before. Each advance opens new doors, new cures, new treatments.
And yet, it’s not enough.
"Today's breakthroughs become tomorrow's medicines." Tweet
Cures don’t appear on a schedule. In search of the unknowable, in search of curing the incurable, there is no one map, no singular template, no predictable milestones.
Finding lifesaving medicines is a life’s work – the work of thousands of researchers who never say never. It's also the work of millions of patients who fight side by side with researchers in the battle for life, against whatever odds they face together.
Now is the time to put the accelerator to the floor. The best is yet to come – like groundbreaking advances in immunotherapy and personalized medicine – where the once impossible is now reality.
Welcome to the future of medicine. Where disease is no match for tenacity. No match for ingenuity. Where together, we go boldly.
Dylan Thomas penned "Do not go gentle into that good night" in 1947, but the sentiment is as timely today as it ever was. Millions of Americans are battling serious illnesses, but they’re not alone in the fight. They have the support of thousands of biopharmaceutical researchers whose lives are dedicated to helping patients go boldly into longer, healthier, and more productive lives.

It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer. But what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality.
Rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy, immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread. Research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients, including kidney and lung cancer. In fact, research from the American Association for Cancer Research shows that for advanced-melanoma patients, survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options.
"It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer." Tweet
Biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types.
With 836 medicines and vaccines in development for cancer, 80 percent of which have the potential to be first-in-class treatments, millions of Americans living with cancer have hope for a brighter future.
Welcome to the new era of medicine.
For all of us.

HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

Diabetes is a serious condition that effects more than 30 million Americans. While complications of the disease can be dire, there is hope. Biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments.
Diabetes: the patient perspective
Diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose (sugar) in the blood. Normally, the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy. With diabetes, the body either does not make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or does not use it properly (type 2 diabetes), leading to high blood glucose levels. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications, such as heart attack, lower-limb amputation, vision impairment and blindness.
Endocrinologist Dr. William "Bill" Chin has experience treating endocrine disorders, including diabetes. As chief medical officer at PhRMA, he works to ensure that patient voices are heard, drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes. When Dr. Chin's son, Danny, was 15, he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst. Dr. Chin diagnosed his son himself with type 1 diabetes.
He says, "I don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease, particularly one that will be chronic. In many ways it’s forever, but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed."
The changing landscape of diabetes treatment
The medications that Danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years. A decade ago, a number of insulin options were available to patients, as well as oral and injected medications. Successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels. To control their glucose, patients needed multiple daily injections and/or multiple oral medicines.
In recent years, researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients, from fewer pills to less frequent injections. Careful monitoring and treatment are still needed, but current medicines in development offer a promising future.
There are 171 medicines currently in development for type 1 and type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related conditions. A new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels. Other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetes-related complications that affect the kidneys, blood vessels and eyes. All of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the FDA.
While these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type 1 diabetes, ongoing research remains critical. In fact, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2013.
Dr. Chin says, "Collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes ... we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease. This can only be achieved by having academic scientists and physician scientists working closely with scientists in the biopharmaceutical industry."

Biosortia Finds New Medicines
Biosortia Pharmaceuticals is the only company directly bringing the deep dark chemistry of any microbiome
into drug discovery with the most sought after drug-like molecules that are generally unobtainable to researchers.
Biosortia is digging into actual unknown microbiome chemistry at 100,000 to 1,000,000 times deeper than
science has typically explored. We have proprietary technologies and capabilities to rapidly fill a discovery pipeline
with high priority unmet needs in key therapeutic areas. There is an unfilled continuous need by Pharma and
investment groups to find and exploit IND stage assets. Biosortia Pharmaceuticals is focused on early stage
drug discovery to generally an IND stage exit for risk share licensing to pharma or spinning-out into a new
company.
This is the most exciting breakthrough in access to new meaningful natural product chemistry for drugs, potentially
opening the 99% of unculturable microorganisms in situ to discovery. As a reference; the 1% of culturable
microorganisms have led directly or indirectly to more the 25% of the drugs on the market today.
Our Vision is to improve human health with our new valuable chemistry!



Researchers around the world recognize the opportunity
to find new medicines from various microbiome habitats.

What is a microbiome?
Simply put it is “the microbial community occupying a reasonably well-defined habitat which has distinct Physico-chemical properties. The term thus not only refers to the microorganisms involved but also encompasses their theaters of activity.” *The term was first used in 2000 and
in print 2001.
Historically, Microbiome has Delivered a Wealth of New Drugs.
Microbiome Access via Culturing: Historically More than 25% of the drugs on the shelf have directly or indirectly came from culturable organisms.  Even today, culturing microorganism is a successful approach to obtaining elicited chemistry from the 1% of microbes that can be cultured and the 2% of those that elicit chemistry in a culture which leaves greater than 99% of microorganisms that can’t be cultured as virtually inaccessible.  Various strategies to encourage growth of unculturable microorganisms with elicited chemistry could improve rates and many researchers around the world continue to investigate. 


Genetic Mining of the Microbiome: Research in the early 1990's and various follow-on attempts to commercialize have advanced the general science of combinatorial genetics, but like combinatorial chemistry, the mathematical likelihood of delivering predictable success is near infinity. The brilliance of natural evolutionary design and the complexity of the process and results are not easy to construct with various snippets of genetics and chemistry in a lab. Thus progress toward meaningful drug-like compounds will likely remain evasive for decades


Combinatorial chemistry has a minimum of  1 x 10500 options for small molecules less than 500 Da and combinatorial genetics has options well in excess of that of combinatorial chemistry when including environmental factors and external precursor chemistry (real world).  So what does 1 x 10500  really mean in terms of testing a new compound?  Well if you had a laboratory create enough starting material and test (assay) a billion x billion (1,000,000,000,000,000,000) compounds per second for the next 8 billion years you will have only tested 2.52288 x 1035 or a miniscule and meaningless fraction of the possibilities.   These numbers alone explain why combinatorial chemistry has been such a bust with billions spent annually for decades and only one drug on the market.  Proven to be a complete non-starter driving up the costs of approved drugs dramatically.


So why does nature (natural products) have such an advantage - simply evolution has done more than 1 x 10500 testing per second for 3.4 billion years because of all the tried mutations but rarely kept.  This simply says the chemistry we seek for new drugs is there for the taking.  Look in the right places and a wealth of new cures will be found. 

.


Biosortia’s Prospecting of Microbiome Chemistry
Currently Biosortia’s unique technologies allow for recovery of the actual microorganisms of the microbiome from the aquatic environment** at a quality and quantity that allows direct chemical prospecting.  This approach is similar to culturing except the culture is the natural habitat of the aquatic microbiome.  The previous phenomenal successes in finding new drugs from the 1% culturable microorganisms allow a incredibly high probability of finding new meaningful opportunities from new access to the 99% that has remained truly inaccessible.
