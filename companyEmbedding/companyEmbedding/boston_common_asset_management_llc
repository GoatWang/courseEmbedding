Fundamental Judgment



 











 







Seeing the whole picture is fundamental to valuing a company. Our team of experienced analysts takes a holistic approach to trying to understand every aspect of a company’s business. We combine rigorous financial and ESG research with in-person company, country, and region visits to analyze risks and opportunities, see beyond the near term, and form what we believe is a complete investment perspective.

Our Philosophy

“We believe the integration of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) research into our investment process allows us to identify leading companies with potential to outperform their peers. Furthermore, as engaged, active investors, we have a seat at the table to improve a company’s fundamentals.”
~ Matt Zalosh, CIO, International Equities
Our investment philosophy is rooted in our belief that a long-term view is necessary to generate sustainable returns.  Markets typically misvalue the risks and opportunities presented by ESG factors, both in terms of the timing and the magnitude of outcomes. We believe we can enhance portfolio quality, return potential, and risk reduction by integrating financial and ESG research. Active, engaged ownership is critically important in raising the sustainability profile of our portfolios. We believe it empowers company managements to be long-term oriented and will improve the fundamentals of the companies, eventually becoming reflected in the value of their shares. These improvements may take the form of lower risk premia, higher earnings, cost savings, product and process innovation, or policy changes.
We seek to preserve and build capital through diversified portfolios of what we believe are high-quality, sustainable companies whose stocks are undervalued. We seek companies with sound governance and a history of responsible financial management that we believe are capable of consistent, visible profitability over a long time horizon.
Our strengths lie in the fundamental judgment of our experienced, close-knit investment team; our tenacious engagement work; the diversity of perspectives around our table; and our rigorous, innovative, and thoughtful investment approach.

About Boston Common Asset Management LLC
Boston Common Asset Management is an experienced investment manager dedicated to the pursuit of ﬁnancial return and social impact; Boston Common incorporates environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors into every stage of the investment research process. Through the visionary leadership of founder Geeta Aiyer, the firm pioneered the expansion of ESG into the global space. Boston Common’s founding colleagues have worked together since the mid-1990s and key members of the Investment team have steered the firm since its inception.

In Boston Common’s view, understanding ESG factors is crucial to valuing a company; the firm analyzes investment risks and opportunities from a broader perspective. It seeks competitive investment returns from portfolios of companies that can contribute to and benefit from sustainable, global growth. Additionally, Boston Common actively engages companies on issues that we believe will accomplish the dual task of improving financial fundamentals and promoting leaders on the environment and human rights.
Boston Common has extensive experience serving pension funds, endowments, foundations, mission-driven organizations, religious groups, and families across the United States. Its clients share a common conviction in sustainable enterprise and a commitment to ethical standards. They invest with Boston Common to align their missions with their investments. Boston Common is a women-led and employee owned firm with headquarters in Boston and an office in San Francisco.
As investors that seek to improve corporate practices, we believe it is also important to “walk our talk” in our own day-to-day behavior. It was natural for us to join the B Corp community and support the movement of like-minded companies that are committed to using business as a force for good.
The Change We Seek®
Boston Common integrates financial and sustainability factors into its investment process because ESG research helps identify companies that will be successful over the long-term. Boston Common seeks companies that can capitalize on new market opportunities, implement efficiency improvements, and avoid unanticipated costs stemming from inadequate attention to ESG risks. 

Additionally, Boston Common uses its voice as shareowners to improve corporate and industry practices globally and to advance the global dialogue toward a sustainable economy. The firm’s engagement strategy as long-term, global investors builds on its investment themes of doing more with fewer resources, treating people as assets, and supporting better governance. Investors with a deep and long-term understanding of prosperity can use ESG analysis and direct engagement to provide the critical checks and balances that financial markets require to function as efficient and socially beneficial distributors of capital.

Wealth Structuring
Preservation and Transfer
Your wealth plan is designed to provide you and your family with thoughtful and innovative solutions customized to the financial and personal complexities of your life.  We bring you knowledge, experience and expertise across the broad range of wealth structuring disciplines.






Wealth Planning
Integrating your personal and financial affairs
By thinking holistically about all aspects of your wealth, we develop customized strategies to help pursue your unique goals. Wealth structuring can help you address issues including:

The cash flow required to help meet your lifestyle
The investments needed to help meet long-range objectives 
The most effective way to pursue estate planning goals 
The tax implications of the many aspects of managing and transferring your wealth

Trusts and Estates
Shaping your legacy and transferring your wealth
For more than two centuries, U.S. Trust has been helping many of America's wealthiest families build estate plans and implement wealth transfer strategies. Your team can work with you to build a sound estate plan that may help you:

Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan
Identify the best-qualified grant recipients
Monitor the impact of your efforts

We can help you design and implement a philanthropic strategy that helps you fulfill your values-based commitments in a way that is consistent with your lifestyle.
Learn more about Philanthropy at U.S. Trust
Custody Services
Benefiting from the experience of dedicated custody specialists
U.S. Trust is the custodian of choice for many sophisticated investors with extensive and complex holdings. Whether you manage your own portfolio or work with multiple brokers and investment managers, we can structure a personalized custody program that simplifies portfolio and trade monitoring and helps meet your specific safekeeping, service and information needs.

Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax or estate planning strategy.

Fundamental Judgment



 











 







Seeing the whole picture is fundamental to valuing a company. Our team of experienced analysts takes a holistic approach to trying to understand every aspect of a company’s business. We combine rigorous financial and ESG research with in-person company, country, and region visits to analyze risks and opportunities, see beyond the near term, and form what we believe is a complete investment perspective.

We go beyond transparency and reporting and ask companies to improve the policies and practices that we believe will improve their fundamentals. Over time, our work has carved a path and developed models for effective engagement with companies.
