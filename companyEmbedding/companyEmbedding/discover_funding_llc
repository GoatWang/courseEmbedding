Instruction J to Form 10-K: 

Item 1.
Business. 

Item 1A.
Risk Factors. 

Item 2.
Properties. 

Item 3.
Legal Proceedings. 

Item 1B.

Substitute
information provided in accordance with General Instruction J to
Form 10-K:  

Item 1112(b)
of Regulation AB. Significant Obligors of Pool Assets (Financial
Information).

The
primary asset of Discover Card Execution Note Trust (the “
Note Issuance Trust ”) is the Discover Card Master
Trust I, Series 2007-CC collateral certificate, which
represents an undivided interest in Discover Card Master Trust I
(the “ Master Trust ”), whose assets include
Discover Card receivables existing as of specified dates in
designated accounts, which receivables have been transferred to the
Master Trust by Discover Bank and Discover Funding LLC, as
applicable. The investor interest in receivables for the collateral
certificate reflects the aggregate nominal liquidation amount of
notes issued by the Note Issuance Trust. The Master Trust,
therefore, may be considered a significant obligor in relation to
the Note Issuance Trust. Pursuant to Instruction 3.b. to
Item 1112(b) of Regulation AB, the information required by
Instruction J to Form 10-K in respect of the Master Trust has been
disclosed in this report on Form 10-K in lieu of the information
otherwise contemplated by Item 1112(b).

The pool
assets held by the Master Trust do not include any significant
obligors.

Item 1114(b)(2)
of Regulation AB. Credit Enhancement and Other Support, Except for
Certain Derivatives Instruments (Information Regarding Significant
Enhancement Providers) (Financial Information).

Not
applicable.

Item 1115(b)
of Regulation AB. Certain Derivatives Instruments (Financial
Information).

Not
applicable.

Item 1117
of Regulation AB. Legal Proceedings.

Discover
Bank

In the
normal course of business, from time to time, Discover Bank and/or
one or more of its affiliates have been named as a defendant in
various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions, and
other litigation, arising in connection with our activities.
Certain of the actual or threatened legal actions include claims
for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for
indeterminate amounts of damages. Discover Bank contests liability
and/or the amount of damages as appropriate in each pending
matter.

Discover
Bank has historically relied on the arbitration clause in its
cardmember agreements, which has in some instances limited the
costs of, and our exposure to, litigation, but there can be no
assurance that Discover Bank will continue to be successful in
enforcing its arbitration clause in the future. Legal challenges to
the enforceability of these clauses have led most card issuers and
may cause Discover Bank to discontinue their use. Discover
Bank

and/or one
or more of its affiliates is involved in pending legal actions
challenging its arbitration clause. Bills are periodically
introduced in Congress to directly or indirectly prohibit the use
of pre-dispute arbitration clauses, and the Dodd-Frank Act
authorized the CFPB to conduct a study on pre-dispute arbitration
clauses and, based on the study, potentially limit or ban
arbitration clauses. On March 10, 2015, the CFPB released its
report to Congress on pre-dispute arbitration as required by the
Dodd-Frank Act. On October 7, 2015, the CFPB announced that it
was considering proposing rules on arbitration agreements that
would (i) effectively ban consumer financial companies from
using arbitration clauses to prevent class action cases and
(ii) require records of all other arbitrations to be provided
to the CFPB for potential publication on its website. The timing
and provisions of any final rule are uncertain at this
time.

Discover
Bank and its affiliates are also involved, from time to time, in
other reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal and
informal) by governmental regulatory and enforcement agencies
regarding our business, including, among other matters, accounting,
tax and operational matters, some of which may result in adverse
judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions, decreases in
regulatory ratings or other relief, which could materially impact
Discover Bank’s financial results, increase its cost of
operations, require a change in business activities and product
offerings or limit its ability to execute its business strategies
and engage in certain business activities. As described below, the
CFPB recently concluded an investigation into certain student loan
practices of Discover Bank. Litigation and regulatory actions could
also adversely affect Discover Bank’s reputation.

On
June 13, 2014, Discover Bank entered into a Consent Order with
the FDIC to resolve previously disclosed matters related to the
FDIC’s examination of Discover Bank’s anti-money
laundering and related compliance programs. In the Consent Order,
Discover Bank agreed to, among other things, enhance its anti-money
laundering and related compliance programs. The order does not
include civil money penalties but does cause Discover Bank to incur
significant expenses. The Federal Reserve notified Discover
Financial Services in 2014 of its intention to enter into a
supervisory action to require enhancements to the Company’s
enterprise-wide anti-money laundering and related compliance
programs.

On
July 22, 2015, Discover Bank, The Student Loan Corporation and
Discover Products Inc. (“DPI”) agreed to a consent
order with the CFPB resolving the CFPB’s investigation into
certain student loan servicing practices. The consent order
requires Discover Bank, The Student Loan Corporation and DPI to
provide redress of approximately $16 million to consumers who
may have been affected by the activities described in the consent
order related to certain collection calls, overstatements of
minimum payment due amounts in billing statements and provision of
interest paid information to consumers, and provide regulatory
disclosures with respect to loans acquired in default. In addition,
Discover Bank, The Student Loan Corporation and DPI are required to
pay a $2.5 million civil money penalty to the CFPB. As
required by the consent order, on October 19, 2015, Discover
Bank, the Student Loan Corporation and DPI submitted to the CFPB a
redress plan and a compliance plan designed to ensure that they
provide redress and otherwise comply with the terms of the
order.

U.S. Bank
National Association

Since 2014
various plaintiffs or groups of plaintiffs, primarily investors,
have filed claims against U.S. Bank National Association
(“U.S. Bank”), in its capacity as trustee or successor
trustee (as the case may be) under certain residential mortgage
backed securities (“RMBS”) trusts. The plaintiffs or
plaintiff groups have filed substantially similar complaints
against other RMBS trustees, including Deutsche Bank, Citibank,
HSBC, Bank of New York Mellon and Wells Fargo. The complaints
against U.S. Bank allege the trustee caused losses to investors as
a result of alleged failures by the sponsors, mortgage loan sellers
and servicers for these RMBS trusts and assert causes of action
based upon the trustee’s purported failure to enforce
repurchase obligations of mortgage loan sellers for alleged
breaches of representations and warranties concerning loan quality.
The complaints also assert that the trustee failed to notify
securityholders of purported events of default allegedly caused by
breaches of servicing standards by mortgage loan servicers and that
the trustee purportedly failed to abide by a heightened standard of
care following alleged events of default.

Currently
U.S. Bank is a defendant in multiple actions alleging individual or
class action claims against the trustee with respect to multiple
trusts as described above with the most substantial case being:
BlackRock Balanced Capital Portfolio et al v. U.S. Bank National
Association , No. 605204/2015 (N.Y. Sup. Ct.) (class
action alleging

 

3


 


 


claims
with respect to approximately 794 trusts) and its companion case
BlackRock Core Bond Portfolio et al v. U.S. Bank National
Association , No. 14-cv-9401 (S.D.N.Y.). Some of the
trusts implicated in the aforementioned Blackrock cases, as well as
other trusts, are involved in actions brought by separate groups of
plaintiffs related to no more than 100 trusts per case.

U.S. Bank
does not provide any assurances as to the outcome of any of the
litigation, or the possible impact of these litigations on U.S.
Bank or the RMBS trusts. However, U.S. Bank denies liability and
believes that it has performed its obligations under the RMBS
trusts in good faith, that its actions were not the cause of losses
to investors and that it has meritorious defenses, and it intends
to contest the plaintiffs’ claims vigorously.

Other than
as set forth above, there are no legal proceedings pending or known
to be contemplated by authorities against any of U.S. Bank National
Association, as indenture trustee, Wilmington Trust Company, as
owner trustee, Discover Bank, as sponsor and servicer, Discover
Card Master Trust I, as issuing entity of the collateral
certificate, Discover Card Execution Note Trust, as issuing entity
of the notes, Discover Funding LLC, as depositor, or any
sub-servicer, or of which any property of the foregoing is subject,
that are material to holders of the notes.

Item 1119
of Regulation AB. Affiliations and Certain Relationships and
Related Transactions.

Discover
Bank, which, prior to January 1, 2016, acted as
seller/depositor for the Master Trust, depositor and beneficiary
for the Note Issuance Trust and, at all times, acts as the sponsor
of their securitizations, is a wholly owned subsidiary of Discover
Financial Services. Discover Funding LLC was established on
May 18, 2015 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Discover Bank
and, on and after January 1, 2016, acts as depositor and
beneficiary for the Note Issuance Trust and as holder of the
residual transferor interest of the Master Trust. Discover
Financial Services acquired Discover Bank in January 1985. Discover
Bank and the trustee for the Master Trust formed the Master Trust
in October 1993. Discover Bank originates and prior to
January 1, 2016, has transferred to the Master Trust, since
its formation, the credit card receivables generated under certain
designated Discover card accounts. On

and after
January 1, 2016, Discover Bank transfers such credit card
receivables to Discover Funding LLC for further transfer to the
Master Trust. Discover Bank and the owner trustee formed the Note
Issuance Trust on July 2, 2007. Discover Bank transferred an
undivided interest in the receivables and other assets of the
Master Trust, represented by the collateral certificate, to the
Note Issuance Trust to support the issuance of notes on
July 26, 2007.

Discover
Bank acts as master servicer for the Master Trust and is currently
the only servicer under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement with
respect to the receivables. During the reporting period, Discover
Bank outsourced certain servicing functions to its affiliate, DPI.
DPI contracted with BancTec, Inc., a third-party service provider,
for certain check processing and related services. However,
Discover Bank is ultimately responsible for the overall servicing
function. Discover Bank also acts as calculation agent for the Note
Issuance Trust, which is part of the servicing function.

Item 1122
of Regulation AB. Compliance with Applicable Servicing
Criteria.

Each of
Discover Bank, DPI, BancTec, Inc. and U.S. Bank National
Association (each, a “ Servicing Participant ”)
has been identified as a party participating in the servicing
function during the reporting period with respect to the pool
assets held by each of the Master Trust and the Note Issuance
Trust. Each of Discover Bank, DPI, BancTec, Inc. and U.S. Bank
National Association has completed a report on an assessment of
compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to such Servicing
Participant (each, a “ Report on Assessment ”)
during the year ended December 31, 2015, which Reports on
Assessment are attached as exhibits to this Form 10-K. In addition,
each of Discover Bank, DPI, BancTec, Inc. and U.S. Bank National
Association has provided an attestation report (each, an “
Attestation Report ”) by a registered independent
public accounting firm regarding its related Report on Assessment.
Each Attestation Report is attached as an exhibit to this Form
10-K. None of the Reports on Assessment or the related Attestation
Reports has identified any material instances of noncompliance with
the servicing criteria applicable to such Servicing Participant
described in the related Report on Assessment.

Item 1123
of Regulation AB. Servicer Compliance Statement.

Each of
Discover Bank and DPI has been identified as a servicer during the
reporting period with respect to the pool assets held by each of
the Master Trust and the Note Issuance Trust. Each of Discover Bank
and DPI has provided a statement of compliance (each, a “
Compliance Statement ”) with respect to the servicing
activities conducted during the Note Issuance Trust’s year
ended December 31, 2015, signed by an authorized officer, and
each such Compliance Statement is attached as an exhibit to this
Form 10-K.

Order Entry System
“Our fixed income desk has been overly pleased with CD Funding’s Order Entry System.  It has allowed our team to process more trades in significantly less time, and having the ability to view submitted orders significantly aids in the management of order flow throughout the month,” says Tom McCarthy, Manager, Fixed Income Trade Desk at CFS.  “CD Funding was able to customize the system to accommodate our firm’s specific needs allowing us to roll the application out to all of our advisors.  We anticipate further time savings, error reduction, and better tracking with the new system.”
TOM MCCARTHY
	MANAGER, FIXED INCOME TRADE DESK
	CUSO FINANCIAL SERVICES
	CLIENT SINCE 01/2013




Expertise
"CD Funding Group orchestrated a comprehensive launch plan for our proprietary market-linked CDs which brought the product to our advisors and investors in record time. They coordinated the critical conversations and infrastructure across many of our business lines and support units. Their execution was flawless. It is clear that CD Funding Group has the requisite experience and expertise to help financial institutions of all sizes to promote this significant product offering."
CURTIS J. FUSZARD, CFA, CFP®, CLTC
	PRESIDENT AND CEO
	ASSOCIATED BANK INVESTMENT SERVICES, INC.
	CLIENT SINCE 07/2011




Superior Bank Support
"Like any new program implementation, when we first started the Power CD program with CD Funding, I was a bit concerned that it would absorb a significant amount of my time each month – time I felt I really didn’t have.  In all actuality, and quite the contrary, the program represents less than 5% of my total job function.  CD Funding makes our Market-Linked CD program simple.  From an administrative standpoint, there are no knowledge prerequisites.  CD Funding notifies us of all upcoming events, prepares every report and provides all contact information we need.  CD Funding’s expertise is unmatched in the industry, and we are extremely pleased with our partnership."
DONNA R. GREER
	BUSINESS SUPPORT MANAGER
	BANK OF OKLAHOMA
	CLIENT SINCE 12/2006




Best In Class Service
"CD Funding is much more than just building and distributing our monthly proprietary offering.  CD Funding provides “best in class” training, knowledge, and service to our team, and their dedication is second to no one in our industry.  Our advisors and program have benefited greatly from the partnership with CD Funding.  Thanks to the ongoing efforts of CD Funding, I take comfort in knowing our advisors are well educated and trained to position and recommend Market-Linked CDs with current clients and prospects."
VANCE RICHARD
	PROGRAM MANAGER, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT
	IBERIA BANK FINANCIAL SERVICES, LLC
	CLIENT SINCE 06/2010




Ease of implementation
"CD Funding helped us move from concept through approval to launch in record time.  I heard at a conference recently that it has taken some banks as much as 18 months to two years to implement a proprietary CD program.  With the help of CD Funding, we were offering an equity-linked CD in the Banco Popular name just two weeks after executing an agreement with them.  CD Funding’s strong, knowledgeable team, led by Tim Bonacci, provided the guidance and strategic support to make the implementation process smooth and seamless.   Their initial rep training and ongoing field support are both critical to the success of our program."
DAVID PETERS
	PROGRAM MANAGER, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT
	BANCO POPULAR
	CLIENT SINCE 02/2011
