Harel Insurance Company Ltd.


Member of the Israel Insurance Association and the Association of Life Insurance companies of Israel  



 
 Harel Insurance Company Ltd (Harel). is a private company, fully owned by Harel Insurance Investments and Financial Services Ltd. (Harel Group) - one of Israel's largest public companies, whose shares are traded on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. 
Harel Group is the third largest insurance group in Israel. It is the second largest in general insurance; the market leader in health insurance, and from the perspective of premium volume, it is the third largest in life insurance. 
Harel contains almost all the insurance activity that Harel Insurance Investments & Financial Services has acquired over time: Harel, which was established by the Group in 1975, Shiloah (acquired in 1984), the Yardeniya portfolio (1985), Sahar (1989), and Zion (1999). The last stage of this process took place on January 1, 2003, when Sahar-Zion merged with Shiloah, which then changed its name to Harel Insurance Company Ltd. - the name of the company that initiated the Group's insurance business in 1975. 
Harel Insurance works closely with the world's largest reinsurance companies as well as with Lloyd’s. Harel was also chosen as the Global Partner for multinational corporations such as AXA, Allianz, Royal & Sun Alliance, Ace and Chubb, and insures the Israeli branches of several large, international companies operating in Israel. 
With more than 70 years reputation and experience, Harel provides comprehensive insurance solutions to hundreds of thousands of policyholders in all areas: general insurance, life insurance and long term savings (provident funds, pension funds), health insurance, travel insurance, homeowners' insurance, business insurance and motor insurance. 
The Harel Group's strength, firm economic backbone, highly qualified staff and the personal service it provides enable it to offer you peace of mind and the secure knowledge that your money and future are in the most reliable and professional hands.
