LLC FAQs - Frequently Asked Legal Questions About Limited Liability Companies | LegalZoom























Skip to main content







In addition to certain guarantees provided by law, LegalZoom guarantees your satisfaction with our services and support. Because our company was created by experienced attorneys, we strive to be the best legal document service on the web. If you are not satisfied with our services, please contact us immediately and we will correct the situation, provide a refund or offer credit that can be used for future LegalZoom orders.
LegalZoom Satisfaction Guarantee Details:

If you're not satisfied, simply call us toll-free at (800) 773-0888 during our normal business hours. All requests made under this guarantee must be made within 60 days of purchase. We will process your request within 5 business days after we've received all of the documents and materials sent to you. Unfortunately, we can't refund or credit any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order. We also cannot refund any money paid by you directly to third parties, such as payments made by you directly to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products.
If you want to exchange the product you ordered for a different one, you must request this exchange and complete your replacement order within 60 days of purchase. The purchase price of the original item, less any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order, will be credited to your LegalZoom account. Any payments made directly by you to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products are not eligible for exchange or credit. Any price difference between the original order and the replacement order or, if a replacement order is not completed within 60 days of purchase, the full original purchase price (in each case less any money paid to government entities or other third parties) will be credited to the original form of payment. If you paid for your original order by check, LegalZoom will mail a check for the applicable amount to your billing address.
Please note that we cannot guarantee the results or outcome of your particular procedure. For instance, the government may reject a trademark application for legal reasons beyond the scope of LegalZoom's service. In some cases, a government backlog can lead to long delays before your process is complete. Similarly, LegalZoom does not guarantee the results or outcomes of the services rendered by our legal plan attorneys or attorney-assisted products. Problems like these are beyond our control and are not covered by this guarantee.
Since we're dedicating time and effort to your legal document preparation, our guarantee only covers satisfaction issues caused by LegalZoom - not changes to your situation or your state of mind.

Knowledge Center&rtrif;Limited Liability Company&rtrif;FAQ 









Limited Liability Company FAQ
Find FAQs related to starting an LLC.
















What is a limited liability company (LLC)?


    
A limited liability company, or LLC, is a business entity created under state laws which has the characteristics of both a corporation and a partnership. Like a corporation, the owners of an LLC are not personally liable for business debts. Like a sole proprietorship or partnership, an LLC has operating flexibility and is a pass-through entity for tax purposes. This means the LLC's profits are passed through and taxable to the owners of the LLC. 




 





What legal documents do I need to form an LLC?


    
To create an LLC, Articles of Organization must be filed with the Secretary of State or appropriate state agency. Next, the LLC members should enter into an operating agreement, which sets forth the rights of the members and the rules for running the company. An LLC may also need to apply for a tax identification number with the IRS. LegalZoom can prepare all of the required documents for you. 

  


 





Can my LLC have an unlimited lifespan?

Yes. Recent changes to the IRS code have promoted changes in state laws permitting LLCs to be created with an unlimited life.


 





What is the difference between a "member" and a "manager" of an LLC?


    
A member is an owner of the LLC and is similar to a stockholder of a corporation. A manager is a person chosen by the members to manage the LLC and is similar to a director of a corporation. A manager can also be a member. 
  


 





Does an LLC have to hold meetings?


    
The answer is usually no, unless the LLC's operating agreement requires meetings. LegalZoom's operating agreements make meetings optional. This is one of the key advantages of an LLC - fewer formalities. This means less paperwork and less chance that the members will accidentally violate the law and thereby lose their liability protection. 


  


 





How much will it cost to form and operate an LLC?

Each state charges an annual fee to maintain an LLC. In many states, you must also submit an annual report or statement of information, which is a one-page form sent by the state. Some states also have state taxes. The annual fees for three popular states—California, Nevada and Delaware—are as follows (prices shown are as of 2015):

California: A $20 reporting fee and a statement of information are required 90 days after formation and then every two years. An annual $800 LLC tax is due by the 15th day of the fourth month after LLC formation and every year thereafter. If the LLC's income exceeds $250,000, it will owe an additional LLC tax based on the income amount.


Nevada: A $150 fee and the Initial List of Managers or Managing Members, as well as a $200 fee and a Business Licence Application, are due within 30 days of formation. There is no state income tax.


Delaware: There is an annual LLC tax of $300 due each June 1st, beginning the year following formation. There is no state income tax.


New York: Every LLC must publish notice of its formation in two newspapers in the county in which it was created. In some areas, the fees for this publication can run up to $2,000. The company must then submit a certificate of this publication to the state, together with a $50 filing fee. For LLCs that choose to be treated as a partnership, there are annual taxes that are based on total income (from a minimum of $25 to a maximum of $4,500).


Every other state: Contact a local accountant.

 
LegalZoom can help you save time when you form an LLC. Answer a few questions in our online questionnaire, we’ll check your answers for consistency and completeness, and file the required documentation with your state. Once your LLC is formed, we send you a final package with all of your documents. We also can help you get in touch with independent attorneys to answer questions about your business.


 





What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?


Although an S corporation shares many of the same tax characteristics as an LLC, an LLC has more flexibility and fewer restrictions than an S corporation. An S corporation cannot have more than 100 stockholders, cannot issue more than one class of shares, and is subject to more formalities than an LLC. However, owners of an LLC are required to pay Social Security and Medicare taxes on profits. Corporate stockholders are not required to pay these taxes on profits over and above the stockholders' salaries.



 





Do I need an attorney to form an LLC?


    
No, you do not need an attorney to form an LLC. You can prepare the legal paperwork and file it yourself, or use a professional business formation service, such as LegalZoom. If you choose to form your LLC through LegalZoom, you will only need to answer a few simple questions online.  We will take care of all of your paperwork, file the necessary documents with the state and even send you an LLC kit with seals and certificates. 



 





How many people are needed to form an LLC?


    
In all states, only one person is needed to form an LLC. Recent changes to the IRS code have promoted reforms in state laws, permitting one-member LLCs.

In addition to certain guarantees provided by law, LegalZoom guarantees your satisfaction with our services and support. Because our company was created by experienced attorneys, we strive to be the best legal document service on the web. If you are not satisfied with our services, please contact us immediately and we will correct the situation, provide a refund or offer credit that can be used for future LegalZoom orders.
LegalZoom Satisfaction Guarantee Details:

If you're not satisfied, simply call us toll-free at (800) 773-0888 during our normal business hours. All requests made under this guarantee must be made within 60 days of purchase. We will process your request within 5 business days after we've received all of the documents and materials sent to you. Unfortunately, we can't refund or credit any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order. We also cannot refund any money paid by you directly to third parties, such as payments made by you directly to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products.
If you want to exchange the product you ordered for a different one, you must request this exchange and complete your replacement order within 60 days of purchase. The purchase price of the original item, less any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order, will be credited to your LegalZoom account. Any payments made directly by you to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products are not eligible for exchange or credit. Any price difference between the original order and the replacement order or, if a replacement order is not completed within 60 days of purchase, the full original purchase price (in each case less any money paid to government entities or other third parties) will be credited to the original form of payment. If you paid for your original order by check, LegalZoom will mail a check for the applicable amount to your billing address.
Please note that we cannot guarantee the results or outcome of your particular procedure. For instance, the government may reject a trademark application for legal reasons beyond the scope of LegalZoom's service. In some cases, a government backlog can lead to long delays before your process is complete. Similarly, LegalZoom does not guarantee the results or outcomes of the services rendered by our legal plan attorneys or attorney-assisted products. Problems like these are beyond our control and are not covered by this guarantee.
Since we're dedicating time and effort to your legal document preparation, our guarantee only covers satisfaction issues caused by LegalZoom - not changes to your situation or your state of mind.

Corporations Compared to LLCs









Knowledge Center&rtrif;Corporation&rtrif;Corporations Compared to LLCs 













        Corporations Compared to LLCs      
Limited liability companies (LLCs) are one of the newest types of business entities. Like corporations, they offer many benefits over partnerships and sole proprietorships. Whether an LLC or a corporation is better for a small business depends on the type of business. The best comparison here is between an LLC and an S corporation, because an LLC can choose to be taxed as an S corporation.
Social Security Taxes
The owners of the S corporation can take out some profits without Social Security taxes. For a large business in which the owners take out salaries of $118,500 or more plus profits, there would not be much difference, since the Social Security tax cuts out at that level as of 2015. However, for a smaller business, in which an owner could take out a $30,000 salary and $20,000 profit, the extra taxes on the $20,000 would be over $3,000.
Raising Money
If a corporation plans to go public or sell stock to a large group of people, the corporate stock might be easier to sell than membership interests in the LLC.
Liability Protection
An important advantage of an LLC is that in some states, a creditor cannot collect the members’ LLC distributions. With a corporation, creditors cannot collect a shareholder’s personal assets, but can collect the shareholder’s dividends.
Profits, Losses, and Taxes
The other advantages of LLCs are found in certain tax situations. For example, an LLC can make special allocations of profits and losses among members, whereas S corporations cannot. S corporations must have one class of ownership in which profits and losses are allocated according to the percentage ownership. In an LLC, money borrowed by the company can increase the tax basis (and lower the taxes) of the owners, whereas in an S corporation, it does not. Contributing property to set up an LLC is not taxable, even for minority interest owners, whereas for a corporation, regulations only allow it to be tax­ free for the contributors who have control of the business.
Foreign Ownership
The owners of an LLC can be foreign persons, other corporations, or any kind of trust, whereas the owners of S corporations cannot. An LLC may have an unlimited number of members, while an S corporation is limited to one hundred.
Management Options
LLCs are also popular because of their flexible management options, allowing owners to directly managed the business or have others handle the day to day operations. LLCs have fewer formalities than corporations, another advantage for some business owners.
Fringe Benefits
Corporations offer a greater variety of fringe benefit plans than any other business entity. Various retirement, stock option and employee stock purchase plans are available only for corporations. Plus, sole proprietors, partners and employees owning more than 2% of an S corporation must pay taxes on fringe benefits (such as group-term life insurance, medical reimbursement plans, medical insurance premiums and parking). Shareholder-employees of a C corporation do not have to pay taxes on these benefits.

Nonprofits are entities that survive any change in their board of directors.

After formation, C Corps have many ongoing formalities such as writing bylaws, selecting directors, holding initial and annual shareholder meetings, and issuing stock.

We love to help!Should I form my business as an LLC?Despite being a relatively new option, the limited liability company (LLC) is now one of the most popular business structures among smaller organizations. While allowing business owners to remain free from a great deal of the regulations imposed on other types of companies, it still provides limited liability protection for its owners (members). This means that the personal assets of an LLC's ownership cannot be collected to fulfill the debts of the business. What is involved in forming an LLC?All states require potential LLC owners to file a substantial set of documents, typically called the Articles of Organization, in order to establish their business. We can take care of this process for you, saving you time, effort, and allowing you to focus on developing your business – not filing paperwork. How should I name my LLC?The name you choose for your LLC is an important decision, as it will be how you represent yourself to potential associates and clients. With that in mind, it is advisable that you take some time to craft a name that you will be proud to have representing you and your business.Your name must be unique, and not deceptively similar, to any other trademarked name or business. It is also required that your name not be used to intentionally misrepresent the products or services you offer. For LLCs, nearly all states will also require you to add a signifier of your limited liability status, such as "LLC" or "L.L.C." to the end of your company's name. You may be able to operate under a name other than your formal LLC name by applying for and using a dba. Are there a required number of individuals needed to form an LLC?There is no minimum requirement as to the number of owners (also referred to as members) that an LLC must have. At the federal level, single-member LLCs qualify for pass-through taxation, however this is not always true at the state level.

While allowing business owners to remain free from a great deal of the formalities imposed on other types of businesses, it still provides limited liability protection for its owners (members). LLCs are also eligible for "pass-through" taxation, which means that the company's income taxes are only reflected on each owner's personal tax return, not at the business level. To learn more about forming an LLC, click the link below.Learn more about forming an LLC  C CorporationForm a C Corporation (C Corp)The C Corporation (C Corp) is what most people think of when they hear the word "corporation". Most large companies are formed under this structure as it offers the most tax related options for business owners. It provides the greatest level of separation between the company and its owners, and allows the company to raise capital through the issuance of publicly traded stock. However, the many formal requirements placed on C Corps prevent the structure from being the ideal choice for many smaller organizations. To learn more about forming an C Corp, click the link below.Learn more about forming a C Corporation  S CorporationForm a S Corporation (S Corp)The S Corporation (S Corp) structure is similar to the C Corp, with a few notable differences. The most important of these differences is that S Corps are eligible for special pass through taxation status with the IRS. This allows S Corp owners to avoid double taxation on their business income. S Corps must request pass through taxation status, by filing Form 2553 with IRS after successfully incorporating.

Why Incorporate | Why You Should Incorporate Your Business | Swyft Filings Home   Starting Your Business  Why Incorporate Your Business? About Us Pricing Overview Our 5 Step Process Why Incorporate General FAQs Our GuaranteeThe Benefits of IncorporatingIncorporating your business offers a unique mix of benefits, many of which are unavailable to informal business structures such as sole proprietorships and general partnerships. If you are looking for tax flexibility, limited liability, and the option to raise capital, incorporation may be the best path for you. The following are four of the major benefits of incorporation:Increased CredibilityBeing recognized as a corporation proves to creditors and potential clients that your business is organized according to state law. By simply adding “Inc” or “LLC” to the end of your business name gives you the professional look and credibility that many customers are looking for.Tax Benefits Corporation owners are able to deduct many more expenses than those who own informal businesses. These write-offs can be substantial since insurance, travel, and entertainment are deductions. Corporation owners are also free from paying certain self-employment taxes, which informal business owners must pay.Asset ProtectionIn the event that a corporation becomes unable to pay its debts, the owners are given limited liability status. This means that their personal funds or assets cannot be collected in order to pay business debts. In the event legal proceedings are brought against the corporation, the owners’ personal assets are protected.Perpetual lifespan If your business is incorporated, it will not be forced to dissolve due to changes in ownership. The transfer of ownership is typically accomplished through the simple sale of common or unrestricted preferred stock or by membership interest transfers. Informal business structures are not perpetual entities, so in the event that an owner dies or wants to sell, the business typically ceases to exist in its current form. Being a perpetual entity makes it easier for incorporated businesses to get bank loans and to attract investors.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC

The essential nutrients that help a patient recover.
A game-time snack that energizes the most devoted fan.
We create memorable food experiences wherever people work, learn, recover and play.
Whether it’s designing an innovative menu based on consumer insights, setting high service standards, or ensuring we have the right people with the right skills, we put those we serve at the core of what we do.
Our approach is simple:

Craft chef-inspired menus with high-quality ingredients 
Encourage healthier living with nutritious options
Offer convenience that fits different lifestyles
Enable personalized experiences through exceptional service

                                    In a recent study, up to 60% of hospital staff uniforms were found to be contaminated with potentially pathogenic bacteria and drug-resistant organisms¹. Developing a better way to clean uniforms could lead to fewer hospital-associated infections.

Skip to main content







In addition to certain guarantees provided by law, LegalZoom guarantees your satisfaction with our services and support. Because our company was created by experienced attorneys, we strive to be the best legal document service on the web. If you are not satisfied with our services, please contact us immediately and we will correct the situation, provide a refund or offer credit that can be used for future LegalZoom orders.
LegalZoom Satisfaction Guarantee Details:

If you're not satisfied, simply call us toll-free at (800) 773-0888 during our normal business hours. All requests made under this guarantee must be made within 60 days of purchase. We will process your request within 5 business days after we've received all of the documents and materials sent to you. Unfortunately, we can't refund or credit any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order. We also cannot refund any money paid by you directly to third parties, such as payments made by you directly to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products.
If you want to exchange the product you ordered for a different one, you must request this exchange and complete your replacement order within 60 days of purchase. The purchase price of the original item, less any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order, will be credited to your LegalZoom account. Any payments made directly by you to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products are not eligible for exchange or credit. Any price difference between the original order and the replacement order or, if a replacement order is not completed within 60 days of purchase, the full original purchase price (in each case less any money paid to government entities or other third parties) will be credited to the original form of payment. If you paid for your original order by check, LegalZoom will mail a check for the applicable amount to your billing address.
Please note that we cannot guarantee the results or outcome of your particular procedure. For instance, the government may reject a trademark application for legal reasons beyond the scope of LegalZoom's service. In some cases, a government backlog can lead to long delays before your process is complete. Similarly, LegalZoom does not guarantee the results or outcomes of the services rendered by our legal plan attorneys or attorney-assisted products. Problems like these are beyond our control and are not covered by this guarantee.
Since we're dedicating time and effort to your legal document preparation, our guarantee only covers satisfaction issues caused by LegalZoom - not changes to your situation or your state of mind.

Knowledge Center&rtrif;Limited Liability Company&rtrif;FAQ 









Limited Liability Company FAQ
Find FAQs related to starting an LLC.
















What is a limited liability company (LLC)?


    
A limited liability company, or LLC, is a business entity created under state laws which has the characteristics of both a corporation and a partnership. Like a corporation, the owners of an LLC are not personally liable for business debts. Like a sole proprietorship or partnership, an LLC has operating flexibility and is a pass-through entity for tax purposes. This means the LLC's profits are passed through and taxable to the owners of the LLC. 




 





What legal documents do I need to form an LLC?


    
To create an LLC, Articles of Organization must be filed with the Secretary of State or appropriate state agency. Next, the LLC members should enter into an operating agreement, which sets forth the rights of the members and the rules for running the company. An LLC may also need to apply for a tax identification number with the IRS. LegalZoom can prepare all of the required documents for you. 

  


 





Can my LLC have an unlimited lifespan?

Yes. Recent changes to the IRS code have promoted changes in state laws permitting LLCs to be created with an unlimited life.


 





What is the difference between a "member" and a "manager" of an LLC?


    
A member is an owner of the LLC and is similar to a stockholder of a corporation. A manager is a person chosen by the members to manage the LLC and is similar to a director of a corporation. A manager can also be a member. 
  


 





Does an LLC have to hold meetings?


    
The answer is usually no, unless the LLC's operating agreement requires meetings. LegalZoom's operating agreements make meetings optional. This is one of the key advantages of an LLC - fewer formalities. This means less paperwork and less chance that the members will accidentally violate the law and thereby lose their liability protection. 


  


 





How much will it cost to form and operate an LLC?

Each state charges an annual fee to maintain an LLC. In many states, you must also submit an annual report or statement of information, which is a one-page form sent by the state. Some states also have state taxes. The annual fees for three popular states—California, Nevada and Delaware—are as follows (prices shown are as of 2015):

California: A $20 reporting fee and a statement of information are required 90 days after formation and then every two years. An annual $800 LLC tax is due by the 15th day of the fourth month after LLC formation and every year thereafter. If the LLC's income exceeds $250,000, it will owe an additional LLC tax based on the income amount.


Nevada: A $150 fee and the Initial List of Managers or Managing Members, as well as a $200 fee and a Business Licence Application, are due within 30 days of formation. There is no state income tax.


Delaware: There is an annual LLC tax of $300 due each June 1st, beginning the year following formation. There is no state income tax.


New York: Every LLC must publish notice of its formation in two newspapers in the county in which it was created. In some areas, the fees for this publication can run up to $2,000. The company must then submit a certificate of this publication to the state, together with a $50 filing fee. For LLCs that choose to be treated as a partnership, there are annual taxes that are based on total income (from a minimum of $25 to a maximum of $4,500).


Every other state: Contact a local accountant.

 
LegalZoom can help you save time when you form an LLC. Answer a few questions in our online questionnaire, we’ll check your answers for consistency and completeness, and file the required documentation with your state. Once your LLC is formed, we send you a final package with all of your documents. We also can help you get in touch with independent attorneys to answer questions about your business.


 





What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?


Although an S corporation shares many of the same tax characteristics as an LLC, an LLC has more flexibility and fewer restrictions than an S corporation. An S corporation cannot have more than 100 stockholders, cannot issue more than one class of shares, and is subject to more formalities than an LLC. However, owners of an LLC are required to pay Social Security and Medicare taxes on profits. Corporate stockholders are not required to pay these taxes on profits over and above the stockholders' salaries.



 





Do I need an attorney to form an LLC?


    
No, you do not need an attorney to form an LLC. You can prepare the legal paperwork and file it yourself, or use a professional business formation service, such as LegalZoom. If you choose to form your LLC through LegalZoom, you will only need to answer a few simple questions online.  We will take care of all of your paperwork, file the necessary documents with the state and even send you an LLC kit with seals and certificates. 



 





How many people are needed to form an LLC?


    
In all states, only one person is needed to form an LLC. Recent changes to the IRS code have promoted reforms in state laws, permitting one-member LLCs.

We love to help!Should I form my business as an LLC?Despite being a relatively new option, the limited liability company (LLC) is now one of the most popular business structures among smaller organizations. While allowing business owners to remain free from a great deal of the regulations imposed on other types of companies, it still provides limited liability protection for its owners (members). This means that the personal assets of an LLC's ownership cannot be collected to fulfill the debts of the business. What is involved in forming an LLC?All states require potential LLC owners to file a substantial set of documents, typically called the Articles of Organization, in order to establish their business. We can take care of this process for you, saving you time, effort, and allowing you to focus on developing your business – not filing paperwork. How should I name my LLC?The name you choose for your LLC is an important decision, as it will be how you represent yourself to potential associates and clients. With that in mind, it is advisable that you take some time to craft a name that you will be proud to have representing you and your business.Your name must be unique, and not deceptively similar, to any other trademarked name or business. It is also required that your name not be used to intentionally misrepresent the products or services you offer. For LLCs, nearly all states will also require you to add a signifier of your limited liability status, such as "LLC" or "L.L.C." to the end of your company's name. You may be able to operate under a name other than your formal LLC name by applying for and using a dba. Are there a required number of individuals needed to form an LLC?There is no minimum requirement as to the number of owners (also referred to as members) that an LLC must have. At the federal level, single-member LLCs qualify for pass-through taxation, however this is not always true at the state level.

While allowing business owners to remain free from a great deal of the formalities imposed on other types of businesses, it still provides limited liability protection for its owners (members). LLCs are also eligible for "pass-through" taxation, which means that the company's income taxes are only reflected on each owner's personal tax return, not at the business level. To learn more about forming an LLC, click the link below.Learn more about forming an LLC  C CorporationForm a C Corporation (C Corp)The C Corporation (C Corp) is what most people think of when they hear the word "corporation". Most large companies are formed under this structure as it offers the most tax related options for business owners. It provides the greatest level of separation between the company and its owners, and allows the company to raise capital through the issuance of publicly traded stock. However, the many formal requirements placed on C Corps prevent the structure from being the ideal choice for many smaller organizations. To learn more about forming an C Corp, click the link below.Learn more about forming a C Corporation  S CorporationForm a S Corporation (S Corp)The S Corporation (S Corp) structure is similar to the C Corp, with a few notable differences. The most important of these differences is that S Corps are eligible for special pass through taxation status with the IRS. This allows S Corp owners to avoid double taxation on their business income. S Corps must request pass through taxation status, by filing Form 2553 with IRS after successfully incorporating.

Why Incorporate | Why You Should Incorporate Your Business | Swyft Filings Home   Starting Your Business  Why Incorporate Your Business? About Us Pricing Overview Our 5 Step Process Why Incorporate General FAQs Our GuaranteeThe Benefits of IncorporatingIncorporating your business offers a unique mix of benefits, many of which are unavailable to informal business structures such as sole proprietorships and general partnerships. If you are looking for tax flexibility, limited liability, and the option to raise capital, incorporation may be the best path for you. The following are four of the major benefits of incorporation:Increased CredibilityBeing recognized as a corporation proves to creditors and potential clients that your business is organized according to state law. By simply adding “Inc” or “LLC” to the end of your business name gives you the professional look and credibility that many customers are looking for.Tax Benefits Corporation owners are able to deduct many more expenses than those who own informal businesses. These write-offs can be substantial since insurance, travel, and entertainment are deductions. Corporation owners are also free from paying certain self-employment taxes, which informal business owners must pay.Asset ProtectionIn the event that a corporation becomes unable to pay its debts, the owners are given limited liability status. This means that their personal funds or assets cannot be collected in order to pay business debts. In the event legal proceedings are brought against the corporation, the owners’ personal assets are protected.Perpetual lifespan If your business is incorporated, it will not be forced to dissolve due to changes in ownership. The transfer of ownership is typically accomplished through the simple sale of common or unrestricted preferred stock or by membership interest transfers. Informal business structures are not perpetual entities, so in the event that an owner dies or wants to sell, the business typically ceases to exist in its current form. Being a perpetual entity makes it easier for incorporated businesses to get bank loans and to attract investors.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
