Mr. Echols is a member of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and the Texas Society of CPAs. Mr. Echols has been engaged in private investments since 2006. He is a member of the boards of directors and Chairman of the audit committees of EnLink Midstream GP, LLC and EnLink Midstream Manager, LLC, companies that own interests in, respectively, EnLink Midstream Partners, LP and EnLink Midstream, LLC, which are engaged in the gathering, transmission, treating, processing, and marketing of natural gas, natural gas liquids, and crude oil. He is also a member of the board of directors and Chairman of the audit committee of HollyFrontier Corporation, an independent petroleum refiner. From 2008 to 2014, Mr. Echols served on the boards of directors of Crosstex Energy, L.P. and Crosstex Energy, Inc., which are predecessors to certain of the EnLink entities. The Board has determined that Mr. Echols' service on the audit committees of these other public companies does not impair his ability to serve on the Audit Committee of the Company.
In addition to having gained substantial managerial experience as an executive officer of Centex, Mr. Echols possesses important skills and experience gained through his service in public accounting. His service on the boards of other significant companies provides the Board with additional perspective on the Company's operations.
