About Hointer
We help retailers build amazing shopping experiences
                centered on one thing: bringing magic to the in-store experience by merging the best of the
                physical and digital universe.

                Shopping is an immersive experience in a beautiful world, full of delightful new products to
                touch and try, visual displays that catch the eye, and the excitement of finding the perfect
                fit; the perfect gift; or the next big thing. Spreading this magic has been our goal all
                along. 

                We launched as a men’s denim shop in Seattle, with the aim of helping men find the perfect
                pair of jeans for every occasion. Soon we realized that our customers didn't enjoy
                sorting through piles to find a size, standing naked in the dressing room
                waiting for our help, or a long line to check out. Online shopping offered the hope of
                speed and convenience, but also resulted in getting wrong sizes, bad fits, uncomfortable
                materials, and the dilemma of do-I-really-want-to-go-through-the-hassle-of-returning-this.
                

                So we asked ourselves – why not offer the conveniences of the online world, paired with the
                tangible excitement of in-store shopping, to create the ultimate customer experience?
                We started to work with mobile technologies, invented etags and in-store sensors to power our smart
                showroom.
                We developed an uber-efficient microwarehouse capable of locating and retrieving items in under 30
                seconds,
                occupying a fraction of traditional warehouse footprint and placed it in the back of our store.
                
                With that, our technology platform was born. It started with one store – our men’s jeans
                shop in Seattle – and grew into a robust, end-to-end software platform for retailers
                everywhere, who sell everything.
Delight Customers
We give retailers the tools to delight customers and empower sales associates.
                We offer an amazing digital experience that turns customer smartphones into remote controls to the
                physical store so they can get
                what they want, when and how they want.
Increase Sales and Improve Margins
Our tools aren’t just for fun – they help re-invent customer experience and optimize in store cost
                structure,
                making online shopping expensive in comparison.
                Retailers also gain never-before-collected in-store shopping activity data. This allows retailers to
                improve
                in-store processes and optimize inventory and assortment allocations. Our in store personalized
                recommendation system delivers items to key decision making zones in-store: fitting rooms and test areas
                where customers try out products, increasing sales and driving units per transaction.
                Meanwhile, customer relationship management (CRM) becomes easy and digital, so stores can drive repeat
                business without hassle.
            
Save Money
Our system more than pays for itself through decreased store operations costs. Better use of
                space in visual displays and storage areas shrinks store footprints, supporting smaller-store formats.
                Store
                staff members become more productive so fewer need to work at one time, decreasing labor
                costs. And inventory holding requirements decline because of digital inventory tracking and eliminated
                need to fill up the rack,
                while in-store items no longer go missing.
            
Our Team





Driven by the spirit of innovation and a focus on customers, our team is made up of
                        designers and engineers who won’t settle for the status quo. We thrive on continuous
                        improvement. And of course, none of it would be possible without our fearless leader, Dr.
                        Nadia Shouraboura. A retail revolutionary, she has wide ranging talents and bold vision; she
                        holds a Ph.D. in Mathematics from Princeton University, has extensive retail and technology experience,
                        and was former head of Supply Chain and Fulfillment Technologies for Amazon.com.
                        Nadia also served on Jeff Bezos' senior leadership team responsible for overall direction and operations
                        of Amazon.
                    

Breaking All The Retail Rules
By Matt Pillar, mattpillar.com
The Beginning
                        Soviet Russia was a decidedly uninspiring place for young Nadia Shouraboura. Buying shoes meant taking anything close to her size that the Central Department Store had to offer. Style and fit weren’t on the list of purchase criteria. Choice was virtually nonexistent. The closest thing to a positive grocery experience was being rewarded with something—anything—for standing in a long line for a long time. The dismal reality of “retail” during her formative years in Russia is one reason you might consider her rise to retail tech pioneer status improbable.

                        In reality, it was the stark contrast between shopping in her native Russia and the retail experiences she enjoyed after immigrating to Israel and traveling the world that inspired her. Shouraboura’s mathematics and science education landed her work as a software developer working on computer aided design systems for industrial robotics. That work put her on the fast track to a full-ride at Princeton University, where she earned her PhD in mathematics. Important work in the energy sector followed, where Shouraboura made a name for herself developing software algorithms for the energy trade. Through it all, the allure of retail beckoned.

                        In 2004, Shouraboura joined a then-fledgling Amazon.com. It was early during her tenure at Amazon when Shouraboura made it a priority to break away from her workstation frequently to gain firsthand experience of the company’s operations. During a month long commitment to the call center—where she actually worked the phones and took customer calls—that Shouraboura had one of those moments that would define her mission for years to come. “More often than not when a customer called, it was to inquire about an order or when a backordered item would be in stock and shipped,” she says. “In the early days, we had no answer. After a month of practicing every possible way to say ‘I don’t know,’ I dedicated myself to that question.”

                        Her relentless pursuit of supply chain certainty led to Shouraboura’s management of software development, infrastructure, and operations for the technology that powers Amazon’s worldwide supply chain and fulfillment operations. That landed Shouraboura a coveted slot on Jeff Bezos’ elite “S Team,” where her work proved foundational to Amazon’s rollout of several product categories including books and appliances and, ultimately, apparel.

                        The apparel rollout preceded another defining moment for Shouraboura. “We had a lot of experience launching new categories, so we modeled our apparel rollout in similar fashion to the rest,” she explains. “Every Christmas season I would work our call centers, and I learned that the apparel rollout gave rise to a new common customer challenge. Clothes that didn’t fit had to be returned, and the e-commerce model wasn’t conducive to that. It was nearly impossible to make returns a good experience, which wasn’t good for customers, and it wasn’t good for us.”

                        The Pitfalls Of The Physical Store Experience
                        Years removed from her lackluster childhood experiences buying footwear and apparel in Soviet Russia, the apparel rollout at Amazon rekindled Shouraboura’s passion for the physical retail experience. In 2012, Shouraboura made another seemingly improbable move. Seeking to focus solely on improving the shopper’s apparel buying experience, she left Amazon. She walked away from the revolutionary e-commerce marketplace that she had so much skin in creating to pursue a vision that she’d been harboring for decades.

                        Shouraboura opened a store. To be more precise, she opened a brick-and-mortar store. Admittedly, she knew very little about what she was setting out to do.

                        Shouraboura played a central role in the early growth of Amazon. If she could quickly take new categories and concepts to scale there, how difficult could it be in a physical sales environment, where she could personally attend to shoppers’ needs?

                        She appointed herself sole proprietor of self-financed Hointer, a high-end Seattle men’s denim store she opened with her own money. She studied denim relentlessly. She got to know all the top designers, and she stuffed her store racks to the gills with expensive inventory. In 2012, she opened her doors in altruistic pursuit of her dream. She envisioned spending her days helping shoppers discover their styles, focusing on the fashion, and delighting her customers.

                        Six months later, Shouraboura was on the verge of closing up shop and cutting her losses.

                        “The experience was horrible,” she laments. “Instead of improving the personal experience of fashion retailing and selling lots of jeans, I spent six months chasing and folding clothes. My displays were a constant mess. The fitting rooms were a constant mess. I hated customers. I hated the whole experience.”

                        Rather than quit, however, Shouraboura doubled down. She decided to change the physical retail apparel experience from the inside out. Acknowledging that her life as a retail sales associate was miserable, she began to think about running a store from the associate’s perspective. “The more I thought about it, the more clear it became that if I wasn’t having a good time, neither were my customers,” she says. Ever the observant recorder of equations, she decided to change her perspective. She began by charting and analyzing the customer experience instead of her own as a storeowner. She found that ultimately, her customers weren’t trying on enough clothes, and if they weren’t likely to buy what they weren’t trying on. “My customers would pick a few items and go into the fitting room. If it didn’t fit, they’d have to get dressed and go find something else. They would only repeat this process a couple of times at most before yelling through the fitting room door for associate help to find another size.” The traditional means of delivering that assistance proved no more pleasant. There’s something decidedly uncomfortable and awkward about hands-on personal interaction between a female store associate and a man in his underwear. “They would ask me once to bring them another size, rarely twice,” recalls Shouraboura. “The reason they came to my store was to try on clothes, but it was so awkward and cumbersome, they wouldn’t try on enough.”

                        A Petri Dish Of Retail Experimentation
                        Shouraboura’s solution to the physical retail experience conundrum at Hointer would raise a lot of eyebrows. Drawing on her experience designing Amazon warehouses, and her experience with robotic automation before that, she made a radical change to her store’s design and operations. She completely removed the stacks and racks of jeans from her store, save for a display model of each style and wash. The sales floor became a showroom instead of a stockroom. Inventory was arranged in orderly fashion in a micro warehouse in the back of the store, invisible to customers. Fitting rooms were equipped with two chutes—one in, one out. Using an app, shoppers punch in the style and size they want, and in fewer than 30 seconds the item is delivered to the fitting room via the “in” chute. Items that don’t fit are placed by the customer into the “out” chute for return to the micro warehouse. “Suddenly, shoppers were trying on an exponentially higher number of items,” says Shouraboura. “It wasn’t uncommon for my customers to try on thirty items in one visit.”

                        That facilitated a simple numbers game—the more jeans customers tried on, the more they bought.

                        For Every Success, Ten Failures
                        Shouraboura’s automated fitting room experiment at her Hointer store is one of many she’s engaged in since the 2012 launch of her business, and she’s not afraid to admit that more of them fail than succeed. That’s why she’s adamant that a retailer’s “innovation lab” should be a store, not a skunk works operation.  “Ninety nine percent of the experiments I try don’t work at all,” she says. “When I hear about retailers experimenting with new ideas in a lab, I often chuckle when we’ve already failed what they’re attempting. I don’t think a lab helps. I think experiments nee to happen in a physical store, where it’s make or break. Everything looks good in a lab. Every midnight idea sounds brilliant there. Then you put it in a store, and more often than not, it doesn’t work.” Shouraboura chalks many failures up to fragility and complexity. Stores, she says, are active environments where kids play, cords get pulled, hardware and software get abused, and associates are not trained to maintain, troubleshoot, and resolve complex technology.


                        What does work, she says, must be scalable and inexpensive. A fitting room concept  that costs $5,000 dollars per installation isn’t feasible for a department store with hundreds or thousands of locations and dozens of fitting rooms in each store.

                        She also cautions that lots of new technologies look fantastic, but they don’t lift sales. For that reason, she advises extremely careful, and patient, measurement of sales lift. Even with good ideas, she says, you don’t typically see an immediate impact on sales. “With a good idea and proper execution, you will see lift within a couple of months. If I receive positive feedback from customers, and it’s inexpensive and scalable and they love it, I give it some time before I expect sales to increase.”

                        Interestingly, Shouraboura says the best in-store technology—the stuff that does have a positive impact on sales—is commonly invisible to the consumer. “As strange as it sounds coming from a technologist, people don’t go shopping to play with technology,” she says. “They shop to experience products and interact with associates. In many cases, technology has a negative impact on sales because shoppers spend their time playing with gadgets and displays instead of trying on products. If they’re not trying on products, we’re not selling them.”

                        Expanding The Concept
                        Shouraboura’s appetite for disruption isn’t abating. As her original Hointer concept in Seattle continues to thrive, she’s busy applying variations of the model to other segments, including grocery and toys.

                        In traditional toy stores, Shouraboura’s dissatisfaction lies within store shelves packed with toys that are meant to be interactive, but are zip-tied into clamshell packages that limit children’s interaction with them. “In our toy store experiment, we took all the racks away and created a playground. We allow kids to come in and play, and using the same concept developed for our Hointer denim store, we leverage chutes to introduce new toys to them based on their interests.”  Parents can quickly purchase the toys their children choose using their smart phone or a store-supplied “magic wand,” which adds the toy to their order upon touching it When the experience is over, the packaged items in the purchase are automatically delivered from the micro warehouse. “The concept is so popular, the store is constantly busy, even on Monday mornings, because it’s a destination.

                        Similarly, Shouraboura’s experience working on Amazon Fresh has shaped her vision of the grocery store of the future. “Grocery stores are crammed with shelf real estate that’s expensive from a merchandising and inventory perspective,” says Shouraboura, “but it isn’t necessary for shoppers to touch, feel, and smell a great majority of that inventory.” Consumers want to touch an apple or smell a melon, for instance, but that tactile and sensory experience isn’t necessary to the purchase of a bottle of ketchup. “Shelves  upon shelves of identical items require a lot of space, yet add nothing to the consumer experience.” Instead, Shouraboura’s grocery concept, in keeping with the Hointer model, provides a showroom where one bottle of each ketchup variety is on display. Using a smart phone or a magic wand, items are quickly added to the cart and collected from the back room for checkout. “The same customer-held technology can provide suggestions and reminders and other grocery shopping applications,” she says.

                        Shouraboura’s ideas have garnered attention and funding from several large international retailers, and winning concepts are being licensed to other retailers. “The future of the store is much like we envisioned the future of e-commerce twenty years ago,” she says. “It started slowly, and no one accurately predicted its impact. We’re starting the same way, and we’re confident that the store of the future will look and act very differently than it does today.” Having said that, and despite her passionate commitment to brick-and-mortar retail, she’s still a fan of Amazon. “E-commerce is perfect for products where price, convenience, and selection are the primary sales drivers; product like printer cartridges, with which a shopper has no emotional connection,” she says. “But, when shopping for apparel or jewelry or toys, a photo won’t do I for the consumer because she doesn’t feel anything.” Online, she says speed will continue to be the merchant’s main focus for the next several years. “We had a comfortable 14 day fulfillment window when we started Amazon. Now, two days is a given, and we’re moving rapidly toward a day, or an hour.”  The next big opportunity for stores to thrive, says Shouraboura, is experiential, and she’ll continue taking risks and working tirelessly to enable it.


                    
                




Case Studies

Improving digital operational excellence.
Digital technology can create dramatic changes in the efficiency and productivity in the store,
                including making the showroom more productive by showcasing more styles. Macy’s recently partnered with
                Hointer, a retail store technology platform that brings the efficiency of online eCommerce to
                brick-and-mortar retail, to transform the swimwear department. By automating the picking of items in the
                back room and bringing them to the dressing room on behalf of the customer, Macy’s and Hointer are able
                to move the bulk of the inventory into the stock room, thus enabling the store to showcase 60% more
                styles in the same physical footprint.

"High-tech Shopping at Hointer"







Increase in-store sales and lower your cost structure





Hointer changed the dressing room experience
                    completely with an iPad
                    interface that avoids awkward associate interactions and makes use of automated micro-warehouses.
                    And
                    the impact was significant with 6x more items tried on, while cross-product recommendations led to
                    an
                    80% increase in sales.











Hointer became an end-to-end solution for
                    retail stores—digitized
                    product information, smart fitting rooms and streamlined backroom operations, enabling customers to
                    browse
                    easily and try on a larger selection of clothes. It also allowed sales associates to use customer
                    and
                    product data to make personalized recommendations.
                    The result: improved customer experiences, higher sales and fewer returns.











 In addition to the streamlined digitized experience,
                    Hointer
                    technology
                    also reduces the need for shelf and floor space and opens up new modes of attractive product
                        presentation.
                











 As both a technology and retailer innovator — not unlike Amazon!
                    —
                    Hointer is educating its shoppers to shop in a different way with different
                    norms and different
                    expectations. The product of that education is not just a more sophisticated Hointer shopper, but a
                    shopper who may now become impatient with the delays, inefficiencies, and inferior experiences
                    proffered
                    by other retailers. That’s where value-added differentiation and competitive advantage come
                        from.
                












Hointer is truly a quintessential example of the convergence of the art and
                    science of retailing.
                











Hointer improves showroom density by 60% -
                    microwarehouse improve space utilization in stores by reducing the number of each item that must be
                    displayed on the floor. How big of a difference does it make? In a recent test with Macy’s, Hointer
                    was able to optimize the floor space and showcase 60% more styles on the showroom floor.
                    Furthermore, because customers don’t have to rummage through inventory for their size, associates
                    spend less time refreshing displays and more time helping customers.

What Jeff Bezos did when this new Amazon employee made a huge mistake

Hointer founder Nadia
  Shouraboura
Nadia
  Shouraboura



  By the time Nadia Shouraboura left Amazon in 2012 after more than
  8 years at the company, she had risen through the ranks into one
  of the most important positions: VP of technology, in charge of
  all its supply chain and fulfillment platforms globally. 

  She was also a member of CEO Jeff Bezos' elite "S-Team" of direct
  reports. 

  Once of her most memorable and impactful moments happened right
  after she was first hired, though.

  Not long after Shouraboura joined the company in 2004, she made a
  huge mistake. When a shipment of new products came in, she
  instructed them to be put up on the highest shelves of the
  warehouse. When a bunch of orders for that product came in, there
  wasn't enough staff to get the product down fast enough
  (remember, this was pre Amazon's warehouse-robot days).  
    

  "I was trying to figure out how I would save the situation," she
  told Business Insider. "So I came up with a model to figure
  out how to minimize the amount of money spent to fix the issue,
  so they wouldn't fire me."





  Her model helped her figure out how late how many of the products
  would have to be, to theoretically cause the least damage. 

  "I brought the model to Jeff Bezos and the S Team, and they
  basically told me that I was being an idiot," she says. "They
  said we just needed to ship everything as fast as we could,
  without regards to cost. We needed to make sure the
  experience was right, and then worry about the money afterwards."

  Amazon brought on outside help and paid expedited shipping for
  all the orders, so that everyone would get their package on
  time. 

  "It cost a lot — was a big number," Shouraboura says with a
  slight laugh. "That's customer obsession for you. That
  situation taught me a lot very quickly. They still adhere to that
  philosophy today."
"Customer
  obsession" is one of the company's main tenets. Amazon
  obviously didn't fire Shouraboura after her mishap, and she says
  she internalized that idea throughout her next 8 years at the
  company. Eventually, she left to found her own retail startup, called
  Hointer. Hointer is anti-Amazon in that it focuses solely on
  ways to improve brick-and-mortar retail. However, one thing is
  the same: The main focus of her company is to make the shopping
  experience more convenient for customers.

Dr. Nadia Shouraboura was born in Soviet Russia. Her work in machine learning attracted the attention of Princeton University where she was offered a scholarship and received a PhD in Mathematics. Her research resulted in several important papers, referenced by over 200 publications.
Nadia joined Amazon.com in March of 2004 and served on Jeff Bezos’ executive team responsible for overall direction and operations of Amazon. Under her guidance as the Head of Worldwide Supply Chain and Fulfillment, Amazon achieved the largest product selection on earth and implemented a novel retail supply chain controlling the move of every item, every associate and every package with precision in real time, worldwide.
During her work on Amazon’s acquisition of Zappos Nadia started to think about the ultimate experience of shopping for tactile items.  She left Amazon to open a high-end Seattle men’s denim store, Hointer, with the vision to change the physical retail experience from the inside out.
The sales floor is a showroom instead of a stockroom. Inventory is arranged in a micro-warehouse in the back of the store, invisible to customers. Fitting rooms are equipped with two chutes—one in, one out. Customers have a new way to shop in store using gestures, mobile devices and magic wands and items magically appear in fitting rooms in under 30 seconds. Customers love the new Hointer store experience it’s been featured in 1000+ publications worldwide and Hointer now licenses its technology to other retailers.
Hointer is now working with an array of top retail brands globally and Nadia is in much demand as a key-note speaker on IOT and the future of retail.
Nadia lives in Seattle with her husband Charlie. Their daughter Caroline studies mathematics and machine learning at Carnegie Mellon University.

    Hointer: How a mathematician got micro-robots to sell you jeans

Nadia Shouraboura’s mathematician parents were disappointed she pursued a career in retail rather than academia, but the former Amazon executive may hold the keys to success for bricks and mortar retailers in a digital age.“There’s a very beautiful part of retail, the beauty of the store and the fun that people have when they go to the store,” says Ms Shouraboura, founder and chief executive of retail technology firm Hointer. “But there is a part that’s really old and hasn’t changed much . . . it could be a great experience if they added great technology to it.”

The Soviet-born mathematician, software developer and robotics engineer believes bricks and mortar retailers are better placed than pure-play online retailers to satisfy consumer demand for products such as apparel and consumer electronics.However, many traditional retailers are stuck in the 20th century, burdened with inefficient systems and costs that make it almost impossible to compete with low-cost online rivals.“When I look at e-commerce in the past 15 years, the progress has been on the technology side, but when I look at retail I don’t see much progress at all,” Ms Shouraboura told Fairfax Media ahead of an online retail conference in Sydney this week.After almost nine years running ­supply chain, fulfilment and inventory buying at Amazon, Ms Shouraboura started developing a suite of retail ­technologies that promise to transform bricks and mortar retailers by giving them the tools to compete with online retailers while reducing rent, labour and inventory costs.

Two years ago she launched Hointer, a chain of menswear stores that acts as a test lab for innovation and a showroom for prospective retail partners.There is little stock on shelves and less than a handful of staff.

Micro robots
Shoppers download the Hointer app, make their selection from about 150 styles of jeans, shirts and tops ­suspended on steel cables and scan a QR code with their smartphone or tablet. Within 30 seconds the products are despatched via micro-robotics from storeroom to designated dressing rooms. Unwanted items are discarded in a chute and deleted from shopping carts while wanted items are purchased by swiping a credit or debit card.Hointer stores have one-fifth the floor space of traditional stores, as inventory is tightly packed in storerooms rather than displayed on shelves, and half the number of staff, who have more time to serve customers. Costs are substantially lower, while the sales uplift is estimated to be between 30 per cent and 50 per cent. “Customers who come to Hointer end up trying on a lot more items,” Ms Shouraboura said. “Normally customers try on three to five – at Hointer on average they try on 12 because it’s very fast.”Ferrier Hodgson retail partner James Stewart says the technology and store experience pioneered by Hointer could be a game changer for retailers.“The tech companies think this is a really interesting concept and ultimately you could see a blend of this sort of technology with human interaction,” Mr Stewart said.“The role that retail staff will play in the next five years will be a lot less about the checkout process and a lot more about the value-add process.”Ms Shouraboura is now in talks with several retailers, including a major consumer electronics chain in the United States, about incorporating Hointer’s technology into their models.It may seem futuristic, but Ms Shouraboura believes some of Hointer’s retail technology will eventually become mainstream. “It works well for apparel, it works well for toys, it works well for electronics when customers want to experience before they decide, it works for jewellery and it will probably work well for grocery,” she said.

CEO Profiles 

My View – Dr. Nadia Shouraboura 
December 8, 2015 By Dr. Nadia Shouraboura









 


A Series of Firsthand Views from Industry Leaders on the Retail Landscape, Careers, Personal Insights and the Future of Retail.
How did you get into this business?
I was born in Soviet Russia, where “retail” meant that when you see a line, you try to cut in and wait to grab whatever you can regardless of what it is. When I crossed the border into Hungary and saw my first food store, I was in awe. At that moment I fell in love with retail and most importantly with the impact it has on people’s li
Who has been your greatest influence/mentor?
My grandfather, a Russian space scientist, taught me that we could put a man in space using the computing power of a T-84 calculator. When people ask me how expensive the Hointer solution is, I always think of high school calculators.
What is your greatest source of inspiration, or where do you get your best ideas?
Making love to my husband is my source of inspiration. I always dream about making shopping as exciting and passionate as sex.
What retail operation do you think is innovative and sustainable?
Convenience through technology. The reason tech has been used in so many ways in the online world is because we can easily learn about individual customers and change the way they interact with products. While harder to understand customers and their product interactions in the physical world, the retail experience is much richer—so we have greater opportunity over time to change the overall game. Innovation, though, is about constant change. It doesn’t sit still. So anything I call out as innovative is only sustainable if it soon becomes something different.
What is your favorite place to shop?
Macy’s Herald Square on Thanksgiving put a spell over me since I was a student, and I love their ongoing makeover. Given the amazing history of that store and yet its ability to constantly reinvent itself, I always feel hope for the future of physical retail when I shop there.
Over the last five years, what has been the biggest change in the industry?
The maturity of ecommerce and early attempts by retailers to fuse physical and digital shopping.
What do you think will change the most in the next five years?
The in-store experience and fusion of digital and physical. This is our biggest opportunity, both in customer experience and supply chain.
What would people be surprised to know about you?
I walked out of the Soviet Union and lived on the streets of Hungary before I could find my way to America. Also, I love to read and write computer programs. I used to read through millions of lines of code at Amazon, and I write a lot of code at Hointer.
What books are you reading?
I’m reading about SpaceX and Tesla, by Ashlee Vance. I think when we create a Tesla-like fitting room at Macy’s, men will line up.
What’s your favorite leisure activity?
I don’t have one. I love to work and I’m okay doing it all the time. When my daughter wants to spend time with me, she comes to Hointer.
What lessons have you learned from elsewhere in your life that you can apply to retail?
I did my Ph.D. in mathematics and I learned how to apply many different ideas and use data to confirm which solution works best. We do the same at Hointer. Most things we try do not work, but the several things that work really well for us and for Macy’s have increased sales. So we double down on those ideas.
What’s your favorite quote (and who said it)?
Jeff Bezos likes to say, “Step by step, ferociously”—and it sits well with me.
What’s your favorite online site?
NASA’s website http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/ It covers space missions. I keep thinking, if we can put a man on Mars, we can reinvent how people shop and make it magical.
