BUFFALO, N.Y., Feb. 23, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Janet M. Coletti, an M&T executive with broad experience in both retail and small business banking management, has been promoted to Executive Vice President for Human Resources and appointed to M&T Bank's Management Committee. 
Comprised of the company's top 13 executives and led by Chairman and CEO Robert G. Wilmers, M&T's Management Committee meets weekly to set the direction and oversee the performance of one of the nation's top 20 largest, independent commercial bank holding companies. Ms. Coletti will join the group in March. A full list of the committee members can be found at https://newsroom.mtb.com/leadership-team. 
She will succeed Steve Braunscheidel as head of the company's Human Resources division, as he transitions to part-time status March 1 after a 36-year career at M&T. Mr. Braunscheidel began his career with M&T in 1978 and held various positions in retail banking, consumer lending, the M&T Investment Group and human resources. In 2004, he was promoted to head of human resources and joined the Management Committee. He will continue to consult with the bank, working on a part-time basis for the remainder of the year. 
"Steve made a tremendous contribution in helping us maintain our culture as we grew from a small bank in Western New York to one of the nation's leading regional banks," said M&T Bank Chairman and CEO Robert G. Wilmers. 
"Janet has a similarly deep background in M&T's business lines and understands how our culture is focused on helping our customers and communities succeed. With close to 16,000 employees, including more than 6,300 in our headquarters community of Buffalo, the human resources job is a crucial one and I am confident Janet is the right person to lead our workforce into the future," he said.
Ms. Coletti has 30 years of experience at M&T. She began her career in 1985, as part of M&T's Management Development Program and has since held numerous positions in retail banking and retail operations. She has also provided support for numerous bank acquisitions and conversions. She assumed responsibility for the Business Banking division in 2010. 
A graduate of Mount Holyoke College, she received her Bachelor of Arts degree in economics.  She is a member of the Small Business Banking Committee of the Consumer Bankers Association, a member of The National Program Development Committee of WNED and serves on the board of the Roycroft Campus Corporation.

                Janet Coletti, executive vice president in charge of human resources at M&T Bank.            








 



It's official: Longtime M&T Bank manager Janet Coletti is now executive vice president in charge of human resources.
The new title means Coletti, who has managed both retail and business banking, gets a seat at the bank's executive management table. She succeeds Stephen Braunscheidel, who had been in charge of human resources since 2004.

                            Janet Coletti, executive vice president in charge of human resources at M&T Bank.                        










 


In her new role, Coletti oversees the department that supports 16,000 M&T employees in multiple states. Most recently, she was senior vice president of M&T's banking business division.
Coletti joined the bank in 1985 as part of M&T's Management Development Program. In addition to her tenure in the retail banking segment, she has been involved in a support role in several of M&T's acquisitions and conversions.




She talked about her new role in December, saying the job feels like "a natural fit" after working with so many different people throughout the years.
Coletti is now the second female to sit on M&T's 13-person executive management committee. She joins the likes of Robert Wilmers, chairman and CEO; Mark Czarnecki, president and chief operating officer; and Rene Jones, co-vice chairman and chief financial officer.
