Click Here for Important Risk Factors

The Fund should be considered speculative and involves a high degree of risk including the potential loss of investment.
The Fund’s illiquid nature will prevent investors from having access to their money for an indefinite period of time.
Investors are subject to stockholders transaction expenses of 10% in addition to annual management fees.
The Fund has elected to be taxed as a REIT, but if it fails to meet the requirements, there may be adverse tax consequences.
An investor should not expect to be able to sell fund shares regardless of how the fund performs and if shares are sold, it is likely an investor will receive less than the purchase price and less than the current NAV.
The fund has implemented a share repurchase program, but does not expect to repurchase more than 5.0% of the shares that were outstanding in the prior year on average. In addition, any such repurchases will be at a 10.0% discount to the most recent offering price for 2 years following the close of the Offering, rising thereafter.
Dividends are not guaranteed, and the fund is permitted to return a limited amount of capital, or borrow, to fund dividends.
An investment in the fund’s shares is not suitable if an investor will need access to the money invested. Because an investor will be unable to sell shares of the fund, it will not be possible to reduce exposure on any market downturn unless and until the fund is listed.
An investor will pay a sales load of up to 10% and offering expenses of up to 4.1% on the amount it invests. If an investor pays the maximum aggregate of 14.1% for sales load and offering expenses, the investment must experience a total return of 16.4% in order to recover these expenses.

 

OverviewFinding dependable sources of meaningful income in a low interest rate environment can be challenging. Since 1987, MacKenzie has provided non-correlated alternatives to investors looking for income and portfolio diversification.
Core StrategyThe fund’s core strategy is to purchase illiquid securities at significant discounts to estimated net asset value. With them, we seek to build diversified portfolios of income-producing and growth-oriented REITs and limited partnerships. Our clients invest at prices we estimate to be significantly below current market value of the underlying asset.
Knowledge is KeyMacKenzie Realty Capital is managed by MacKenzie Capital Management (“MacKenzie”) and its investment advisory affiliate, MCM Advisers, LP (“MCMA”), who have specialized in the area of discounted real estate securities for more than a quarter of a century.
ExperienceOur team of real estate and securities analysts has extensive hands-on acquisition experience and deep insight into the real estate market. We also have a proprietary database of real estate securities collected over 27 years of continued analysis, which allows us to quickly recognize, and potentially capitalize on, windows of opportunity.

This is the company's regular quarterly dividend at the annual rate of 7% based upon the sale price of $10 per Share, plus an additional special dividend of 3.5 cent per share, primarily due to the sale of a block of shares of, and an initial liquidating distribution from, KBS Real Estate Investment Trust. Unless pro-rated due to closings during the quarter, shareholders of record as of March 31, 2017, will receive a total dividend equal to $0.21 per Share, and will be paid on or about May 19, 2017, in cash or reinvested in stock for those participating in the Company's dividend reinvestment plan.

On 11/15/2016, Mackenzie Realty Capital, Inc. announced that they will be unable to file their next 10-Q by the deadline required by the SEC.


Mackenzie Realty Capital, Inc. Declares Regular Third Quarterly Dividend and Special Dividend, Payable on or About November 15, 2016
Nov 14 16
The board of directors of MacKenzie Realty Capital, Inc. has authorized the Company to declare two dividends for the third quarter 2016. The first is the Company's regular quarterly dividend at the annual rate of 7% based upon the sale price of $10 per Share. The second is a special dividend resulting in large part from the sale of TIER REIT Shares owned by the Company and the receipt of cash consideration from the merger of Apple REIT Ten. Of the total amount being distributed, $235,125 was declared on September 14, 2016, relating to 2015 taxable income, but scheduled to be paid with this quarterly dividend. Unless pro-rated due to closings during the quarter as described in the paragraph below, shareholders of record as of September 30, 2016, will receive a total dividend equal to $0.25 per Share, and will be paid on or about November 15, 2016, in cash or reinvested in stock for those participating in the Company's dividend reinvestment plan. The Board anticipates making future declared dividends, if any, on a similar schedule, approximately 45 days after the close of the previous fiscal quarter. The Board determined that the Company had sufficient income from the quarter ended September 30, 2016, to support the regular quarterly dividend to Stockholders at the annualized rate of 7%, in addition to the special dividend, without distributing any original capital.

Click Here for Important Risk Factors

The Fund should be considered speculative and involves a high degree of risk including the potential loss of investment.
The Fund’s illiquid nature will prevent investors from having access to their money for an indefinite period of time.
Investors are subject to stockholders transaction expenses of 10% in addition to annual management fees.
The Fund has elected to be taxed as a REIT, but if it fails to meet the requirements, there may be adverse tax consequences.
An investor should not expect to be able to sell fund shares regardless of how the fund performs and if shares are sold, it is likely an investor will receive less than the purchase price and less than the current NAV.
The fund has implemented a share repurchase program, but does not expect to repurchase more than 5.0% of the shares that were outstanding in the prior year on average. In addition, any such repurchases will be at a 10.0% discount to the most recent offering price for 2 years following the close of the Offering, rising thereafter.
Dividends are not guaranteed, and the fund is permitted to return a limited amount of capital, or borrow, to fund dividends.
An investment in the fund’s shares is not suitable if an investor will need access to the money invested. Because an investor will be unable to sell shares of the fund, it will not be possible to reduce exposure on any market downturn unless and until the fund is listed.
An investor will pay a sales load of up to 10% and offering expenses of up to 4.1% on the amount it invests. If an investor pays the maximum aggregate of 14.1% for sales load and offering expenses, the investment must experience a total return of 16.4% in order to recover these expenses.

 

OverviewFinding dependable sources of meaningful income in a low interest rate environment can be challenging. Since 1987, MacKenzie has provided non-correlated alternatives to investors looking for income and portfolio diversification.
Core StrategyThe fund’s core strategy is to purchase illiquid securities at significant discounts to estimated net asset value. With them, we seek to build diversified portfolios of income-producing and growth-oriented REITs and limited partnerships. Our clients invest at prices we estimate to be significantly below current market value of the underlying asset.
Knowledge is KeyMacKenzie Realty Capital is managed by MacKenzie Capital Management (“MacKenzie”) and its investment advisory affiliate, MCM Advisers, LP (“MCMA”), who have specialized in the area of discounted real estate securities for more than a quarter of a century.
ExperienceOur team of real estate and securities analysts has extensive hands-on acquisition experience and deep insight into the real estate market. We also have a proprietary database of real estate securities collected over 27 years of continued analysis, which allows us to quickly recognize, and potentially capitalize on, windows of opportunity.

Its team of seasoned real estate analysts, comprising over 30 percent of the firm’s personnel, provides in-depth analysis of an investment’s viability by using a proprietary real estate securities database.
EXPERTISE AND VISIONMacKenzie Capital Management’s programs run the gamut from conservative to aggressive, each providing current cash flow and the expectation of future returns based on the eventual full-price liquidation of the underlying assets. By applying expertise, vision and an opportunistic mindset, MacKenzie Capital Management has consistently generated strong returns for its investors.
