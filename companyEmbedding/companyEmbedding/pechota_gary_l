Pechota























































HILL CITY | Gary Lynn Pechota, age 67, of Hill City, SD, passed away peacefully on Thursday, Dec. 15, 2016, at Rapid City Regional Hospital.Mass will be held at 10:30 a.m. Tuesday, Dec. 20, 2016, at The Cathedral of Our Lady of Perpetual Help, with visitation starting at 9:30 a.m. A reception and luncheon will follow at the church. A Rosary Service will be held at St. Isidore Catholic Church in Colome, SD, at 1 p.m., with private interment at Colome Cemetery on Wednesday, Dec. 21.Gary was born in Pasadena, CA, on Oct. 19, 1949, to Junior and Leona Pechota, the middle child. Relocation did not work out and so the family moved back to Colome, SD, in 1950, where he lived with his parents and brother, Terry, and sister, Tonna, until he graduated in 1967 from Colome High School. For 18 years of his life, his entire world, it seemed, was Colome, Winner and Gregory. His life revolved around going to school, his friends, and working for Junior, who cut no one any slack on the job for any reason and for which Gary would often credit as one of the reasons for his success. He was small for his age growing up but getting run over by older kids, playing sandlot football on the Manzer field, trying to tackle Kenny Sorber, and playing basketball and fighting at nearly every scrimmage with his brother only made him tougher. He had no fear. He got lost on Labor Day in Winner when he was 6 years old and started to hitchhike back to Colome. In Teener baseball, he broke his arm catching and pitched the next day with a cast on the other arm. He found a little bit of humor in most anything. He promised Miss Dedlow that he would not jump from the outside ledge of the classroom if there was no test on that day.
His last two years in high school were special. He had stellar years playing football. Local Colome pundits still talk of his game with Bonesteel. He held the single game scoring record in basketball at Colome for a while, and no one could beat him for the first 30 yards of the 100 yard dash, giving him great delight in maintaining the he could have been an Olympic champion if there was a race of that distance. And he loved to talk about, and never let anyone forget, that Colome beat Winner in basketball his senior year. He kept in regular contact with his close friends whom he grew up with and went to high school with including Mick Tarr, Gary Hutchinson, Bob Manzer, and a host of others. He loved Colome, the accomplishments of the school and the people who lived there, and would not have traded his upbringing there for any other.After graduating from Colome High School in 1967, finishing 13th in his class, Gary went to Black Hills State College where graduated with a business degree in 1971. Gary married Julie Anne Weidensee on Aug. 6, 1971, in Spearfish, SD. After graduating, he went to work at Rosebud Electronics in Mission on the Rosebud Indian Reservation, where he met Bill Janklow who became a best friend and confidant. Gary and Julie moved to Palo Alto, CA, in 1972 where Gary completed his MBA from Stanford University. After graduating in 1974, they moved to Minneapolis, MN, where Gary worked for General Mills Corp. He went to Ernst and Ernst Accounting Firm as a Certified Public Accountant.In the early 1980s the family returned to South Dakota where Gary was employed by Knecht Lumber Company and eventually became CEO of South Dakota Cement Plant from 1983 through 1992. The opportunity to turn around another cement plant drew Gary and the family to relocate to the Lehigh Valley in Pennsylvania where he held the top leadership roles for Giant Cement Holding Corp. from 1992 through 2003. Gary then spent two years as Chief of Staff for the National Indian Gaming Commission.Gary then served on several corporate boards (BH Corporation, Insteel Industries, Inc.) and private ventures (DT-Trak) and returned to their beloved Black Hills of South Dakota where he and Julie built their dream log home.Gary was preceded in death by his father, Junior Pechota.; his sister, Tonna Cox and her husband Mack Cox. He is survived by his wife, Julie; son, Christopher and daughter, Mary (Kati); grandchildren, Eileen Pagan, Emily Letson, Kimberly Diaz, Olivia Facenda, Faith Facenda, Aidan Weller, and Brayden Frank; five great-grandchildren; his mother, Leona Pechota; and his brother, Terry Pechota.

Gary enjoyed attending a good track meet or basketball game, spending time with his children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren.He will be buried in Colome, where it all began and where he will eternally rest near Junior and Tonna and Mac, who can continually remind him that, in the final analysis, he, like everyone else, could have worked a little harder.Memorials have been established at St. Isidore Catholic Church in Colome, SD, and Mt. Carmel Catholic Church in Keystone, SD. Friends may sign Gary’s online guestbook at Kirk Funeral Home’s website.

I'm deeply saddened by the loss of Gary. No one was more professional, honest, and fair in all interactions. He leaves an incredible legacy of commitment to South Dakota and his family. All who were associated with Gary whether personally or professionally benefitted from his intelligence and humor.

Dear Katie and Family,I am so sorry to hear about your dad.  When I saw the picture in the obituaries I immediately recognized AIden's "Gramps ".  You and your family are in my thoughts and prayers. Love to all.Mary Ann Brown Seton Academy

Gary was a special spirit.  I remember him with the warmest feelings and I always walked with a lighter step after seeing him.  One remembrance was his teaching me to drink Mexican beer with a lime twist. And always teasing Julie!My heart goes out to you, Julie, and to your children and grandchildren.  He is one of the real losses.

Peace to you all

Julie, Terry, Tona and all the Pechota family.....Gary and I played phone tag the past few years leaving voice mail messages but never connecting.  As kids growing up we had in common that Jr. (Gary"s Dad) did carpentry/remodel work and my Dad ran the lumber yard.  We always joked around that some day we should start PeDrip Construction Company, named after our last names.  Gary, I know you will be missed, Thought and Prayers to all of you at this difficult time.        Rick Wardrip in Mesa, Arizona
