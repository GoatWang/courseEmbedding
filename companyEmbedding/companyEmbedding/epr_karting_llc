EPR Properties, a Kansas City-based REIT that has helped fund the land acquisition for many Topgolf developments around the country, paid $7.13 million on Monday for 11.8 acres on Universal Boulevard across from the convention center, where the company will invest a projected $20 million to build a 65,000-square-foot entertainment center.GrowthSpotter first reported on Sept. 10 that Dallas-based Topgolf and Georgia-based Andretti Indoor Karting & Games were in advanced planning stages for neighboring attractions on Universal Boulevard, with more than 20 acres of Orlando Equity Partners land to be acquired between the two, northwest of the Orange County Convention Center.

(Bob Moser)

Topgolf development manager Ted Heilbron confirmed the company's plans on Sept. 24 to build an entertainment facility with a golf driving range on 11.8 acres. Closing on the land purchase and groundbreaking had been forecasted for November, but plat approvals with the county and private factors delayed the process by three months. Topgolf officials formally announced last week that construction will begin in February on the Orlando property, and the venue is expected to open in 2017.

(Bob Moser)

Andretti Karting is expected to close on its purchase of its nine-acre rectangular lot in mid-April, directly south of the Topgolf lot, where it will spend an estimated $30 million to build a 100,000-square-foot enclosed entertainment center with video games, meeting space, electric go-karts on three levels of elevated track, zip-lines, bowling, a restaurant and more.Officials at Topgolf and Andretti Karting did not respond to requests for comment on Wednesday. General contractor on the project is Arco/Murray and the architect is Aria Group, both firms from suburban Chicago that have contributed to the majority of Topgolf's developments in the United States. Both are also working on Andretti Karting's project plans.

The Topgolf and Andretti Karting developments lie southwest of the majority of a 474-acre package of 19 parcels that was acquired on Dec. 17 by an affiliate of Comcast, corporate owner of Universal Orlando. Comcast confirmed Wednesday morning in an earnings report that the company spent $130 million to buy land of that acreage size in the vicinity of its Orlando theme park, the Orlando Sentinel reported. Have a tip about Central Florida development?

PARTIES, GROUP EVENTS, AND SPECIAL EVENTS

 





START PLANNING >








At K1 Speed, we pride ourselves on providing our guests with an unforgettable experience. Our karting centers are world-class entertainment venues and we strive to deliver thrills that will satisfy even the most ardent of racing enthusiasts. Though our Arrive & Drive racing package is a great option for most of our guests, we also host special events, group events, and private parties. Our group packages are a terrific way for you to experience the thrill of head-to-head racing with family, friends, co-workers, or associates. If you’re interested in planning a group or special event, or are looking to host a party, please contact K1 Speed today to speak with one of our event planners.

 
















ADULT PARTIES




What better way to spend time with family and friends than a night out at the kart track? Our adult parties offer a terrific opportunity for friends, siblings, spouses, and family members to enjoy each other’s company, challenge each other on the track, relax with a meal, and experience the adrenaline-inducing thrills of indoor kart racing. Whether you choose to start your night out with a couple of laps around our track or end the day, we are confident that you will have an absolute blast.

 
LEARN MORE ABOUT ADULT PARTIES >


















BIRTHDAY PARTIES




Our centers make for unforgettable birthday parties that are great for kids, teenagers, and adults. Whether you’re planning a small birthday party for the family or a large event for a group of children, we can accommodate your needs. Our race packages include podium celebrations for the winners, group photos, and available catering. Your children will not forget this birthday for months to come – in fact, they may ask to have their birthday at K1 Speed next year as well!

 
LEARN MORE ABOUT BIRTHDAY PARTIES >


















BACHELOR PARTIES




We have private room rentals available and a number of different race packages that are perfect for bachelor parties. Starting your night with some head-to-head racing is a great way to get your adrenaline flowing, break the ice among the groomsmen, and experience genuine thrills. Why waste time with bowling alleys and batting cages? Start out your evening or weekend with a bang – race our high-performance electric karts at speeds approaching 45mph!

 
LEARN MORE ABOUT BACHELOR PARTIES >


















BAR / BAT MITZVAHS




If you want to celebrate a special milestone in your son’s life (or daughter’s – our centers are ideal locations for Bat Mitzvahs too), why not add a bit of excitement? One of the reasons K1 Speed is such an ideal location for parties, group events and special events is that we can offer our guests much more than mere racing. We have private party rooms, spacious lobbies with plasma screen televisions and leather couches, arcades, and a museum-quality collection of authentic racing memorabilia. If you want a unique venue for your son’s Bar Mitzvah, K1 Speed is for you.

If you have an idea for a special event, please contact our team of planners. We will do everything that we can to accommodate your needs. In fact, we can even rent out our entire facility should your party’s size require it! Plan an event that will be the talk of your guests for weeks and months. Plan an event at K1 Speed.

TEAM BUILDING













MEETING ROOMS













CATERING















Our Nationwide indoor karting centers are perfect venues for corporate events. If you’re planning a corporate function or company party, we think you’ll be impressed with what K1 Speed has to offer. Each of our locations have meeting rooms that feature wireless internet connections and 110″ display screens that are perfect for presentations, and we also offercatering options if you would like to have food and drinks available. What truly separate our centers from other party venues however are our race packages. Racing amongst friends and co-workers at speeds approaching 40mph in our electric karts is an exhilarating and unforgettable experience, perfect for corporate events and team building exercises.
An atmosphere that promotes friendly competition is great for communication, and communication amongst co-workers builds camaraderie and morale, both of which have tangible benefits in the workplace. At K1 Speed, we help with the planning of corporate events throughout California, Texas, Illinois, Washington, Florida and Arizona and we would love to host your next corporate function or company party. Contact us today to schedule a reservation for a karting event in Los Angeles, San Diego, Orange County, the Inland Empire, the Bay Area, Redmond Washington, South Florida, Phoenix, Central and Eastern Texas or Chicago.










INDOOR KARTING – CORPORATE EVENTS HAVE NEVER BEEN MORE FUN




At K1 Speed, we believe that having a company lunch is a great way to spend time with co-workers and improve office morale. However, we also think that going indoor karting is a better way to boost office morale! If you are looking to inject some excitement into your next corporate event, then we can assure you that our kart racing events are what you’re seeking! A corporate event at K1 Speed is one that your employees will be talking about for a long time to come; in fact, don’t be surprised if they request to come back!

TESTIMONIALS

 


 "Wow!!!  I had some AWESOME comments about your facility. First, let me tell you how much I appreciate everything you and your staff did for our group.  They had a BLAST! Everything was perfect and from the bottom of my heart, thank you!  I wouldn’t be surprised if you see us renting your facility in the future.  Again, thank you for your professionalism and management of K1 Speed in Sacramento.  "I would like to Thank You so much for making Carly’s 17th birthday party GREAT!!!!  We were there last Wednesday, with 25 teenagers, and they all had a wonderful time.  The facility is fabulous – lots of space to spread out, clean and well maintained, and the staff was so nice and very helpful and accommodating.  They were great with the teens and kept things moving along at a comfortable pace.  We Thank You Very Much for making this Carly’s “best birthday ever”!!!  We will definitely be back in the future."  "We had what I would call one of the most successful team events at K1 Speed Austin just last night.  The facility was incredible, the staff was engaging, and our entire group had a blast!  Our staff can’t stop talking about how much fun we had, and they keep asking when we are going to do it again!!  We hope that this is just the first of many events we will have with K1 Speed.  We are going to have an extremely hard time getting our team to agree to anything else but K1 Speed for our future events.  You have set the bar pretty high, and the fun factor is off the charts!!  Thank you, K1 Speed!!!!"

                Andretti Indoor Karting and Games            








 



EPR Karting LLC, an entity-related to Kansas City, Mo.-based real estate investment trust EPR Properties, has officially closed on the land needed to build the Andretti Indoor Karting attraction on Universal Boulevard.
The land was purchased for $8.4 million from Atlanta-based Orlando Equity Partners, according to county records. Orlando Equity Partners is one of the primary land owners on Universal Boulevard, which is an area gaining steam since much of that land is now owned by Universal Orlando Resort's parent company, Comcast Corp.

Andretti Indoor Karting and Games










 


The Andretti attraction will sit on 10 acres fronting Universal Boulevard near Convention Way with a separate attraction — the proposed Topgolf facility— behind it, said Robbie McEwan, first vice president with CBRE, who along with Bobby Palta represented the land buyer.




In February, Andretti Indoor Karting & Games filed paperwork with Orange County to build a 100,800-square-foot indoor go cart/entertainment facility on 8.44 acres on Universal Boulevard. In addition to being a cutting-edge karting attraction, the typical Andretti facilities also have a motion theater ride, full-size auto simulators with steering wheels and pedals, rope courses and event space.
Alongside the Topgolf attraction, which will be a 65,000-square-foot, three-level facility with 102 climate-controlled hitting bays, the Universal Boulevard corridor is beginning to become the prime spot for businesses wishing to tap into the success of International Drive.
The corridor welcomes more than 5 million people a year, and the more attractions that pop up nearby will only help boost the business in that sector.

Covers tourism, hospitality and sports business
