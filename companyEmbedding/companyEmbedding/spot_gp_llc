Description
Spot-GP was created for users that need to print large quantities of parts or big
objects for a reasonable price while maintaining other properties like cure speed,
hardness and clearness, along it’s low viscosity and surface tension.
This is the resin of choice for DIY users that want to get started with printing with an
affordable product without necessitating specific performances of their final builds.
This resin is also ideal for printer setups needing large vats of resin, for which reason
a low viscosity is a key factor.
This version of the resin comes pre-mixed with yellow opaque pigment in a concentration that allows for the simple use with the B9Creator and similar setups, with PDMS and fluorinated film separation systems.
