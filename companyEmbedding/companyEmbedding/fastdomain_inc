Why is this contact information displayed? [Close]
The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

Modifying Name Servers (Registered through FastDomain)
Summary

        If you purchased your domain from FastDomain, then you can manage it online by using the Domain Manager and going to the Name Servers tab. Please note: Any changes to nameservers can take up to 72 hours to propagate.
        
If you did NOT purchase your domain from us, we are not able to change the name servers because we don't control the domain. Please contact the domain registrar (place where you bought the domain) and ask how to make the name server updates. Most domain registrars have a tool so you can do this yourself. Then you will remove the current name servers and replace them with the name servers from your welcome email.
Updating the Name Servers


Login to your FastDomain Control Panel.
Click the Domains tab along the top.
Choose your domain name by putting a check mark next to it. The right side will populate with tabs.
Please click the Name Servers tab on the right.
Select Use Custom Nameservers.
Enter in the new name servers.
Click Save Nameserver Settings


Note: Please allow 24-72 hours for the DNS propagation of name servers to fully propagate.

For more information about how to update other DNS records such as CNAME, TXT, SRV or A records, please read our DNS changes article.

BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

Transfer Domain to Another Registrar
This article explains how to prepare your domain to be transferred from FastDomain to a new registrar. You'll initiate the transfer itself with the gaining registrar, but there are a few things you can do to ensure the process goes smoothly.
Important:

To avoid any delays, please complete all five steps before initiating the transfer.
Avoid transferring your domain within 45 days of renewal, or you could lose that renewal year.
Updating the registrant contact information (name, organization, or email address) for a general top-level domain (gTLD) will initiate a Change of Registrant process which requires additional verification before the new information is saved.

Are you transferring the ownership of your domain to another person? Read about Transferring Domain Ownership.


Prepare Your Domain

Review Contact Information
Pause Privacy
Update Name Servers
Unlock the Domain
Obtain the EPP Code


Initiate the domain transfer
Approve the transfer


Prepare Your Domain
There are a few things you need to do before transferring your domain. First, follow these steps to access your domain settings:

Log into your FastDomain Domain Manager.
Choose Domains in the main menu at the top of the page
Scroll down and select the domain you want to transfer from the list on the left.
        		Several tabs for the domain will appear to the right, which you’ll use to view and update your settings. These tabs are:
        			
Main
Renewal Options
Contacts
Privacy Options
Name Servers
Transfer EPP
Lock



If you only see three tabs then the domain is already registered elsewhere. You can view the domain's registrar in the Main tab.
Review Contact Information
Your contact information is included on your domain's record in the WHOIS database, as required by ICANN. Upon transfer, the gaining registrar will use the information on the domain's record to email critical information regarding the transfer to the administrative contact, so you need to make certain it's correct. It's best to avoid using an email address that’s associated with the domain; use a public email service, like Gmail, instead.
You will only see the option to opt-out of the 60-day transfer lock IF saving your changes will trigger a Change of Registrant request. If the option isn't there, the Change of Registrant process (steps 7, 9, and 10) will not apply.
Follow these steps to update your domain's contact information:

Click the Contacts tab to the right. 
        			Check the boxes for registrant, admin, and billing to view the information listed for each contact. You can view and edit each individually, or all at once, depending on which box(es) you've selected. 
        			
        				Make any changes to the information for each contact as necessary, then double-check the information to verify that you've entered the new owner's correct email address for the registrant and admin.
Do you see the option to opt-out of the 60-day transfer lock? If not, click Update Contact Information to save your changes. If it's there, updating the contact information will initiate a Change of Registrant request, which requires both parties to approve of the changes before the updated record can be submitted to the registry. Follow these steps to continue:

Check the box to opt-out of the 60-day transfer lock. This is optional, but highly recommended.
Click Update Contact Information to save your changes.
Locate the verification email and click the link to approve the changes.
The new owner must locate their verification email and click the link to approve the changes.

Pause Privacy
Privacy, if you have it, must be paused (disabled) for the transfer to be successful. Pausing privacy unblocks your domain's contact information in the public WHOIS database so the gaining registrar can contact you regarding the transfer.

Click the Privacy Options tab.
If privacy is enabled, click Pause Domain Privacy.

Update Name Servers
It's entirely possible to register your domain with one company and host your website with another, so you can continue hosting your website here if you'd like. But if you've already moved your website files to a new host, you may want to update your name servers now to minimize downtime during the transfer. You cannot make DNS changes while the transfer is in progress, so it is important that you do it now.

Click the Name Servers tab.
Select Use Custom Nameservers.
Enter the settings for your new hosting provider.
Click Save Nameserver Settings.

Your new DNS settings will begin to propagate as soon as you save your changes. Each ISP updates at a different rate, usually taking 24 - 72 hours to complete worldwide. During this time, your emails will be down, and your web traffic will be directed to either the old or new host, depending on the visitor's ISP.
Unlock the Domain
Domains are locked by default to prevent unauthorized transfers. You must unlock the domain before it can be transferred to a new registrar.

Click the Lock tab.
If the domain is locked, click Unlock.

Obtain EPP Code
Next, you need the EPP code, which other registrars may refer to as the Authorization or Auth code. It's essentially a unique password for the domain, made up of letters, numbers, and special characters, which you'll give to the gaining registrar to authorize the transfer.

Click the Transfer EPP tabstrong>.
Copy or otherwise make note of the code so you can give it to the gaining registrar to initiate the transfer request.

Remember, it's case- and character-specific; so if you choose to copy/paste the code, make sure there aren't any additional spaces at the beginning or end.
You've now finished prepping your domain for transfer.
Initiate Domain Transfer
Now your domain is ready to be transferred. The transfer itself will be initiated with the gaining registrar, so you'll need to contact them for specific instructions, but here's a general idea of what you'll need to do:

Log in to your account with the gaining registrar.
Begin the domain transfer process according to their instructions.
Provide them with the EPP code you copied from the Transfer EPP tab.
Follow any additional steps and/or validation they require.

Approve the Transfer
Domain transfers can take up to five days to complete, but once the transfer is pending, you can expedite the process by approving it manually.

Log in to your fastdomain Domain Manager.
Scroll down and select the domain pending transfer from the list on the left.
Click the Transfer EPP tab to the right.
Click Approve. The transfer will go through immediately, though it may take a few minutes (up to an hour) for the gaining registrar to detect the change.
