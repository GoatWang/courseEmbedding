Blood Bands
Barcode Plus

Typenex® Medical developed the Barcode Plus™ family of blood bands to minimize human error in the blood transfusion process. Despite the care clinicians and phlebotomists take when handling blood and blood components, mistakes can happen. Unfortunately, some mistakes are the result of mislabeled specimens or misidentified patients.
Barcode Plus Blood Bands help ensure the right patient gets the right blood. Each band includes a blood bank identification number (BBID) in its barcode that helps identify the specimen and makes sure it goes to the intended recipient. Personnel can use an ISBT scanner to transfer the BBID to the Laboratory Information System (LIS).






Barcode Plus™ Blood Band Options
First developed by Typenex Medical in 2007, barcoded blood bands helped reduce the risk of mis-entering a BBID into the LIS. Today we offer a variety of blood bands in the Barcode Plus family, engineered to meet the needs of health care facilities. Our barcoded blood band options include:

Barcode Plus™ | Handwritten - This blood band minimizes data entry errors and fits most patients.
Barcode Plus™ | Labels - A convenient choice for hospitals with mobile phlebotomy systems and bedside labeling.
Barcode Plus™ | Condensed - Save time and avoid transcription errors with a blood band that does not require the technicians to write down patient information.
Barcode Plus 8™ | Label - Hospitals that require longer inpatient stays or extra steps in their protocol will like the extra stickers available on the Barcode Plus 8 Blood Band.
Barcode Plus Slim™ | Handwritten - The newest addition to the Barcode Plus family, this blood band has a narrower surface but is still easy to read and use.

Chose Typenex Medical Barcode Plus Blood Bands to help streamline procedures and reduce the chance of error.


Barcode Plus™ Blood Band Features
Every Barcode Plus Blood Band comes with:

A blood bank identification number (BBID) - The unique BBID creates a physical link to the patient throughout the transfusion procedure.
Clear prompts for patient information - Large font and straight forward prompts provide clear instructions for adding patient data.
Plastic backings and shields - The plastic covering keeps patient information legible throughout the duration of the stay.
Band stickers - With multiple sticker options, Typenex Medical has a blood band to meet the needs of the hospital's protocol.



Additionally, the Barcode Plus family of blood bands is compatible with the Typenex Medical R3™ reattachment system. The R3 band makes it simple to relocate, resize, and replace any Typenex Medical blood bands.

How to Use Barcode Plus™ Blood Bands
The Barcode Plus family of blood bands is easy to use. In general, the person drawing blood should:

Lift the label’s protective seal.
Write the patient’s information on the label, or adhere a pre-printed label to the band.
Wrap the band around the patient’s wrist and snap it to close.
Draw the specimen.
Peel the label from the band and place it on the tube.
Cover the patient's information with the clear protective shield. Adhere the sticker to specimen tube. Extra stickers are available on the “tail” of the blood band in case they are needed. In the lab, the technician can either scan or manually enter the BBID into the LIS. When it’s time for the transfusion, the transfusionist simply matches the barcode on the requisition form, the unit of blood, and the patient’s blood band.


Typenex Medical Barcode Plus Blood Bands are a convenient way to capture and protect patient data. They are durable and easy to use, and they fit most patients. Contact a Typenex Medical representative to learn more about Barcode Plus Blood Bands.

Blood Bands
Flexi 2.1

The Flexi 2.1™ Blood Band is made of a soft, flexible material, and it offers the necessary durability along with the comfort required for a long-term stay or outpatient scenario.






Information About Flexi 2.1™ Blood Band 
As with any of the barcoded blood bands, the Flexi 2.1 comes with a blood bank identification number (BBID) that creates a physical connection between patient, transfusion tag, and blood component. Placing the BBID in the barcode allows blood bank staff to use a scanner to transmit it directly into the Laboratory Information System (LIS).
Additionally, the blood band has two options for forms for different transfusion protocols. You can either select the general form, which comes with more identification stickers, or the condensed form.



                   Flexi 2.1 Band and Form
                







Features of the Flexi 2.1™ Blood Band

A barcoded blood bank identification number (BBID) - Using a barcode with a BBID improves patient safety by eliminating data entry errors.
Easy-to-read prompts for patient information -  Prompts are written in a large font that can quickly be read by caregivers.
Water resistant cover -The plastic covering keeps patient information legible throughout the patient’s stay, even with daily showering.
Two options for forms - Select the form that best fits your identification protocols.

 How to Use the Flexi 2.1 Blood Band 
The Flexi 2.1 is easy to use. You or a staff member simply:

Apply the patient information to the upper left-hand corner of either the General or Condensed form.
Detach an insert from the form. Then write the patient's information on the form, or adhere a pre-printed label to it. 
Slide the insert into the band pocket. 
Remove the liner from the adhesive flap.
Wrap the band around the patient’s wrist and snap it closed.

The Flexi 2.1 is now securely attached to the patient. Should you need to relocate it, use the Typenex Medical R3™ reattachment system. The R3 band makes it simple to resize and replace most Typenex Medical blood bands - a distinct benefit when dealing with mobile patients.

Blood bands go a long way toward improving patient safety, but only when they are in place. Use a band that is too loose, and it can get snagged on equipment. Use one that is too snug, and you sacrifice patient comfort.













R3â˘ Reattachment System
Typenex Medical developed the R3™ Reattachment System as a companion product for all of our barcoded blood band options. The R3 band allows a skilled medical professional to easily resize and relocate any Typenex Medical barcoded blood bands, such as the:

Home

Blood Bands
CheckDigit

Blood transfusions may be relatively safe procedures, but they do carry some risk of complications. That is why blood banks and caregivers make every effort to screen, test, and track the blood and blood components they collect.
Typenex® Medical’s CheckDigit® Blood Band provides an extra layer of security for recipients and medical staff alike without adding any extra steps to the transfusion process. By integrating our modern technology with the Cerner Bridge Transfusion Administration product, CheckDigit Blood Bands help ensure the right blood goes to the right person. 






CheckDigit® Blood Band Options 
Just like other barcoded blood bands, every CheckDigit Blood Band comes with a blood bank identification number (BBID) that creates a link between the patient, the transfusion tag, and the specimen. CheckDigit Blood Bands also have additional digits embedded in the permanent BBID that stays attached to the patient. Our CheckDigit Blood Band options include:

CheckDigit | Handwritten – The CheckDigit Handwritten Blood Band has plenty of room for hand-writing patient information.
CheckDigit | Label – Hospitals with mobile phlebotomy systems and bedside labeling often find this blood band a convenient choice.
CheckDigit | Condensed – Save time and avoid transcription errors with a condensed blood band that does not require the technicians to write down patient information. This option  includes multiple barcoded sticker options.
CheckDigit 8 | Handwritten – Hospitals that require longer stays or extra steps in their protocol prefer the extra stickers available on the CheckDigit™ 8 Handwritten Blood Band.
CheckDigit | Band and Form – CheckDigit Band and Form system is durable for up to seven days of regular patient wear – including daily showering.

Features of CheckDigit® Blood Bands
Typenex Medical designed CheckDigit Blood Bands to adapt to your clinic’s processes. Features include:

Options - Select the style and number of stickers that best fits your procedures. Both handwritten and pre-printed labels are available.
Customizable patient information options - You decide what data you need, and Typenex Medical creates prompts in large, easy-to-read fonts so your technicians will be less likely to miss them.
Plastic shields - The plastic shield protects the patient’s information and keeps it legible.
Compatibility with the R3™ Reattachment system - The ability to resize or relocate a blood band helps patients be more comfortable and can save your facility time. Most Typenex Medical blood bands can be safely adjusted using our R3 Reattachment System.

CheckDigit Blood Bands make it easier for your staff to know that the procedures in place are working.




 Instructions 
The embedded digits in the permanent BBID on every CheckDigit Band provide caregivers with a higher level of confidence that the correct blood is going to the correct patient. Here is how it works.

Verify the patient’s identity using your set protocol.
Place the patient's information on the CheckDigit Blood Band, either by writing it out by hand or using a pre-printed label.
Apply the blood band to the patient, and draw the specimen.
Adhere the barcoded stickers to the specimen and to any documents required by your procedure.
In the blood bank, caregivers scan the barcode into the Laboratory Information System (LIS). When your clinicians complete your pre-transfusion protocol, they scan the blood component and transfusion tag to help ensure they share the same barcode information with the record in the LIS.Finally, the caregiver will scan the permanent BBID with the hidden check digit. If it matches the other information, the process proceeds. If not, the system will alert the transfusionist.


 CheckDigit Blood Bands help ensure the final pre-transfusion check occurs at the patient’s bedside. This will give your caregivers peace of mind that they have done everything they need to do to protect the patient.

With the receipt of this $230,000 USD one-time cash payment, Typenex has been paid the full remaining consideration(s) and the above referenced Settlement Agreement has been forever retired.  There will be no additional share issuances or share conversions owed to or delivered to Typenex at any point in the future.  The final share issuance delivered to Typenex by the Company, pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, was a tranche of 10,000,000 shares on March 16, 2015.  
Tauriga's Chairman & CEO Dr. Stella Sung stated, "By extinguishing the remaining obligations to Typenex, the Company has taken important steps to both improve its capital structure and reduce the supply of shares in the marketplace.  This has been a challenging situation for Tauriga, and there has been understandable investor frustration with respect to our recent share price.  Throughout this period, though, management has continually focused on building the fundamentals of the business and the Company remains excited and optimistic about the opportunities to both grow existing business and launch new products."

Big Foot® Suction Disc

Home
Products
Operating Room
Big Foot







According to OSHA, “The floor of every workroom shall be maintained in a clean and, so far as possible, a dry condition” (1). The operating room often encounters fluid-intensive cases, such as arthroscopies and trauma. Many of these cases result in a buildup of fluid on the operating room floor, which can pose a risk of slipping to clinicians in addition to an increased turnover time during clean-up.
The Big Foot® Suction Disc is an effective floor fluid management solution for today’s operating room. The Big Foot effectively vacuums fluid off the floor with minimal noise or set-up time, unlike other solutions in the market that are costlier, less effective, and more disruptive.(1)29 CFR, Part 1910.22(a)(2)





Features & Benefits

16 Suction Ports – Many ports are distributed across the device to maximize liquid removal.
Quiet – The Big Foot generates a sound level that is 14.8 decibels quieter than the market-leading PuddleVac*.
Sleek Design – It is easy to maneuver and reposition on the floor to address areas of high fluid volume.
Compatible – The Big Foot is able to connect to any standard operating room suction system through a simple attachment of tubing to the device.

*Test values come from simulated use testing conducted by Typenex Medical.

Lab Disposables
Handling blood and blood components means extra precautions in the lab, but that doesn’t mean you need to sacrifice efficiency. Our Smearsafe blood dispenser eliminates steps without risking patient care.
