What Makes Us Exceptional— And Sets Us Apart 

Masters of One. Most financial professionals are “jack-of-all-trades, master of none.” The DRL Group has taken a different approach to financial services. “We are Masters of One”, having spent decades doing one thing well: fixed-income investing. We specialize in the bond market, helping provide fixed-income solutions for our clients. You can expect this singular focus from the DRL Group.
Price-Efficient Trade Execution: Thanks to our state-of-the-art technology, DRL Group clients have access to both the primary and secondary bond markets. This provides you with efficient pricing because we can execute trades on both the buy and sell side of the transaction, which in most cases, could result in higher returns.
Municipal and Corporate Bond Specialists. Our team of professionals is focused on providing fixed-income solutions to produce a stable income stream—and help protect principal value. We create customized bond portfolios to preserve capital and minimize risk, while maximizing client returns in unpredictable market environments.
Tax Free Investment Solutions. Our clients are interested in shielding their investment income from taxes. For investors who want tax-exempt investment solutions, we can purchase at dealer level pricing, with a nominal mark up on attractive tax-free bonds. This results in higher yields for our clientele.
Well Versed with Major Market Fluctuations. With over 35 years of collective industry expertise, we have been through significant ups and downs of the economy and the market. We have extensive experience adapting our clients’ portfolios to ever-changing market conditions. We will do the same for you.
Personalized Process. All clients receive the personal attention they deserve. We take the time to understand each client’s needs based on their tax bracket, age, goals, and financial situation. We continuously analyze and update strategies to meet our clients’ evolving individual objectives for income, growth, and asset protection. And, our clients deal directly with the owners of the firm—not junior advisors or a call center. We know our clients’ time is extremely valuable, so when a client calls, we pick up the phone. You can always expect good, old-fashioned service.
Award Recognition. The DRL Group has been consistently recognized as one of Houston’s Top Wealth Managers. The National Association of Board Certified Advisory Practices (NABCAP) named us among the Top Wealth Managers two years running, and the Houston Business Journal featured us in both 2012 and 2013. We have also been showcased as one of the Best Businesses of Katy, TX, for 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016. You’ll be taken care of by an award-winning team.
Independent. Since we are not owned by a bank or an insurance company, we sell no proprietary, high commission products. Instead, the financial products we do offer are dependent on what’s in the best interest of our clients. All of our operations are highly regulated. Your investment funds are held at our custodian, National Financial Services, a 100%-owned subsidiary of Fidelity Investments.

All Fixed Income News












In general the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a maturity date, so avoiding losses caused by price volatility by holding them until maturity is not possible.
Lower-quality debt securities generally offer higher yields, but also involve greater risk of default or price changes due to potential changes in the credit quality of the issuer. Any fixed income security sold or redeemed prior to maturity may be subject to loss.
Before investing, consider the funds' investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.

The performance data quotes represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Yield, share price and investment return fluctuate and an investor’s shares may be worth more or less than original cost upon redemption. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Click above for month-end returns.The Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Municipal Bond Index covers the USD-denominated long-term tax-exempt bond market.The total return performance figures presented for Class I shares of the fund represent the performance of the fund's Class A for periods prior to December 15, 2008, the inception date for Class I shares, and the performance of Class I, respectively, from that inception date. Performance reflects the applicable class' distribution/servicing fees since the inception date. Had these fees and expenses been reflected for periods prior, performance would have been different. Investors should consider, when deciding whether to purchase a particular class of shares, the investment amount, anticipated holding period and other relevant factors.

Performance Metrics





Main Risks

					Bond Risk: Bonds are subject generally to interest rate, credit, liquidity, call and market risks, to varying degrees. Generally, all other factors being equal, bond prices are inversely related to interest-rate changes and rate increases can cause price declines.National Municipal Risk: Income for national municipal funds may be subject to state and local taxes. Income may be subject to state and local taxes for out-of-state residents. Some income for non-AMT-Free funds may be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax for certain investors. Capital gains, if any, are taxable.State Risk: Investing primarily in a single state may make the fund's portfolio securities more sensitive to risks specific to the state.

Notes & Disclosures
Portfolio composition and allocation is as of 06/30/17 and is subject to change at any time. Totals may not be exact due to rounding. Negative exposures may represent short positions through derivatives.Bonds rated BBB/Baa or higher are considered investment grade, while bonds rated BB/Ba or lower are considered speculative as to the timely payment of principal and interest. Credit ratings reflect only those assigned by S&P, Moody's, and/or Fitch.  Split-rated bonds, if any, are reported in the higher rating category.Source: Morningstar, Inc. All rights reserved. The Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Municipal Bond Index covers the USD-denominated long-term tax-exempt bond market.Duration is a measure of volatility expressed in years. The higher the number, the greater the potential for volatility as interest rates change.Reflects the percentage of a fund's movements that can be explained by movements in a particular benchmark. An R-squared of 100 indicates fund movements that are perfectly correlated to those of the benchmark. In order to compare funds across general asset classes, Morningstar calculates R-squared values relative to a "standard" broad-based market index. For example, the R-squared of both a small cap, domestic equity fund and a domestic technology fund would be determined against the S&P 500 Index. Thus, the "standard" broad-based market index used by Morningstar may differ from the fund's actual benchmark stated in this factsheet. Source: MorningstarBeta is a measure of the systematic risk of a stock or a portfolio and is an indicator of expected return. A beta higher than 1.0 has higher risk than the overall market has and thus the stock or portfolio can be expected to perform in relation to the overall market in that way.A statistical measurement of dispersion around an average which depicts how widely fund returns varied over a certain period of time.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Fund Goal and Approach



The fund seeks to maximize current income exempt from federal, New York state and New York city income taxes to the extent consistent with the preservation of capital. To pursue its goal, the fund normally invests at least 80% of its net assets, plus any borrowings for investment purposes, in municipal bonds that provide income exempt from federal, New York state and New York city income taxes and the federal alternative minimum tax.




				Risks
			



				
					Bond Risk: Bonds are subject generally to interest rate, credit, liquidity, call and market risks, to varying degrees. Generally, all other factors being equal, bond prices are inversely related to interest-rate changes and rate increases can cause price declines.National Municipal Risk: Income for national municipal funds may be subject to state and local taxes. Income may be subject to state and local taxes for out-of-state residents. Some income for non-AMT-Free funds may be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax for certain investors. Capital gains, if any, are taxable.State Risk: Investing primarily in a single state may make the fund's portfolio securities more sensitive to risks specific to the state.
					





Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses of the fund carefully before investing. Download a prospectus, or a summary prospectus, if available, that contains this and other information about the fund, and read it carefully before investing.

Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses of the fund carefully before investing. Download a prospectus, or a summary prospectus, if available, that contains this and other information about the fund, and read it carefully before investing.

Notes & Disclosures
 For share classes offered after the fund's inception date, the total returns quoted reflect the performance of the fund's initial share class(es), adjusted to reflect applicable non-recurring sales charges. Performance for these share classes has not been adjusted to reflect any class-specific distribution or servicing fees or any differences in operating expenses. Had such fees and expenses been reflected, returns for these share class returns during such periods would have been lower. Performance is historical and not indicative of future results. Investment return, yield, and principal value will fluctuate and an investor will receive more or less than the original cost upon redemption. Investors should consider, when deciding whether to purchase a particular class of shares, the investment amount, anticipated holding period and other relevant factors, and should read the prospectus carefully.Source: Morningstar, Inc. All rights reserved. The Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Municipal Bond Index covers the USD-denominated long-term tax-exempt bond market.The Ratings formula measures the amount of variation in a fund's performance and gives more emphasis to downward variations. The top 10% of the funds in the category receive five stars; the next 22.5% four stars; the next 35% three stars; the next 22.5% two stars; and the last 10% one star.  Ratings reflect sales loads.The fund represents a single portfolio with multiple share classes that have different expense structures.Subsidized yield may reflect the waiver of receipt of a portion of the management fee, and/or a reimbursement of the fund expenses by the Dreyfus Corporation, which would have had the effect of lowering the fund's expense ratio and generating a higher yield.The Dreyfus Corporation has contractually agreed  to waive receipt of its fees and/or assume the expenses of the fund so that total annual fund operating expenses of none of the classes (excluding Rule 12b-1 fees, shareholder services fees for Class A, C, I, Y and Z shares, taxes,
brokerage commissions, extraordinary expenses, interest expenses and
commitment fees on borrowings) exceed 0.45%. Dreyfus may terminate this agreement upon at least 90 days' prior notice to investors, but has 
committed not to do so until at least January 1, 2018. 
The "Dreyfus Investment Style Classification" graphically depicts the fund's investment strategy as described in its Prospectus. The horizontal and vertical axes describe the fund's general credit quality focus (High: AAA/AA; Medium: A/BBB; Low: Below BBB) and weighted average maturity in years (Short: <4; Intermediate 4-10; Long: >10). It is designed to support asset allocation decisions and not to depict actual fund holdings at a point in time.
