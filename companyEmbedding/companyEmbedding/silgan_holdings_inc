Silgan Holdings Inc | Company Profile




























































Company Profile
Founded in 1987 by our Non-Executive Co-Chairmen of the Board, Phil Silver and Greg Horrigan, Silgan has 
        	grown to be a leading supplier of rigid packaging for consumer goods products. Our primary lines of business are metal containers,  
            metal and plastic closures and dispensing systems and plastic containers. The Company takes great pride in the fact that its products 
            contain some of the world's best known branded consumer products, including Campbell's Soup, Del Monte Fruits and Vegetables, 
            Listerine and Friskies Pet Food.
Our objective is to increase shareholder value by efficiently deploying capital and management resources to grow our business, 
        	reduce operating costs and build sustainable competitive positions, or franchises, and to complete acquisitions that generate 
            attractive cash returns. We believe we will accomplish this goal because of our leading market positions and management expertise 
            in acquiring, financing, integrating and efficiently operating consumer goods packaging businesses.
Since our inception in 1987, we have acquired thirty-five businesses. As a result of the benefits of acquisitions and organic 
        	growth, we have become a leading manufacturer of metal containers in North America and Europe with net sales of $2.27 billion
            in 2016, and we are the largest manufacturer of metal food 
			containers in North America with an overall unit volume market share of approximately sixty percent in the United States in 2016. Through acquisitions, we are a leading worldwide manufacturer of 
            metal and plastic closures and dispensing systems for food, beverage, health care, garden, home and beauty products, with net sales of $797.1 million in 2016. 
            We have also grown our market position in the plastic container business since 1987, with net sales increasing sixfold to $543.9 million in 2016.
