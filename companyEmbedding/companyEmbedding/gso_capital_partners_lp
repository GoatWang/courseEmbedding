“Now when I think about my career, it seems limitless. Five years into this, I’ve already joined the board of directors of one of our investments. If you asked me four years ago if I thought I’d be on the board and actually be making a difference, I would have said ‘no.’ So I don’t know exactly where it is that my career would ultimately end up, but I don’t see a road block and I don’t see an end to the opportunity right now.”
Scott Eisenberg - Managing Director, GSO      
“Blackstone is the largest alternative investment manager in the world, but what that really means is that we’re investing on behalf of pension plans and pensioners. Just about anywhere you go in the world, you can see real estate Blackstone owns on behalf of our limited partners.”
Kathleen McCarthy - Senior Managing Director, Real Estate      
“A lot of my engineering background was about problem solving, how do you come at a solution and how do you think about it in a new way, and a lot of that is really translatable into finance and working with clients.”
Viral Patel - Managing Director, Tactical Opportunities

Our credit business, GSO Capital Partners LP, is one of the largest credit-oriented alternative asset managers in the world and a major participant in leveraged finance.  In March 2008, Blackstone acquired GSO and combined the two firms’ credit investment businesses.  GSO seeks to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns across a variety of investment strategies.  Fee-earning assets under management totaled $28.7 billion as of September 30, 2011. 
 


Leveraged Loans
GSO is among the largest managers of senior secured bank loans in the world through collateralized loan obligation (CLO) vehicles, separately managed accounts and other levered and unlevered pools of capital. 
 


Customized Credit Strategies
We manage diversified portfolios of senior secured bank loans of noninvestment grade companies in structured vehicles.  As of September 30, 2011, the team managed 50 funds across the US and Europe, including CLOs, separately managed accounts, commingled funds, structured finance vehicles, closed end funds, and business development companies.  We also invest in the debt and equity tranches of CLOs managed by selected third parties. 
 


Special Situations Credit Strategies
GSO’s credit strategy is focused on investing in the leveraged finance marketplace. It invests in long/short credit, event driven opportunities and liquid stressed and distressed securities. GSO may invest in both public and private non-investment grade and non-rated securities, including leveraged loans, high yield bonds, distressed securities, second lien loans, mezzanine securities, common and preferred equity securities, and credit derivatives.

 


Mezzanine Strategies
Drawing upon GSO’s extensive origination capabilities, our mezzanine strategy focuses on providing junior capital to companies in connection with leveraged buyouts, acquisitions, recapitalizations and growth financings.  We focus on investments in “upper” middle market companies with earnings ranging from $25 to $200 million with well-established products or services, defensible market niches and experienced, proven management teams.  We employ a flexible investment approach, investing opportunistically throughout a capital structure, with a focus on principal preservation.

 


Distressed Strategies
GSO has significant expertise evaluating and structuring investments for financially troubled companies and assets.  GSO focuses on buying portfolios of loans and bonds from distressed sellers in the secondary market and on providing rescue financing to companies facing liquidity constraints.

 


Secondary Markets
GSO invests in “stressed” loans or high yield bonds trading at below intrinsic value.

 


Rescue Financing
GSO focuses on providing privately negotiated “capital solutions” to companies in need of liquidity or significant capital structure transformation due to pending covenant violations, debt maturities, cyclical downturns in their businesses or other funding requirements.  This strategy combines GSO’s distressed, credit and trading expertise with Blackstone’s private equity capabilities.
 


Separately Managed Accounts
GSO manages portfolios of leveraged loans and high yield bonds for select large institutional clients.  A traditional leader in the credit space, GSO has a solid track record of creating value through investments in the credit markets across many cycles.

Our credit business, GSO Capital Partners LP, is one of the largest credit-oriented alternative asset managers in the world and a major participant in leveraged finance.  In March 2008, Blackstone acquired GSO and combined the two firms’ credit investment businesses.  GSO seeks to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns across a variety of investment strategies.  Fee-earning assets under management totaled $28.7 billion as of September 30, 2011. 
 


Leveraged Loans
GSO is among the largest managers of senior secured bank loans in the world through collateralized loan obligation (CLO) vehicles, separately managed accounts and other levered and unlevered pools of capital. 
 


Customized Credit Strategies
We manage diversified portfolios of senior secured bank loans of noninvestment grade companies in structured vehicles.  As of September 30, 2011, the team managed 50 funds across the US and Europe, including CLOs, separately managed accounts, commingled funds, structured finance vehicles, closed end funds, and business development companies.  We also invest in the debt and equity tranches of CLOs managed by selected third parties. 
 


Special Situations Credit Strategies
GSO’s credit strategy is focused on investing in the leveraged finance marketplace. It invests in long/short credit, event driven opportunities and liquid stressed and distressed securities. GSO may invest in both public and private non-investment grade and non-rated securities, including leveraged loans, high yield bonds, distressed securities, second lien loans, mezzanine securities, common and preferred equity securities, and credit derivatives.

 


Mezzanine Strategies
Drawing upon GSO’s extensive origination capabilities, our mezzanine strategy focuses on providing junior capital to companies in connection with leveraged buyouts, acquisitions, recapitalizations and growth financings.  We focus on investments in “upper” middle market companies with earnings ranging from $25 to $200 million with well-established products or services, defensible market niches and experienced, proven management teams.  We employ a flexible investment approach, investing opportunistically throughout a capital structure, with a focus on principal preservation.

 


Distressed Strategies
GSO has significant expertise evaluating and structuring investments for financially troubled companies and assets.  GSO focuses on buying portfolios of loans and bonds from distressed sellers in the secondary market and on providing rescue financing to companies facing liquidity constraints.

 


Secondary Markets
GSO invests in “stressed” loans or high yield bonds trading at below intrinsic value.

 


Rescue Financing
GSO focuses on providing privately negotiated “capital solutions” to companies in need of liquidity or significant capital structure transformation due to pending covenant violations, debt maturities, cyclical downturns in their businesses or other funding requirements.  This strategy combines GSO’s distressed, credit and trading expertise with Blackstone’s private equity capabilities.
 


Separately Managed Accounts
GSO manages portfolios of leveraged loans and high yield bonds for select large institutional clients.  A traditional leader in the credit space, GSO has a solid track record of creating value through investments in the credit markets across many cycles.

Our agents and support staff are here to give you the right insurance related advice based on your specific needs – helping you get the right coverage for you, your family and/or your business. While we can help you with almost any type of insurance, or guide you to the right partner of ours here are some of the key areas that most folk require insurance -

Home Insurance (including renters insurance, condo insurance) – every community and locality has specific needs. Some areas are more prone to fires, others to floods. Our agents understand the vagaries of homeowners insurance needed in the New York, NY area and we can help you get great insurance coverage for – fire protection, flood insurance, insuring valuables, and even personal umbrella insurance – coverage that gives you additional peace of mind.
Auto Insurance – in the vast majority of states it is illegal to drive without at the very minimum liability insurance coverage for a vehicle you drive. But, the nuances are different from state to state and in some cases county and city rules may require special consideration. Our agents can help you navigate the different auto insurance coverages, riders and recommend carriers, pricing and adequate coverage based on your specific needs.
Business insurance – every business has different needs. While all businesses need some form of liability insurance; professional services need additional E&O, there are specific needs for each and every class of business - for example construction/contractors may need specific coverage based on the location (New York, NY); and many blue collar businesses need special commercial auto insurance and workers compensation coverages.
Pick up the phone – call 800-332-2056, we would love to hear your story, give you some great insurance advice, and if you think we can get you some comparative quotes, we will use our expertise to your advantage.
