W. R. Berkley Corporation has sold its real estate investment at 1101 New York Avenue NW in Washington, D.C.
The company expects to report a realized pre-tax gain of approximately $120 million on the sale in the third quarter of 2017, which is in addition to approximately $22 million in pre-tax earnings related to the property in prior years.
The sale is in keeping with the company’s long-term strategy of investing for total return in order to continue delivering long-term value creation to shareholders despite a low interest rate environment.
Celebrating 50 years, W. R. Berkley Corporation is a Greenwich, Conn.-based insurance holding company that operates worldwide in two segments of the property casualty business: insurance and reinsurance.

About W. R. Berkley Corporation
W. R. Berkley Corporation, founded in 1967,
                    is one of the nation�s premier commercial
                    lines property casualty insurance providers.
                    Each of the operating units in the Berkley
                    group participates in a niche market requiring
                    specialized knowledge about a territory or
                    product. Our competitive advantage lies in
                    our long-term strategy of decentralized
                    operations, allowing each of our units to
                    identify and respond quickly and effectively
                    to changing market conditions and local
                    customer needs. This decentralized
                    structure provides financial accountability
                    and incentives to local management and
                    enables us to attract and retain the highest
                    caliber professionals. We have the expertise
                    and resources to utilize our strengths in
                    the present environment, and the flexibility
                    to anticipate, innovate and respond to
                    whatever opportunities and challenges
                    the future may hold.
Products and services are provided through various surplus lines insurance company subsidiaries of W. R. Berkley Corporation and offered through licensed surplus lines brokers. Not all products and services may be available in all jurisdictions, and the coverage provided by any insurer is subject to the actual terms and conditions of the policies issued. Surplus lines insurance carriers do not generally participate in state guaranty funds and insureds are therefore not protected by such funds.
