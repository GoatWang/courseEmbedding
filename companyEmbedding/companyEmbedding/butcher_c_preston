A WHITE KITCHEN CART WITH A HARDWOOD TOP


The Preston Hollow from Catskill Craftsmen is a charming, cottage-style kitchen cart that delivers generous work and storage space to the kitchen. Its base is finished with a white, antique lacquer that gives the cart a clean, fresh appearance; and its natural lacquered, hardwood top provides a fine-furniture look. As an added benefit, lacquered finishes are easy to clean and care for. This classic, natural-white combination is equally stunning in casual or contemporary kitchen settings.
 

A Cart with Three Different Storage Options


Take advantage of all the storage options the Preston Hollow presents. For starters, it comes with a 14-inch-deep (front to back) drawer that’s over two feet wide. It’s a good place to stow kitchen tools and utensils. Two slatted, open shelves are good spots for larger items you make use of regularly – such as serving bowls or blenders, for instance. Quick, easy access means you won’t waste time and effort hunting for such necessities. Store other kitchen implements you use less often and packaged foods behind the cart’s traditional, paneled cabinet door where you’ll find a storage space measuring 25-1/4 inches wide by 14 inches deep by 23 in. high. Finally, a wooden towel bar lets you keep a dishtowel and/or tools such as tongs close at hand. It doubles as a handle for the cart, which rolls about easily on caster wheels that can be locked to secure the cart in place once it’s positioned where desired.

Catskill will either repair or replace any product it determines to be defective in either material or workmanship. Such repairs or replacements will be made by Catskill Craftsmen, Inc. or anyone the company authorizes, at no charge to the Purchaser.

Refunds & Returns
If you change your mind within 30 days and wish to return your purchase, you are entitled to a refund (purchase price less a 20% restocking fee).

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/23/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.
