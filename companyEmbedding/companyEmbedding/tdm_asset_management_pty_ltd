Our Firm
Our Investment Approach

Our Firm


TDM is a private investment firm founded in 2004 with offices in Sydney and New York. 
We manage funds for a select group of families who share our long-term investment philosophy. The firm is owned by its three partners who invest personally alongside the clients of TDM.
We invest in companies with attractive growth profiles run by outstanding management teams. Our flexible mandate allows us to invest in public companies globally, as well as Australian and New Zealand based private companies.  
We have a highly focused approach to investing, with a portfolio of no more than 15 investments globally. We typically deploy between $20 million to $75 million (maximum $100 million) per investment. 


We invest in companies with the following attributes:

Attractive growth profile
Proven business model underpinned by a  track record of performance
Low or no financial leverage
Durable competitive advantage
Management teams who think and act like owners
Company culture that fosters innovation and adaptability to changing environments





 





					"We invest in companies with attractive growth profiles run by outstanding management teams."
				

					Tom Cowan, Partner
				




Our Investment approach


TDM's investment approach centres on combining a large investment opportunity set with a focused approach to selecting individual investments.
Our investment mandate is highly flexible. We invest in both public and private companies across a range of geographies, with a focus on Australia, New Zealand, the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and Western Europe. Whilst we are primarily equity investors, we have the ability to invest across the full spectrum of security types.  
We conduct intensive due diligence prior to allocating capital to an investment.  Our focus is on building superior knowledge of businesses, industries and people prior to investing.
We typically deploy between $20 million to $75 million (maximum $100 million) per investment.
We will co-invest with trusted and like minded investors in our network, where there are strategic reasons to do so. This may include experienced institutional investors through to individuals with relevant industry expertise. 


When we make an investment, we are looking to hold the investment for at least 5 years. Our ability to provide patient capital to businesses is underpinned by clients who share our long-term investment philosophy. We believe this approach provides a significant advantage compared to most other investors.
Our flexible mandate means that we are never forced to sell an investment based on constraints that face many traditional private or public equity investors. For example, we benefit from: 

No fixed investment time horizon
No short term market performance benchmarks
No restrictions on holding an investment as it transitions from a private company to a public company or visa versa

We believe that investing free of these restrictions improves our ability to make the best possible investments for our clients and makes us a unique partner for the companies in which we invest.




 

Our Partnership Approach


Our objective is to play the role of a supportive and constructive partner to the management teams and boards of the companies in which we invest. We are passionate about being part of building world-class businesses and assisting, where we can, in determining the best way to create shareholder value.
We support management teams and boards in a variety of ways, adapting the nature of our support to the specific circumstances of each investment.
For private company investments we are typically appointed to the board and have an active level of engagement with the business.  
For public company investments the support we offer may simply be the role we play as a stable, committed shareholder and provider of long term “patient” capital. Alternatively we can also have a more active involvement similar to our private company investments which can include being appointed to the board.   
For many of the companies in which we invest, we have a deep relationship with the management team and board, which evolves over time. We have successfully played the role of a trusted “sounding board” on matters ranging from strategy development to major transactional events such as mergers and acquisitions, capital raisings and bank re-financings. Please refer to “Our Capabilities” section for more details.

Our Capabilities

TDM has extensive investing, corporate advisory and capital markets experience.  This experience gives us scope to add value to businesses in a variety of ways.  We have been successful in working with management teams and boards of public and private companies for the benefit of all shareholders, in the following areas:  

Strategy development 
Assessing capital allocation alternatives 
Board construction and corporate governance
Management remuneration and equity incentive structures 
Investor communications
Improve decision making by providing management insights and data from our global industry research 
Leveraging our global networks to improve business outcomes

The TDM partners, Tom Cowan, Hamish Corlett and Ben Gisz have invested together for more than 15 years and have enjoyed a friendship reaching even further back.  They work as a tight team to maximise results for TDM clients and the companies in which they invest.
