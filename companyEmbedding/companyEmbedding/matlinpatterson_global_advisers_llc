Differentiating Factors



MatlinPatterson is distinct among its peers in our willingness to challenge conventional viewpoints and be creative in structuring investments. We ensure that in every investment we leverage multiple perspectives – incorporating macroeconomic analysis, market intelligence and business acumen within our fundamental analytical framework.

Our core experience lies in building value through complex turnaround situations.
Since 1994, the MatlinPatterson team and its professionals have gained unique insight through our focus on highly complex investment opportunities in illiquid markets. Unlike the “good company, bad balance sheet” perspective that typically drives distressed managers, our cohesive team looks for outliers, those opportunities with more inherent risk, but a greater performance potential. Our proven skill in managing these turnaround situations, in terms of identifying them, taking control and turning them into profitable entities, positions MatlinPatterson to recognize and capture opportunity.


From our private equity vantage point we are flexible and agile investing across the capital structure.
By combining private equity investing skills with distressed securities trading skills, MatlinPatterson has the experience to move quickly to address the accelerated timeframes that often characterize distressed situations. Our familiarity with the complexities of reorganizing distressed companies enables MatlinPatterson to evaluate and act upon investment opportunities. 

Our longstanding market presence enhances deal flow and our ability to source opportunity.
With over 20 years of active market participation in inefficient and illiquid markets across the globe, MatlinPatterson is among the first to see corporate distressed opportunities and deal flow. Complementing this corporate access is our active participation in the global credit markets, which enhances the information ‘flow’ necessary to trade liquid credit strategies.

As one firm, we blend our public and private investing expertise across all of our strategies.
From the start, MatlinPatterson blended trading and private equity skills to invest in control opportunities, balancing perspectives to realize value among a range of complex situations. In approaching control investments, MatlinPatterson typically employs two approaches: accumulating deeply discounted securities and other obligations of distressed companies as a first step toward acquiring a controlling or influential ownership interest, generally through the conversion of debt to equity, and directly acquiring significant ownership stakes or injecting capital into businesses that are in bankruptcy or in financial distress.

We manage our investments and businesses actively.
Whether managing our liquid portfolios or private equity investments, we are active investors. We focus on balance sheet optimization and operational excellence in our control positions—engaging with the company actively throughout the reorganization and ownership process. Following a successful financial restructuring, we focus on stability and building the long-term value of the firm. In our ownership role, we focus on enhancing human capital, providing guidance on strategic and operational issues, facilitating ongoing financing and funding the business to bring greater stability as we build value for the firm and our investors leading to a successful exit.

Coalescing around disparate credit experience, our team is greater than the sum of its parts.
The history of the firm is steeped in distressed credit and special situations investing, and all of the firm’s credit strategies are based on fundamental analytic methodologies. Accordingly, each MatlinPatterson portfolio team is able to draw on the expertise of the others, as the firm’s portfolio managers freely share their investment approaches, thoughts and ideas. In addition, all of the teams are able to benefit from experience of the firm in reorganizations, formulating portfolio company business strategies, and assessing and overseeing company management. The ability to access and leverage the platform’s broad credit investment and trading experience, industry knowledge, market resources, and active participation is a unique advantage of the firm.

Investment Philosophy



MatlinPatterson makes investments based on rigorous, disciplined, bottom-up fundamental credit research and analysis. Across our investment platform, each individual strategy team adheres to the same rigorous standards, and strives to be a leader in its respective niche. Our cohesive culture and the value we place on internal communication creates an environment for idea sharing and collaboration, enhancing value to our investors. 

Our Guiding Investment Principles
Rigorous fundamental analysis lies at the heart of successful investing.
Our investment process centers on detailed financial analysis geared toward understanding a company’s free cash flow potential, its financial and non-financial obligations, as well as catalysts that may trigger a change in value. For companies in financial distress, we gain an understanding of the source of distress, the stakeholders participating in a restructuring process and the factors affecting the company’s ability to reorganize.

Multiple perspectives are essential to accurately assess corporate valuation.
Critical to any investment decision is a fundamental view of a company’s intrinsic value. While we employ traditional valuation techniques to determine a company’s value, we also perform a range of proprietary analyses uniquely suited to investing in illiquid and opaque segments of the credit markets. These factors, coupled with our understanding of restructuring and history of strong corporate management during turnarounds, enhances our ability to capitalize on market inefficiencies. Additionally, our knowledge of the U.S. bankruptcy code, insolvency litigation and regulatory environment in key jurisdictions enables us to understand the legal pitfalls that could impact returns on investment.
Risk management must be proactive and dynamic.
Many of the credit market segments in which we invest carry inherent risks associated with a lack of liquidity, uncertain cash flows, imperfect information and inefficient pricing. Each portfolio team has a strong focus on risk relative to projected return. We utilize several strategies designed to mitigate downside risk associated with credit specific risk, market volatility and tail risk. Each manager also employs strategy-specific risk tools.

Portfolio construction requires broad perspective and big picture thinking.
While individual investments within portfolios are selected primarily through fundamental bottom-up analysis, in constructing and managing our portfolios we carefully analyze external factors that may impact the performance and risk of the portfolio as a whole, including changing industry dynamics, market volatility as well as geopolitical and macroeconomic conditions. As timing is an integral factor in accurately assessing return potential, we leverage our operational expertise to structure positions across our control and non-control investment strategies.

History[edit]
In 1994, David Matlin and Mark Patterson formed the Global Distressed Securities Group at Credit Suisse to invest proprietary capital across a wide range of control and non-control distressed opportunities on a global basis. In 2001, the Distressed Group launched its first private equity fund to invest client capital in distressed-for-control situations and wound down its proprietary investment activity. In 2002, David Matlin and Mark Patterson formed MatlinPatterson as an independent entity to succeed to this business and has since sponsored successor distressed-for-control funds in 2003 and 2007, raising approximately $9 billion in total capital commitments across these three funds, with the most recent Fund being a $5 billion Fund raised in 2007.[3][4]
In 2007, David Matlin and Matlin Patterson formed an affiliate to leverage the distressed control expertise by offering a non-control liquid trading strategy.[5] At the beginning of 2013, the control and non-control businesses were combined into a single investment management platform under the overall supervision of Mr. Matlin. This interdisciplinary approach, blending trading and private equity skills to invest in distressed opportunities, enables the Firm to flexibly source transactions under a variety of economic and financial environments.
Through several distressed debt cycles, MatlinPatterson and its investment professionals have invested over $14 billion of proprietary capital, distressed-for-control funds and non-control distressed funds in more than seventy-five control and 380 non-control distressed opportunities in more than twenty-five countries.
In December 2012, Allied World Assurance, a publicly traded insurance company, acquired a minority interest in the liquid credit business of MatlinPatterson. As part of the transaction, Allied World agreed to invest $500 million in MatlinPatterson’s funds.[6]
The MatlinPatterson Group collectively represents the MatlinPatterson Distressed business and a full spectrum of credit focused investment strategies including (i) trading long and short positions in investment-grade credit instruments such as public and private corporate bonds, notes, loans, debentures, leverage loans, mortgages, convertible debt, governmental bonds, municipal securities and other evidences of indebtedness and derivatives based thereon, (ii) trading in structured mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities and (iii) senior bank debt collateral asset management services.
MatlinPatterson distressed business investments[edit]
MatlinPatterson’s distressed business pursues illiquid control and activist non-control investment strategies, as well as a range of liquid trading strategies. The firm’s control strategies are characterized by its controlling or active participation in distressed companies and their restructurings require a long-term investment outlook. Since 1994, MatlinPatterson and its predecessor entities have invested over $8 billion across 66 control investments. MatlinPatterson’s liquid trading strategies seek to generate profits from changes in the price of securities or claims, with the firm remaining largely uninvolved in a restructuring process or distressed company. Since 1994, MatlinPatterson and its predecessor entities have invested approximately $6 billion across 380 passive and active non-control strategies. In July 2009, MatlinPatterson—which acquired Nortel bonds after the company filed for bankruptcy, becoming one of Nortel's largest bondholders—participated in the auction for Nortel's CDMA and LTE wireless assets. Ericsson ultimately outbid NokiaSiemens and MatlinPatterson, paying almost double the initial "stalking horse" bid of $650 million.[7]
In 2007, MatlinPatterson acquired a controlling stake in XL Health, a Baltimore based Medicare Advantage health plan focused on senior citizens with chronic diseases. In 2011, the company was acquired by United Healthcare after having taken EBITDA from ($112) million in 2007 to a $259 million in 2011. This deal won the operational excellence award for the healthcare segment from Private Equity International magazine.[8]
The firm was also a significant purchaser of WorldCom bonds.[9] The company later was renamed MCI Worldcom and later more simply to MCI prior to its subsequent acquisition by Verizon.
In 2001, MatlinPatterson became the majority owner of Huntsman Corporation,[10][11] which at the time was the 5th largest chemicals company worldwide, and later became a public company. MatlinPatterson has also made several investments in the energy sector, becoming the largest shareholder of NRG Energy,[12] which was the country’s third largest independent power company, as well as acquiring several power generation facilities in the Southeastern United States.
Other significant investments include California-based homebuilder Standard Pacific Corp., in which MatlinPatterson purchased a controlling stake in 2008. Between January 2009 and November 2010, MatlinPatterson invested $1 billion to become the controlling shareholder of Flagstar Bancorp of Troy, Michigan.[13]
MatlinPatterson Investment Strategies[edit]
MatlinPatterson Global Opportunities[edit]
MatlinPatterson’s control strategies are characterized by control or active participation in distressed companies and their restructurings through investments that require a long-term investment outlook. The team invests in senior and subordinated, secured and unsecured debt and equity, in both public and private companies.
MatlinPatterson’s liquid credit strategies seek to generate absolute returns with low volatility through non-investment grade credit across all periods of the default cycle. The strategies seek to exploit inefficiencies in selected markets and capitalize on situations that are outside mainstream investment opportunities.
MatlinPatterson Credit Trading[edit]
MatlinPatterson’s credit trading strategies take a trading-oriented, liquid approach to the performing credit markets. The firm’s strategies seek to generate consistent, equity-like returns while limiting volatility and the potential tail risk that can be associated with the credit asset class. The team’s security selection, portfolio construction and risk management processes seek to create an asymmetric return profile that is long volatility and that relies on price movements to generate returns. The team’s risk management process is focused on capital preservation utilizing a tight stop-loss discipline. The strategies incorporate the use of corporate and municipal bonds, credit default swaps, and other credit-related instruments.
MatlinPatterson Securitized Credit[edit]
MatlinPatterson’s securitized credit strategies take a liquid relative value approach, targeting credit investments across the residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS), commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) and asset-backed securities (ABL) markets. The firm seeks to generate returns through a comprehensive asset selection process and an active trading strategy. The team utilizes proprietary analytics to drive the evaluation of investment opportunities and performs rigorous stress tests across a variety of scenarios. Investments are based on a disciplined bottom-up approach centered upon an assessment of the credit quality of the assets that constitute the underlying collateral of the relevant security or instrument.
MatlinPatterson Senior Credit[edit]
MatlinPatterson’s senior credit strategy focuses on senior bank debt. This strategy involves the construction and management of high current income portfolios of senior bank loans. The firm applies a fundamental bottom-up credit research investment process driven by disciplined and continuous credit monitoring. MatlinPatterson seeks to mitigate credit risk by focusing on issuers with at least 50% junior capital to the secured bank loans and consistent core cash flow generation (EBITDA). Historically this approach has achieved lower volatility returns by minimizing capital losses from default and default-like events.

MatlinPatterson Investment Strategies[edit]
MatlinPatterson Global Opportunities[edit]
MatlinPatterson’s control strategies are characterized by control or active participation in distressed companies and their restructurings through investments that require a long-term investment outlook. The team invests in senior and subordinated, secured and unsecured debt and equity, in both public and private companies.
MatlinPatterson’s liquid credit strategies seek to generate absolute returns with low volatility through non-investment grade credit across all periods of the default cycle. The strategies seek to exploit inefficiencies in selected markets and capitalize on situations that are outside mainstream investment opportunities.
MatlinPatterson Credit Trading[edit]
MatlinPatterson’s credit trading strategies take a trading-oriented, liquid approach to the performing credit markets. The firm’s strategies seek to generate consistent, equity-like returns while limiting volatility and the potential tail risk that can be associated with the credit asset class. The team’s security selection, portfolio construction and risk management processes seek to create an asymmetric return profile that is long volatility and that relies on price movements to generate returns. The team’s risk management process is focused on capital preservation utilizing a tight stop-loss discipline. The strategies incorporate the use of corporate and municipal bonds, credit default swaps, and other credit-related instruments.
MatlinPatterson Securitized Credit[edit]
MatlinPatterson’s securitized credit strategies take a liquid relative value approach, targeting credit investments across the residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS), commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) and asset-backed securities (ABL) markets. The firm seeks to generate returns through a comprehensive asset selection process and an active trading strategy. The team utilizes proprietary analytics to drive the evaluation of investment opportunities and performs rigorous stress tests across a variety of scenarios. Investments are based on a disciplined bottom-up approach centered upon an assessment of the credit quality of the assets that constitute the underlying collateral of the relevant security or instrument.
MatlinPatterson Senior Credit[edit]
MatlinPatterson’s senior credit strategy focuses on senior bank debt. This strategy involves the construction and management of high current income portfolios of senior bank loans. The firm applies a fundamental bottom-up credit research investment process driven by disciplined and continuous credit monitoring. MatlinPatterson seeks to mitigate credit risk by focusing on issuers with at least 50% junior capital to the secured bank loans and consistent core cash flow generation (EBITDA). Historically this approach has achieved lower volatility returns by minimizing capital losses from default and default-like events.

History[edit]
In 1994, David Matlin and Mark Patterson formed the Global Distressed Securities Group at Credit Suisse to invest proprietary capital across a wide range of control and non-control distressed opportunities on a global basis. In 2001, the Distressed Group launched its first private equity fund to invest client capital in distressed-for-control situations and wound down its proprietary investment activity. In 2002, David Matlin and Mark Patterson formed MatlinPatterson as an independent entity to succeed to this business and has since sponsored successor distressed-for-control funds in 2003 and 2007, raising approximately $9 billion in total capital commitments across these three funds, with the most recent Fund being a $5 billion Fund raised in 2007.[3][4]
In 2007, David Matlin and Matlin Patterson formed an affiliate to leverage the distressed control expertise by offering a non-control liquid trading strategy.[5] At the beginning of 2013, the control and non-control businesses were combined into a single investment management platform under the overall supervision of Mr. Matlin. This interdisciplinary approach, blending trading and private equity skills to invest in distressed opportunities, enables the Firm to flexibly source transactions under a variety of economic and financial environments.
Through several distressed debt cycles, MatlinPatterson and its investment professionals have invested over $14 billion of proprietary capital, distressed-for-control funds and non-control distressed funds in more than seventy-five control and 380 non-control distressed opportunities in more than twenty-five countries.
In December 2012, Allied World Assurance, a publicly traded insurance company, acquired a minority interest in the liquid credit business of MatlinPatterson. As part of the transaction, Allied World agreed to invest $500 million in MatlinPatterson’s funds.[6]
The MatlinPatterson Group collectively represents the MatlinPatterson Distressed business and a full spectrum of credit focused investment strategies including (i) trading long and short positions in investment-grade credit instruments such as public and private corporate bonds, notes, loans, debentures, leverage loans, mortgages, convertible debt, governmental bonds, municipal securities and other evidences of indebtedness and derivatives based thereon, (ii) trading in structured mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities and (iii) senior bank debt collateral asset management services.
MatlinPatterson distressed business investments[edit]
MatlinPatterson’s distressed business pursues illiquid control and activist non-control investment strategies, as well as a range of liquid trading strategies. The firm’s control strategies are characterized by its controlling or active participation in distressed companies and their restructurings require a long-term investment outlook. Since 1994, MatlinPatterson and its predecessor entities have invested over $8 billion across 66 control investments. MatlinPatterson’s liquid trading strategies seek to generate profits from changes in the price of securities or claims, with the firm remaining largely uninvolved in a restructuring process or distressed company. Since 1994, MatlinPatterson and its predecessor entities have invested approximately $6 billion across 380 passive and active non-control strategies. In July 2009, MatlinPatterson—which acquired Nortel bonds after the company filed for bankruptcy, becoming one of Nortel's largest bondholders—participated in the auction for Nortel's CDMA and LTE wireless assets. Ericsson ultimately outbid NokiaSiemens and MatlinPatterson, paying almost double the initial "stalking horse" bid of $650 million.[7]
In 2007, MatlinPatterson acquired a controlling stake in XL Health, a Baltimore based Medicare Advantage health plan focused on senior citizens with chronic diseases. In 2011, the company was acquired by United Healthcare after having taken EBITDA from ($112) million in 2007 to a $259 million in 2011. This deal won the operational excellence award for the healthcare segment from Private Equity International magazine.[8]
The firm was also a significant purchaser of WorldCom bonds.[9] The company later was renamed MCI Worldcom and later more simply to MCI prior to its subsequent acquisition by Verizon.
In 2001, MatlinPatterson became the majority owner of Huntsman Corporation,[10][11] which at the time was the 5th largest chemicals company worldwide, and later became a public company. MatlinPatterson has also made several investments in the energy sector, becoming the largest shareholder of NRG Energy,[12] which was the country’s third largest independent power company, as well as acquiring several power generation facilities in the Southeastern United States.
Other significant investments include California-based homebuilder Standard Pacific Corp., in which MatlinPatterson purchased a controlling stake in 2008. Between January 2009 and November 2010, MatlinPatterson invested $1 billion to become the controlling shareholder of Flagstar Bancorp of Troy, Michigan.[13]

About



Under the leadership of David Matlin and Mark Patterson, MatlinPatterson began investing in distressed corporate situations in 1994 within Credit Suisse. They quickly garnered recognition as an investment team successful in capturing value in distressed situations in less efficient markets around the world—taking control and non-control positions in situations other firms avoided. From this depth of experience, the firm grew, spinning out of Credit Suisse in 2002 as a noted private equity firm and rapidly evolving into a broader credit focused investment manager.  In 2010, the firm launched a range of targeted credit strategies to enable investors to benefit from the firm’s breadth and depth of experience investing across the dynamic credit markets. MatlinPatterson has nearly 50 employees located in New York.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
