Mr. Boynton joined Rayonier as Director, Specialty Pulp Marketing and Sales in 1999. Prior to joining Rayonier, he held positions with 3M Corporation from 1990 to 1999, including as Global Brand Manager, 3M Home Care Division. Mr. Boynton serves on the Board of Directors of The Brink's Company, is also a member of the Board of Governors and its Executive Committee of the National Council for Air and Stream Improvement, a member of the Board of Directors of the National Association of Manufacturers and a member of the Board of Directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta's Jacksonville Branch. From 2012 until 2014 Mr. Boynton also served as a director of Rayonier. He holds a bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from Iowa State University, an MBA from the University of Iowa and graduated from the Harvard University Graduate School of Business Advanced Management Program.

As a result of Mr. Boynton's previous service as Rayonier's President and CEO from January 2012 to June 2014 and as its Chairman from May 2012 to June 2014, and his previous service as Senior Vice President, Performance Fibers and Senior Vice President, Performance Fibers and Wood Products, Mr. Boynton has developed valuable business, management and leadership experience, as well as extensive knowledge of the Company and long-standing relationships with its major customers. We believe this experience, together with his marketing and engineering background, make Mr. Boynton uniquely well suited to help lead the Board's considerations of strategic and operational decisions and manage the Company's business.
