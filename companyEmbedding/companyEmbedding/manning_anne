Looking for a novel writing software that is affordable and easy-to-use? Anne has a recommendation.For years, I've looked for the system, that piece of software, plotting program, or philosophy, that would help me to write faster and better. After all, the one single thing that boosts your sales is a big back list. Most of the writing software I've found have been tailored for scriptwriting. And they were expensive, like hundreds of dollars for the top of the line version.
I recently became aware of another one, that's actually been around for a while, WriteWay (www.writewaypro.com). I was a little skeptical. After all, it wasn't expensive, only $49 for the full Pro version, so how powerful could it be? But there was a demo version with all the functionality of the Pro version, except for printing and exporting files (more on that later), so I figured I would try it.
Download and installation of the demo was easy and fast and I had it open in minutes.
This is where I give you my con on this software. It isn't totally intuitive, that is, I wasn't able to open it and start working immediately. I'm usually fast on the uptake, especially since all PC-compatible software looks pretty much like your normal Microsoft product. WriteWay comes with sample data and a tutorial to guide the new user through all the functions, from setting up a new book file to how to export to a regular document. If you go through the tutorial, you probably won't have any trouble.
Afte familiarizing myself with all the tabs and buttons--and there are lots--I imported my latest work-in-progress. It was quick and painless. I had to do some rearranging on the very handy structure tree that shows up on the left of the display. This tree shows you your whole book in scenes, chapters, and acts. Moving a scene or chapter from one place to another is not difficult.
There are lots of great features in WriteWayPro. The best is that your entire WIP is in one place, from initial ideas to research for a particular book to character descriptions to the actual draft of the book. The Pro version has a storyboard, which takes the information you enter and shows you graphically. The best single feature is the word count tracking. WriteWay will tell you how many words you've written during the day, and you can project your book. Tell WriteWay when you start, when you want to be finished, and it'll tell you how many words you need to do, and show you on a day-to-day basis how you're doing.
Needless to say, I purchased the Pro version for the ridiculously reasonable price of $49. The Standard Version isn't quite as powerful, so you can't import a WIP, there's no storyboard or research section, but at $24 it's a pretty good buy for just writing. Check out the features before you buy and I highly recommend downloading the demo and trying it out before you decide to buy.
WriteWayPro is the very best plotting and writing software I've ever investigated and the only one I've ever actually bought. I use it and recommend it highly!

Company HistoryMore than 75 years have passed since George T.
Manning left Europe for Australia. His job as an international grain
merchant was to develop a more robust trade between his European firm
and the vast potential of Australia's agricultural community. As things
go, Manning's assignment was scrapped, largely due to the looming threat
of war brewing in Europe.


One day, while still in Sydney planning his next professional move
Manning was introduced to a friend of a friend in the local grain trade.
This friend of a friend was a rough opal broker.


At that moment, in a pub in Sydney, the story of Manning's rise to
dominance in the opal trade began. He was to become world-renowned as
“The Opal King.” But this unofficial title, a sign of the respect with
which the mining and dealing communities in Australia regarded him,
didn’t come easily.


In those early days, opal was still a relatively unknown gemstone
commodity.  Many false starts had come and gone to introduce opal to
European markets. Almost no trade had been established with the USA.
Distances were so great, costs so high, and transport times far too long
to permit a practical trade in opal.  Also there was the lingering
superstition in many European countries that opal might bring bad luck
to the wearer.  This superstition took root from Sir Walter Scott’s
depiction of opal’s mysterious radiance in his 1829 novel, " Anne of
Geierstein, (or The Maiden of the Mist)1.  Due to the novel’s vast
European popularity, Scott’s description of opal as a mystical object
led to the gem’s disfavor from the mid 19th century into the early 20th
century. So, dispelling the superstition became a hurdle opal had to
overcome.  Yet opal continued to grow in popularity with those who
disregarded the unfounded belief that Scott’s novel had generated. In
fact it was Queen Victoria and Sarah Bernhardt, the first renowned
trend-setting western famous personalities who chose to ignore the
superstition and purchase fine Queensland opal for their collections.


Manning's plan was to immigrate to the US, but without a means of
support he knew this wasn’t possible.  When he saw that first rough opal
parcel he asked many key questions: How much was it? Where was it
mined? Was there a steady supply? Who marketed it and where? How could
one judge the rough in relation to the cut output?


Manning purchased this parcel and sold it in Sydney for a fair profit a
few days later. He bought more and sold it quickly to the local Sydney
cutters.


His interest aroused, he met some old hands in the mining game who’d
prospected in White Cliffs and Andamooka. Together they planned a trek
to the fields, an introductory adventure that Manning treasured until
the day he died.


His many years of field-buying in Andamooka, Coober Pedy and Lightning
Ridge never quite equaled that first flush of excitement during those
early journeys over land from Sydney to the opal fields. The outback,
the rugged miner's life, the thrill of a new find, cleaning and classing
the rough, cutting and selling it to the market – fueled his decision
to devote the rest of his life to promoting Australian opal as one of
the world’s premier gemstones.


In 1940, Manning immigrated to the USA to start the business in New York
City's (then) jewelry district in the Maiden Lane/Canal Street area. He
went door to door, showing his stones, building interest, selling as he
could. Because his stones were “free-sized,” there was a volume limit
to growth of the business.  Unless he could find a way to sell volume,
he knew he’d be limiting the opportunity to increase sales.


A paradigm-shifting idea blossomed.


Manning recognized that opal had great potential as a manufacturer’s
volume item. No one had yet seriously considered calibrating opal in
high volume. Supply had always been limited. Quality had never been
assured. Thus he saw his opportunity.


Manning’s broker relationships with Australia’s Pogany family and later
the Collins and Keady organizations, allowed for a constant stream of
rough to be sent wherever Manning required.  He’d already completed the
arduous task of categorizing opal, establishing color and quality
grades, calculating yields and selecting the sizes and shapes that would
become the opal standard for the industry.  Now the need to feed volume
to the market became urgent.


Manning's New York cutting operation couldn’t keep up with the demand
for free-size and single stones and definitely not for calibrated sizes.
So Manning began his search for a suitably skilled source to properly
slice and cut his opal.


His first efforts to develop a reliable volume-cutting operation took
him to Idar-Oberstein.  Idar cutters had already become skilled in
cutting and polishing opal, but not in calibrating it for volume
markets.  But very soon Germany became too costly a cutting environment
for high volume output.  The post-war boom had led to a significant rise
in labor costs.  Manning had to find another source of skilled labor if
his plan was to succeed.


Once again, he traveled around the world in search of highly skilled and
affordable labor markets to produce the volume cutting required by the
American manufacturing industry’s insatiable demand for product.


Hawaii, Samoa, Indonesia, Fiji, the Philippines, Thailand  – each had
potential but none were suited to meet the requirement for precise, high
-volume calibration cutting of opal.


After disappointing starts and stops, he arrived in Hong Kong. It was
that visit that spawned what has become the modern opal cutting industry
today.


Manning found a willing audience in Mr. Ngai and Mr. Chan of Wan Kow
Gems. These two men owned a Tiger Eye and Jade cutting factory. They
were fascinated by the unique beauty of the opal rough Manning brought
them. He sat at the slicer, demonstrating the skill necessary to clean
the matrix from the gem material to reveal its optimum color. He showed
them what variations were common, how to avoid cracks and imperfections.
The dopping and finishing process were much the same as with Tiger Eye,
thus the skills of one could be adapted to the other.


For ten years, Manning and Wan Kow dominated Hong Kong's opal industry.
Transactions were routine and reliable. Direct rough opal shipments from
the field, priced fairly with consistent quality made this enterprise
possible. The businesses prospered. The only real competition for fine
rough opal came from Manning’s Japanese counterpart, Mr. Yamamoto.
Yamamoto also purchased large quantities of rough opal to satisfy
post-war Japan’s appreciation for this fine gemstone. These two men
loomed large on the rough opal horizon for many, many years. With George
T. Manning's passing in April of 1977, so passed the original link to a
business adventure that still continues today.


Manning International is the successor company to Manning Opal
Corporation. And Wan Kow Gems has evolved many times over into the
current population of fine cutting houses in Hong Kong and the PRC.


Australia's opal mining industry existed long before George Manning's
first bout of “opal fever.” Great names in the business, far older than
the Manning name, along with newer entries, still appear on company
logos. Marks, Lane, Bartram, Costello, Van Brugge, Keady, Christianos,
Giles, Sherman, Cudlipp, King – and many, many others remain at the core
of the Australian opal industry. Greek, Italian, German and Slavic
immigrants, along with more recent Chinese newcomers, populate the
mining communities of the Outback in search of the magical amorphous
silica gemstone that is Australian Opal.


Until George T. Manning's entry into the opal world, no one had
succeeded with such vast market penetration and product development as
he achieved in his 40 years at the helm of his opal business.


So, it is with great pride in his memory that manninginternational.com
and its parent, Manning Opal Company, Inc, recognizes George T.
Manning’s achievements as our model of excellence in reputation, in
reliable international relations and in marketing honesty and integrity.

ELI MANNING RECEIVES ANN AND WELLINGTON MARA AWARD
BY DAN SALOMONE


Eli Manning is a two-time Super Bowl MVP, but the Giants quarterback would be the first to say that his accomplishments off the field are more important than the ones on it.
 On Thursday night, team president John Mara presented Manning with the Ann and Wellington Mara Award at the Vision of Hope awards dinner to benefit Boys Hope Girls Hope of New York.





"Eli Manning epitomizes in so many ways what we all want our athletes to be like and especially what we want in a Giants player," Mara said. "You all know about his accomplishments on the field, but it's his work off the field and the way he conducts himself that we most admire and respect. ... When you're fortunate enough to be in this business, you hope and pray that your players, particularly your stars, the guys who become face of your franchise, are people you're proud to have represent you. It doesn't always work out that way. I've been very fortunate, very blessed to have been around this team my entire life. I have been around a lot of great players, a lot of great people, and it's been a blessing for me. But I will tell you this: I have never been more proud of anyone who has ever worn the New York Giants uniform than I am of No. 10, Eli Manning."
 "I'm just thrilled and honored to be mentioned in the same breath as Ann and Wellington Mara, that's an honor in itself, Manning said. "They're two people I had the great fortune to know a little bit and to be around and to know what they meant to the community, to New York, and what they've done. I think I would not be recognized for my charity work if it weren't for the Mara family, for the Giants organization, for promoting us, for encouraging us to go out and be a part of your community."
 Each year in May, Boys Hope Girls Hope of New York holds its Vision of Hope awards dinner, which draws nearly 1,000 guests and supporters. Held at Cipriani Wall Street, the gala is the organization's main source of funding, often raising 65 percent of its annual operating budget. The special night celebrates the organization and its scholars' accomplishments while honoring a member of the New York Giants.





Founded in 1979, Boys Hope Girls Hope of New York is a charitable organization operating a college preparatory boarding program in Brooklyn. BHGHNY's mission is to help academically capable and motivated children from at-risk situations meet their full potential and become men and women for others by providing them with the safe and stable living environment, academic support, and guidance they need to finish high school, graduate from college, and become responsible and productive citizens. Today, the organization has operations in 15 U.S. cities and three countries in Latin America.
"Each year I have the privilege at this dinner to present the Ann and Wellington Mara Award to an individual who's really distinguished himself with what he or she has done in the community," Mara said. "My father was one of the founders of this organization, was one of the first board members, and this organization was so very meaningful to both my parents, as it is to me."
 Causes like this also have drawn Manning, who has been championing the youth throughout his 14 NFL seasons. That has only intensified since becoming the father of three young daughters.
 Manning has served as the Chair of the New York March for Babies for the past eight years, joining thousands of New Yorkers in the walk in support of March of Dimes. Providing additional access for top sponsors, engaging donors and raising awareness of the organization's platform, Manning’s efforts with March for Babies helped raise more than $25 million over the past seven years.
That is just one of Manning's many good works, and he was honored this past January as the co-winner of the Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year. Manning became the first Giants player to receive the award in its 47-year history. He was also named the Giants’ Man of the Year in 2007, 2008, 2011, 2012, 2014 and  2015.
He supports the Make A Wish Foundation and has granted wishes on a yearly basis, hosting wish kids and their families at practices and games. Manning has been a leader in supporting the National Football League and American Heart Association's campaign, PLAY60, a national youth movement and awareness initiative designed to promote physical fitness and healthy living to an increasingly inactive generation of children
 His most significant new endeavor is spearheading “Tackle Kids' Cancer,” an initiative with Hackensack University Medical Center. Prior to kicking off an extensive media campaign to raise awareness of this cause, Manning spent time with patients and doctors at the hospital's pediatric cancer center, learning more about the greatest needs in cancer research.
