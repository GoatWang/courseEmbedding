Roberto M. Esquivel|Herald-StandardThis August 2014 photo shows the entrance to Fayette Energy Facility in German Township. Dynegy Inc., a Houston-based energy company, purchased the plant and 10 other facilities in Ohio and Illinois from Duke Energy as part of a $2.8 billion acquisition. The sale was finalized April 2.


Roberto M. Esquivel|Herald-Standard



















































Dynegy Inc. announced recently its acquisition of Duke Energy’s Midwest commercial generation plants and retail business, including German Township power plant Fayette Energy Facility.The Houston-based energy company closed the sale of the Duke Energy portfolio April 2 for $2.8 billion in cash.In addition to Fayette Energy Facility, Dynegy acquired nine generating plants in Ohio and one in Illinois, as well as Duke Energy Retail Sales, the company’s Ohio retail business.The sale will not disrupt operations at the newly acquired plants, said Dynegy spokesperson Micah Hirschfield.“It’s status quo,” he said. “We purchase plants and we continue operating them. I don’t think (the sale) has any effect. It’s business as usual.“We feel all of the plants are good assets,” Hirschfield added.Fayette Energy Facility, a natural gas-fired, combined-cycle plant located just outside of Masontown with a 620 megawatt generating capacity, opened in May 2003 and produces power for about 500,000 homes. It consists of two natural-gas fired turbines, two heat recovery steam generators and one steam turbine operating in combined-cycle mode.The facility was constructed on a 300-acre site in 2002 as a $420 million investment by Duke. According to Hirschfield, the plant currently employs 21 workers.“We’re looking forward to getting the Fayette folks integrated into Dynegy,” he said.Duke, which is headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, announced in February 2014 its intent to sell its stock of gas, coal and oil burning electric power generation plants, citing inconsistent and unstable earnings in the power generation market.

Dynegy Inc. announced in August its intent to purchase the Duke Energy portfolio.In a separate deal, Dynegy recently acquired EquiPower Resources Corp. and Brayton Point Holdings LLC from Energy Capital Partners, including 10 additional generating facilities, for $3.45 billion.“The EquiPower and Duke acquisitions are transformational for Dynegy, ushering in a new era of substantial scale, and geographic and fuel diversity,” Dynegy president and CEO Robert C. Flexon said in a press release.The two acquisitions doubled Dynegy’s generating capacity to 26,000 megawatts in eight states — enough to supply 21 million homes in the Northeast and Midwest regions. Dynegy’s annual generation is expected to increase from 60 to 115 million megawatt-hours.Dynegy also provides retail electricity to 830,000 residential customers and 23,000 commercial, industrial and municipal customers in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Illinois.“We now have a meaningful presence in three of the best markets in the country and substantial fuel diversity across our portfolio,” Flexon continued. “Additionally, our PJM retail business is now fully backed by generation, providing a platform for growth.”
