Publisher's Description▼▲
"Many churched teens struggle to connect their faith to their everyday lives, and when asked what they believe, you often get the Christianese answers they think they need to give in church. And with most issues of faith, these are things that cant simply be taught in a four-week series of messages. As part of the bestselling TalkSheets series, TalkSheets: Confirm It! helps teens engage in real conversations where belief can be discovered, Christian words and notions can be unpacked, and faith can be connected with and expressed. Whether you use these TalkSheets as the primary lesson or as a supplement for your youth group, Sunday school class, small group or confirmation class, Confirm It! offers 52 TalkSheets that will allow teenagers to learn more about:  God  Jesus  The Holy Spirit  The Bible  Salvation  Discipleship  Key Words of Faith As each TalkSheet presents important issues, interesting activities, and challenging questions, kids will be encouraged to think about opinions, learn about themselves, and grow in their faith."

            In this expanded version of Deliver Me from Negative Self-Talk Lynn R. Davis adds new and exclusive content in a reader friendly format, using Biblical principles, engaging personal and real life experiences to illustrate and introduce practical steps to help the reader replace negative self-talk with positive thought patterns. 


Faith Declarations are also included which are designed inspire the reader to practice the process of using positive thought patterns and to increase their faith. Discussion questions are used to encourage the development of critical thinking skills with a clearer focus. The chapter titled Developing Your Spiritual Self-Talk succinctly shows the reader how to grow spiritually and to walk in faith. 


The final section of the book is made up of thirty-one daily reflections and meditations. A powerful scripture promise provides the reader with the stimulus that will lift the spirit encourage clear thinking, and to embrace Gods unconditional love, grace, and mercy.


Davis writes with a balance of candor, sensitivity and authority. Deliver Me from Negative Self-Talk will resonate with Christians desirous of building and growing in faith and those wanting  to experience the amazing impact of replacing negative self-talk habits with positive thought patterns.


A complimentary copy of this book was provided for review purposes. The opinions expressed are my own.

            Lynn Davis has done it again, Deliver Me From Negative Self Talk is outstanding. Not only will it help you get your thoughts straight and help you keep them there, but Lynn gives us the tools in each chapter to elevate what we think and help you question why you think that way. In the world we live in being bombarded with so much negative all around we all can get easily caught up in it, thankfully there is a better way. In this book your even given ways to talk positive affirmations, and of course see what you Don't want to say. This book is so full of wisdom and truth and real life stuff. Lynn has walked the walked and shares with us how to be survivors and overcome to become all we are meant to be in the Lord. So I was given a copy for a honest review and I'm headed out to buy a few for gifts for loved ones. Grab a few copies you'll read it more than once and you will most definitely bless whoever you give one to. Enjoy!

            I was given an advance copy of Deliver Me From Negitive Self Talk! Wow was it life changing, it has helped me change the way I think and speak. Loved the questions to go deeper at the end of every chapter. God's Word does not return void, every declaration said in faith will bring fruit.


Disclaimer: I was given this book in advance to read for a review.
