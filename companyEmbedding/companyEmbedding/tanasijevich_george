About
the Speakers

Ambassador
David Adelman
U.S.
Ambassador to Singapore

Since presenting his
credentials as U.S. Ambassador on April 29, 2010, David Adelman has
made great progress further developing and managing the relationship
between the United States and Singapore.  Under his leadership
the U.S. engagement in Singapore has become one of America’s anchors in
Asia.

Ambassador Adelman has
led trade missions to Burma, India, Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam
working to increase exports of American goods and services and identify
investment opportunities for American firms.  He also
regularly travels to the United States meeting with American
manufacturers and service providers to discuss the challenges and
opportunities of doing business in Asia.  Under Ambassador
Adelman’s leadership, U.S. exports to Singapore are at a historic high
having increased more than 45 percent.  The United States
trade surplus with Singapore has grown to the fifth largest American
surplus in the world.  In 2011, the U.S. Embassy in Singapore
earned the State Department’s global award for promoting the
President’s National Export Initiative.  Also, since
Ambassador Adelman’s arrival, U.S. direct foreign investment in
Singapore is at an all-time high having increased more than 20% to over
$116 billion in cumulative investment in 2011.

Since Ambassador
Adelman’s arrival, cooperation between the United States and Singapore
on defense and security matters have advanced significantly. 
Military cooperation reached a milestone with the announcement this
year that the United States will deploy the first in class U.S. Navy
Littoral Combat Ship in Singapore in 2013.  On February 1,
2012, for the first time, the United States and Singapore launched a
formal annual Strategic Partnership Dialogue to further political and
economic cooperation.  The Ambassador successfully worked to
make Singapore a party to the Hague Convention on International Child
Abductions and the countries signed the U.S.- Singapore Preventing and
Combating Serious Crime Agreement.  Also in 2012, the
Ambassador successfully negotiated the establishment of the U.S. –
Singapore Third Country Training Program under which the U.S. and
Singapore have worked jointly to build health care, environmental and
educational capacity in the Lower Mekong.  Educational and
cultural exchanges have also increased during Ambassador Adelman’s
tenure.  This year, more Singaporeans than ever will study at
American colleges and universities and more American researchers,
students and artists will work in Singapore than at any other time in
history.

Ambassador Adelman has
spent most of his career in the private sector.  Prior to his
appointment, he was a businessman and partner in a large American law
firm.  He has also been a university instructor and member of
the Georgia Senate.  He has received numerous academic and
civic honors throughout his career.  He holds graduate degrees
in law and public administration.

Born in New York City,
Ambassador Adelman lived much of his life in Atlanta,
Georgia.  He and his wife Caroline have three children, Oscar,
Leah, and Avery.

									 Marina Bay Sands, Asia’s leading destination for business, leisure and entertainment, today announced that George Tanasijevich has been appointed its President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO). Tanasijevich is also the Managing Director of Global Development for Las Vegas Sands Corp., the parent company of Marina Bay Sands and a leading global integrated resorts developer with properties in Las Vegas, Macau and Singapore.
  
 Prior to his recent appointment, Tanasijevich was the interim CEO and previously served as the General Manager and Vice President, Singapore Development, spearheading the development of Las Vegas Sands Corp.’s winning bid for Singapore’s first Integrated Resort at Marina Bay.
  
 Michael Leven, President and Chief Operating Officer, Las Vegas Sands Corp. said, “With his deep insights of corporate Asia, organizational leadership expertise and experience in developing a world-class integrated resort from the ground up, George was the perfect choice for us. As our first employee in Singapore, George was instrumental in Las Vegas Sands’ successful bid for the Marina Bay Integrated Resort. Throughout Marina Bay Sands’ construction and opening phases, George continued to impress us with his sharp business and legal mind, familiarity with the operating framework in Singapore, and reassuring presence. He has been a steady and strong force for the company since Day 1, and we are proud to have him lead Marina Bay Sands to even greater heights.”

   

Prior to joining Marina Bay Sands in 2005, Tanasijevich was based in Macau as Director of Development, responsible for the coordination of various commercial activities related to Las Vegas Sands Corp.’s Cotai Strip projects. An accomplished business executive and attorney with extensive international experience, Tanasijevich also previously served as Senior Vice President / Equity Markets at CapitaLand Limited in Singapore, Southeast Asia’s largest real estate and hospitality conglomerate. 
  
 Said Tanasijevich, “At every phase of Marina Bay Sands’ growth, I have been privileged to work with individuals whose passion, hard work and dedication have helped create and define this iconic destination.  As Marina Bay Sands moves into its second year of operations, I am excited to embark on my new role and look forward to working closely with my 8,600 colleagues to ensure the continued success of Asia’s best destination.”
  
 Marina Bay Sands has also appointed another industry veteran to its senior leadership team. Benny Zin has been appointed as Marina Bay Sands’ Chief Operating Officer (COO). 
  
Zin most recently served as Marina Bay Sands’ interim COO and was formerly Vice President for Conventions and Exhibitions, driving the company’s Meetings, Incentives, Conventions and Exhibitions (MICE) strategy since its opening last year. As COO, Zin will helm the company’s operations across its diverse businesses including hotel, retail, MICE as well as Food and Beverage.
 
Prior to joining Marina Bay Sands, Zin was the Chief Operating Officer of The Palace Management Group, which operated luxury living communities in Miami, Florida. Before this role, he was the Chief Executive Officer of Kardan Communications, a division of publicly traded company Kardan Ltd, overseeing six telecommunications and software companies.
