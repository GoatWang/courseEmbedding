DALLAS, March 22, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Brinker International, Inc. (NYSE:   EAT), today announced Steve Provost has been named executive vice president and chief marketing and innovation officer of Chili's® Grill & Bar. In this role, Provost will lead the brand's consumer insights, culinary innovation and marketing teams.

"In looking for the right leader for our Chili's culinary and marketing teams, we were fortunate to reach within Brinker's talented senior leadership team," said Kelli Valade, executive vice president and president of Chili's. "I've had the pleasure of working alongside Steve for the past eight years. His tenure as a BrinkerHead, coupled with his thorough understanding, experience and love of marketing, made it an easy decision for him to lead our Chili's marketing and innovation efforts."
Provost joined the Brinker family in 2009 as senior vice president of marketing for Maggiano's Little Italy® and later that year transitioned to serve as brand president. In the past eight years, Maggiano's drove 23 consecutive quarters of sales growth, opened new, more efficient restaurants, more than doubled profitability and increased financial returns to the highest level in the brand's history. In its 25th year, Maggiano's continues to be recognized for its differentiated dining experience with awards like America's top five favorite chain restaurant and America's favorite place for special occasions from Technomic and the number one most allergy-friendly large chain from AllergyEats.
Prior to Brinker, Provost held various marketing positions as executive vice president and chief marketing officer of Quiznos®, senior vice president of franchising and vice president of marketing for Kentucky Fried Chicken® and chief marketing and innovation officer for Long John Silver's and A&W brands. 
As Provost transitions, the Maggiano's brand will be co-led by Vice Presidents, Genifer Gray and Larry Konecny, who have been promoted to chief operations officer and vice president and chief concept officer, respectively. Gray and Konecny have progressed through various leadership positions with the brand over the past 15 years, most recently leading the development and successful launch of the biggest menu change in the brand's 25-year history.
Brinker International, Inc. is one of the world's leading casual dining restaurant companies. Founded in 1975 and based in Dallas, Texas, as of the fiscal second quarter ended Dec. 28, 2016, Brinker owned, operated or franchised 1,658 restaurants under the names Chili's® Grill & Bar (1,606 restaurants) and Maggiano's Little Italy® (52 restaurants).

Can Steve Provost Turn Maggiano's Into a Billion-Dollar Brand?

Kim Bhasin
Senior reporter, The Huffington Post
Hi there, you can call me Kim. I'm Senior reporter at The Huffington Post and I'm based in Greater New York City Area.

There are a lot of challenges that come with the growth of a company, especially with a business as complex as a restaurant. But if handled correctly, all those struggles can be overcome.Take Maggiano's Little Italy, for example. It exists in the higher-end chain restaurant category with competitors like the Cheesecake Factory and P.F. Chang's China Bistro. It has semi-scratch kitchens, large locations and multiple business lines that make it particularly hard to scale. And yet, it managed to grow. In fact, Maggiano's is the only high-end Italian food chain that has scaled to the size it is right now: 44 restaurants.How did it pull that off? Maggiano's president Steve Provost shares his thoughts on how he has built the company's reputation, while staying true to its origins.Small Player Advantage"Economics is destiny in any business," Provost says. "While there are some challenges, we also have the advantage of not spending a lot of money on expensive TV commercials talking about how good we are. We want your friends to tell you how good we are."Smaller brands with a "megaphone" now have an advantage. "The world is changing and the beauty of being a smaller player is that we're now in a better world for non-marketers," Provost says. "With the rise of social, you can tell your story much more extensively." Staying True to Its BrandThere's no simple answer for what a company should do with its brand, since each one is different. All you can do is stay true to your own."The hardest thing about any brand is whatever you do has to be done off of who you are," Provost says. "The ideas that stick are the ideas that fit the brand."For Maggiano's, its brand is about being indulgent. That's how consumers think of it. It can never instantly reverse itself and become all about health, for instance.It's also focused on family. Diners go there to eat in a big group for long periods of time, and they expect exquisite service. If Maggiano's can't provide that expected level of service, then it has failed.Acting Small and Big Maggiano's has combined two models of doing business: the entrepreneurial model and the big company model. The entrepreneurial model involves one innovator with a great gut instinct and the ability to stay nimble and react quickly to what customers think, while the big company model is about long-term processes that are highly scientific and about getting the customers involved with every process. "What we try to do at Maggiano's is get them both together," Provost says. "Both have flaws. The gut instinct could be wrong or you could fall in love with the process and lose sight of the end result."Future Plans"Our goal is to be a billion-dollar brand—100 restaurants and more—but never sacrifice the unique service experience that we have," Provost says. "We want to grow responsibly, recruit and develop world-class chefs, and find the sites that are special."Read more interviews with entrepreneurs and business experts.
