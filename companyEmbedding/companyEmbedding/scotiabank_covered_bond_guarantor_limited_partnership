	The indexation methodology used to account for subsequent price developments is based on (i) with respect to mortgaged properties located in the cities of Vancouver, Victoria, Calgary, Edmonton, Winnipeg, Ottawa-Gatineau, Hamilton, Toronto, Montreal, Quebec City and Halifax, data provided by Teranet




	through the Teranet - National Bank National Composite House Price Index


	TM

	(the "House Price Index"), and (ii) for mortgaged properties located in all other areas of Canada, national residential statistics compiled by the Canadian Real Estate Association ("CREA"). The data derived by the House Price Index





	is based on a repeat sales method, which measures the change in price of certain residential properties within the related area based on at least two sales of each such property over time. Such price change data is then used to formulate the House Price Index for the related area. The statistics derived by




	CREA are the average actual resale prices for residential properties in the related area, as well as overall figures for each province and territory of Canada. The Original Market Value is as of the date it is most recently determined or assessed in accordance with the underwriting policies (whether upon originiation




	or renewal of the Loan or subsequently thereto).

	currently reviews the Loans in its Covered Bond Portfolio, on a periodic basis, to ensure such Loans continue to be
	Eligible Loans. As a result of a review, a selection of Loans may be sold by the Guarantor to Scotiabank, including
	Loans that have ceased to be Eligible Loans or Loans that are at least 90 days past due or subject to foreclosure. Sales
	of Eligible Loans by the Guarantor that are at least 90 days past due or subject to foreclosure are done on a voluntary
	basis and the Guarantor is under no obligation to continue such sales or notify investors of any discontinuance of
	such sales. The sale of Loans by the Guarantor that were at least 90 days past due or subject to foreclosure reflected
	in this Investor Report were immaterial to the Covered Bond Portfolio’s overall performance. Refer to Notes 13
