Testimonials



A doctor is a person who is licensed to practice medicine. A healer is a person who restores the health of their patient. In my experience, there are a lot of doctors in the world, but much fewer healers. ​In Rama Prasad, I found both. I am so grateful to speak with an Ayurveda doctor with such a holistic view of the world, always shared with care and humour.  ​- Anton | 24th May 2017.

Our recent Google Maps testimonials
​For the first time in my life I have met someone that actually knows more about me and my health than I do. Much more. Rama has been treating me by removing the cause of my disease, not by removing the symptoms. He has gently showed me a new way of eating that gives my body power and space to heal itself. The herbs he is giving me are strengthening my body and give no strange side effects. I came with Giardia which I now know is just a symptom for clogged intestines.

More about Sanskrit and this course




What is Sanskrit?



Originally called ‘samskrtam’, Sanskrit is the oldest recorded language. It is known as the language of the gods and is the language for Hindu, Buddhist, Sikh and Jain wisdom. It was the official language of India until 1100 AD when the Muslim invasion occurred. Its script is known as ‘deva-nagari’ or 'modern and divine'.       Sanskrit has a unique sound vibration that resonates with the microcosm of our bodies and the macrocosm of the universe. Enlightened sages imparted it as a sublime sound that would elevate one’s consciousness to enlightenment. It has also been deemed the most compatible language for computers by NASA researcher Rick Briggs. This is because it is the only natural language in the world functioning with mathematical precision and embodying the principles of artificial intelligence.      Linguists agree Sanskrit has perfect grammatical foundation. Each word can be likened to a tree. Evolving from the root of grammar, stemming into the language, branching in the listener’s mind, flowering in their heart and bearing the fruit of positive deeds.      Reciting and understanding potent Sanskrit vibrations reconnects us with the subtle forces of the cosmos and our spiritual centre. It offers a window to ancient wisdom imparted by sages revealing life-enriching truths. Sanskrit is essential to explore the depths of yoga, meditation, astrology, philosophy and Ayurveda. Profound philosophical epics such as the Ramaayana, the Mahabhaarata, Bhagavad-Gita and the Puraanas are also originally in Sanskrit.      Chanting Sanskrit correctly connects us with the empowering energies of the cosmos and our being. The powerful sound vibrations of Sanskrit help to release stress, calm emotions, heal the body and focus the mind. Specific mantras can also dispel negative energies and harness positive influences. Modern research indicates that reciting Sanskrit bestows the same effect as deep meditation.





Writing sanskrit



Sanskrit reading & writing
Dr Rama Prasad offers Sanskrit training for general interest or tailored specifically for those involved in Yoga, Ayurveda or Vedic spirituality. Chanting Sanskrit correctly connects us to the subtle energies of the cosmos and our being.       The powerful sound vibrations of Sanskrit help to release stress, calm emotions, heal the body and focus the mind. Specific mantras can also dispel negative energies and harness positive influences into one’s life.      Learning Sanskrit opens a window to the ancient wisdom imparted by saints in the Vedas. It offers deeper insights into the sciences of Yoga, Meditation and Ayurveda, since all this knowledge was originally recorded in Sanskrit. Sanskrit is likened to a tree that evolves from the root of grammar, stems into an alphabet, branches in the listener’s mind and flowers in their heart bearing the fruit of positive deeds.

Yoga & Ayurveda - complementing each other
Yoga and Ayurveda are complementary to each other. Both focus on sustainable human health and well-being. While Ayurveda takes a person from illness to wellness, Yoga takes him from wellness to stillness! In other words, while Ayurveda mostly focuses on physical fitness, Yoga aims at emotional and Spiritual fitness.How does Ayurveda complement YogaYoga and Ayurveda are sister-sciences. Both follow the same fundamental principles and aim at human wellness. Where Ayurveda is clinical Yoga, Yoga is spiritual Ayurveda.             Ayurveda STARTS with assessing the distance between 'your current body' and 'body type'. Ayurveda uses all practical and effective methods to bring your body back to the true yourself by addressing emotional, environmental and lifestyle causes as well as tissue damage. Ayurvedic method includes personalised hot oil therapies, deep cell cleanses, nutritional upgrades and supplements from wild-crafted rainforest herbs. When your body is fitter, your progress in Yoga is faster.            "I could not practice my daily asana, I could not get into meditation, I couldn't even breath properly because of my violent peristalsis" - says Jay, a 47 years old Yogi for 17 years. "Within a week of being on my new diet and herbs from my Ayurveda consultant, my pain subsided, which pleasantly shocked my G.P. and Gastroenterologists." - he continued. "A course of hot oil treatments completely brought me back to my mat! I stopped all my herbs and treatments in 4 weeks. Now, I feel even brighter with my new diet." - Jay concludes.Background"Veda" is compilation on wisdom from life. It was a large body of information. At one stage it was divided into 4 categories, and called Rg, Yajus, Saama and Atharva. The latter one, Atharva, was all about remedial measures. Veda was further recomposed a few thousand years later into more facts and principles called Darshanas. It was a training manual for us to live our life with optimum fulfilment. It taught us what is life and how to DEAL with it.        Yoga is one of the six 'darshanas'. And, Ayurveda is the subunit of Atharva Veda and its foundations are in the first Darshana namely, Sankhya. This is one connection between them.        If Ayurveda helps to stay fit and healthy, Yoga takes to a new level of fitness. It helps you with self-knowing and thus more connected with the world we are living.        Sage Patanjali is known to have composed the foundations of Yoga, Sanskrit language and Ayurveda.Both are 6000+ years oldHow old are they? That question is like when did mothers start breastfeeding? No one really knows. Or, everyone knows, but can't put a number on it. Most historians think it could be 3000 to 6000 years old. Based on the Australian Aboriginal culture and stories, it could be 60,000 years old. There are concepts in both Indian and Australian Aboriginal schools that are similar or same.Both are soul-centredBoth Yoga and Ayurveda are tailor made for each individual. You might begin with a group posture class. But, the progress is both physical, emotional and spiritual! And the connection with your teacher makes your personal journey safe, guarded and fast. It becomes a self-discovery.Both encourage self-discoveryA taxi driver needs to know how the taxi system works. A pilot knows how the air traffic works, how his plane works. An owner of a mind-body need to know how their mind-body works. Ayurveda starts the self-enquiry with body-type analysis. There are 4 different styles of body-type or prakriti analysis. This reveals your 'make' and 'what are you designed for'. Once you know your 'map', it is time to explore. This method is safe, sustainable and most importantly joy-giving.       Once this part is over Yoga helps you work with the mind and soul though its consciousness practices and meditation techniques. It’s all about productivity through your natural skills and thus keeping you fulfilled.Art and ScienceArt is "kala" in Sanskrit language in which the entire Vedic literature is recorded. Kala stands for the 'dance of the goddess of wisdom". Kala is wisdom in serene action. Every form of knowledge is Kala. Science is "shaastra" in Sanskrit. Shaastra is defined as 'systematic search to knowledge". Its the same definition of science. Literally science - modern or ancient is shaastra.        Practiced personally, Ayurveda is purely an art on health. Practiced in clinic, Ayurveda is a science. Same is applicable to Yoga. Both are art and science.What  Ayurveda offer to the Yoga community...The above story of Jay is simple and explains it all.         There is nothing like Ayurveda - being sister science to Yoga, born from the same linguistic, philosophical and geographical ecology, to support a Yoga practitioner with their prana, tejas and ojas.

"How can I help you, Sam". Rama was really happy to pick up the phone and help me with my doubts!​I've turned the corner within 6 weeks of Ayurveda with Rama. ​- Samantha 22/04/2017














I have been a patient of Dr Rama Prasad for 18 years. I first saw him when I was suffering chronic ulcerative colitis, which several specialist gastroenterologists could not bring under control. Within a week of following Rama’s treatment, diet and advice, my illness was not only under control, but had completely turned a corner and I have never looked back. I have learned much from Rama including managing the stresses of life and understanding how they are linked directly to our health. I have complete trust in Rama and his Ayurvedic practices and would fully recommend him for all health needs. - Frankey








Rama, ​you have no idea but the skin care line I developed was actually inspired by your take on Ayurveda way back in 2000". ​- K. Bright.








"Rama's body type analysis is out of this world. He helped our children a lot with life and education direction."








"I went to Dr. Prasad to fix my psoriasis.  ​Just over 3 months, Ayurveda has transformed my life."
