Life and career[edit]
Kelley was born in Truckee, California. He graduated from University of California at Berkeley and received his medical degree from the School of Medicine in San Francisco. He continued his studies at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, earning a Doctor of Medical Science in 1941.
In 1942 he was called to duty in the United States Army Medical Corps as chief psychiatrist for the 30th General Hospital in the European Theatre. Along with psychologist Gustave Gilbert he administered the Rorschach inkblot test to the 22 defendants in the Nazi leadership group prior to the first Nuremberg trials.[1] Kelley authored two books on the subject: Twenty-two Cells in Nuremberg and The Case of Rudolph Hess.
Upon honorable discharge in 1946, Kelley was appointed Associate Professor of Psychiatry at the Bowman Gray School of Medicine in North Carolina. In 1949 he was appointed Professor of Criminology at the University of California at Berkeley.
Kelley committed suicide in front of his wife and children on New Year's Day 1958 by ingesting a capsule of potassium cyanide (as had Nazi leader Hermann Göring, whom Kelley had come to know during his psychiatric evaluation at Nuremberg).[2][3]
Kelley was portrayed by Stuart Bunce in the 2006 BBC docudrama Nuremberg: Nazis on Trial, which depicts the events at Nuremberg,[4] as does Jack El-Hai's nonfiction book The Nazi And The Psychiatrist.[5]

5.0 out of 5 starsNazi war criminals judged to be by anf large psychologically  "normal"Byjohnnon April 9, 2016An analysis of a psychiatrists interviews of Nazi war criminals in preparation for the Nuremburg trials.  I read Gustave Gilbert's "Nuremburg Diary" fifty years ago and remember it vividly.  (I wish that Nuremburg Diary was available on Kindle, as I would like to read it again.)  Kelly's conclusions that the defendants were by and  large "normal" is disturbing although not really alarming.  I do not know enough about Rorschach ink blots to know what they signify and seem not to be alone in this regard.  It seems to me that analysis really depends on the the admisisator of the test and his (or her) prejudices.  Nevertheless The story of  Dr. Kelly was fascinating.  I suppose we will never know whether Rudolf Hess was really amnesiac during the trial.I was left with the conclusion that it could happen here and found some real parallels between the Nazi defendants and certain presidential candidates in the 2016 election coming up in November.  The parallels are scary!.

3.0 out of 5 starsNot Enough Material Here for a Whole BookByZeldockon May 8, 2014I found El-Hai's previous book, "The Lobotomist," absolutely fascinating.  The history of psycho-surgery and the life of the developer--and biggest fan--of the "icepick" operation fit together beautifully.  The lobotomy fad remains a significant topic.At first glance, a book about a psychiatrist who examined the leading Nazi war-crime defendants would seem to hold similar potential.  But sadly, there is not much of a payoff here.  The view we get of the Nazis reinforces Douglas Kelley's conclusion that (with a couple of exceptions) they weren't psychologically abnormal.  Aside from that, we don't gain much insight into them.  When Kelley, and El-Hai's focus, return to the U.S., it seems that we might get into something that's more than moderately interesting, in the topic of Kelley's criminological work.  But again, El-Hai doesn't have anything particularly memorable to tell us.The book is well written and appears to be well researched.  The varying interpretations of and periodic disputes over the Rorschach tests given to the Nazi defendants by Kelley and another Army psychiatrist might have provided a better framework for El-Hai's material than the life story of Kelley himself.

There was a problem loading comments right now. Please try again later.3.0 out of 5 starsCover blurb misleadingByGwynn B. Owenson April 13, 2015Format: Hardcover|Verified PurchaseThis book is less about Hermann Goering than the search (successful or not) for a common denominator tying Nazi atrocious acts and mindset to some form of psychopathy singular to the rise of Nazism by psychiatrists including the featured Douglas M. Kelley and to a lesser extent his bete noir, the psychologist Gustav Gilbert. Following his term in Nuremberg, Kelley's life is explored through his subsequent work.The key issue of whether Nazism is a function of a mental disorder unique to the times or these Nazis studied presented were basically indistinguishable psychologically from the "normal" people in society remains a contentious subject today. This is the main premise of this book.The cover of this book lends the impression it is about primarily Goering and Kelley, and their "fatal meeting of minds" is patently sensationalistic. This distorts and diminishes the message that lurking in each of us is the capacity to effect evil acts in certain nurturing circumstances.0Comment|

In the first part of the book, he interacts with the Nazis who are being held for the Nuremberg trials. That was interesting.  But then the book goes on to the psychiatrist's career in the States. If I were to choose to read a biography, it would not be of this doctor.0Comment|

I knew Doc when I was a rookie police officer working in records and was one of the last who saw him as he left the police station to go home 1-1-58 and heard the ambulance call.  Still gives me chills all these many years after the fact.  Over the years I have often wondered how it happened.  There were rumors but nothing quite like the book.  Good to have at least this much of the story.0Comment|

Please try again later.5.0 out of 5 starsAlthough this may sometimes look like a splitting of the narrativeByIvan Mario Braunon August 9, 2016Format: Kindle Edition|Verified PurchaseThis book is not a scientific study on the psychology of the main Nazi defendants in Nüremberg, but an interesting and quite detailed report on the unsuspectedly normal personality of mass murderers.Besides this, it gives interesting insights into the personal life of one of the psychiatrists (Douglas Kelley) involved in maintaining the health of the prisoners, including both his relationship with Hermann Göring and his own family. Although this may sometimes look like a splitting of the narrative, its leitmotiv concerns some  similarities between Göring's and Kelley's own narcissistic behaviors.0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuseCommentInsert product linkPaste the product's web address below:Product not found.

Kelleyon December 6, 2013Format: Hardcover|Verified PurchaseThis is a well documented history about the fascinating interaction between two egotists,  psychiatrist Dr. Douglas Mc Kelley and the Nazi second in command, Reich Marshal Herman Goering.  It is well researched from army and academic archives but also from personal records kept by Dr. Kelley's son, Douglas Jr.The insights into the two protagonist's personalities are well drawn and very believable.  The good versus evil theme is also presented. The questioned raised as to whether Dr. Kelley was forever changed by the evil spector of Goering is never really answered but left for the reader to ponder.Fascinating history, well presented, this would make a good movie or play.0Comment|

Mysterious suicide of Nuremburg psychiatrist


Joan Ryan


        Published 4:00 am, Sunday, February 6, 2005
    
































































Forty-seven years have washed over the memory of that New Year's Day in 1958. Doug Kelley was 10 years old. His brain stored what happened that day in snapshots. 
His father exploding in rage in the kitchen of their sprawling Kensington home. His father on the stairs with the vial of white powder. His father on the floor, jerking and foaming, his eyes wild. His grandfather trying to pour water down his throat. The ambulance. 
But all these years later, Kelley still doesn't know why his father did what he did, in front of his family, on a day that seemed no different from any other day. Nobody knows why, not his mother, who is 90 now, or his younger brother and sister.

I heard about Dr. Douglas Kelley from a reader responding to my column last week. I wrote about a psychiatrist who had interviewed Nazi war criminals awaiting trial in Nuremberg after World War II. That psychiatrist had been one of six or seven rotated in by the U.S. Army during the several years of the tribunal. The reader asked whether I knew about Douglas Kelley, the most famous of the Nuremberg psychiatrists. He wrote a book called, "22 Cells in Nuremberg," upon his return to the United States. 
"He committed suicide," the reader said, "by taking potassium cyanide, just like Hermann Goering. I had heard he never got over his experience in Nuremberg." 
The case was almost five decades old. What did it matter now? But I kept thinking about it. Had he carried back from those 22 cells something darker than psychiatric reports? Was there a part of him that was hollowed out by living inside the minds of men who killed so easily? I couldn't help but do a little digging. I discovered something I didn't expect. Kelley was a local guy. 
He was a descendant of C.F. McGlashen, who was famous for discovering the Donner Party. He was born in Truckee and grew up in San Francisco. He was a straight-A student at Lowell and an Eagle Scout. He graduated from UC Berkeley, earned his medical degree at UCSF and, on a Rockefeller fellowship, earned a second doctorate in medical science from Columbia. At the time of his death, he was a famous professor of psychiatry and criminology at UC Berkeley. 
His suicide was front-page news for two days in The Chronicle. He was just 45 years old. He had attended a New Year's Eve party the night before. "He was his usual jovial self," one guest was quoted as saying. He had driven into San Francisco earlier in the day to pick up his father, a dentist, so they could watch the Rose Bowl on the family's new color television. He left no note. 
"His act just doesn't make sense," Berkeley Police Chief John Holstrom, a friend of Kelley's, told the paper. 
I tracked down Doug Kelley, the son, in Fairfield. He is 57 and is still trying to solve the mystery. Kelley grew up to be, in his own words, "a burned out lefty." He dropped out of college during the Vietnam War, fathered a son at 19 and spent a decade wandering around the world. He married four times. He has worked for the U.S. Postal Service for the past 27 years. 
"He was cooking dinner, burned himself and exploded," Kelley said. "The next thing we knew, he was on the stairs saying he was going to swallow the potassium cyanide and that he'd be dead in 30 seconds." His wife, father and three children witnessed his death. 
Some speculated, according to the 1958 Chronicle story, that Dr. Kelley brought the potassium cyanide back from Nuremberg. But his wife and son say he had so many different medicines and concoctions in his home laboratory that he could have gotten the poison anywhere. Still, his papers from Nuremberg and comments recalled by his son suggest he connected with Goering as a person. In his book, he expresses admiration for Goering "for taking his own life at his own convenience and in a manner of his own choosing." 
"His suicide, shrouded in mystery ... was a skillful, even brilliant finishing touch," he wrote. "... (H)istory may well show that Goering won out in the end." 
Kelley's widow, Alice-Vivienne Kelley, has no more of an answer today to her husband's death than she did 47 years ago. She lives in Santa Barbara, in a large house overlooking the ocean. She is still as proper and private as her Southern blueblood upbringing taught her to be. She remembered her husband as endlessly interesting and incomparably brilliant. He was an early practitioner of the Rorschach test, publishing a book on the technique in 1946. He was a leading expert in the use of psychiatry in law enforcement, serving as a consultant and a prosecution witness in high-profile murder cases. He was a gourmet cook and a magician -- a lively, driven genius whose interests and affinities had no bounds. 
"I don't know what happened right at the end there," she said over the phone in her soft Tennessee drawl. "I never did know why. He wasn't unhappy. I just put it out of my mind. I don't want to try to remember." 
She said it probably is a coincidence that her husband died by the same method as Goering. 
"I think so," she said. "I don't know. See, a lot of things I didn't know. I didn't feel it was my right to be curious about certain things. I wish I could give you a really clear picture of how he was thinking at the time. But it's not anything I want to think about. It is just a mystery." 
Kelley's son, Doug, said his mother's recollections and the newspaper accounts don't tell the whole story. His father had a dark side that he didn't show in public. He was an alcoholic who frequently erupted in anger. He had threatened suicide at least once before. Maybe he took on too much responsibility with his many professional pursuits. Maybe he understood too well, from his time at Nuremberg, the quiet insanity that can lurk inside smart and accomplished men. 
"All through his papers (from Nuremberg), his interviews show men who are so surprised they ended up where they did," Kelley said. 
Kelley has some of the memorabilia his father took from Nuremberg, some of it too bizarre for explanation. Inside a flat yellow Kodak box is a series of X-rays of a head that is labeled as Adolf Hitler's. There is a typed and translated copy of Hitler's will. He has small packages of chocolates and cookies carefully wrapped in writing paper, on which Rudolf Hess asks Kelley to check if his guards have been poisoning him. Dr. Kelley also had, for some reason, many letters from Goering to his wife. 
"Why did it have to turn out this way?" Goering writes. "If we had even suspected this development, we would certainly have gone another way." 
And there is a note from Goering to Dr. Kelley. 
"I regret your departure from Nuremberg, as do the comrades confined with me. I thank you for your human behavior and also for your attempt to understand our reasons." 
Doug Kelley remembers appearing with his father on a TV show his father hosted for KQED called "The Criminal Mind." On this episode, Doug Kelley played a little boy whose father snaps when the boy won't stop beating a drum. "It analyzed how certain frustrations led to violent behavior," Kelley recalled. 
For a man who spent his life studying breaking points, he seemed to have understood so little about his own. "I know it's ironic," Kelley said. "I think maybe he knew he was on a runaway train. I think he knew what was inside, but he didn't know how to make it go away." 
Maybe Dr. Douglas Kelley took from those 22 cells in Nuremberg something darker than just letters and Rorschach results. Or maybe his furious intellect burned itself out. Or maybe he was mentally ill. For Doug Kelley, what is left of his father are boxes and boxes of psychiatric evaluations and notes that show what was in the minds of Nazi leaders and local murderers and kidnappers. 
What they don't tell him is what was in his father's.

Lt. Colonel Douglas McGlashan Kelley (11 August 1912 – January 1, 1958) was a United States Army Military Intelligence Corps officer who served as chief psychiatrist at Nuremberg Prison during the Nuremberg War Trials. He was charged with ascertaining defendants' competency evaluations before standing trial.

Life and career[edit]
Kelley was born in Truckee, California. He graduated from University of California at Berkeley and received his medical degree from the School of Medicine in San Francisco. He continued his studies at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, earning a Doctor of Medical Science in 1941.
In 1942 he was called to duty in the United States Army Medical Corps as chief psychiatrist for the 30th General Hospital in the European Theatre. Along with psychologist Gustave Gilbert he administered the Rorschach inkblot test to the 22 defendants in the Nazi leadership group prior to the first Nuremberg trials.[1] Kelley authored two books on the subject: Twenty-two Cells in Nuremberg and The Case of Rudolph Hess.
Upon honorable discharge in 1946, Kelley was appointed Associate Professor of Psychiatry at the Bowman Gray School of Medicine in North Carolina. In 1949 he was appointed Professor of Criminology at the University of California at Berkeley.
Kelley committed suicide in front of his wife and children on New Year's Day 1958 by ingesting a capsule of potassium cyanide (as had Nazi leader Hermann Göring, whom Kelley had come to know during his psychiatric evaluation at Nuremberg).[2][3]
Kelley was portrayed by Stuart Bunce in the 2006 BBC docudrama Nuremberg: Nazis on Trial, which depicts the events at Nuremberg,[4] as does Jack El-Hai's nonfiction book The Nazi And The Psychiatrist.[5]

Life and career[edit]
Kelley was born in Truckee, California. He graduated from University of California at Berkeley and received his medical degree from the School of Medicine in San Francisco. He continued his studies at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, earning a Doctor of Medical Science in 1941.
In 1942 he was called to duty in the United States Army Medical Corps as chief psychiatrist for the 30th General Hospital in the European Theatre. Along with psychologist Gustave Gilbert he administered the Rorschach inkblot test to the 22 defendants in the Nazi leadership group prior to the first Nuremberg trials.[1] Kelley authored two books on the subject: Twenty-two Cells in Nuremberg and The Case of Rudolph Hess.
Upon honorable discharge in 1946, Kelley was appointed Associate Professor of Psychiatry at the Bowman Gray School of Medicine in North Carolina. In 1949 he was appointed Professor of Criminology at the University of California at Berkeley.
Kelley committed suicide in front of his wife and children on New Year's Day 1958 by ingesting a capsule of potassium cyanide (as had Nazi leader Hermann Göring, whom Kelley had come to know during his psychiatric evaluation at Nuremberg).[2][3]
Kelley was portrayed by Stuart Bunce in the 2006 BBC docudrama Nuremberg: Nazis on Trial, which depicts the events at Nuremberg,[4] as does Jack El-Hai's nonfiction book The Nazi And The Psychiatrist.[5]

Job Details
               Capital Southwest is a Dallas-based publicly traded business development company ("BDC"), with approximately $775 million in assets. On December 2, 2014, Capital Southwest announced its intent to separate into two public companies through the spin-off of certain of its assets into a diversified industrial growth company, CSWI, and to refocus the BDC on lending to strong middle market companies. As a result, Capital Southwest is currently active in the market executing its new investment strategy concentrating on investments ranging from $5 million to $20 million in senior "unitranche" debt, second lien and subordinated debt, as well as equity co-investments in support of the acquisition and growth of middle market companies. The control companies that will be contributed by Capital Southwest to CSWI in connection with the spin-off are actively seeking growth through add-on acquisitions. Since Capital Southwest's formation in 1961, it has always sought to invest in companies with strong management teams and sound financial performance. As a public company, Capital Southwest is fortunate to have the flexibility to be creative in its financing structures and to invest to support the growth of its portfolio companies over long periods of time.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

How the BuildZoom Score works








Follow this contractor

















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Texas:













Does Kelley Douglas M carry a valid contracting license?



Only certain types of specialty contractors (e.g. HVAC, electrical) need to be licensed in Texas. There are no licensing requirements when it comes to hiring for a construction or major remodeling project.
Kelley Douglas M currently holds license ME-30385 (Master Electrician, Me Master Electrician), which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Texas?



The Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation (TDLR) regulates HVAC and electrical contractors. You should verify their license status on the TDLR Website before hiring. General contractors and home builders are not licensed so you should do additional research before hiring one.











Your liability risk when hiring Kelley Douglas M



Although it isn't a regulatory requirement, you can ask your general contractor to provide evidence of workers' compensation and general liability insurance prior to hiring them. 











Financial recourse when hiring Kelley Douglas M



The Texas Department of Licensing Regulation does not require general contractors to carry a surety bond nor is there a state recovery fund.











What else should I know before hiring Kelley Douglas M



There is no financial or criminal background check performed on general contractors by the TDLR. The State's Department of Public Safety does maintain a publicly accessible database so you can run your own background check prior to hiring. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



The information on BuildZoom is made available as a public service and should not be considered advertising. We collect client feedback and verify contractors' permitted history with dozens of local building departments in Texas, which saves you time and helps minimize your risk when hiring. 











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The Texas Attorney General's office recommends getting several bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free).

In 1945, an improbable relationship between the fallen Reichsmarschall, Hermann Goering, and ambitious US Army physician, Douglas Kelley, becomes a hazardous quest into the nature of evil, amid the devastation of Europe at the end of World War II In 1945, after his capture at the end of the Second World War, Hermann Goring arrived at an American-run detention center in war-torn Luxembourg, accompanied by sixteen suitcases and a red hatbox. The suitcases contained all manner of paraphernalia: medals, gems, two cigar cutters, silk underwear, a hot water bottle, and the equivalent of $1 million in cash. Hidden in a coffee can, a set of brass vials housed glass capsules containing a clear liquid and a white precipitate: potassium cyanide. Joining Goring in the detention center were the elite of the captured Nazi regimeGrand Admiral Donitz; armed forces commander Wilhelm Keitel and his deputy Alfred Jodl; the mentally unstable Robert Ley; the suicidal Hans Frank; the pornographic propagandist Julius Streicherfifty-two senior Nazis in all, of whom the dominant figure was Goring. To ensure that the villainous captives were fit for trial at Nuremberg, the US army sent an ambitious army psychiatrist, Captain Douglas M. Kelley, to supervise their mental well-being during their detention. Kelley realized he was being offered the professional opportunity of a lifetime: to discover a distinguishing trait among these arch-criminals that would mark them as psychologically different from the rest of humanity. So began a remarkable relationship between Kelley and his captors, told here for the first time with unique access to Kelley s long-hidden papers and medical records. Kelley s was a hazardous quest, dangerous because against all his expectations he began to appreciate and understand some of the Nazi captives, none more so than the former Reichsmarshall, Hermann Goring.

This book was quick and interesting, but lacked a certain je ne sais quoi for me and, at times, felt a bit "forced" in its attempt to give the relationship between its two titular characters a causal weight in the events that eventually befell the Kelley family.Like 
Dr. Douglas M. Kelley
 (below), I am fascinated by the inner workings of the human mind. Likewise, the human capacity for evil revealed in criminology and the study of history (in particular the events of and surrounding WWII) capture my curiosity and desire to understand. Kelley and I are certainly not alone in this, and in the decades since WWII scholars from a variety of fields have sought to unravel the sociological, psychological and historical underpinnings of what happened. All of this is to say, that I did not find Dr. Kelley to as exceptional as the author may have intended.
That notable figures who work with notorious criminals are often somewhat egotistical is not surprising. John E. Douglas, the original "Mindhunter," is an example that stands out (see: 
Mindhunter: Inside the FBI's Elite Serial Crime Unit
). What author 
Jack El-Hai
 refers to as 
tele-empathy
, "the ability to feel what others are feeling and thinking" after carefully examining them" (p.201), seems like it would be requisite for the job. From studies such as the Milgram experiment and the Stanford Prison Study (both of which El-Hai refers to toward the end of the book), we have learned more about quotidian obedience to authority. Books such as Martha Stout's 
The Sociopath Next Door
 describe that individuals who completely lack conscience are by no means an anomaly. The most interesting pieces of information in re. the over-the-top character of 
Hermann Göring
, which are almost unfathomably bizarre (his extreme pill addiction, his letter writing campaign to President Truman regarding the inhumane conditions in which he was being kept, his obsession with wild animals etc.), were brushed over too quickly for my liking, in favor of Kelley's family history. 
While I enjoyed this book, I feel like it could have done more. Perhaps that was not the author's intention, but somehow the parallels between Göring and Kelley failed to draw me in as stories unto themselves. Furthermore, these characteristics seemed to me less exceptional, less notable than one might believe based on this material alone. Kelley told journalists that: 

"[Göring] is still the same swaggering, vain, conceited braggart he always was. He has made up his mind he's going to be killed anyway, so he's very anxious to be considered the number one Nazi, a curious kind of compensation" (p.116).

This desire to rise to the top (one that Kelley, apparently, shared with Göring) seemed, to me, unsurprising. It certainly didn't seem like a trait so noteworthy as to suggest that two men sharing it would somehow be distant reflections of one-another. I'll withhold the other "big" parallel as not to spoil anything, but I, again, thought it was a bit overstated...

	Dr. Douglas M. Kelley, who served as a psychiatrist for the U.S. Army in World War II, received an order to be the lead psychiatrist and work with the high level Nazis being detained for trial at Nuremberg after the war. He saw it as an opportunity to try to discern if there was there a common flaw among the Nazi leaders? “We must learn they why of the Nazi success so we can take steps to prevent the recurrence of such evil.” “What made these men criminals?” “Were they born with evil tendencies?” “Did they share psychiatric disorders?” “The trial and it run-up served as fascinating laboratories for the study of group dynamics of aggression, criminal motivation, defense mechanisms of the guilty, depression, and the response of deviant personalities to the judicial process.”	His conclusions are as relevant in the United States today, in 2013, as they were in 1947.	Hermann Göring, President of the Reichstag, Hitler’s deputy, Prime Minister of Prussia, Reich Minister of Aviation and Commander in Chief of the Luttwaffe, Minister of Economics, member of the Secret Cabinet Council, director of the Hermann Göring Works manufacturing combine, field marshal, chairman of the Reich Council for National Defense, Reich Forestry and Hunting Master, and Reichsmarshall, was the highest ranking Nazi in detention. After seeing the films taken when the concentration camps were liberated, he stated he didn’t know the extent of the atrocities committed against the victims and thought it was enemy propaganda. Until that point, he wanted all co-defendants to “defend themselves, be proud of their actions, and accept the punishment of the victors as a unified group.” At first, he told his fellows, to expected exile, then a group execution which “would grant them an afterlife as national martyrs.” Unlike the others, he didn’t blame Hitler or the Nazi regime. He considered himself a moving force in the Nazi movement.” Kelley spent a lot of time with Göring, admiring his intelligence but aware of his dark side. In a letter to his wife, Göring suggested that if both of them did not survive the war, their daughter should be sent to live in the US with Kelley and his wife. 	The first two pages of THE NAZI AND THE PSYCHIATRIST tell about the suicide of Dr. Kelley on January 1, 1958. The book then moves back to May 6, 1945. Realizing the war was soon ending, Göring sent a letter offering to help the Allies form a new government for the Reich. The Americans captured him but he didn’t get to meet with General Dwight Eisenhower or any other officials. Instead, he was taken into custody as a criminal for his crimes in World War II. At the time, he was addicted to paracodeine, taking forty pills a day. (Five tablets had the narcotic effect of 65 mg of morphine.) An army official found that “Göring’s hoard of [paracodeine] amounted to nearly the world’s entire supply.”	During the war, Kelley recognized “combat neurosis” and “combat exhaustion,” now referred to as PTSD, post-traumatic stress disorder and worked to rehabilitate soldiers and determine who could return to the battlefield or noncombatant duty and who should be returned the US for further treatment. In the early years of the war, only 2% of the its victims in the North Africa campaign could return to duty. After Kelley trained physicians in ways to treat it, more than 95% of the service personnel were able to do so. He was able to use some of techniques when he worked with the Nazi prisoners to help keep them fit for trial. He combined psychiatry with criminology and also developed group therapy as psychiatric tool. 	One of Kelley’s co-workers, Captain John Dolibois a welfare official helping detainees with their problems and listening to them observed “they spoke quite freely believing they would never face trial. We sometimes had trouble getting them to shut up. They felt neglected if they hadn’t been interrogated for a several days.” The psychological staff was able to easily get information where traditional interrogation methods failed. 		Relying heavily on The Rorschach or Ink Blot Test, he concluded,“These people without Hitler are not abnormal, not pervert[s], not geniuses. They were like any other aggressive, smart, ambitious, ruthless businessman, and their business happened in the setting up of a world government.” Others, working with him, particularly Lieutenant Gustave Mark Gilbert who held a PhD in psychology and wanted to gather information to write a book, came to a different conclusion. 	THE NAZI AND THE PSYCHIATRIST presents a detailed picture of the detainees lives before and after Nuremberg, a description of the courtroom itself, the reaction of the Nazis to the testimony and the verdicts, It also tells what happened to each prisoner after the trial. While most of the book deals with Hermann Göring and the relationship between him and Kelley , the book presents information about each of the main defendants, the men at the higher leadership roles in the Nazi regime. For example, Julius Streicher, editor of the exceedingly anti-Jewish Der Stürmer, was considered loathsome, a pariah among the other prisoners. He had a reputation as a sadist, rapist, and collector of pornography. Joachim von Ribbentrop, Hitler’s foreign minister, had only an elementary school education and had worked in the liquor business previously. Kelley questioned whether Hess’s amnesia was real, faked, or somewhere in between (had been faked then turned real) but was able to show he was capable to stand trial.	The book also states that Hitler had gastrointestinal disorders for more than twenty years though no organic cause was ever found by doctors. Because of that, he feared death and acted impulsively. He believed he had stomach cancer and “turned his attention from successful assaults on Great Britain to a campaign in the east that resulted in defeat.”	There were three suicides among the detainees, two by hanging before the trial and one, Göring’s by swallowing a cyanide capsule the night before he was to be hung.	After Kelley returned to the United States, Kelley was urged to write, but he wanted to get away from the detentions and trial. Eventually, did write about his experiences and examination as well as taught and trained law enforcement personnel. His family life was extremely complex with him alternating between kindness and vicious enforcer. He and his wife had major arguments and his children never knew how he would react to anything. He refused to see a psychiatrist because he didn’t want to appear weak before a peer since he was an expert in the field. He was excessively strict with his children, especially his oldest son, because he wanted to train him to not act like the Germans did. He was to be observant and analytical. His son began thinking of killing his father when he was seven years old.	Based on his interpretation of their psychological make-up and trying to answer his original questions about why the Nazis acted as they did, Kelley said. “Unbridled ambition, weak ethics, and excessive patriotism that could justify nearly any action of questionable rightness.” They were “Not monsters, evildoing machines, or automata without soul and feelings.”	He wrote 22 Cells “to influence the thinking of the American people and hoped readers would understand the qualities that allowed a group of men to dominate a country and let them believe they had the right to do so....That America could become Germany.”	Some of the Nazi prisoners compared Germany to the United States and it’s racial bigots and ultranationalists, such as white supremacists Senator Theodore Bilbo, Congressman John E. Rankin, Governor Eugene Talmadge and Huey Long. To prevent people with personalities similar to the Nazis from gaining control of the US, “Kelley advocated:	removing all restrictions on the voting rights of US citizens, convincing as many Americans as possible to vote in elections, and rebuilding the educational system to cultivate students who could think critically and resist using ‘strong emotional reactions’ to make decisions. Finally, he urged his countrymen to refuse to vote for any candidate who made ‘political capital’ of any group’s race and religious beliefs or referred indirectly or directly to the blood, heritage, or morals of opponents. ‘The United States [would] never reach its full stature’ until it has undergone this transformation	Near the end of the book, we read more of Dr. Kelley’s suicide, by cyanide capsule.	At the beginning, NAZI AND THE PSYCHIATRIST presents a list of the principle characters including their job titles. The final book will include eight pages of photos and a full bibliography which includes writings by both Dr. Kelley and Lieutenant Gilbert. 	I received an advance copy this book from Goodreads.com and am very glad I had the opportunity to read it. Kelley’s comments about preventing similar experiences in other countries, quoted above, echo strongly in the US political atmosphere today.

(nb: I received an Advanced Review Copy of this title from the publisher via NetGalley)Jack El-Hai’s latest book, “The Nazi and the Psychiatrist,” tells one of the lesser-known stories of post-World War 2: the psychological analysis of the infamous Nuremberg Trial defendants. It is a fascinating journey.The book follows Dr. Douglas M. Kelley, a celebrated Army psychiatrist. As a Captain serving in the European theater, he developed techniques that greatly slashed the detrimental effects of combat fatigue, enabling soldiers to return to their units mentally healthy and able to resume fighting. Always an intellectually curious man, Dr. Kelley was overjoyed to be reassigned to work with the surviving Nazi leaders.Kelley served as a regular physician as needed, but his specialty was analyzing the psychological fitness of these prisoners. Of particular interest to Kelley was Hermann Göring, Hitler’s Reichsmarschall and choice to take over Germany after his death.Dr. Kelley performed the psychological evaluations as required, but he went one step further. Under the guise of administering routine tests, Kelley dug deeper into his Nazi “patients,” trying to discover if there was some trait, some gene, some sort of special indicator that facilitated these men becoming Nazis.His findings may surprise you. So painstakingly thorough was his methodology, that much of Dr. Kelley’s research is still being analyzed over 60 years later.During his tenure at Nuremberg, Dr. Kelley developed close professional relationships with some of history’s most-feared men. The sheer normalcy, even collegiality, with which Kelley and Göring interacted was especially unexpected: the guy who created the Luftwaffe could be charming, intelligent, and even funny.Naturally, most of “The Nazi and the Psychiatrist” focuses on this period in Dr. Kelley’s life. However, he was definitely not an ordinary Army doctor. Kelley came from an intellectually driven background, where mental discipline and broad curiosity were taught from a young age. After he left the Army, Kelley took a while to find his bearings, eventually settling at his alma mater, UC Berkeley, where he was the star professor in the school’s new criminology program.In addition to teaching, Kelley served as a consultant to numerous law enforcement agencies, TV shows, even Hollywood movies.As his professional life became more hectic, life at home with his wife and three kids began to suffer. And we are left to wonder if there might be a touch of psychosis in the psychiatrist.“The Nazi and the Psychiatrist” is a fascinating book—with a promising title like that, how could it not be? One risk with historical treatises is that the author sometimes over-reaches, padding what could be an interesting story with endless, dry recitation of facts.Happily, “The Nazi and the Psychiatrist” avoids this pitfall beautifully. Author Jack El-Hai presents plenty of information; indeed, I came away with a new understanding of both behavioral psychology and psychiatry, as well as the Nuremberg Trials. What El-Hai does so well is keep the story moving. No single part of the story bogs down in minutiae. He presents all manner of salient facts and details, but he does a wonderful job editing.As the title suggests, at the core is the relationship between a Nazi (Göring) and psychiatrist Kelley. The pre-War and post-War life of Dr. Douglas Kelley bookends his Nuremberg experiences, and this information is crucial. Also, we go inside the Nuremberg Trials, even after Dr. Kelley had returned stateside. This, too, is critical.The resulting book is a gripping, informative, oddly bittersweet account of two men, and how their extraordinary lives came tangent to one another for a brief moment in time. It is most definitely a story worth reading. That it’s true makes it all the more compelling.Highly Recommended

For more than seven decades, we've been trying to understand the nature of the Nazi mind.

For more than seven decades, we've been trying to understand the nature of the Nazi mind. Was there something uniquely psychopathic about them, or could their horrors be wreaked by any country's leaders and citizens?One of the first people to get an opportunity to try to answer this question was Captain Douglas M. Kelley, a 32-year-old psychiatrist in the U.S. Army medical service, who was assigned to attend to the 22 top Nazi defendants being held in Nüremberg, Germany, in the months before their trial began for crimes against humanity. Kelley spent long hours talking to the defendants and administering what were then relatively new psychiatric tests, like Rorschach ink blot testing and Thematic Apperception Tests.Among the Nazi bigwigs Kelley was responsible for, the top patient was Hermann Göring, former head of the Luftwaffe and Hitler's one-time designated successor. Göring's huge personality and appetites were like a tractor beam for Kelley. He was charming, intelligent and quick-witted, but it soon became clear that he had no regard for anyone outside his small circle of family and close friends.As the book description tells us, Göring managed to kill himself with a cyanide capsule in his cell the night before he was scheduled to be hanged. Twelve years later, Kelley also killed himself with cyanide, after a long slide into emotional illness and alcoholism. The book description concludes that Kelley's suicide shows "the insidious impact of the Göring-Kelley relationship, providing a cautionary tale about the dangers of coming too close to evil."I think the book description is misleading. Author Jack El-Hai does not try to make an argument that Kelley's exposure to Göring and the other Nazis somehow tainted him and led to his suicide. He does argue that there are some similarities between Göring's and Kelley's motivations for suicide and for choosing cyanide as a method, but that's the extent of it.The value of this book is not in some sensationalistic link between Göring and Kelley. Instead, the real value is the inside look at the minds of these Nazi leaders and how they revealed themselves to Kelley, whom many of them came to trust. El-Hai writes a great deal about Göring, but there is also extensive and valuable discussion of Rudolf Hess, Alfred Rosenberg, Robert Ley, Joachim von Ribbentrop, Julius Streicher and others. This should be of interest to many history readers, especially those who enjoyed books like Anthony Read's The Devil's Disciples: Hitler's Inner Circle.Secondarily, El-Hai gives us an insightful look at the early days of criminal psychology and psychiatric testing. Kelley was active in both fields, including in the years after Nüremberg, when he lectured and consulted, was a professor of psychiatry at Wake Forest University and, in 1949, became the first head of the newly-established department of criminology at the University of California at Berkeley. Many of the concepts we take for granted today were in their infancy during this period, and El-Hai provides a clear and interesting view of what the field was like at that time.Finally, El-Hai provides a fascinating description of various analysts' views of Kelley's records of the psychoanalytic tests of the Nazi defendants, and their debates about what they revealed about the Nazi psyche.Rights to The Nazi and the Psychiatrist have been optioned to turn it into both a film and a stage play. I suspect in both cases, the hook will be the same sensationalistic one as in the book description. While that may make a good selling strategy, I hope people will read and appreciate the book for its actual content.

Çok iyi bir kitap daha, bir gazeteci tarafından yazılmış, edebi derinlik beklemeden okunmalı. Nürnberg Mahkemesi'nde yargılanan üst düzey Nazi yöneticilerini ( Görring, Hess, Dönitz vd) yakından izleme ve inceleme fırsatı bulmuş Amerikalı psikiyatrist Dr Kelley'in bulgular ile vardığı sonuçlar uzun uzun anlatılmış. Bu arada aynı görevi yapan psikolog Gilbert'in vardığı sonuçlar çok farklı. Kitabı iki yönüyle okumak gerekli. İlki Dr Kelley'in kişiliğini ve hayatını öğrenme, ikincisi Kelly ve Gilbert arasındaki görüş farklılığındaki doğru tarafı bulmak için düşünmek. Yazar ise tamamen farklı niyetle yazmış kitabı, o Görring'in Dr Kelley'i etkilediğini hatta tamamiyle ele geçirmiş olduğunu vurguluyor. Ayrıca bu 22 üst düzey nazi yöneticisinin, insan kasaplarının kişilikleri hakkında daha ayrıntılı bilgi edinmek de kitabın bir başka artı yönü. Dr Kelley Nazi'lerin de bizler gibi normal isanlar olduğunu ancak çok rahatça güç, otorite, hükmetme vb isteklere evet demelerini ve hedefe ulaşmak için son derece egoist ve duyarsız olduklarını söyleyerek bu durumun her ülkedeki insanlar için de geçeli olabileceğini, ABD'de fırsat çıktığında ırkçılık ve milliyetçi duyguların faşist yönetici profillerini kolayca yaratabileceğini ileri sürmekte. Bugünkü Amerika ve Trumph'ı düşünürsek hiç haksız değil. Gilbert ise Nazi'lerin psikopat olduklarını ruhsal problemi oan insanlar olduklarını onları bizler gibi normal kabul etmenin yanlş olduğunu savunuyor. Yani LePen, Willers,Putin, Saddam, Kaddafi vb liderlerin normal olmadıklarını psikopat olduklarını ileri sürüyor. O da haksız sayılmaz. En iyisi kitabı okuyun kendi kararınızı kendiniz verin.

From a historical perspective, this is a hugely informative and compelling book. Unfortunately, it's greatest weakness is that it features very little of the actual conversations between Dr. Kelley and Hermann Goering. Their face-to-face should have been the most riveting delivery of the premise of the book. I suspect those possibilities are why this book was optioned for a movie adaptation before it was even published.

It is about a young US Army psychiatrist who was assigned to the supervise the mental health of key Nazi leaders during their incartitation leading up to their war crime trials in Nuremberg. Much of the story is based on the doctor's own notes as he interviewed such leaders as Hermann Goring, Admiral Donitz, Alfred Jodl among others. Although the book concentrates mostly on these post war interviews, it continues to follow the professional career of the psychiatrist after he left the Army and became a well known criminal psychiatrist working with many police departments and lecturing at universities around the US. However, the most interesting passages that appeared throughout the book related to the interviews with Goring, probably one of the more "colorful" and complicated prisoners who, for the most part, opened up about his wartime activities and his views as to why he felt "justified" in his role as a close follower of Hitler.

At times it is unclear whether this is a biography of Goring or Kelley or an academic contribution to the aforementioned debate. However, as one gets engrossed in the story, it hardly seems to matter that it doesn't necessarily have a defined goal beyond the storytelling itself.I would certainly recommend this to anyone interested in the history of WW2 or psychiatry in the 20th century. Overall, it is an enjoyable and fascinating read.*Disclosure - I received a free ARC copy of this book through Goodreads First Reads.

Ciekawa historia pracy amerykańskiego psychiatry i psychologia (-ów) z nazistami przed i w trakcie procesu w Norymberdze i ciekawe wnioski prowadzące do znanej tezy o banalności zła. Ciekawe (nie przesadnie) dzieje tytułowego bohatera po powrocie do Stanów a szczególnie tego jak skończył. Ale poza tym książka zawodzi. Przez cały czas budowane jest napięcie sugerujące jakiś szczególny związek między psychiatrą a Göringiem, którego konsekwencją będzie dramatyczna kulminacja. Jest rzeczywiście dość dramatyczna kulminacja, jest akcesorium łączące tę kulminację z wydarzeniami w Norymberdze... Ale nie ma w tym wszystkim za grosz sensu. Nie ma żadnego sznurka, który by wiązał te luźne fakty w jakąś tezę. W największym skrócie: dowiadujemy się, że naziści nie byli wariatami, ale nie można tego z całą pewnością wykluczyć; że badający ich psychiatra w pewnym momencie zwariował albo nie zwariował; że był tyranem dla swojej rodziny albo tylko bardzo ambitnym ojcem i że wynikało to z jego pracy z nazistami albo z czegoś zupełnie innego. Całość podlana językiem sensacyjnego reportażu, w którym ostatecznie nic sensacyjnego się nie dzieje. Z dużej chmury - mały deszcz.

I don't read as many nonfiction books as I often find them to be dull, dry books filled with recitation of dates and names but little story. The best nonfiction history books, for me, are those that read more like a novel. This one mostly succeeds at doing that. I would probably rate it at about 4.5 stars.Many reviewers have complained that this book is too long. I disagree. If anything, I wanted more. I am sure there is so much more story to mine and I would have loved to know more about Dr Kelley's interactions with the Nazis -- particularly Hermann Goring.It is an excellent story of the intersection of these two extraordinary men's lives for a brief moment of time -- and how one influenced the other for many years after. It is a glimpse into the things that occurred post-WWII with the Nazis who remained alive. We see the arrogance when learning about the expectations they had regarding their treatment by the Allies. We see the desire to learn what made a Nazi a Nazi. And we see something we might call PTSD today affecting the doctor for the remainder of his life.This book is excellent -- informative, compelling and absorbing. It reads quickly.

An interesting book about a young American psychiatrist and his interactions with Nazi war criminals at Nuremberg. Goering is his main focus of attention but there are others, including Hess, who he tests and interviews.I thought the book would end with either the end of the psychiatrist's stint working there or perhaps the sentencing and execution of these Nazis but I was wrong. The story continues with what happened later in the psychiatrist's personal life which was quite shocking.

The Nazi and the Psy­chi­a­trist: Her­mann Göring, Dr. Dou­glas M. Kel­ley, and a Fatal Meet­ing of Minds at the End of WWII by Jack El-Hai is a non-fiction book about the doc­tor and his inter­ac­tion with the war criminals.This is a good book, but it is not the book I thought it would be. In my head I was imag­in­ing Göring on the prover­bial couch, or sit­ting across from Dr. Kel­ley engag­ing in war of the minds. What I got was a study by Dr. Kel­ley of what is con­sid­ered evil using the Nurem­berg tri­als as a laboratory.Dr. Kel­ley jumped on the oppor­tu­nity to diag­nose the Nazi mind­set, to find out what made these peo­ple tick, how could they mur­der mil­lions (includ­ing their own peo­ple), what was their defense mech­a­nisms and jus­ti­fi­ca­tions that allowed them to live with­out guilt or remorse.Inter­est­ing ques­tions indeed!Göring, the high­est rank­ing Nazi being tried, was con­vinced that he will be set free, arriv­ing to his incar­na­tion with16 suit­cases, one filled with valu­ables. As a for­mer head of state he fig­ured that the trial was just vic­tors’ pro­pa­ganda. When con­fronted with evi­dence of con­cen­tra­tion camps and Nazi mur­ders he claimed that he didn’t know what was happening.Dr. Kel­ley admits that Göring is a charis­matic per­son­al­ity and the two got along very well. Along with Göring, the book also talks a lot about Hess who is pre­sented as an unsta­ble per­son who might, or might not, be able to stand trial.The book also talks a great deal about the Rorschach tests and Dr. Kelley’s inter­pre­ta­tion of the pris­on­ers’ answers and extrap­o­lated their mean­ings. Since Dr. Kel­ley worked through an inter­preter, the results of the tests were still being eval­u­ated half a cen­tury later.Upon his return to the US Dr. Kel­ley set­tled into a fam­ily life and became a noted psy­chi­a­trist spe­cial­iz­ing in foren­sics. Dr. Kel­ley taught at top schools, researched and worked with police all over the coun­try. In an ironic twist, Dr. Kel­ley was caught in his own night­mar­ish exis­tence (by his own mak­ing) and com­mit­ted sui­cide the same way Göring did before him.The con­clu­sions Dr. Kelly made are fright­en­ing and still rel­e­vant to this day. In his writ­ings, Dr. Kel­ley stated that there was noth­ing “spe­cial” about these top Nazis and their per­son­al­i­ties, what hap­pened dur­ing Germany’s Third Reich could hap­pen in any coun­try.While I found the premise of the book to be fas­ci­nat­ing, I didn’t feel the nar­ra­tive came together once the Nurem­berg tri­als were over. This book could is actu­ally more of a biog­ra­phy of Dr. Kel­ley than his inter­ac­tion with his infa­mous clients.For more reviews and bookish posts please visit: http://www.ManOfLaBook.com

De mannen waren verantwoordelijk voor hun eigen daden en zeer goed in staat om goed en slecht van elkaar te onderscheiden.

"Hun karaktertrekken zijn zo gewoon dat, hoewel ze niet sociaal wenselijk gedrag vertonen, mannen die op hen lijken ook in Amerika te vinden zijn".Hij ontdekte wel sporen van neurosen, vaker voorkomend, die hun wreedheden konden vergroten.De rorschachtest zou de rorschachtest niet zijn, als ze niet tot een controverse zou leiden. Was de rorschachtest wel het middel om de nazi's van de gewone mens te onderscheiden?Er ontstaan twee kampen, mensen die het met Kelley eens waren en zij die meenden dat er wel een gemeenschappelijk persoonlijkheidsprofiel was (psychopaat met een beperkt vermogen om schuld te voeren en om zich te hechten aan andere mensen. Hun kwaadaardig eigenbelang dreef hun gedrag)Een latere en omvangrijke evaluatie van de rorschachresultaten van de nazi's (1995, Zillmer et al) gaf aan dat het onmogelijk was om enkel op basis van deze resultaten de nazi's onder te brengen in een bepaalde psychologische groep.

All of the leaders were interviewed: Goering, Speer, Jodl, Hess, Keitel, Rosenberg, Streicher, Raedar, Donitz, Frank, etc. At that time the thought was that these leaders suffered from some type of abnormal behavior, perhaps even psycho or sociopaths. No one wanted to hear that perhaps these leaders were narcissistic but otherwise normal people caught up in status, power struggles and needs not unlike many people we see today. This story hasn't really been told and is focused on Dr. Kelley's personal struggle with his work with Herman Goering, his own past and what he discovered. Any students of psychology, philosophy or sociology should read this book - what are 'normal' humans really capable of?? This quote should intrigue you to read this book. It does not give anything away about the deeper story:"Kelley knew that the Nazis had committed atrocities and crimes of war on an unprecedented scale. Even the German leaders were surprised to realize what they had done and where they had ended up. But men whose personalities fell within normal parameters had set in motion the Nazi outrages, making Kelley worry that they could happen again. “With the exception of Dr. Ley, there wasn’t an insane Joe in the crowd,” he told a reporter for the New Yorker. The leaders “were not special types,” he wrote. “Their personality patterns indicate that, while they are not socially desirable individuals, their like could very easily be found in America” or elsewhere. Consequently, he feared that holocausts and crimes against humanity could be repeated by psychologically similar perpetrators."

Jack El-​Hai's book, "​​The Nazi and the Psychiatrist"​, tells the story of an Army Psychiatrist, Dr. Douglas Kelley, who interviewed ​Hermann Goering and ​the ​other ​top surviving Nazi leaders after World War II as they were preparing to face charges in the N​uremburg Trials. ​ His objective was to determine if there was a particular trait, characteristic, or psychiatric condition that caused or allowed those men to oversee so many atrocities to occur under their leadership. After numerous interviews and tests, Dr. Kelley came to conclude that there was nothing particularly abnormal about these men. The uncomfortable result of this conclusion is that the capability to perform similar atrocities was not unique to the Nazi Party or German people, but can exist anywhere. People can be incited to acts of cruelty by propaganda, scare tactics, repeated lies, and distrust of 'others', and when leaders exhibit these characteristics, it should be a red flag to all citizens capable of critical thinking and independent thought to beware. After the Nuremberg Trials, Dr. Kelley returned to private life, and continued his practice and a lecturer, writer, psychiatrist, consultant, criminologist, teacher, and family man. Unfortunately for Dr. Ryan and his family, the stresses of his life brought out his darker side, and led to an unfortunate and unhappy life. Two points st​uck with me upon completing Jack El-​Hai's book:(1) that even highly regarded psychologists who spend their time helping others overcome their stresses and problems are not immune from suffering from similar afflictions; and (2) the capability to inflict injury or death on others is a trait of homo sapiens which can surface in any of us unless guarded against.

You can't go wrong in writing about Hermann Goring and the psychiatrist who treated him while he was awaiting trial at Nuremberg, Douglas M. Kelley. While most of the world has heard of Goring, few know about Kelley and what a fascinating character he is. This book's strengths are the beginning and the end. I enjoyed learning about Kelley and his colorful family background. I also enjoyed getting to know him as he began his work at the Nuremberg jail. The end of the book lets us see how Kelley adjusted (or really, didn't adjust) to life after the war. We're left with a big cliffhanger at the beginning that is not resolved until the very end, but frankly, it kept me reading.I thought the middle was not as strong. El-Hai spends quite a bit of time recounting the Nuremberg Trials. At this point, Kelley had gone home, his work with the defendants completed. I just feel that I can read about the Nuremberg Trials anywhere; I would have preferred to read more about Kelley. He's such a rich character; I think more could have been done to plumb those depths. For example, we get one paragraph on a major rift between Kelley and a psychologist he worked with at Nuremberg. It seemed like a major conflict that could have had more attention.This book is many things: a biography of Kelley, a history of the Nuremberg trials, a small biography of Goring, and an analysis into the "Nazi mind" and what Kelley's tests may have revealed. In a way, it feels a little too stratified to me.That being said, this is a well-written book about a fascinating topic. It won the 2014 Minnesota Book Award for general nonfiction, and deservedly so.

This excellent book was at times a very chilling experience, with implications on the 2016 US presidential election, and reflecting some occurrences in America's own past.Grasping to find psychological disorder common to all of the Nazi prisoners at Nuremberg, Dr. Douglas Kelley concludes that they share few similarities and are not different enough from ourselves to be comforting. Fearing that a Hitler-like mind could appear again--even in America-- Kelley struggled to cope with the possibility. Finding his subjects, at most, sociopaths, and at least, ambitious, it is easy to understand how someone could rise to lead--and others to willingly be led--down such a terrible path again. When Kelley suggested to Hermann Göring that Americans saw all Nazi officials as Hitler's yes-men, Göring replied, "That may well be, but please show me a 'no-man' in Germany who is not six feet underground today." Say no to the wrong person and, whoever you are, you're dead, and there was always someone more than willing to step up and take your place.In many ways, Göring appeared to be a loving father and husband. Who would not submit, for self-preservation (or the welfare of their family, their neighbors, or their country), to awful orders and hide in the recesses of their brain any terrible consequences for others?

I am fascinated with the Nazis and found this book had some interesting information but was often quite boring.I liked this quote on pages 67 and 68.

There were also the salesmen . . . who sold Hitler's ideas to the world . . . Altogether the captive Nazi leaders constituted a "board of directors" of their defeated regime, a ruling group that had run a nation but frequently had little contact with one another.Yet unlike any corporate board of directors, this one had unleashed six years of war upon the world, cynically disregarded treaties and international agreements, wiped out countless communities of innocent people, enslaved millions, concentrated additional millions in camps designed to murder them efficiently, and legalized racism and terror. What made these men criminals? Did they grasp at opportunities that could tempt many of us? Were they born with evil tendencies? Did they share psychiatric disorders--a type of "Nazi mind"--that could account for their behavior?"

This is essentially a biography of Douglass Kelley, an American who becomes an army psychiatrist and is serendipitously assigned to evaluate the 22 Nazis who were to stand trial at Nuremberg. There were two intriguing aspects in the book. One is Kelley’s quest to try to understand the Nazi mind (something that perhaps all of us have wondered about).

This is essentially a biography of Douglass Kelley, an American who becomes an army psychiatrist and is serendipitously assigned to evaluate the 22 Nazis who were to stand trial at Nuremberg. There were two intriguing aspects in the book. One is Kelley’s quest to try to understand the Nazi mind (something that perhaps all of us have wondered about). Why did they do it, and could it happen again, even in our own country? There was never a deeply satisfying answer to this question. A part of us wants to believe the Nazis were psychopaths, and completely unlike us. Kelley concluded that they were mostly “normal” folks but highly driven, much like a corporate CEO or other ambitious capitalist. And he thought it could happen again, right under our noses. The second intrigue was the eccentric Herman Goering. Kelley developed a close relationship with him and the reader is left to wonder what influence Goering might have had on Kelley. Like Goering, Kelley was a bit of a showman and eventually, like Goering, committed suicide with cyanide. But as it turned out, the Nazi was far more interesting than the Psychiatrist, and the book peters out after Kelley leaves Germany. It was still a very interesting read, even a gripping read, but I was left with the same haunting question I had when I started—how could it have happened?

Más que un libro, es un documental de la vida del psiquiatra que estuvo en la prisión de Nuremberg con las cabezas Nazi (Göring sobretodo) con el objetivo de determinar si estaban aptos para juicio y con el objetivo personal de averiguar si existía una "mentalidad nazi", un patrón de personalidad entre las cabecillas que haya asegurado el Holocausto.

Como puntos a favor están la historia y la documentación del libro y como punto en contra que el autor alarga el libro con detalles de la vida personal de Kelley que no aportan mucho a la historia. Igual es un libro altamente recomendable.

I received an advanced readers copy of this book through Goodreads. As I am an avid reader of anything related to WW11 I had very high expectations that came just short of being met. The topic was interesting and of great historical significance and the writing style easy to read however the layout of the story seemed to lack focus. I feel the last chapter was not necessary as well as some of the descriptive parts regarding Kelley's family history. Nonetheless I did enjoy this read.

        it was amazing



I grew up watching documentaries about WWII. The Nazi leaders strutted around in striking uniforms designed to intimidate.This book is about after the war, about after those leaders were captured and incarcerated and examined psychologically. So, through this book we learn what these men were really like, particularly Goering.The uncomfortable conclusion is that, under the right circumstances, anyone could behave as badly as the Nazis did. A chilling conclusion.

I read an Advanced Readers Copy of this book thanks to a Goodreads First Reads draw. I found this book to be very well written. El-Hai writes with intelligence that is always accessible & a sensitivity that is never sensationalistic. He doesn't speculate, dramatize or demonize (to his credit) but his narrative is certainly not dry. You won't come away with any clearer idea about what motivates a man like Goring, but it is definitely a book well worth reading.

A variety of perspectives on the top leaders of the Nazi Regime at the end of WWII and the influence these men held over themselves and other. The idea that the Nazis may have shared similar traits and acted this way because of those traits was an interesting concept as well as the downfall of these men.

Weird and twisted and not what I expected. I guess I felt like the author editorialized on what and how he presented the information a little too much, just to tell the story he wanted to the reader to see. Still an interesting read though.

The florid prose and unremarkable conclusions did not impress me. The melodramatic and cliched description of the psychiatrist's final act sealed my opinion of this text--- thin and shallow.

Following Germany's surrender at the end of World War II, American psychiatrist Douglas Kelley accepted a military assignment to become familiar with, study, and otherwise mentally examine the surviving high-ranking Nazi officials leading up to the Nuremberg Trials. His hope was to identify a common personality trait or defect which would assist in explaining their willing participation in the inhuman atrocities that took place.Kelley's notes reveal fascinating and shocking insights into the psyches and motivations of these famous prisoners, including Göring, Hess, Rosenberg, Streicher, et al, in ways generally excluded from history textbooks. Several of the top officials, including Göring himself, admitted openly that they didn't even sincerely believe that Jews were inferior, but rather were merely a convenient means of inciting fear and anger among the rest of the German population.A few passages of note, some chillingly relevant in today's political climate:* Kelley: "I was more than casually interested as a psychiatrist to find in Rosenberg an individual who had developed a system of thought differing greatly from known fact, who absolutely refused to amend his theories, and who, moreover, firmly believed in the magic of the words in which he had expressed them."* Hess had founded an alternative-medicine hospital that bore his name, "where the only requirement was that men practicing there could not be medical doctors," Kelley reported.* The anti-Semitism of the Nazis stuck Göring as useful bait for potential adherents with gripes more emotionally rooted than the mere imposition of an offensive peace treaty.* Kelley: "They are people who exist in every country of the world. Their personality patterns are not obscure. But they are people who have peculiar drives, people who want to be in power, and you say that they don't exist here, and I would say that I am quite certain that there are people even in America who would willingly climb over the corpses of half of the American public if they could gain control of the other half..."Minnesota Book Award finalist, 2014

“Paranoiac people suffer from megalomania, a need to dominate others, feelings of persecution, and a compulsion to falsify the past to fit their view of the world. Fascism, aggression, and anti-Semitism, then, were only symptoms of what ailed Nazi Germany.”
