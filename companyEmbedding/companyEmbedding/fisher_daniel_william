Description by OLDIES.com:

Nancy Archer is beautiful, wealthy -- the kind of woman who has it all, and she's had it up to here! Her mean-spiriting father wants control of her business, and Harry, her cheating husband, only want her for her money. Nancy wants to fight back, but she lacks the confidence, until the night she runs into an alien spaceship. At first, no one believes her crazy story; in fact, Harry sees it as the perfect opportunity to have his wife certified insane. But something has happened to Nancy since her alien encounter. Nancy never used to have a weight problem -- but overnight she's literally as big as a house. Nancy has grown to fifty feet tall -- and suddenly she sees the men in her life from a new angle: looking down on them!

 Vibration MonitoringPrevents $250,000 Incidentat Braskem »Even the best-maintained equipment can surprise plant operators with an unexpected breakdown, but as engineers at Braskem’s PP4 polypropylene unit in São Paulo, Brazil recently confirmed, if an incipient fault is detected early enough and monitored carefully, a potential catastrophic failure can be turned into a scheduled, routine repair.
​










 Changing of the Guard inNuclear PressureTransmitting »After 14 years of development and testing, Emerson is seamlessly transitioning its legendary, 40-year-old Rosemount 1150 Series of nuclear-qualified pressure transmitters to its new 3150 Series.
​










Refinery Improves Compliance & Reduces Costs with Wireless »Measurement Solutions Cut Green House Gas Compliance Costs by Half »Control-Disk™ Butterfly Valves Enable Throttling Control in Rolled-Steel Cooling System »













 Ergon’s Mobile WorkersEmbrace Wireless Freedom »Wouldn’t it be nice to get off the walkie-talkies and bring your control-room interfaces right out to where your process applications are running? You could get off the radios, stop playing telephone tag with coworkers, punch changes into the system directly and see orders carried out seamlessly. It’d be even better for configuration and turnaround work, and you’d probably save a bunch of time and money, too.










 Role of Fired HeaterSafety Systems »A fully automated burner management system operating as an SIS for burner control can meet minimum safety targets, improve system availability and lower costs.

        Daniel William Fisher fined $25,000, stripped of trading rights for 15 years
    



98/36

September 25, 1998

    Released: September 22, 1998  Contact: Michael Bernard  899-6500 or (BC only) 1-800-373-6393
Vancouver -- The president and sole director of a company who sold shares in the company without being registered or filing a prospectus has been fined $25,000 and stripped of his trading rights for 15 years by the British Columbia Securities Commission.
In a decision released recently, a Commission panel also prohibited Daniel William Fisher from acting as a director or officer of any company or engaging in investor relations activities for 15 years and ordered him to pay the costs of the hearing.
The panel was told Fisher was sole shareholder, director and president of Western Horizontal Drilling Inc., a company in the business of purchasing interests in oil and gas leases and then selling fractions of those interests to investors.
One of the leases in which WHD held an interest was a well in Texas called Johnson No. 2. Between December 1990 and November 1991, WHD sold fractional interests in the well to 28 investors, 24 of them B.C. residents.
Fisher placed advertisements in The Province and Vancouver Sun newspapers to promote the scheme. One of the ads promised a 700 percent return on invested capital in less than 80 days and claimed a 1990 track record of seven wells averaging 800 barrels of oil a day.
"Fisher was the directing mind of WHD and must be held responsible for the company’s complete disregard for the requirements of the (Securities) Act," the Commission panel said. "He dealt with the investors who purchased WHD’s securities and he caused the company to place advertisements respecting its securities that contained blatant misrepresentations, including ludicrous projected rates of return.
"As a result of Fisher’s actions, 28 investors lost between $300,000 and $400,000 US and the capital market in British Columbia was brought into disrepute."
The British Columbia Securities Commission is a provincial government agency responsible for regulating trading in securities and exchange contracts.
Copies of the Commission decision (6 pages) may be obtained in person at #200-865 Hornby Street, Vancouver, British Columbia.
The decision can also be accessed through the British Columbia Securities Commission website address: http://www.bcsc.bc.ca.

                                10-position all-numeric identification number assigned by the NPS to uniquely identify a health care provider.

                                Code describing the type of health care provider that is being assigned an NPI. Codes are:

1 = (Person): individual human being who furnishes health care;
2 = (Non-person): entity other than an individual human being that furnishes health care (for example, hospital, SNF, hospital subunit, pharmacy, or HMO).





                                Is Sole Proprietor
                            

                                N
                            

                                Indicate whether provider is a sole proprietor.

A sole proprietor is the sole (the only) owner of a business that is not incorporated; that unincorporated business is a sole proprietorship.
In a sole proprietorship, the sole proprietor owns all of the assets of the business and is solely liable for all of the debts of the business.
There is no difference between a sole proprietorship and a sole proprietor; they are legally a single entity: an individual.
In terms of NPI assignment, a sole proprietor is an Entity type 1 (Individual) and is eligible for only one NPI (the sole proprietorship business is not eligible for its own NPI).
As an individual, a sole proprietorship cannot be a subpart and cannot have subparts. (See NPI Final Rule for information about subparts.)
A sole proprietorship may or may not have employees.
Often, the IRS assigns an EIN to a sole proprietorship in order to protect the sole proprietor's SSN from disclosure in claims or on W-2s. NPPES does not capture a sole proprietorship's EIN.
Many types of health care providers could be sole proprietorships (for example, group practices, pharmacies, home health agencies).

                                The last name of the provider (if an individual). If the provider is an individual, this is the legal name. This name must match the name on file with the Social Security Administration (SSA). In addition, the date of birth must match that on file with SSA.
