ABOUT POLARIS: GLOBAL VALUE INVESTING


For 25+ years, we have been steadfast in our belief that a global value investing strategy achieves top risk-adjusted returns. The proof is in our benchmark-beating performance.



LENGTHY TRACK RECORD: We have one of the longest global and international track records of any firm presently in operation and continuously managed by the same individuals.




VALUE-ORIENTED: An unwavering commitment to pure global value investing — time-tested over nearly three decades — has been the key to our success and that of our clients. We seek to build value portfolios that can achieve higher than benchmark returns with below market risk.




GLOBAL DIVERSIFICATION: We have a disciplined approach to global value investing, with the flexibility to invest in companies in any country (developed or emerging), industry or market capitalization. Diversification extends to more than 15 industry groups and 15 countries.




FUNDAMENTAL STOCK PICKING: We conduct bottom-up stock selection, which results in holdings that are considered the most undervalued in the world pursuant to our valuation criteria. In addition to financial analysis, our seven-member research team assesses industry conditions, competitors and company management.




INVESTED ALONGSIDE OUR CLIENTS: Our personnel, from portfolio managers to analysts to relationship managers to client service, have invested a significant amount of their personal assets in the funds we manage or subadvise.

GLOBAL CONCENTRATED


 A benchmark agnostic diversified “best ideas” global concentrated portfolio of approximately 30-40 fundamentally-strong stocks deemed substantially undervalued. 

The global concentrated portfolio is based off of our global multi-cap product strategy. The 30-40 stock portfolio is comprised of our “best ideas”, pinpointing stocks that we view to be substantially undervalued with very strong market projections. After completing a thorough stock screening, we then conduct extensive fundamental research to identify undervalued companies with solid business models. Frequently, we find timely buying opportunities when companies retain their fundamental strengths (i.e. market share gains, intellectual property, healthy product pipeline, good free cash flows, clean balance sheets) but experience stock price declines when investors react to short-term negative news. 
In addition to pure financial analysis of a stock prospect, our research team triangulates, looking at industry trends, pinpointing market share prospects and speaking with competitors, suppliers and customers. We believe it is very important to collect as much primary source information as possible from each of these sources and assimilate this information to form more general views about the company, industry, global economics, and final stock selection. Only then are companies chosen for the global concentrated portfolio.  Although defined as a “concentrated” mandate, the portfolio is typically well diversified across country (both developed and emerging), industry and market capitalization.

INVESTMENT STRATEGY


We have the flexibility to invest in any country, industry or market cap with only one rule: find the most undervalued companies with the strongest business fundamentals.
ALL CAPITALIZATION: We employ an unconstrained pure value equity selection process that is characterized as an active, all-capitalization (multi-cap) global investment strategy. Portfolio construction attempts to balance the capitalization ranges subject to the firm’s value discipline.  
GLOBAL DIVERSIFICATION: Global portfolios hold what we consider to be the most undervalued companies in the world, regardless of region or sector. We also have the flexibility to invest in emerging markets, providing an additional avenue for exposure to some of the world’s fastest growing economies. We conduct bottom-up stock selection, which results in portfolio weightings across industry, country and market capitalization that are a function of the companies we identified as the most undervalued in the world.  We have focused on global diversification, ensuring that our portfolios have investments in at least 15 different countries and industry groups. 
VALUE ORIENTATION: The investment strategy strongly emphasizes valuation over growth.  Committed to our global diversification mandate, the companies that typically enter the portfolios come from both developed and emerging markets, with two common elements: the companies generate strong sustainable free cash flows and have conservative balance sheets. These companies may be capable of growing stronger in difficult economic environments, while performing admirably in growth cycles too.  We like the growth potential, but don’t want to pay for it.

INTERNATIONAL SMALL CAP


We mine for gems in the lesser-known small cap universe, offering investors an approximate 60 to 80 stock portfolio of some of the world’s best smaller companies. 
The Polaris investment philosophy holds true for the international small cap portfolio, as we seek undervalued companies with strong fundamentals — only diverging due to market cap. However, this is far from a limitation as there is an ever increasing number of small cap companies entering global stock markets. When investing in a new security for an international small cap portfolio, we seek to purchase companies with a market cap greater than $50 million and less than $2 billion.  After the initial purchase of a security, its market capitalization may fall below $50 million or appreciate to greater than $2 billion.  There is no formal guideline for minimum or maximum market cap of any one security in the portfolio. 
The 60 to 80 stock portfolio has always been well diversified with investments in at least 15 different industry groups and countries.  The industry/sector/country exposure changes gradually over time as a function of which small cap stocks are the most undervalued in the world at a given period.  We are mindful of emerging market exposure, looking to limit investment in these markets to no more than 35% of the small cap portfolio.
