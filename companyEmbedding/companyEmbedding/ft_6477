Procedures for the salvage and necropsy of the dugong (Dugong dugon)Product Type: ReportYear: 2000Author(s): Eros, C., H. Marsh, R. Bonde, T.J. O'Shea, C. Beck, C. Recchia, and K. DobbsSuggested Citation: Eros, C., H. Marsh, R. Bonde, T.J. O'Shea, C. Beck, C. Recchia, and K. Dobbs. 2000. Procedures for the salvage and necropsy of the dugong (Dugong dugon). Research Publication. Townsville, Queensland, Australia: Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. 74 p. Data and specimens collected from dugong carcasses and live stranded individuals provide vital information for research and management agencies. The ability to assign a cause of death (natural and/or human induced) to a carcass assists managers to identify major threats to a population in certain areas and to evaluate and adapt management measures. Data collected from dugong carcasses have contributed to research in areas such as life history, feeding biology, investigating the stock structure/genetics of dugongs, contaminants studies, heavy metal analyses, parasitology, and the effects of habitat change. Adapted from the 'Manual of Procedures for the Salvage and Necropsy of Carcasses of the West Indian Manatee (Trichechus manatus),' this manual provides a detailed guide for dugong (Dugong dugon) carcass handling and necropsy procedures. It is intended to be used as a resource and training guide for anyone involved in dugong incidents who may lack dugong expertise.
