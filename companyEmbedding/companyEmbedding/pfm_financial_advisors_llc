1Forbes rankings are the opinion of SHOOK Research and are based on advisor interviews, client retention, industry experience, compliance record, assets under management and revenue generated for the firm. Investment performance is not considered. Advisors do not pay to be in the ranking.
2According to Barron's, "The formula [used] to rank advisors has three major components: assets managed, revenue produced and quality of the advisor's practice. Investment returns are not a component of the rankings because an advisor's returns are dictated largely by each client's risk tolerance. The quality-of-practice component includes an evaluation of each advisor's regulatory record." The rankings are based on the universe of applications submitted to Barron's. The selection process begins with a nomination and application provided to Barron's. Principals of Edelman Financial Services, LLC self-nominated the firm and submitted quantitative and qualitative information to Barron's as requested. Barron's reviewed and considered this information, which resulted in the rankings on Aug. 27, 2012/Aug. 28, 2010/Aug. 31, 2009.

Checklist: 9 Questions Every Advisor Should Be Able to Answer 




Whatever your priorities, this can help you find someone who understands you and has the resources to help you manage your financial life 











AT ONE TIME OR ANOTHER, WE ALL face major turning points in our lives—getting married, becoming a parent, receiving a life-changing promotion, getting ready to retire. At times like these, many people feel a need for financial help, and start to wonder whether working with a financial advisor might make sense. That's when the search begins.
The challenge is finding someone you'll feel comfortable talking to about the most personal things—your family, your money, your hopes for your future. Someone who'll be there for you for years to come, and who can provide more than just stock recommendations.
To find an advisor who can help you with those decisions, don't be afraid to ask the following tough questions—they'll help you get a clear idea of what you can expect from the relationship and whether it makes sense for you.
1. What types of clients do you work with?
Some advisors have special experience working with business owners or members of a specific profession. Others might have particular knowledge in a specialty, such as sustainable investing or retirement planning. Ask what team members or resources from around their company they can call upon to help you meet your specific needs.
The challenge is finding someone you'll feel comfortable talking to about the most personal things—your family, your money, your hopes for your future.
2. What is your track record?
No advisor can or should promise financial results based on past performance. And beware those who do. But an advisor with a record of long relationships with clients likely provides the kind of service that earns their loyalty.
3. How often will we talk?
An advisor should be committed to conversations in person, by phone, or online—whatever your preference is—as often as you require. Every client has different needs and expectations. Be upfront with the advisor about how frequently and by what means you would like to get together to discuss your finances.
4. How realistic are my goals?
Even if you have a strong idea of what you want to accomplish with your money, the right advisor can help you better understand and prioritize your goals, including making any necessary tradeoffs based on your finances, timelines and investing preferences.

5. How will we keep my strategy on course?
Even the best strategy will need adjusting as financial markets and your goals change. An advisor should have a plan for regular reviews and the ability to correct as market conditions and your priorities shift.
6. What happens if the markets are volatile? Will you call me?
When markets get scary, there's nothing worse than feeling isolated and alone. One of an advisor's most vital functions is to reach out at such times, hear your concerns, offer perspective, and talk about any needed adjustments to your strategy.
7. What if I'm upset about a service issue or an investment?
As life becomes increasingly automated, there's nothing like a human voice and quick response when you're concerned about a financial matter. Advisors who define their success by your success will be eager to quickly resolve any such issues.
8. Who will I actually be working with?
Many advisors have teams of professionals to enhance the services they provide. Ask who you'd be working with on a regular basis and their level of experience. Beyond the immediate team, does the company supporting them have access to a broad array of financial insights and resources?
9. How do I pay you for your work?
It's never easy to ask, but the right advisors will welcome this question. Clarity about fees is vital to a successful relationship. Payment—whether a percentage of assets or per transaction—should be structured around your needs and preferences.

About Us
Diversity & Inclusion

At PFM, diversity and inclusion are foundational to the firm’s success – in serving our clients, in creating a dynamic and welcoming work environment for our employees, in partnering with external stakeholders, and in realizing our overarching purpose of providing advice for people who transform their world. It is vitally important to us that both our colleagues and our clients should be able to recognize themselves in PFM. Diversity of thought, perspective, experience and background is a hallmark of our principles. Our sincere, unwavering commitment is demonstrated through consistent and creative efforts to attract, retain, and develop a diverse workforce, while sustaining the inclusive culture for employees to best serve our clients’ interests using their unique insights, talents and perspectives.










About Us
History of PFM
It started with the simple insight that governments and charitable institutions needed independent advice from people they could trust. Advice from people who understood their financial needs and challenges, inside and out. From people who respected the amazing work they do every day, always for the benefit of others.
PFM opened its first office in Philadelphia in 1975. From the very beginning, we had a distinct advantage over the competition: we understood the need for a financial services firm founded exclusively for the benefit of governments and charitable institution clients. Thanks to an unwavering commitment to serving our clients’ interests above all else, PFM has grown into one of the nation’s leading independent financial and investment advisors.
Today, PFM employs hundreds of professionals serving a diverse base of clients from locations in every region of the country. We are asset managers, financial advisors and consultants who work across a broad range of traditional and special purpose sectors. Our duty as a fiduciary, combined with our bedrock principles of Ingenuity, Sustainability and Resourcefulness, help us deliver on our promise of advice that will help our clients transform their world.

Financial Advisory


Our Approach
At PFM, our financial advisors play an active part in designing and executing the financing strategies of our clients. We see ourselves as both our clients' partner and guide in helping to achieve their specific goals.
We built our reputation by providing superior service to our clients and making their involvement in the day-to-day financing process as streamlined as possible. Perhaps this is why, since 1987, PFM’s financial advisory team has been ranked the nation's leading independent municipal financial advisors in terms of par amount and number of issues by Thomson-Reuters.






Ingenuity
Informed by deep insight into the marketplace, our solutions are never cookie-cutter. We believe that a financial advisor should be a resourceful partner, helping clients face whatever challenges may arise, with sound advice based on careful, relevant analysis.  We develop ideas that reflect the needs and perspective of our clients, allowing them to attend to their futures proactively instead of reactively.  
Diligent Management
When serving as financial advisor, we take an all-encompassing approach, ensuring that our clients’ best interests come first and foremost during each step of the capital formation process. We provide a forum for ideas, an environment for testing conventional wisdom, and a platform for forging value-added strategies. Most importantly, we help our clients execute transactions efficiently and seamlessly.
Fiduciary Focus
We believe advising our clients carries with it a sacred trust. Our 40+ year reputation is built upon putting our clients first. PFM incorporates our financial advisory professionals’ deep market expertise with sophisticated modeling capabilities, centralized bond pricing analysis and the collaborative power of teamwork to advise on each client’s unique objectives. Our goal is to reduce our clients’ financing costs and identify risks in ever-changing markets. 
Our Solutions
Transaction Management & Bond Pricing
Issuing debt requires careful analysis and expertly delivered advice at every turn. We help our clients access capital for their projects through multiple tools including municipal bonds, bank loans, state and federal loan programs, public-private partnerships and other options which may not require borrowing such as grants or pay-as-you-go sources. To each engagement, we bring an understanding of what others have done successfully and how those ideas or approaches may work within the context of a client’s specific circumstances. 
PFM professionals are among the most active participants in the municipal securities market. We were the first financial advisory practice to have dedicated individuals focused exclusively on developing tools that help our clients receive fair pricing for their bonds. Our pricing group practice possesses extensive experience in both competitive and negotiated sales, matched only by the largest underwriting firms.
Credit Strategies
Accessing the capital markets, or obtaining some form of lending, on predictable and acceptable terms depends on having an effective credit strategy. We help our clients develop and implement successful credit strategies that support their borrowing needs, while maintaining funding flexibility and sustainable finances.
Capital Planning
We design long term plans of finance to fund our clients’ ambitions. The crucial first step is to define the rules of the road — the financial planning that will get our clients where they need to go in the short and long term. A solid foundation of financial, debt and tax policies along with sound analytics is fundamental for creating a sustainable, long-range plan of finance. After that, we are with our clients every step of the way, as partners and advisors.

1Forbes rankings are the opinion of SHOOK Research and are based on advisor interviews, client retention, industry experience, compliance record, assets under management and revenue generated for the firm. Investment performance is not considered. Advisors do not pay to be in the ranking.
2According to Barron's, "The formula [used] to rank advisors has three major components: assets managed, revenue produced and quality of the advisor's practice. Investment returns are not a component of the rankings because an advisor's returns are dictated largely by each client's risk tolerance. The quality-of-practice component includes an evaluation of each advisor's regulatory record." The rankings are based on the universe of applications submitted to Barron's. The selection process begins with a nomination and application provided to Barron's. Principals of Edelman Financial Services, LLC self-nominated the firm and submitted quantitative and qualitative information to Barron's as requested. Barron's reviewed and considered this information, which resulted in the rankings on Aug. 27, 2012/Aug. 28, 2010/Aug. 31, 2009.

Checklist: 9 Questions Every Advisor Should Be Able to Answer 




Whatever your priorities, this can help you find someone who understands you and has the resources to help you manage your financial life 











AT ONE TIME OR ANOTHER, WE ALL face major turning points in our lives—getting married, becoming a parent, receiving a life-changing promotion, getting ready to retire. At times like these, many people feel a need for financial help, and start to wonder whether working with a financial advisor might make sense. That's when the search begins.
The challenge is finding someone you'll feel comfortable talking to about the most personal things—your family, your money, your hopes for your future. Someone who'll be there for you for years to come, and who can provide more than just stock recommendations.
To find an advisor who can help you with those decisions, don't be afraid to ask the following tough questions—they'll help you get a clear idea of what you can expect from the relationship and whether it makes sense for you.
1. What types of clients do you work with?
Some advisors have special experience working with business owners or members of a specific profession. Others might have particular knowledge in a specialty, such as sustainable investing or retirement planning. Ask what team members or resources from around their company they can call upon to help you meet your specific needs.
The challenge is finding someone you'll feel comfortable talking to about the most personal things—your family, your money, your hopes for your future.
2. What is your track record?
No advisor can or should promise financial results based on past performance. And beware those who do. But an advisor with a record of long relationships with clients likely provides the kind of service that earns their loyalty.
3. How often will we talk?
An advisor should be committed to conversations in person, by phone, or online—whatever your preference is—as often as you require. Every client has different needs and expectations. Be upfront with the advisor about how frequently and by what means you would like to get together to discuss your finances.
4. How realistic are my goals?
Even if you have a strong idea of what you want to accomplish with your money, the right advisor can help you better understand and prioritize your goals, including making any necessary tradeoffs based on your finances, timelines and investing preferences.

5. How will we keep my strategy on course?
Even the best strategy will need adjusting as financial markets and your goals change. An advisor should have a plan for regular reviews and the ability to correct as market conditions and your priorities shift.
6. What happens if the markets are volatile? Will you call me?
When markets get scary, there's nothing worse than feeling isolated and alone. One of an advisor's most vital functions is to reach out at such times, hear your concerns, offer perspective, and talk about any needed adjustments to your strategy.
7. What if I'm upset about a service issue or an investment?
As life becomes increasingly automated, there's nothing like a human voice and quick response when you're concerned about a financial matter. Advisors who define their success by your success will be eager to quickly resolve any such issues.
8. Who will I actually be working with?
Many advisors have teams of professionals to enhance the services they provide. Ask who you'd be working with on a regular basis and their level of experience. Beyond the immediate team, does the company supporting them have access to a broad array of financial insights and resources?
9. How do I pay you for your work?
It's never easy to ask, but the right advisors will welcome this question. Clarity about fees is vital to a successful relationship. Payment—whether a percentage of assets or per transaction—should be structured around your needs and preferences.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
