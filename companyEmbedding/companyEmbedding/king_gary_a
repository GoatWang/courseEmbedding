If you smoke while you are pregnant, your baby may be more likely to experience optic nerve problems or crossed eyes.High CholesterolNeurologistsMultiple SclerosisOptic nerve inflammation may also be responsible for blurred vision. Your optic nerve carries impulses from the retina, a layer of cells that line the back of the eye, to the brain, where they are interpreted as images. Optic nerve inflammation is often one of the earliest signs of multiple sclerosis. It can also occur if you have syphilis, Lyme disease, shingles, cat scratch fever, herpes, mumps or measles.RadiologistComputed TomographyChemotherapyTake medications that increase your sensitivity to UV and blue light, including tranquilizers, birth control pills, diabetes and chemotherapy drugs, antihistamines, retinoids, steroids, anti-inflammatories and antibiotics.MRISimilar to an MRI or CT scan, the OCT non-invasively captures high definition cross sectional images of the retina and optic nerve, in a matter of seconds, allowing our doctors to see in unprecedented clarity.OphthalmologistsEye ExamDuring an eye exam, Dr. Dr. Gary King and Dr. Sarah King will ask you questions about any symptoms or issues you are experiencing, medications you are currently taking, any blurry vision, your work environment, and your overall health. Family history and previous eye or vision conditions will also be discussed during this part of the examination. Dr. King will consider this information when determining any treatments or recommendations.Cataract SurgeryCataracts occur when the lens at the center of your eye becomes cloudy. If your cataract becomes large enough and interferes with your vision, your optometrist will probably recommend surgery to remove it. During cataract surgery, the cloudy lens is replaced with an artificial lens.GlaucomaGlaucoma occurs when the pressure in your eye is too high and can lead to permanent vision loss. In many cases, people do not have any symptoms initially. Glaucoma can be detected with a simple test at your optometrist's office. If you are diagnosed with the condition, prescription medications, eye drops or surgery can help preserve your vision.OphthalmologyMacular DegenerationThe complex contains eight B vitamins that may reduce your risk of macular degeneration and help you avoid changes in the blood vessels in your retina.Laser Eye SurgeryAt King's Eye Care, we provide comprehensive care to meet the vision needs of our patients. As an optometrist, Dr. Dr. Gary King and Dr. Sarah King offers pre- and post-operative care for patients undergoing LASIK eye surgery or other eye surgical procedures. Our goal is to help you attain the clearest vision possible using advanced technologies.CataractsUVB Rays. The ozone layer blocks some UVB rays, but a significant amount still break through, resulting in sunburns and suntans and contributing to the formation of cataracts.DermatologistsSkin CancerCancer. Melanoma and basal cell and squamous cell cancers can develop on your eyelids and most often occur on the lower eyelids. Possible symptoms of eyelid cancer include eyelash loss, bleeding bumps, new spots on the eyelids that grow or have irregular borders, and chronic inflammation of the eyelids that doesn't get better when you use medication. In some cases, melanoma can affect the middle layer of your eye and cause blurry vision, a spot on your iris or a change in the shape of a pupil. Cancer can also develop in the conjunctiva.PsoriasisEndocrinologistDiabetes CareThyroidDiabetic RetinopathyIf you have diabetes, it's important to be aware of the signs of diabetic retinopathy, which include blurred vision, trouble with night vision and dark spots in your center vision. The condition occurs when small vessels in your retina leak blood or fluids, clouding your vision.PsychiatristsDepressionAnxietySend to PhoneGary King Optometrist109 Boone St, Berea, KY 40403(859) 986-7027Send this business listing as a text message to a mobile phone.I agree to the Terms and ConditionsCancelSendYour text message was sent.To opt out at anytime, send the word STOP to YP411.To get a help message, send the word HELP to YP411.There was an error sending your text.Please try again.E-MailGary King Optometrist109 Boone St, Berea, KY 40403(859) 986-7027Send this business details to yourself or up to 5 friends.Up to 5 email addresses, separate addresses with a commaSend Yourself a CopyCancelSend
