FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

What are analysts saying about Rockwell Automation stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Rockwell Automation stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Rockwell Automation’s third quarter fiscal 2017 top and bottom line improved year over year and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The increases in earnings were primarily due to higher sales, partially offset by higher incentive compensation. Backed by strong performance in fiscal 2017 so far and an improving macro environment, the company hiked adjusted earnings per share guidance to the range of $6.60 to $6.80 and projects sales to be around $6.3 billion. The company will benefit from the consistent growth in the consumer and transportation verticals and expects heavy industries to grow in 2017 despite the prevailing softness in oil and gas and mining. Further, increased investment, acquisitions, product launches and share repurchases will support growth. The company has a positive record of earnings surprises in recent quarters." (7/28/2017)
2. Barclays PLC analysts commented, "We are updating our model following ROK's F1Q17 earnings release. Our 2017E core growth goes to 3% from 1% driven by better than expected book/bill and actual results in the quarter. We had previously expected the year to be more back-end loaded. Our 2017E EPS goes to $6.25 from $6.10. Our 2018E EPS goes to $6.90 from $6.85, as we remain somewhat conservative in light of low visibility on timing /magnitude of the recovery. Bias to numbers is likely upward, however. Our PT goes to $166 (24x our 2018E EPS of $6.90) from $144 (21x our prior 2018E EPS of $6.85)." (1/26/2017)

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Rockwell Automation (NYSE:ROK) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 1 Sell Rating, 11 Hold Ratings, 2 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.07)Consensus Price Target: $148.31 (10.10% downside)
