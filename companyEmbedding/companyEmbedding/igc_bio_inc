Water Activity(Aw) Measurements Using a Payne Cell with a Flux-Calibrated Membrane and DVS
The measurement of water activity (Aw) is a very important metric in the food industry. It is used by food manufacturers and government agencies to evaluate the quality of food ingredients and to predict a product’s potential shelf life. The most widely used method to determine Aw is the measurement of water vapour pressure emanating from a food material enclosed in a sealed chamber. This application note demonstrates a possible alternative to the traditional method employed by industry and describes advantages that may be gained by this new procedure.

An overview of iGC SEA – a new instrument for characterising the physico-chemical properties of polymers
The surface properties of powders and fibres are important parameters in the handling and performance of a wide range of solid materials. iGC SEA has been specifically designed to address many of the issues faced by physical properties researchers, including fully automated operation and the ability to measure samples in a controlled humidity environment. This Application note gives a brief description of the technique, the instrument and some examples of its application to a range of polymeric materials analysis problems.

Characterisation of surface properties of glass fibres by inverse gas chromatography
In the present paper dispersive surface energies and specific free energies have been calculated for different modified E-glass fibre surfaces. Both different sizing and different polymer coatings have been investigated to consider changes in the surface chemistry and surface energy during different fibre treatments.

A sorption study on microporous materials by finite dilution inverse gas chromatography
Finite concentration IGC SEA is a useful tool for the investigation of surface and pore properties. A novel combination of finite concentration IGC SEA and thermal desorption provides the possibility to separate micropore adsorption from surface and mesopore adsorption. This allows the calculation of BET values with physical relevance for highly microporous materials and the consideration of molecular sieve effects.

Determination of the glass transition temperatures Tg of maltose and its dependence on relative humidity by infinite dilution inverse gas chromatography
The glass transition temperature Tg is an important property for the characterisation of polymeric, food, pharmaceutical and many natural products. iGC SEA can provide a fast and accurate determination of this property as well as its dependence on relative humidity. This paper describes the characterisation of maltose with decane at infinite dilution.

Vapour Sorption Properties of Building Materials using Gravimetric Sorption Instrumentation – an Overview
Dynamic Vapour Sorption (DVS) has long been used for investigating the interaction of water and organic vapours with solid materials. The versatility and impact of DVS has particular importance in the study of building materials. This overview application note summarises several examples of using DVS to study cements, wood, insulation, and other building materials.

Characterisation of Wheat Straw for Bio-fuel Application
Biomass, such as wheat straw is an abundant and inexpensive natural biopolymer rich in cellulose and hemicellulose [1] which can be converted into bio-fuel. The bio-fuel has been attracting attention due to the future potential shortages of fossil fuel [2,3]. One of the crucial steps of producing bio-ethanol from wheat straw is its pre-treatment which should facilitate the economic feasibility and yield efficient conversion into biofuel. This pre-treatment is expected to increase the accessible chemical sites of the straw to increase convertibility in subsequent hydrolysis and fermentation steps. Dynamic Vapour Sorption (DVS) [4] and UV were used to assess the wheat straw pre-treatment and sugar yield, respectively.

Combining Raman Spectroscopy with Gravimetric Vapour Sorption Analysis for Pharmaceutical Materials
Raman spectroscopy is a widely used physical characterization technique used in the pharmaceutical industry. The combination of Raman spectroscopy and Dynamic Vapour Sorption (DVS) allows for a more complete understanding of vapour-solid interactions for pharmaceutical materials as it relates to structural properties. This paper overviews the DVS-Raman capabilities and gives several examples.

Robert Penny, founder of IGC, to launch sixth company

					Posted on Fri/17/AugustWed/23/January  by AZBio 


By Angela Gonzales – August 16, 2012 Phoenix Business Journal

Robert Penny, co-founder and CEO of International Genomics Consortium, is starting his sixth company.
 
Dr. Robert Penny – 2011 Bioscience Leader of the Year at the AZBio Awards – October 13, 2011
The new company, simply called Paradigm, is being formed as a nonprofit and will be a spinout of Phoenix-based IGC, in partnership with the University of Michigan.
Paradigm will have offices in Phoenix and Ann Arbor, Mich., at U-M, and will employ 15 people at each of its offices within the first three years, Penny said.
“The goal for this is to be a national company,” Penny said. “It will be involved in translating a lot of the sequencing information that is now coming available, to drive that into clinical trials and into patient care in the future, so patients get the best opportunity to get a drug more likely to work well.”
Its goal is to figure out ways to get the right drug at the right time for the right patient, he said.
Penny said he originally was going to form Paradigm as a for-profit company, like his other ventures, including Molecular Profiling Inc.
But when he talked with his business associates, he was referred to Dr. Jay Hess, chairman of the Department of Pathology at the U-M Medical School, because they seemed to have similar visions.
“I met with Dr. Hess,” Penny said. “Quite frankly, he out-competed every other potential opportunity by a multiple factor.”
Hess said IGC has a track record of bringing molecular diagnostics to market. He also likes the idea that both IGC and the university are nonprofits with a patient-focused vision.
“We’re doing this because we want to be leaders in bringing personalized medicine to patients in a way that’s going to improve their health,” Hess said.
U-M Medical School is known for its research in prostate cancer. It has run a molecular diagnostics reference laboratory for the past 20 years.
“This is an extension of what we do,” Hess said.
While Paradigm will start out in cancer research, it will expand to other non-cancer diseases in the future, he said.
