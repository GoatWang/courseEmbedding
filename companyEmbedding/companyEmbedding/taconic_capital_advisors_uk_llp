Fund Advisor

                                    Current                


Taconic Capital Advisors LP


                  Taconic Capital is a global institutional investment firm that pursues an event-driven, multi-strategy investment approach. Taconic was founded in 1999 by former Goldman Sachs partners, Frank Brosens and Ken Brody and currently manages approximately $9 billion.

Taconic Capital Advisors UK LLP


                  TCA UK is an active, research-driven, probabilistic manager which follows a team-oriented investment approach and a distributed decision-making process. The firm constructs relatively concentrated portfolios on a bottom-up basis using fundamental and risk/reward analysis. The co-portfolio managers size positions and make investment decisions for the funds. The firm utilizes probabilistic investing and focuses on companies undergoing change to their business or capital structures. They employ fundamental, legal and regulatory analyses to identify misperceptions and mispricings with the potential to lead to outsized returns on capital. The funds also include fundamental deep-value investments that typically have a soft catalyst.  The Opportunity Fund invests in merger arbitrage, special situations, distressed and capital structure arbitrage. The funds typically have a long bias and the firm actively manages the potential downside risk of the overall portfolio. Individual positions with offsetting short hedges are implemented when appropriate.The firm's hedging philosophy aims to limit losses and preserve capital during severe market dislocations. Macro portfolio hedges are the primary method of protecting against portfolio tail risk. The firm searches for inexpensive volatility in an effort to build a diversified portfolio of hedges with the goal of limiting overall portfolio risk. The risk management and portfolio management teams are separate and distinct, providing appropriate checks and balances. The Co-Portfolio Managers shape the portfolio on a regular basis with respect to factor risks.  The portfolio is manually stress tested and stress test results and factor risk analyses are reviewed by the full risk management team at regular risk meetings. If the stress test yields an expected loss greater than 10%, the portfolio is adjusted and/or portfolio hedges are increased.
