Christopher T. Fraser Appointed President and CEO of KMG Chemicals | Business Wire
























































Christopher T. Fraser Appointed President and CEO of KMG Chemicals






September 25, 2013 01:00 PM Eastern Daylight Time



HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The Board of Directors of KMG Chemicals, Inc. (NYSE: KMG), a global 
      provider of specialty chemicals to select markets, announced today that 
      Christopher T. Fraser has been appointed the company’s president and 
      chief executive officer, effective immediately. Fraser, who is chairman 
      of the KMG board, has been serving as interim CEO since late June.
    


      “I am honored that the Board asked me to be KMG’s CEO and lead the next 
      phase of the company’s growth,” Fraser said. “Over the past several 
      months, I have gained a full appreciation for the opportunities that 
      exist for KMG, and today I am excited to assume the role of CEO on a 
      permanent basis. As a board member since 2008, I have a strong 
      commitment to seeing KMG reach its full potential as an organization. As 
      CEO, I will lead our long-range strategic direction while addressing 
      near-term priorities for integration, operational efficiencies and 
      profitable growth,” Fraser said.
    

      “After a thorough executive search that narrowed to several talented 
      candidates, the board unanimously decided that the best person for the 
      job was already serving as interim CEO – and that was Chris Fraser,” 
      said John C. Hunter III, board member and chair of the governance 
      committee. “Even though Chris had declared that he was not a candidate 
      for this post, the Board members nonetheless asked him to reconsider and 
      to take on this responsibility. Chris not only has a deep understanding 
      of our company and our markets, but he also has the strategic vision to 
      drive KMG forward and achieve the company’s full growth potential. Chris 
      has a track record of building successful chemical companies and the 
      Board is confident that his experience and skill set are the perfect 
      match for KMG,” said Hunter.
    

      The Board has also announced that Fraser will remain chairman and that 
      it will appoint a new lead director, independent of management, in the 
      near future. The lead director will be elected from among the board's 
      independent directors to serve as their leader with the purpose of 
      ensuring continuing transparency and accountability in the company’s 
      governance.
    

      Fraser, age 55, is an experienced executive in the chemicals industry 
      and has been CEO of two chemical companies. He holds Bachelor of Science 
      degrees in Chemistry and in Business Administration from the University 
      of Connecticut and an MBA from Pepperdine University. He has served on 
      KMG’s board since 2008 and as chairman of the board since December 2012.

Christopher T. Fraser Appointed President and CEO of KMG Chemicals





























































Christopher T. Fraser Appointed President and CEO of KMG Chemicals
























Tweet




















September 25, 2013 - 10:00 AM PDT


HOUSTON



(Business Wire)  
      The Board of Directors of KMG Chemicals, Inc. (NYSE: KMG), a global 
      provider of specialty chemicals to select markets, announced today that 
      Christopher T. Fraser has been appointed the company’s president and 
      chief executive officer, effective immediately. Fraser, who is chairman 
      of the KMG board, has been serving as interim CEO since late June.
    

      “I am honored that the Board asked me to be KMG’s CEO and lead the next 
      phase of the company’s growth,” Fraser said. “Over the past several 
      months, I have gained a full appreciation for the opportunities that 
      exist for KMG, and today I am excited to assume the role of CEO on a 
      permanent basis. As a board member since 2008, I have a strong 
      commitment to seeing KMG reach its full potential as an organization. As 
      CEO, I will lead our long-range strategic direction while addressing 
      near-term priorities for integration, operational efficiencies and 
      profitable growth,” Fraser said.
    

      “After a thorough executive search that narrowed to several talented 
      candidates, the board unanimously decided that the best person for the 
      job was already serving as interim CEO – and that was Chris Fraser,” 
      said John C. Hunter III, board member and chair of the governance 
      committee. “Even though Chris had declared that he was not a candidate 
      for this post, the Board members nonetheless asked him to reconsider and 
      to take on this responsibility. Chris not only has a deep understanding 
      of our company and our markets, but he also has the strategic vision to 
      drive KMG forward and achieve the company’s full growth potential. Chris 
      has a track record of building successful chemical companies and the 
      Board is confident that his experience and skill set are the perfect 
      match for KMG,” said Hunter.
    

      The Board has also announced that Fraser will remain chairman and that 
      it will appoint a new lead director, independent of management, in the 
      near future. The lead director will be elected from among the board's 
      independent directors to serve as their leader with the purpose of 
      ensuring continuing transparency and accountability in the company’s 
      governance.
    

      Fraser, age 55, is an experienced executive in the chemicals industry 
      and has been CEO of two chemical companies. He holds Bachelor of Science 
      degrees in Chemistry and in Business Administration from the University 
      of Connecticut and an MBA from Pepperdine University. He has served on 
      KMG’s board since 2008 and as chairman of the board since December 2012.

      Advent International since 2011, Fraser advises on investment
