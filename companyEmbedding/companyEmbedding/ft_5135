This is interesting about Manorville?

                    The hamlet of Manorville was a small farming community for many years. The area of the hamlet once laid within the huge tract of land known as Manor St. George, a land grant given to Col. William "Tangier" Smith in 1693 for recognition of his service as governor of Tangier in Morocco. In 1844, the Long Island Rail Road built a station called "St. George's Manor", which was situated off of Ryerson Avenue. However, Seth Raynor, the station agent who was a patriot during the American Revolutionary War, disliked the name due to its similarity to the British and their colonial dominance (St. George, the patron saint of England, is a symbol of the English monarchy), and decided to paint over the sign, leaving only the word "Manor". The hamlet changed its name to "Manorville" with the opening of its post office in 1907, but timetables and Long Island Rail Road documents retained the name "Manor" until 1907 or 1908

Worried about your printer’s warranty?
Add All Selected to Cart


Many consumers are worried if the use of compatible or aftermarket printing supplies will void their printer's warranty.  The answer is no. 
More simply put, this means that your printer warranty cannot be voided just because you choose to use compatible products unless the manufacturer can prove that the compatible product caused direct damage to your printer. In cases such as this, the manufacturer may choose not to repair your printer but your warranty would remain in effect for all other warranty issues.
