Prepare for Archery Season with Bows, Arrows & Archery Gear
Whether for sport or hunting, take aim with performance-crafted archery equipment from DICK'S Sporting Goods. 
Experienced and novice archers alike can prep for their shot with the industry's latest recurve, compound and crossbows. Load your weapon with carbon and aluminum arrows and bolts—all designed for excellent durability, speed and energy transfer. 
Bows 
Select from high-quality recurve, crossbow and compound bow models: 

Recurve Bows, Traditional Bows & Longbows: Recurve bows are also called "traditional" bows and have tips that curve away from the archer as they draw. These models store energy efficiently to deliver greater speed to the arrow. They are easy to handle, featuring a compact design with slim grips and a smooth draw. Longbows offer the most basic bow design and are sleek and lightweight for an efficient shot.
Crossbows: This system features a bow attached to a stock and lever. When the archer releases the lever, an arrow, or bolt, shoots from the mechanism. These bows have a much greater firing range than a recurve bow. They do, however, require more time to load. 
Compound Bows: These bows use a system of cables and pulleys, known as cams, to bend the bow's limbs. A cable is attached to each of the bow's cams. As the cables draw back, the cams turn to bend the bow's limbs. Stiff limbs create significant energy transfer during the draw. 

Stock up on gear from popular brands and choose from Bear Archery® bows, Barnett® crossbows, October Mountain Products and Delta McKenzie® targets. 
Protect your bow with bow cases for crossbows, compound bows and more from DICK'S Sporting Goods. 

Expert Advice

Choose the Right Arrows & Accessories 
Learn more about the archery equipment available at DICK’S Sporting Goods: 
Arrows & Bolts
Archery arrows and crossbow bolts come in a variety of weights, lengths and materials. 

Aluminum arrows are highly popular for their strength, flexibility and durability. Carbon arrows are ultra lightweight for excellent speed and energy transfer. 
Arrow length is critical for safety and accuracy. Arrows that are too short or too long can hinder your ability to hit your target. 
Youth arrows are perfect for beginners and properly sized for youth archers. 

Archery Accessories 
Practice makes for a perfect shot, so get ready for your next hunt with archery targets for your backyard or open field. Go for the realism of 3D targets or opt for more basic foam blocks, bags and targets. 
Think about your bow’s draw weight. Draw weight denotes the amount of strength required to draw back a bow. Most adult archers can use a bow with a draw weight of 50 to 70 pounds. Youth bows have a much lighter draw weight. Always consult product information before making your selection. 
You should also consider the draw length of your bow. To determine the proper draw length for you, make a fist with your bow hand and hold it outward, as if you are shooting a bow. Have another person measure the distance from the end of your hand to the corner of your mouth. Select a bow with a draw length near this measurement.

Expert Advice

Broadheads are a popular choice for hunting big game, small game and everything in between. When you’re ready to upgrade your hunting gear, keep these considerations in mind:

Mechanical broadheads feature expandable blades that open upon impact, creating larger wounds that can help you achieve faster, cleaner kills. 
Broadheads are available for use with crossbows and compound bows, so be sure to double check that you are getting the right type of arrowhead for your bow.
Many small game broadheads feature smaller heads and innovative designs, which provide the right combination of cutting power and impact for birds and other small targets.


Broadheads are available in a wide range of weights. For accurate flight, be sure to use appropriate broadhead for your arrows. Check the recommendations from your arrow’s manufacturer before you buy your broadheads.
While today’s broadheads deliver impressive accuracy, you may need to change your bow sights when switching between field points and broadheads. It’s also a good idea to check that you are using field tips at the same weight as your broadheads.
Sharp blades are essential for broadhead performance. Check your blades periodically, and either replace worn ones or use a blade replacement kit to install new blades.

Prepare for Archery Season with Bows, Arrows & Archery Gear
Whether for sport or hunting, take aim with performance-crafted archery equipment from DICK'S Sporting Goods. 
Experienced and novice archers alike can prep for their shot with the industry's latest recurve, compound and crossbows. Load your weapon with carbon and aluminum arrows and bolts—all designed for excellent durability, speed and energy transfer. 
Bows 
Select from high-quality recurve, crossbow and compound bow models: 

Recurve Bows, Traditional Bows & Longbows: Recurve bows are also called "traditional" bows and have tips that curve away from the archer as they draw. These models store energy efficiently to deliver greater speed to the arrow. They are easy to handle, featuring a compact design with slim grips and a smooth draw. Longbows offer the most basic bow design and are sleek and lightweight for an efficient shot.
Crossbows: This system features a bow attached to a stock and lever. When the archer releases the lever, an arrow, or bolt, shoots from the mechanism. These bows have a much greater firing range than a recurve bow. They do, however, require more time to load. 
Compound Bows: These bows use a system of cables and pulleys, known as cams, to bend the bow's limbs. A cable is attached to each of the bow's cams. As the cables draw back, the cams turn to bend the bow's limbs. Stiff limbs create significant energy transfer during the draw. 

Stock up on gear from popular brands and choose from Bear Archery® bows, Barnett® crossbows, October Mountain Products and Delta McKenzie® targets. 
Protect your bow with bow cases for crossbows, compound bows and more from DICK'S Sporting Goods. 

Expert Advice

Choose the Right Arrows & Accessories 
Learn more about the archery equipment available at DICK’S Sporting Goods: 
Arrows & Bolts
Archery arrows and crossbow bolts come in a variety of weights, lengths and materials. 

Aluminum arrows are highly popular for their strength, flexibility and durability. Carbon arrows are ultra lightweight for excellent speed and energy transfer. 
Arrow length is critical for safety and accuracy. Arrows that are too short or too long can hinder your ability to hit your target. 
Youth arrows are perfect for beginners and properly sized for youth archers. 

Archery Accessories 
Practice makes for a perfect shot, so get ready for your next hunt with archery targets for your backyard or open field. Go for the realism of 3D targets or opt for more basic foam blocks, bags and targets. 
Think about your bow’s draw weight. Draw weight denotes the amount of strength required to draw back a bow. Most adult archers can use a bow with a draw weight of 50 to 70 pounds. Youth bows have a much lighter draw weight. Always consult product information before making your selection. 
You should also consider the draw length of your bow. To determine the proper draw length for you, make a fist with your bow hand and hold it outward, as if you are shooting a bow. Have another person measure the distance from the end of your hand to the corner of your mouth. Select a bow with a draw length near this measurement.

Dick Allen 1
































 

Dick
Allen 

It amazes me that in today's information
age there are still thousands of Chopper enthusiasts who don't know who Dick
Allen was. This little section of the site will hopefully help to give this man
the credit he richly deserves and educate newcomers in some of the historical
information that surrounds our shared interests. Dick Allen was truly a legend
in his own time and you can't say this about to many people.
Note that most of the images embedded in this
article came from Darcy Allen (Dick's daughter), The Shamrock Fabrication site
by Irish Rich, from his 'Applied Machete' blog and the Motorcycle-Art Webzine (motorcycleart.blogspot.com) owned by Chris Kallas.
Darcy came down to California this year
(2014) and managed to meet a lot of people that worked with her father. She's shown
below sitting on Joe Hurst's 'Chrome Bike' (formerly Dick's 'Wheeler Dealer'). Unfortunately I was in Texas so we
only communicated by telephone. Needless to say I was surprised as hell that
Dick had a daughter as all I remembered were his two boys. It was an honor to
talk with her especially since she plans on continuing to explore her fathers
legacy in
whatever way she can.
 

 
Darcy met the current owner of Dick's
'Locomotion' frame and is in the process of trying to buy it back so it stays in
the family. At least they let her hold the old (repainted) gas tank for a few
minutes.
 

 
After talking with
    Darcey I began calling everybody I knew who had contact with Dick over the
    years. I'm going to give her the old fork set her Dad built for me in 65.
    They are in horrible shape so I called Irish Rich to see if he can find time
    to schedule them in for 'refurbishing'. Darcy rides her own Harley on a
    regular basis and spends most of her time doing volunteer work for veterans
    groups. Hopefully someday she'll be riding her fathers old bike and
    spreading the 'Allen Gospel' around the country.
Dick Allen was born in Rockford Illinois
in 1937. Like a lot of young guys he was drawn towards anything that 'rolled'
and it wasn't unusual that he ended up working in a cycle shop when he was only
13 years old. The old shop was at 3042 Kishwaukee in Rockford and there still is
a shop there but it specializes in imports. Unlike a lot of young guys Dick's interest
however went beyond
just wanting to go fast in a car or on a bike. He was fascinated by the
mechanical aspects of virtually anything that you could possibly imagine.
Basically he was a self-taught engineer and mechanic with unusual creative
talents. Some say that he verged on being a genius with respect to machines of
any kind. The first time I met him we ended up having a 6-hour conversation that
encompassed a whole range of subjects starting with cars and bikes but extending
into speed boats, airplanes and shop-built tools.
Dick was married for
    the first time around 1955 and had two children Richard Jr. and Drew who as
    far as I know still live in Rockford.
There is a myth that Allen came to
California in 1965 as an 'outsider' from Illinois but in reality he was well
entrenched in the California bike culture since enlisting in the Navy. Nobody
    knows for sure what he did for the Military. His first post was in Panama but it appears that he was
    later stationed at some remote site between the El Centro air base and what
    eventually became Vincent naval air base near Yuma. Dick was honorably
    discharged in 1954 and lived near the base in the small town of Winter Haven
    where he met and married Mary Benton in 1959 (his second wife). Dick perfected his machine
    trades in the military and coincidentally Mary was also a machinist and they
    met while working for the same shop. They had two children, Tracy and
    Darcy.  Dick worked on bikes in a shop behind their house and was
    quickly developing a reputation as a good builder, mechanic and pretty
    radical 'Biker'.
For those folks not to
    familiar with Southern California Interstate 8 that runs from San Diego to
    just south of Phoenix was originally state highway
    80 started in 1912 to connect the old Yuma marine base to the 'modern'
    world. Since the highway basically paralleled the Mexican border it's no
    wonder that it's a stretch of road very popular with biker gangs going all
    the way back into the fifties. Most of the land north of road belongs to the
    military and most of land south of the road is basically uninhabited desert.
    This is where Dick Allen started his career. There have been major bike runs
    on this stretch of highway going way back into the fifties. I think the Yuma
    Prison run still happens every year. Back in the 'old days' there was a
    notorious 'house of ill repute' that some say was 'sanctioned' by the
    military but it was the only biker hangout north of the border. I'm not sure
    but if I remember right it was called 'Imperial Gables'.
Dick and Mary moved to
    Bakersfield around 1960 and then later moved to
    Winnebago Illinois around 1961 and divorced the next year. Dick then married
    his third wife, Marge, and they and their two children, Clinton and Lee moved to Lawndale California in 1965. This is the point for most people where Dicks history
    as one of the South Bay builders begins. 
Very few people know
    that Allen was as much into cars as he was into bikes and in fact almost all
    of his early frame fabrication work involved dragsters, a lot of that work
    took place when he was living in Rockford. Here's a rare picture of him at
    the Oswego drag strip in 1961. He's driving the black Chevy.
 

 
At first glance Allen was a pretty
intimidating looking guy. He was far from being 'handsome' as they'd say in 'Gentleman's
Quarterly' and was well over six-feet tall and probably weighed around 250 when
I first met him. He didn't take kindly to 'strangers' but if you bothered to
introduce yourself you'd soon get a big smile and a firm handshake. You
immediately knew that you were meeting somebody who had no 'veneers'. What you
saw is what you got and it was all genuine with no ego involved. I don't want to
sound to 'Emo' here but he was about as close as I've ever come to meeting
somebody who had an almost 'Zen' like quality in their personality. Dick was
only around 28-years old when I first met him but he already looked like he was forty.
I've been told that he had a 'hard' life but I think maybe it was more like a
'fast life' as a lot of us had back in those days.
Some folks have faulted him for
personality quirks because Dick basically lived his life for himself. He didn't
care what others thought and for this reason he was often seen as being somewhat
'aloof' or 'distant and uncaring', maybe even selfish or self-centered but I
never saw that aspect in the man. If anything it was the reverse. He was
passionate about everything and everybody. He was especially passionate about bike
runs and parties.
If he had any faults,
    more than what most of us have, it was that he 'compartmentalized' virtually
    everything. This is not an uncommon trait seen in people that are consider
    'gifted' or 'eccentric'. Dick had a 'compartment' for everything and I think
    this let him organize his life as he saw it. He had several 'extended'
    families but they were always 'separated' and 'compartmentalized' and it wasn't
    until long after his death that a lot of these people finally found each
    other.


 

Darcy sent the snapshot above that shows
her Dad in Bakersfield back in 1959 and this may be the oldest photograph anybody has ever seen
of Mr. Allen sitting one one of his bikes. This is the original 'Chrome Bike', a 54
Pan. Many people have told me that
this bike was the one that eventually evolved into 'Wheeler Dealer' many years
later.

 
This is the same bike
    in it's later incarnation with Sportster forks as it existed around 1966.
    The photo was taken by Dick's close friend Chuck Pilkington. This is a
    magazine scan from a1983 article about Dick published shortly after his
    death.
 

 
The image above is the
    same bike in it's third iteration, named 'Wheeler Dealer' by Roth for the
    magazine article in 1968. Dick didn't really do much different to the bike
    except install the extended Indian Girder, sissy bar and pipes. The original
    Pan motor was swapped for a Shovel. The tank remained the same throughout
    the bikes history. Just a note to the reader about Roth. I think he must
    have been related in some way to George Bush as he had a habit, maybe a
    compulsion, to give everything and everybody around him a 'nickname'.
If you showed Roth a
    picture he'd 'name' it. If you showed up in his shop he'd give you a
    'nickname' (if he liked you). If you brought in a car or a bike he'd give it
    a 'name'. He called me 'Smiley' because he never saw me smile. He called
    Mike Vils 'Fass Mikey'. Mike thought he got the name because of his fast
    bike but Roth told me it was because of his hair that looked like it was
    going fast standing still.
Believe it or not the
    old Wheeler Dealer frame still exists after having been bought and sold about five times over
    the years. Joe Hurst is currently rebuilding the bike having owned it two
    times himself (see the first picture on this page for the current configuration).
This is a shot of
    Dick's house on 167th
street in Lawndale. The bikes are 'White Bear' owned by Joe Hurst and Dick's
'Locomotion'. Rumor has it that this place was basically a home away from
home for dozens of bikers and several of Dick's friends lived here on and off
for several years.


 
The house is
    still there today but it looks like somebody subdivided the lot and built
    apartments in the back where the old garage used to be. That's Dick's two
    boys Clinton and Lee by his third wife Marge
    from Rockford seen in the background.
If you've done much reading about
Chopper history you're probably already familiar with the parts and components
that Allen became famous for. He's credited with developing the 2 into 1 exhaust
system, first using disk brakes on bikes, first using automotive 'mag' and
aluminum  rims on bikes and developing improvements in belt-drive systems.
Many people credit him with being the first guy to run a primary belt drive made
by using belts from the old 6-71 dragster blowers on his own machined pulleys
while living in Rockford in 1963. I've also been told
that he was modifying car wheels and tires to get that 'wide-tire' look back in
64. He actually came up with a lot more than these few items and invented countless
'small' innovations for bikes that have become almost commonplace today. In
general most historians also credit him with being a significant contributor to
what became known as the 'South Bay' chopper 'style'.
This shouldn't be confused with the
other 'South Bay' style that originated up in Frisco. What we're talking about
here is a style of bike that first started to appear between 1959 and 1962 in
that area of southern California bounded on the north by Segundo Beach, on the
south by Redondo Beach and on the east by the 605 freeway. This area was
literally the birthplace of the classic 'long-bike' as most of us know it today.
The region includes the communities of Maywood, Gardenia, Redondo and Manhattan
Beach, Compton, Bellflower, Lawndale, Lakewood, Torrance and Hawthorne. If you
extend the imaginary northern boundary by about  two miles it also
encompasses the shop owned by Ben Hardy and the old shop owned by Ed Roth. This
is where chopper history gets interesting because a lot of the 'legends' only
    lived a few blocks apart from each other. There was a continual exchange of
    ideas between these people and an almost 'communal' sharing of resources,
    parts, materials, labor, services and even complete bikes. It was a lot
    easier to get things done back in those times, in that environment, than it
    is today where every shop and every builder almost seem to be odds most of
    the time.
I first found Dick Allen in 1963 because
I needed somebody to extend a set of old Indian 640 Scout Girder forks and his
name came up as the guy who did this type of work. I lived in Kansas at the time
and he was a little far away. Things didn't come together
at the time and it wasn't until a few years later that I finally managed to hook
up with him. This time I came with an
introduction from Ed Roth and had no problem actually finding the man who wasn't
all that easy to find in the first place since he didn't really have a 'shop' at
the time and worked out of about three different places in Lawndale. Like a lot of us he held down a 'real' job during the day and did his
own work after hours.
I showed him my forks and told him what
I needed done. He took the forks over to a bandsaw and chopped them into six
pieces and handed them back along with some tubing while he made a sketch on the back of some take-out
menu. He told me to just follow the 'instructions' and weld everything back
together per the dimensions he provided and then I'd be good to go. No charge.
Needless to say it didn't work out to
well for
me once I got back home and I ended up butchering those forks from lack of
talent on my end of the equation. Years later I did rebuild those forks once I
learned a little more and as far as I know somebody is still using them on some
bike out there somewhere.
A few months later I needed to have a
stock Harley Springer 'narrowed' and Dick Allen was again the man to see. In
fact Dicks 'main claim to fame' was in narrowing old stock Springers. This isn't a
simple job and basically involves completely 'de-brazing' all the fittings in
the stock forks and then cutting, bending, modifying and re-welding everything
back together again. Dick Allen literally became 'famous' for doing this chore
but few people realize how significant this simple fact is. Ten hours and two
cases of beer later plus a twenty dollar bill and I had a nice set of narrowed
forks and a ton of new 'knowledge'.
The picture below is
    Dick's first 'house/shop' behind what used to be Ken's Trans-Way transmission
    shop where he worked from 65 to around early 1967 when they moved down the
    street to new digs..
 

 
Keep in mind that back in
1965-66  and nobody had yet come up with the idea of building narrow forks
from scratch. At  least nobody but Dick Allen. While he was working on my
forks he was telling me how we could be doing this easier and cheaper if we just
shit-canned the old forks and started from scratch and built a Springer from tubing just using the old
rockers, springs and spring
perch from the stock forks. I had no idea what he was talking about but it sure
sounded good.
In 1967 I had a chance to see his first
set of tube forks based upon this concept and I was immediately sold on the
whole deal and bought parts for two forks sets to take back to Las Vegas plus
some sketches he made so I could build more of my own. We used these sketches to make some of
the
drawings for what we call the 'Rude and Crude Old School Springer' plans.
Ironically Dick didn't bother to actually put his own plans into action until
around 1968.
The ad below, from 1968
    in Roth's little magazine is the first ad Dick ever ran for any of his
    products. The forks are his 'early' version of the straight-leg idea and utilized
    the stock Harley spring perch and upper tree.
 

 
Fast forward to 1971 and Dick Allen
publicly announces the first ever 'completely custom' built narrow Springer forks.
 



This might not seem like a big deal now
but his offering of these forks literally changed the entire concept of building
a custom bike for the average guy on the street who prior to this invention had
to either extend a stock Springer or modify their old hydraulic forks.
Dick advertised the forks as being $395,
as seen in the 1973 ad above but in reality if you went by the shop before he went 'public' you
could pick up a set in the 'raw' for $100. This might seem unrealistically cheap
but keep in mind that you could buy a fairly decent used Big Twin for $600 at
the time.
Ironically, even though Dick Invented
the 'mass-produced' custom chopper Springer in the mid sixties, by the time he
started to run ads several other companies were already selling forks of similar
designs based upon his prototypes which he didn't bother to keep 'secret'. This
really didn't bother him since virtually everybody still knew that an Allen
Springer was the best you could buy so he never wanted for business. In fact he
had to much business most of the time and routinely sold off parts to other
builders. I bought his parts and I know that Al Myer (Sugar Bear) also bought
components from him. I'm sure other local builders did the same. There was
plenty of work to go around and Dick didn't have an 'ego' problem to stand in
his way.
It's worth pointing out at this point
that there was, back then, and still is today, an entire Chopper Industry made
up of individuals and small shops who never bother to advertise their products
or services yet they're all overloaded with work. The business model is simple.
It's called supporting your local craftsmen. Stop by the shop, bring some beer
and lay out your specifications for what you need made, or better yet make it
yourself if you have the skills. It just kills me to see people talking about
building a 'custom' bike but they buy everything on the Internet with a credit
card. They end up with what I call a 'Bolt-on Special'.
Almost all my contact with Dick revolved
around front-ends, either Girders or Springers so that's what I want to talk
about here because I don't know anything about the other aspects of his work. We
did compare notes on frame building and we had some agreement on certain aspects
but a lot of disagreements on other aspects. At one time I had a copy of my old
frame blueprints that he 'marked-up' to show me how to run what was called a
'raised transmission' but I lost those a long time ago. 
With respect to Springer history I do
think that Dick Allen was, without a doubt, the definitive originator of what
most of us call the 'California Ultra-Narrow Springer'. We even have to go a
little beyond that statement because the Allen Springers, in any of their
various configurations, actually 'worked' and worked exceedingly well. He really
didn't have any competition in this field at all and no matter how many
companies sprang up making forks the 'Allen Products' fork set was never
equaled.
The main reason for this wasn't because
he made nice hardware. In fact his forks from a quality standpoint were about
average. The big difference was that he understood Springer geometry and tuning
and nobody else realized the importance of this simple fact. Even the factory
mechanics didn't understand how to properly tune Springers.
If you do a lot of reading you've no
doubt seen where many of Allen's 'ideas' were pirated and marketed by other
companies and some of this is true and some of it is false. Dick had a lot of
irons in the fire and a lot of friends so he often developed an idea, made the
pass, and then let somebody else carry the ball. His exhaust systems were made
and marketed by E.M.E. and this was all on the up and up. He let several people
    build Springers virtually identical to his own without asking for royalties.
    His attitude was basically that whoever actually fabricated something got
    the pay for it. That's not to say that he wasn't ripped-off. Every time he
    was in jail and then again after the bike accident his shops were pretty
    much 'cleared-out'. Sometimes he was forced to sell parts and tools to cover
    legal and medical expenses but a lot of people took advantage of these
    situations. He never cried over spilt-milk and just keep moving ahead.
Before we switch to the second page of
this article I'd like to just post some photographs from other sites that we've
mentioned earlier. Please visit these sites as they have a ton of good
worthwhile info about Dick Allen for those interested in the man.
The first shot is from the Chris Kallas
blog and it shows Dick (on the right) on a typical ride but what's interesting
is that he riding two-up with a 'guy'. Nobody but Dick Allen could get away with
doing this and to top it off that guy looks to me like Bruce Parrish. Maybe I'm
mistaken but it sure looks like him. Could also possibly be David Mann if this
pic is of a Hangmen ride.


If anybody
    knows the particulars on this snapshot call or email me as I'm sure there is
    a ton of history behind this particular run. One of Dick's 'business'
    problems was that he liked to ride more than he liked to build. In fact he
    preferred to build and work on what we call 'rider bikes' far more than
    fancy show bikes and this inclination alienated a lot of the so-called
    'custom builders' (and potential customers) that were his peers.
(UPDATE: I did receive
    some info about the photo above and it was taken at a funeral in Santa Cruz
    and is actually a 'still' taken from a movie made by Gary Partlow and John
    Carney).
Dick and some of his
    friends would occasionally ride up to Searchlight Nevada on Friday nights
    back in the early sixties for a little party time at the Casino. Vegas was
    not a biker-friendly town so if you wanted some of the freedom of Nevada but
    you rode a bike you usually stopped short of town at Searchlight and visited
    the El Ray for a little action.
 

 
The El Ray and a lot of
    the other 'clubs' were officially closed somewhere around 1965 when
    Searchlight was sucked-up into Clark County but all they really did was go
    underground. I actually moved way out on Blue Diamond road south of Vegas
    proper just so I'd be closer to Searchlight since this is where most of the
    Bikers would congregate on weekends. I met my first wife there, but at a
    burger drive-in and not the El Ray.
Actually the ride up
    from Los Angles to Vegas is a truly incredible bike trip and one that can
    typically made at 'full speed' so that stretch of highway was basically a
    race track for guys with hot bikes. Back in the day, once you crossed over
    into Nevada there was no speed limit so it was 'balls-to-the-wall', may the
    fastest iron horse win. Dick's regular crew on some of these runs was Mike
    Vils, Chuckie, Buzzard, Foot and Tiny.
I don't want to break
    away from writing about Dick Allen but but when I was contacted by Darcy I
    broke open some old boxes that had stored since the early seventies and the
    memories started to flow back into my mind. Sometimes we get 'dulled' by the
    passage of time and forget what the 'old days' were really like.
Looking back now, that
    period of time for me, as a baby-boomer', from 62 to 65 was an almost
    'perfect time' to be alive. There was nothing that we couldn't do and the
    'Man' pretty much turned a blind eye to it all. Things started to change in
    late 66 or early 67 and paranoia started to set in everywhere. If your were
    a Biker in 65 you were 'cool'. If you were a Biker in 67 you were 'meat' for
    the political grist mill. In 67 The city of Hermosa Beach actually tried to
    introduce a complete ban on motorcycles within the city limits. It only got worse as time moved forward. By
    70
    if you rode a 'modified' bike you literally became a moving target for law
    enforcement. By 1973 I personally believe that most bikers were routinely
    stopped just because they rode motorcycles. If you just so happened to also
    have 'long hair' you were shit-up-a creek.
I was almost beaten to
    death by a Cop in 69 just for parking in the 'wrong' spot but a few Angels
    helped me out otherwise I wouldn't be here today. I wasn't even riding a
    chopped bike as all I had then was my 'commuter', a small Triumph. A lot of
    people, mostly the Chopper magazine folks, still today, try to 'smooth-over'
    the issues between the law and Bikers that existed between 67 and 74. The
    younger guys today have no idea of how lucky they are to have missed all of
    that drama. We had cops bust into one of our camps in Big Sur and burn our
    bikes with the excuse that there must have been a fuel leak that got into
    the campfire. The men were taken to court, charged with violating the
    ancient 'Mann Act' of trafficking young women for prostitution across state
    lines. The women we had with us were charged with prostitution. Fortunately
    all charges were dropped in court and our 'gang' was dropped at the state
    line with no bikes and no money.
This wasn't an unusual
    situation for Bikers back then and I'm sure almost everybody who lived
    through those times have similar horror stories they can recount.
Allen was trying to do
    business right in the middle of this period of so-called 'social transition'
    and Dick Allen was not what you'd call a 'politically correct' type of guy
    by any stretch of the imagination so he had his ups and downs with law
    enforcement over the course of several years. Probably the worse run-in occurred
    in 1973 when he was busted for riding around on one of his Cobra Trikes than
    had a pot leaf laminated in under the clear-coat. He ended up serving
    six-months of a five year sentence for 'possession'. That kind of gives you
    an idea of how bad things were back then between the law and Bikers.
This next shot is a
    classic and it's been spread all around the web. I suppose the guys at the
    boutique discussion boards would call this 'Grunge style' so it could be
    properly classified. I'm still not to sure I understand some of these
    various 'boards' as they seem to be caught up in styles and fashions more so
    than in building or riding bikes but I guess I'm just behind the times.
 

As you can see Dick did
    not have a big ego and he wasn't much of what we'd call a 'fashionista'. For
    folks that never knew Dick in person you can get a slight inkling of how big
    this guy was when you look at the size of his hand over that grip handle and
    size of his boot.
Joe Hurst used to call
    this 'iteration' of Dicks putt, as seen above, the 'Rat Fuck' bike. This has
    to be a relatively 'late' photo as it clearly shows the 'fully-developed'
    concept of his early production version of the mass produced Springer. I'm
    guessing this is from 1968 or 69. Somebody has to know the history behind
    this snapshot and I hope that they'll send me an email. This is probably the
    first version of the bike that came to be known as 'Loco-Motion'. One
    tell-tale is the swastika clutch pedal. Even though this is a black and
    white photo you can easily see that the 'chips' on this frame match the
    'chips' seen in other pictures of what people call the 'red' frame' bike.
    There is the big headlamp, the 'Z' bars, the band where the tie-wrap used to
    be located and biggest tell-tale are the cheap aluminum foot pegs.
This this next photo
    was taken in the shop around 1970 and clearly shows one of the Cobra trikes
    being mocked-up about a year before it supposedly existed. What's
    interesting is the bike frame sitting on top of the trike frame.

This particular Trike
    was never finished and I haven't run across anybody who knows what happened
    to the motor. The bike on the right is one of the various incarnations of
    'Loco-Motion II', still wearing the old tank paint from Nasty Nez's (Nez
    Nesbit of Phase III) original 'Loco-Motion'. Fortunately this is an old
    Polaroid so we have a date stamp of November 1970.
There is some
    controversy over this particular frame. Some have said this frame actually
    became 'White Bear' owned by Joe Hurst while others have told me it became
    'Loco-Motion'. I'm inclined to believe that the later story is true since
    Joe's bike had the sidecar hoops cut and molded while Dick left them stock on
    his frame. Whatever happened we know that both Joe and Dick road this bike,
    as seen here, on several occasions. I think I've seen Joe quoted as saying
    that it was basically a 'shop bike'.
Here's a shot taken
    from another web site and credited with being Joe Hurst 'jamming' on the 'Rat bike' and it's pretty easy to see that it's
    the red frame bike.

 
But here's another
    picture of a bike that people also called Dicks 'Rat' bike and it's the
    cradle frame bike with the black tank seen sitting on top of the trike
    frame.
 

 
The red-framed bike
    with Nez's old tank on it was Dicks 'Research & Development' bike and it
    went through a bunch of evolutions over time. The picture below shows it
    with a Vincent motor installed.

For fans of Dick Allen
    there remains some controversy about 'Loco-Motion' and 'White Bear' with
    respect to one another since Joe was quoted at some website as saying that
    Dick 'liked White Bear so much that he copied it'. I seriously doubt that
    Joe actually made that statement since it's fairly obvious from the record
    that Loco-Motion was being ridden by Dick before White bear
    came into existence. At one web site Joe is quoted as saying
    that they stopped along the way during one of their cross country trips to give some
    guy a deposit for building the frame for White bear. This is another 'story'
    that gets changed around depending on who you're talking with as several
    people have told me that the frame for 'White Bear' was the same frame that
    Joe used on his older 'Hustler' bike.
What a lot of people
    don't realize nowadays is that most builders back then took in almost any
    type of fab or welding jobs that came in the front door just so they could
    do this kind of stuff at the backdoor. Even the best fabricators could not
    make a living just by building bikes and if you were lucky enough to get a
    job at one of these shops you'd likely be welding bumper-hitches or making
    BBQ grilles to pay the rent. The 'good' work usually happened 'after hours'.
    Dick's sign outside his first two shops simply said " Dick Allen,
    Choppers and Welding".
Allen never saw a bike
    as being a 'Bar-Hopper'. For him riding was serious business and long
    distance riding was one of his passions. He 'invented' the auxiliary fuel
    tank for long-haul runs and the well circulated photo below shows his 'rig'
    on Loco-Motion sitting out front of the shop in Gardena around 1975.

At one time Allen and
    some of his friends started riding to Sturgis via Rockford, which a pretty
    long detour, but it became an annual run and eventually one of  the
    cycle magazines teamed up with him and they officially called this the 'Dick
    Allen Dash' which became a fairly significant long distance endurance run. Dick
    actually missed the start of the first run and had to play 'catch-up' with
    the rest of the pack only to end up having his bike stolen in Denver.

    Dick even 'invented' a whole bunch of specialized tools but he actually
    tried to commercially sell his version of an engine/tranny work fixture.
    Like everything else he did it was copied and made and sold cheaper by
    dozens of other people.

As far as I know Dick
    was never a member of any official 'club' but if anybody organized a club
    ride Dick Allen was usually invited. He was one of the few 'Lone-Wolves' who
    was seldom alone on the road. From what I gather he had some close friends
    in the Hangmen and El Forastero clubs. I know several of the Hangmen had his
    front ends on their bikes. Of course looking back now I suppose anybody who
    was serious about riding back then had one of his forks sets.
Dick Allen's memory
    seems close to most of us builders today who knew him as a friend but we
    need to keep in mind that most of us who knew him, those of us who are still
    living, weren't actually part of his original peer group. Allen was a product of the
    Bobber and Chopper builders of the fifties, not the sixties as we normally
    associate him. He started building bikes in 1950. This is a fact a lot of us
    tend to forget. By the time the sixties rolled around he already had a lot
    of experience and by the seventies he had firmly established his own unique
    'style'. For many of us 'Boomers' Allen was a living legend, a mentor and a
    friend who always had time, to give you some of his own time, which is a
    rare thing.
This is one reason that
    Dick seemed to 'attract' a huge following of 'up and comers' way back in the
    old days. A lot of these 'youngsters' would eventually become legends
    themselves thanks, in part, to some of Dick's wisdom. 
Here's a great picture
    of Dick taken around 1971.
 

 
The guy with his back
    to the camera is Randy Smith, when he was working for Custom Chopper
    Magazine under the pseudonym of 'Bud Wiser'. That's Randy's press camera
    that Dick's holding. Dick's wearing another 'shop' shirt. I don't think I
    ever saw him in a 'civilian' shirt but he seemed to have an endless supply
    of uniforms from a variety of 'businesses' for some reason.
While we're on the
    subject of Dick Allen and the media I think that folks need to understand
    once and for all that chopper magazines exist for only one purpose and
    that's to make money from advertising. The mags don't care one bit about the
    'content' that goes into the rag so long as each issues sells more
    advertising revenue. That's just a fact of life.
When it came to Dick
    Allen however many, if not all of the stringers, photographers, staff writers
    and even some of the publishers were drawn to him like a magnet even though
    he usually refused to do any significant advertising of his products. His
    shop became a hang-out for media types over the years because they got to
    see the so-called 'Biker lifestyle' lived out before their very eyes. Keep
    in mind that the vast majority of magazine people back in the day didn't
    even ride bikes. I think I remember about tree staff writers who actually
    owned a motorcycle. I know of several articles written about some of Dicks
    products and related work that have never been published simply because he
    wouldn't pay for advertising space in some magazine. From day one Dick
    always felt that the best advertising was via 'word of mouth' and he stayed
    with that concept to the very end.
One ex-magazine guy I
    talked with said his old outfit probably had over a hundred Dick Allen
    related pictures in the archives that will never be published or released to
    the public.
Another interesting
    thing about Dick Allen was that he never really 'promoted' his own business,
    at least not within the time period I knew him. I never saw any Dick Allen 'bling'
    like decals, shirts or hats. In fact he seldom ran any magazine ads, beyond
    the few other people have posted at various sites. On the other hand he was
    pretty active in promoting other businesses owned by his friends and even
    had their shop decals on a lot of his builds. You'll never find a 'Dick
    Allen Products' decal anywhere because he never made any. You won't find any
    'Dick Allen' shirts or hats anywhere because he never made any. The vintage
    ones you find today were made by people who did so without Dicks
    endorsement. As far as I know nobody making some of this Dick Allen bling
    nowadays has even asked the family permission to do so.
Most, if not all, of
    Dicks original group of friends are long gone and those of us who remain and
    had a chance to ride with him were his second tier of friends, the younger
    guys who hung around the shops in the late sixties and early seventies while
    he worked on our projects. This is one reason that there are two different
    levels of old stories about Dick. One level, almost mythic, are the stories
    handed down from the 'old guys' and then there is the second level that a
    lot of us can recount from first hand experiences. Interesting is the fact
    that you can ask a single question to a group of his surviving friends and
    get numerous completely different answers.
Some of this dichotomy
    can be laid directly at the doorstep of the Chopper Rags back in the day who
    literally 'made-up' many of the 'stories' they published. These 'Mags' also
    stirred up the shit when they could and a good example of this was an
    article about Dick Allen challenging anybody anywhere with any type of bike
    to race him cross country from L.A. To Chicago. Needless to say this stirred
    up the pot in the motorcycle industry and a lot of people were just looking
    to get some good publicity from beating Dick at his own game. I need to
    inject some preamble here as Dick had a reputation, for decades, of having
    the fastest bikes on the planet so he was always a big target of the
    so-called 'performance crowd' in the industry. I can say from personal
    experience that he did have some incredibly fast bikes but it was actually
    his riding style that won him races against much faster bikes. To put it
    simply he just ran 'flat-out', 'balls-to-the-wall' on any and all roads and
    in the twisters he usually beat his competition by shear 'guts' alone.
I have no idea who
    actually won that race as it eventually disintegrated into just a big party
    but by mid point Dick was already a full day ahead of the rest of the pack
    despite getting started a day late.
 

You can click on the
    picture to see a larger image of the magazine article.
Even today, for his
    friends, it's sometimes hard to separate myth and legend from fact largely because
    Dick's life was almost mythic even while he was still alive. This is in
    stark contrast to what you see today concerning other 'famous' builders who
    will probably never be remembered for doing much of anything except building
    a couple of show bikes on some television program.
What is somewhat ironic
    is that a couple of people I've called to gather more information about Dick
    actually want to be 'paid' to tell their 'stories'. I seriously doubt that
    these types of people could have really been his friends.
Darcy summed it up
    perfectly when she told me that Dick experimented, improved and then built
    Choppers so that other people could ride and enjoy having a properly
    modified bike and not some monstrosity built by a celebrity. He cared not
    for fame or fortune and sought out neither during his lifetime. He didn't
    run a shop that sold glitz and bling for inflated prices. He didn't rip
    people off for 'services' and basically he lived by the 'Golden Rule' of Do
    unto others as you would have them do unto you'. Dick was into bikes for the
    pure joy and excitement of the 'Ride' and this is probably the real reason
    he became a legend. Somebody in the industry was once quoted as saying that
    Dick's 'Word' was better than any printed legal 'guarantee' offered by any
    manufacturer anywhere at anytime.
 

 
After a wild and
    exciting life Dick Allen died peacefully in his sleep at Chuck Pilkington's
    house on August 20, 1983 as
    the result of a brain injury received in an auto accident and then
    aggravated by his1981 cycle accident. He is missed
    by literally hundreds of people.
Darcy has started a
    non-profit organization called "The Dick Allen Memorial
    Foundation" and funds raised by the group will go towards helping
    Bikers and families of Bikers who have had an accident or other bad runs of
    luck. If you'd like to donate anything to the group contact Darcy via email
    at darcyallen3@aol.com Donations can
    be in any form including cash, goods or services and will be tax deductible.
    Darcy is also putting together a book about her father so anybody who knew
    Dick and has a story to tell should contact her. The objective is to prepare
    a biography where each of his friends will have a separate chapter so the
    final work will be a testimony to Dick's life and the lives of those who
    rode with him.

Dick’s biz card.
After watching “The History of the Chopper” Jesse did on the 
Discovery Channel, it brought back memories of Dick Allen back 
in the day.


     I was fresh out of the Marine Corps in 1971. I bought a 
H-D three wheeler and chopped it up. Saw the Dick Allen 
Springer front-end around the South Bay and had to have one. 
But I could not find Dick Allen. He must have been in jail again. I 
did find out about a machine shop on Artesia Blvd, in South 
Redondo Beach, where Dick worked in his early years. It turned 
out to be true. 



 Pops at 3 rivers run, Bob T in background.
I went in and asked the old machinist for a Dick Allen 
Springer front-end. He said, “Go ask Dick Allen.”




 My response, “Dick is nowhere to be found, heard he was in 
jail.”

 He yells back, “sound’s about right.” 

I Came back the next day and went over the build for the 
new Springer. A few weeks went by when I got the call and the 
front-end was done. It still was a Dick Allen Springer because 
this old guy worked hand ‘n hand with Dick at the beginnings of 
the front end. 




The Springer was in the corner of the shop. Going over to it, 
I yelled, “Where’s the chrome.”

 His come back was, “Does this look like a chrome shop?”

 Off to find a chrome shop I go. Then I mounted it on the 
old trike.

 


 Dick Allen narrow springer front end side view—a 
classic.
Eights months later I sold the Trike for enough money to 
buy my new Shovelhead. As time rolled on I met Dick Allen with 
some of the South Bay guys I was riding with. Going to his shop 
was always an adventure. I learned always bring beer or other 
party favors with you; this was a good trade for work. 



 Dick Allen collector

I picked up a 12 spoke, 15-inch mag (Magnesium rim off 
drag cars) for the rear of the rigid Shovel. All of us knew him as 
“POP”. He was the only one, at the time who adapted the car 
wheel for a motorcycle. Being a 15-inch wheel there was no 
motorcycle tires on the market, so we ran a car tire, a 155/15 or 
165/15. I ran a 155/15 Pirelli radial with low PSI for better 
handling. 



Dick was the first to introduce large tires. This 
was a car radial 15.
Dick was definitely ahead of his time. He developed the Belt 
Drive, Disc Brakes, the long narrow Springer front-end that 
worked, Stainless steel one piece oil lines, 2-into-1 exhaust 
collector and many other items which he never got credit for. 
Pop lived the life to the fullest each day.



12 spoke mag with a 15515 Pirelli

 I am still running the 12 spoke mag today except with 15-
inch Avon tire. His shop was a cool place to hang once in awhile, 
we never knew what he would come up with next. Once he took 
a Chevy 327 and put it in a H-D trike, rolled out and hit the 
throttle. It had so much torque it twisted and threw the trike into 
a telephone pole. Just  another day at the shop.




12 spoke mag with an Avon.
One thing that stands out was about 1974. We left the South 
Bay for the Kern River Run on Memorial Day weekend. Meeting 
up with a bunch of the So. Cal. Guys, we stayed a day at Kern 
River and than split to Three Rivers up north where there was a 
party on someone’s property. Can’t quite remember. A band was 
playing and there were lots of party favors. Everyone was loaded 
to the sky. 




At night a barn fire was blazing, I remember everyone was 
dancing in the blaze of the fire including Pop. It was one hell of 
a weekend run, one of many. Monday night it was homeward 
bound for all. Running in the holiday traffic I missed the turn-off 
for fuel and ended riding by myself in this madness home. But 
then, in my rear view mirror, I noticed a light flicking in the 
distance moving fast down the white line of traffic. It was Pop, 
he slowed that old Knucklehead down looked over at me said, 
“Hey kid, lets go.”



Classic Pan from the era.
 I was in my early 20s then. Off we went down the white line 
so fast the cars looked blurred. I swear it was the Twilight Zone. 
I guess I was as loaded as Pop. I will never forget this. Dick Allen 
was a pioneer for the industry. He was a true biker and rebel.

 

REST IN PEACE
--Bob T

                   Yep, i remember Dick. I had a Sportster that needed a new lower end. Chuck did the work for me. as I recall. Joe bought locomotion from Dick. Don't know what happened to it after that. i remember the Cobra trike caused dick a lot of trouble, cause of the marijuana leaf that was placed on the fiberglass body before it was clearcoated. I remember partying with Dick and he was complaining about an infection on his foot...next thing you know, amputation. It was about that time I became acquainted with Richard Noriega, the owner of Fat's Sportster Haven. My how time flies, eh?

Dick Allen Chopper Hero





As a kid buying chopper magazines certain individuals took on rock star status.  One of those guys was Dick Allen.   Any time a magazine featured something related to Dick you knew it would be cool.Dick's bike as featured in Choppers Magazine Oct. 68.  Here you can see how the secondary sissy bar bolts to the fender and at the bar up top.Take note of the art and also that skinny 26" front wheel.During this period, not too many ran a stock bobbed Harley fender on this style of chopper.Really tall stacks,  ...a slight crack?!It's interesting how time changes things.  At that time, many guys dumped their panheads in a flash for the better performance of a shovel.     So why did Dick go from a pan to a shovel then latter a knuckle?  Some say knucks are the best.An earlier photo of what appears to be the same bike.   Forks are early Sportster that look to be fitted with slugs for extension (check the area between trees).    The trees look raked and the lower one still has the fork boot mounts attached.  The antique 26" front rim and spokes was still black at this time.A later shot of Dick on his knuckle "Locomotion", sporting some of his trademark features: 12 spoke 15"mag with car radial tire, swooping sissy bar support, long narrow springer, 2 to 1 collector exhaust, cobra seat, tall z-bars, and Sportster headlight.  These features became almost a standard for the South Bay (beach cities L.A.).Ed Newton's art for Roth's t-shirts and decals. Tall pipes, Indian forks, tall skinny front wheel and a crazy bearded rider.  Was this inspired by the wheelie incident or  drawn before and later modified for the article?  This could have been Dick, as Newton's California Chopper art also seems to be a depiction of Beautiful Buzzard.The engine here is a shovel and the tanks match Dick's paint.  Only Ed Newton would know the back story.

Great writeup on a great builder and innovator. Question- is the tank on Locomotion that is attached to the sissy bar an aux fuel tank?





August 9, 2009 at 9:12 PM












Chris K
said...



Thanks. Yes that's an aux tank. It's another feature that some South Bay bikes ran. I'm not sure of the origins of this one but I've seen several made from stainless steel fire extinguishers. My neighbor who had one said, "it was because they wouldn't spark if you went down".

Pat
said...



Fascinating!! I`ve looked at hundreds of chopper pics over the years and don`t recall seeing an aux tank. It really makes sense for a biker who wants to run a small tank and not have to be in range of a gas station every 45 minutes of riding. The reinforced sissy bars on Dicks bikes come would be necessary to support the weight of a full aux tank plus gear. From what I have been able to gather, Dick rode the hell out of his bikes- they all look bitchin` but are total functional at the same time (necessary when one actually RIDES thousands of miles across deserts, mountains, etc). I think that mindset has been missing from the bike scene since Dick passed. Thanks again for the great write-up- I`m hungry for every scrap of info I can get on Dick and his bikes.

I'll try to get some shots of bikes with aux tanks and dig up what I can on Mr. Allen

Richard Anthony Allen (born March 8, 1942) is a former American Major League Baseball (MLB) player and Rhythm and Blues (R&B) singer. He played 15 seasons in the major leagues as a first baseman, third baseman, and outfielder most notably for the Philadelphia Phillies and Chicago White Sox, and is ranked among his sport's top offensive producers of the 1960s and early 1970s.
Allen was an All-Star for seven seasons. He won the 1964 National League Rookie of the Year Award and the 1972 American League Most Valuable Player Award. He also led the American League (AL) in home runs for two seasons, led the NL in slugging percentage one season and the AL two seasons, and led both leagues in on-base percentage each for one season. His .534 career slugging percentage ranks among the highest in an era marked by low offensive production.
Allen's older brother Hank was a reserve outfielder for three AL teams, and his younger brother Ron was briefly a first baseman with the 1972 St. Louis Cardinals.
In 2014, Allen appeared for the first time as a candidate on the National Baseball Hall of Fame's Golden Era Committee election ballot[1] for possible Hall of Fame consideration in 2015. He and the other candidates all missed getting elected by the committee.[2] The Committee meets and votes on 10 selected candidates from the 1947 to 1972 era every three years. Allen was one vote short of the required 12 votes needed for election.[3]

MLB career[edit]
Philadelphia Phillies[edit]
Dick Allen hit a baseball with an authority Philadelphia fans had not seen since Chuck Klein and Jimmie Foxx. Phillies scout John Ogden convinced the Phillies to sign Allen in 1960 for a $70,000 bonus. John Ogden played for the International League Baltimore Orioles from 1919 to 1925 under Jack Dunn, the discoverer of Babe Ruth, and later pitched against Ruth in the American League. Ogden stated in a Philadelphia Bulletin story printed on July 1, 1969, that Dick Allen was the only player he ever saw who hit a ball as hard as Babe Ruth.[4]
Allen's playing career got off to a turbulent start as he faced racial harassment while playing for the Phillies' minor league affiliate in Little Rock; residents staged protest parades against Allen, the local team's first black player. Nevertheless, he led the league in total bases.
His first season in the majors, 1964, ranks among the greatest rookie seasons ever.[5] He led the league in runs (125), triples (13), extra base hits (80) and total bases (352); he finished in the top five in batting average (.318), slugging average (.557), hits (201), and doubles (38); and won Rookie of the Year. Playing for the first time at third base, he led the league with 41 errors. Along with outfielder Johnny Callison and pitchers Chris Short and Jim Bunning, Allen led the Phillies to a six-and-a-half game hold on first place with 12 games to play in an exceptionally strong National League. The 1964 Phillies then lost ten straight games and finished tied for second place. The Phillies lost the first game of the streak to the Cincinnati Reds when Chico Ruiz stole home with Frank Robinson batting for the game's only run. In Allen's autobiography (written with Tim Whitaker), Crash: The Life and Times of Dick Allen, Allen stated that the play "broke our humps".[6] Despite the Phillies' collapse, Allen hit .438 with 5 doubles, 2 triples, 3 home runs and 11 RBI in those last 12 games.
Allen hit a home run off the Cardinals' Ray Washburn in 1965 which he cleared Connie Mack Stadium's left center field roof Coke sign. That home run, an estimated 529-footer, inspired Willie Stargell to say: "Now I know why they (the Phillies fans) boo Richie all the time. When he hits a home run, there's no souvenir."[7]
While playing for Philadelphia, Allen appeared on several All-Star teams including the 1965–67 teams (in the latter of these three games, he hit a home run off Dean Chance). He led the league in slugging (.632), OPS (1.027) and extra base hits (75) in 1966.
Non-baseball incidents soon marred Allen's Philadelphia career. In July 1965, he got into a fistfight with fellow Phillie Frank Thomas. According to two teammates who witnessed the fight, Thomas swung a bat at Allen, hitting him in the shoulder. Johnny Callison said, "Thomas got himself fired when he swung that bat at Richie. In baseball you don't swing a bat at another player—ever." Pat Corrales confirmed that Thomas hit Allen with a bat and added that Thomas was a "bully" known for making racially divisive remarks. Allen and his teammates were not permitted to give their side of the story under threat of a heavy fine. The Phillies released Thomas the next day. That not only made the fans and local sports writers see Allen as costing a white player his job, but freed Thomas to give his version of the fight.[8] In an hour-long interview aired December 15, 2009, on the MLB Network's Studio 42 with Bob Costas, Allen asserted that he and Thomas are in fact good friends now.[9]
Allen's name was a source of controversy: he had been known since his youth as "Dick" to family and friends, but for reasons which are still somewhat obscure, the media referred to him upon his arrival in Philadelphia as "Richie", possibly a conflation with the longtime Phillies star Richie Ashburn.[citation needed] After leaving the Phillies, he asked to be called "Dick", saying Richie was a little boy's name. In his dual career as an R&B singer, the label on his records with the Groovy Grooves firm slated him as "Rich" Allen.[10]
Some of the Phillies' own fans, known for being tough on hometown players even in the best of times, exacerbated Allen's problems. Initially the abuse was verbal, with obscenities and racial epithets. Eventually Allen was greeted with showers of fruit, ice, refuse, and even flashlight batteries as he took the field. He began wearing his batting helmet even while playing his position in the field, which gave rise to another nickname, "Crash Helmet", shortened to "Crash".[citation needed]
He almost ended his career in 1967 after mangling his throwing hand by pushing it through a car headlight. Allen was fined $2,500 and suspended indefinitely in 1969 when he failed to appear for the Phillies twi-night doubleheader game with the New York Mets. Allen had gone to New Jersey in the morning to see a horse race, and got caught in traffic trying to return.[11] (He was reinstated, but wanted to be traded. Due to problems in having a trade made right then, he agreed to finish the 1969 season with the Phillies.[citation needed])
St. Louis Cardinals and Los Angeles Dodgers[edit]
Allen finally had enough, and demanded the Phillies trade him. They sent him to the Cardinals in a trade before the 1970 season. Even this deal caused controversy, though not of Allen's making, since Cardinals outfielder Curt Flood refused to report to the Phillies as part of the trade. (Flood then sued baseball in an unsuccessful attempt to overthrow the reserve clause and to be declared a free agent.) Coincidentally, the player the Phillies received as compensation for Flood not reporting, Willie Montañez, hit 30 home runs as a 1971 rookie to eclipse Dick Allen's Phillies rookie home run record of 29, set in 1964.[12]
Allen earned another All-Star berth in St. Louis, and his personal problems seemed to abate. The Cardinals even acceded to his wishes regarding his name, as Cardinals broadcaster Jack Buck made a point from game one of calling him "Dick Allen."
Decades before Mark McGwire, Dick Allen entertained the St. Louis fans with some long home runs, at least one of them landing in the seats above the club level in left field. As Jack Buck said at the time, "Some of the folks in the stadium club might have choked on a chicken leg when they saw that one coming!"[citation needed] Nevertheless, the Cardinals traded Allen to the Los Angeles Dodgers before the 1971 season for 1969 NL Rookie of the Year Ted Sizemore and catcher Bob Stinson, the LA Dodgers 1966 first round draft pick. Allen had a relatively quiet season in 1971 although he hit .295 for the Dodgers.
Chicago White Sox[edit]
The Dodgers traded Allen to the White Sox for pitcher Tommy John prior to the 1972 season. For various reasons, Allen's previous managers had shuffled him around on defense, playing him at first base, third base, and the outfield in no particular order—a practice which almost certainly weakened his defensive play, and which may have contributed to his frequent injuries, not to mention his perceived bad attitude. Sox manager Chuck Tanner's low-key style of handling ballplayers made it possible for Allen to thrive, for a while, on the South Side. He decided to play Allen exclusively at first base, which allowed him to concentrate on hitting. That first year, his first in the American League, Allen almost single-handedly lifted the entire team to second place in the AL West, as he led the league in home runs (37) (setting a team record), RBI (113), walks (99), on-base percentage (.422), slugging average (.603), and OPS (1.023), while winning a well-deserved MVP award. However, the Sox fell short at the end and finished  5 1⁄2 games behind the World Series–bound Oakland Athletics.
Allen's feats during his years with the White Sox—particularly in that MVP season of 1972—are spoken of reverently by South Side fans who credit him with saving the franchise for Chicago (it was rumored to be bound for St. Petersburg or Seattle at the time). His powerful swing sent home runs deep into some of cavernous old Comiskey Park's farthest reaches, including the roof and even the distant (445 ft) center field bleachers, a rare feat at one of baseball's most pitcher-friendly stadiums. On July 31, 1972, Allen became the first player in baseball's "modern era" to hit two inside-the-park home runs in one game. Both homers were hit off Bert Blyleven in the White Sox' 8-1 victory over the Minnesota Twins at Metropolitan Stadium. On July 6, 1974, at Detroit's Tiger Stadium, he lined a homer off the roof facade in deep left-center field at a linear distance of approximately 415 feet (126 m) and an altitude of 85 feet (26 m). Anecdotal and mathematical evidence agreed that Allen's clout would've easily surpassed 500 ft (150 m) on the fly.[13]
The Sox were favored by many to make the playoffs in 1973, but those hopes were dashed due in large measure to the fractured fibula that Allen suffered in June. (He tried to return five weeks after injuring the leg in a collision with Mike Epstein of the A's, but the pain ended his season after just one game in which he batted 3-for-5.) In 1974, despite his making the AL All-Star team in each of the three years with the Sox, Allen's stay in Chicago ended in controversy when he left the team on September 14 with two weeks left in the season. In his autobiography, Allen blamed his feud with third-baseman Ron Santo, who was playing a final, undistinguished season with the White Sox after leaving the crosstown Chicago Cubs.[14]
With Allen's intention to continue playing baseball uncertain, the White Sox reluctantly sold his contract to the Atlanta Braves for only $5,000, despite the fact that he had led the league in home runs, slugging (.563), and OPS (.938). Allen refused to report to the Braves and announced his retirement.
Return to the Phillies[edit]
The Phillies managed to coax Allen out of retirement for the 1975 season. The lay-off and nagging effects of his 1973 broken leg hampered his play. His numbers improved in 1976, a Phillies division winner, as he hit 15 home runs and batted .268 in 85 games. He continued his tape measure legacy during his second go-round with the Phillies. On August 22, 1975, Allen smashed a homer into the seldom reached upperdeck at San Diego's Qualcomm (née Jack Murphy) Stadium.
Oakland Athletics[edit]
Allen played in 54 games and hit 5 HR's with 31 RBI's during his final season for the Oakland Athletics in 1977 before leaving the team abruptly in June of that season.
Music career[edit]
Dick Allen sang professionally in a high, delicate tenor. The tone and texture of his voice has drawn comparisons to Harptones' lead singer Willie Winfield.[15] During Allen's time with the Sixties-era Phillies, he sang lead with a doo-wop group called The Ebonistics. Dick Allen and The Ebonistics sang professionally at Philadelphia night clubs. He once entertained during halftime of an NBA Philadelphia 76ers game. The Philadelphia Inquirer printed a review of his performance: Here came Rich Allen. Flowered shirt. Tie six-inches (152 mm) wide. Hiphugger bell-bottomed pants. A microphone in his hands. Rich Allen, the most booed man in Philadelphia from April to October, when Eagles coach Joe Kuharich takes over, walked out in front of 9,557 people at the Spectrum last night to sing with his group, The Ebonistics, and a most predictable thing happened. He was booed. Two songs later though, a most unpredictable thing happened. They cheered Rich Allen. They cheered him as warmly as they have ever cheered him for a game-winning home run.[16]
Although his music career was not as substantial or long-lasting as that of Milwaukee Braves outfielder Arthur Lee Maye, Allen gained lasting praise for a recording on the Groovy Grooves label titled, "Echoes of November." The song is featured in the Philles official hundred-year anniversary video and the novel '64 Intruder.[17] In 2010, Brazilian pop star Ana Volans rerecorded "Echoes of November;" her rendition sold briskly in Brazil. (The CD's jacket contains a dedication to Dick Allen and his Hall of Fame candidacy.)[18]
Hall of Fame candidacy[edit]
Nearly forty years after retiring, Allen remains a much discussed and still controversial ballplayer. An increasing number of Baseball historians regard him as the best player not inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame.[19] Allen appeared on the Hall of Fame's 2014 Golden Era Committee ballot (the committee votes every three years since 2011 when Ron Santo was elected by the committee) of 10 selected candidates (selected by a committee of the Baseball Writers' Association of America) from the 1947 to 1972 era[1] for consideration of Hall of Fame enshrinement in 2015. Allen and Tony Oliva were both one vote short of the required 12 votes by the committee which elected none of the candidates.[20]
Sabermetrician Bill James rated Dick Allen as the second-most controversial player in baseball history, behind Rogers Hornsby.[21] James called Allen's autobiography, Crash, "one of the best baseball books in recent years".[22] For many years Allen held the distinction of the highest slugging percentage among players eligible for but not in the National Baseball Hall of Fame. This only ended in 2006, when Albert Belle became eligible but was not elected.
Allen Barra wrote in his Wall Street Journal sports column that "A growing body of baseball historians think that Dick Allen is the best player eligible for the Hall of Fame." [19] The arguments usually center around his very high career averages, batting (.292), slugging (.534), and on-base (.378). They also point out that he began his career during the mid-1960s, a period so dominated by pitchers that it is sometimes called the "second dead ball era" [23] Of the Major League batters with 500 or more career home runs whose play intersected Dick Allen's career at the beginning or end, only Mickey Mantle's lifetime OPS+ of 172 topped Dick Allen's lifetime 156 OPS+ [24] His career OPS+ is the second highest of any retired player not in the Hall of Fame (only topped by Mark Mcgwire). Allen also played some of his career in pitcher-friendly parks such as Busch Memorial Stadium, Dodger Stadium, and Comiskey Park.[25]
In addition to hitting for high offensive percentages, Allen displayed prodigious power. Before scientific weight training, muscle-building dietary supplements, and anabolic steroids, Allen boasted a powerful and muscular physique along the lines of Mickey Mantle and Jimmie Foxx. Indeed, baseball historian Bill Jenkinson ranks Allen with Foxx and Mantle, and just a notch below Babe Ruth, as the four top long-distance sluggers ever to wield a baseball bat.[26] A segment of MLB Network's Prime 9 concurred with Jenkinson's findings. On that same broadcast, Willie Mays stated that Allen hit a ball harder than any player he had ever seen.[27] Dick Allen, like Babe Ruth, hit with a rather heavy bat. Allen's 40-ouncer bucked the Ted Williams-inspired trend of using a light bat for increased bat speed. Allen combined massive strength and body torque to produce bat speed and drive the ball. Two of his drives cleared Connie Mack Stadium's 65-foot-high left field grandstand.[26] Twice Allen cleared that park's 65-foot-high right center field scoreboard: a feat considered virtually impossible for a right-handed hitter.[26]
Detractors of Allen's Hall of Fame credentials argue that his career was not as long as most Hall of Famers, so he does not have the career cumulative numbers that others do. They further argue that the controversies surrounding him negatively impacted his teams.[28] Hall of Fame player Willie Stargell countered with a historical perspective of Dick Allen's time: "Dick Allen played the game in the most conservative era in baseball history. It was a time of change and protest in the country, and baseball reacted against all that. They saw it as a threat to the game. The sportswriters were reactionary too. They didn't like seeing a man of such extraordinary skills doing it his way. It made them nervous. Dick Allen was ahead of his time. His views and way of doing things would go unnoticed today. If I had been manager of the Phillies back when he was playing, I would have found a way to make Dick Allen comfortable. I would have told him to blow off the writers. It was my observation that when Dick Allen was comfortable, balls left the park."[29] The two managers for whom Allen played the longest—Gene Mauch of the Phillies and Chuck Tanner of the White Sox—agreed with Willie Stargell that Allen was not a "clubhouse lawyer" who harmed team chemistry. Asked if Allen's behavior ever had a negative influence on the team, Mauch said, "Never. Dick's teammates always liked him. I'd take him in a minute."[19] According to Tanner, "Dick was the leader of our team, the captain, the manager on the field. He took care of the young kids, took them under his wing. And he played every game as if it was his last day on earth."[30] Hall of Fame player Orlando Cepeda agreed, saying to author Tim Whitaker, "Dick Allen played with fire in his eyes." [31] Hall of Fame teammate Rich Gossage also confirmed Tanner's view. In an interview with USA TODAY Sports, Gossage said: "I've been around the game a long time, and he's the greatest player I've ever seen play in my life. He had the most amazing season (1972) I've ever seen. He's the smartest baseball man I've ever been around in my life. He taught me how to pitch from a hitter's prospective, and taught me how to play the game right. There's no telling the numbers this guy could have put up if all he worried about was stats. The guy belongs in the Hall of Fame." [32] Another of Allen's ex-White Sox teammates, pitcher Stan Bahnsen, said, "I actually thought that Dick was better than his stats. Every time we needed a clutch hit, he got it. He got along great with his teammates and he was very knowledgeable about the game. He was the ultimate team guy."[33] Another Hall of Fame teammate, Mike Schmidt, credited Dick Allen in his book, Clearing the Bases, as his mentor.[34] In Schmidt's biography, written by historian William C. Kashatus, Schmidt fondly recalls Allen mentoring him before a game in Chicago in 1976, saying to him, "Mike, you've got to relax. You've got to have some fun. Remember when you were just a kid and you'd skip supper to play ball? You were having fun. Hey, with all the talent you've got, baseball ought to be fun. Enjoy it. Be a kid again." Schmidt responded by hitting four home runs in that game. Mike Schmidt is quoted in the same book, "The baseball writers used to claim that Dick would divide the clubhouse along racial lines. That was a lie. The truth is that Dick never divided any clubhouse."[35]

Philadelphia Baseball Wall of Fame




Richard Anthony Allen (born March 8, 1942) is a former American Major League Baseball (MLB) player and Rhythm and Blues (R&B) singer. He played 15 seasons in the major leagues as a first baseman, third baseman, and outfielder most notably for the Philadelphia Phillies and Chicago White Sox, and is ranked among his sport's top offensive producers of the 1960s and early 1970s.
Allen was an All-Star for seven seasons. He won the 1964 National League Rookie of the Year Award and the 1972 American League Most Valuable Player Award. He also led the American League (AL) in home runs for two seasons, led the NL in slugging percentage one season and the AL two seasons, and led both leagues in on-base percentage each for one season. His .534 career slugging percentage ranks among the highest in an era marked by low offensive production.
Allen's older brother Hank was a reserve outfielder for three AL teams, and his younger brother Ron was briefly a first baseman with the 1972 St. Louis Cardinals.
In 2014, Allen appeared for the first time as a candidate on the National Baseball Hall of Fame's Golden Era Committee election ballot[1] for possible Hall of Fame consideration in 2015. He and the other candidates all missed getting elected by the committee.[2] The Committee meets and votes on 10 selected candidates from the 1947 to 1972 era every three years. Allen was one vote short of the required 12 votes needed for election.[3]

MLB career[edit]
Philadelphia Phillies[edit]
Dick Allen hit a baseball with an authority Philadelphia fans had not seen since Chuck Klein and Jimmie Foxx. Phillies scout John Ogden convinced the Phillies to sign Allen in 1960 for a $70,000 bonus. John Ogden played for the International League Baltimore Orioles from 1919 to 1925 under Jack Dunn, the discoverer of Babe Ruth, and later pitched against Ruth in the American League. Ogden stated in a Philadelphia Bulletin story printed on July 1, 1969, that Dick Allen was the only player he ever saw who hit a ball as hard as Babe Ruth.[4]
Allen's playing career got off to a turbulent start as he faced racial harassment while playing for the Phillies' minor league affiliate in Little Rock; residents staged protest parades against Allen, the local team's first black player. Nevertheless, he led the league in total bases.
His first season in the majors, 1964, ranks among the greatest rookie seasons ever.[5] He led the league in runs (125), triples (13), extra base hits (80) and total bases (352); he finished in the top five in batting average (.318), slugging average (.557), hits (201), and doubles (38); and won Rookie of the Year. Playing for the first time at third base, he led the league with 41 errors. Along with outfielder Johnny Callison and pitchers Chris Short and Jim Bunning, Allen led the Phillies to a six-and-a-half game hold on first place with 12 games to play in an exceptionally strong National League. The 1964 Phillies then lost ten straight games and finished tied for second place. The Phillies lost the first game of the streak to the Cincinnati Reds when Chico Ruiz stole home with Frank Robinson batting for the game's only run. In Allen's autobiography (written with Tim Whitaker), Crash: The Life and Times of Dick Allen, Allen stated that the play "broke our humps".[6] Despite the Phillies' collapse, Allen hit .438 with 5 doubles, 2 triples, 3 home runs and 11 RBI in those last 12 games.
Allen hit a home run off the Cardinals' Ray Washburn in 1965 which he cleared Connie Mack Stadium's left center field roof Coke sign. That home run, an estimated 529-footer, inspired Willie Stargell to say: "Now I know why they (the Phillies fans) boo Richie all the time. When he hits a home run, there's no souvenir."[7]
While playing for Philadelphia, Allen appeared on several All-Star teams including the 1965–67 teams (in the latter of these three games, he hit a home run off Dean Chance). He led the league in slugging (.632), OPS (1.027) and extra base hits (75) in 1966.
Non-baseball incidents soon marred Allen's Philadelphia career. In July 1965, he got into a fistfight with fellow Phillie Frank Thomas. According to two teammates who witnessed the fight, Thomas swung a bat at Allen, hitting him in the shoulder. Johnny Callison said, "Thomas got himself fired when he swung that bat at Richie. In baseball you don't swing a bat at another player—ever." Pat Corrales confirmed that Thomas hit Allen with a bat and added that Thomas was a "bully" known for making racially divisive remarks. Allen and his teammates were not permitted to give their side of the story under threat of a heavy fine. The Phillies released Thomas the next day. That not only made the fans and local sports writers see Allen as costing a white player his job, but freed Thomas to give his version of the fight.[8] In an hour-long interview aired December 15, 2009, on the MLB Network's Studio 42 with Bob Costas, Allen asserted that he and Thomas are in fact good friends now.[9]
Allen's name was a source of controversy: he had been known since his youth as "Dick" to family and friends, but for reasons which are still somewhat obscure, the media referred to him upon his arrival in Philadelphia as "Richie", possibly a conflation with the longtime Phillies star Richie Ashburn.[citation needed] After leaving the Phillies, he asked to be called "Dick", saying Richie was a little boy's name. In his dual career as an R&B singer, the label on his records with the Groovy Grooves firm slated him as "Rich" Allen.[10]
Some of the Phillies' own fans, known for being tough on hometown players even in the best of times, exacerbated Allen's problems. Initially the abuse was verbal, with obscenities and racial epithets. Eventually Allen was greeted with showers of fruit, ice, refuse, and even flashlight batteries as he took the field. He began wearing his batting helmet even while playing his position in the field, which gave rise to another nickname, "Crash Helmet", shortened to "Crash".[citation needed]
He almost ended his career in 1967 after mangling his throwing hand by pushing it through a car headlight. Allen was fined $2,500 and suspended indefinitely in 1969 when he failed to appear for the Phillies twi-night doubleheader game with the New York Mets. Allen had gone to New Jersey in the morning to see a horse race, and got caught in traffic trying to return.[11] (He was reinstated, but wanted to be traded. Due to problems in having a trade made right then, he agreed to finish the 1969 season with the Phillies.[citation needed])
St. Louis Cardinals and Los Angeles Dodgers[edit]
Allen finally had enough, and demanded the Phillies trade him. They sent him to the Cardinals in a trade before the 1970 season. Even this deal caused controversy, though not of Allen's making, since Cardinals outfielder Curt Flood refused to report to the Phillies as part of the trade. (Flood then sued baseball in an unsuccessful attempt to overthrow the reserve clause and to be declared a free agent.) Coincidentally, the player the Phillies received as compensation for Flood not reporting, Willie Montañez, hit 30 home runs as a 1971 rookie to eclipse Dick Allen's Phillies rookie home run record of 29, set in 1964.[12]
Allen earned another All-Star berth in St. Louis, and his personal problems seemed to abate. The Cardinals even acceded to his wishes regarding his name, as Cardinals broadcaster Jack Buck made a point from game one of calling him "Dick Allen."
Decades before Mark McGwire, Dick Allen entertained the St. Louis fans with some long home runs, at least one of them landing in the seats above the club level in left field. As Jack Buck said at the time, "Some of the folks in the stadium club might have choked on a chicken leg when they saw that one coming!"[citation needed] Nevertheless, the Cardinals traded Allen to the Los Angeles Dodgers before the 1971 season for 1969 NL Rookie of the Year Ted Sizemore and catcher Bob Stinson, the LA Dodgers 1966 first round draft pick. Allen had a relatively quiet season in 1971 although he hit .295 for the Dodgers.
Chicago White Sox[edit]
The Dodgers traded Allen to the White Sox for pitcher Tommy John prior to the 1972 season. For various reasons, Allen's previous managers had shuffled him around on defense, playing him at first base, third base, and the outfield in no particular order—a practice which almost certainly weakened his defensive play, and which may have contributed to his frequent injuries, not to mention his perceived bad attitude. Sox manager Chuck Tanner's low-key style of handling ballplayers made it possible for Allen to thrive, for a while, on the South Side. He decided to play Allen exclusively at first base, which allowed him to concentrate on hitting. That first year, his first in the American League, Allen almost single-handedly lifted the entire team to second place in the AL West, as he led the league in home runs (37) (setting a team record), RBI (113), walks (99), on-base percentage (.422), slugging average (.603), and OPS (1.023), while winning a well-deserved MVP award. However, the Sox fell short at the end and finished  5 1⁄2 games behind the World Series–bound Oakland Athletics.
Allen's feats during his years with the White Sox—particularly in that MVP season of 1972—are spoken of reverently by South Side fans who credit him with saving the franchise for Chicago (it was rumored to be bound for St. Petersburg or Seattle at the time). His powerful swing sent home runs deep into some of cavernous old Comiskey Park's farthest reaches, including the roof and even the distant (445 ft) center field bleachers, a rare feat at one of baseball's most pitcher-friendly stadiums. On July 31, 1972, Allen became the first player in baseball's "modern era" to hit two inside-the-park home runs in one game. Both homers were hit off Bert Blyleven in the White Sox' 8-1 victory over the Minnesota Twins at Metropolitan Stadium. On July 6, 1974, at Detroit's Tiger Stadium, he lined a homer off the roof facade in deep left-center field at a linear distance of approximately 415 feet (126 m) and an altitude of 85 feet (26 m). Anecdotal and mathematical evidence agreed that Allen's clout would've easily surpassed 500 ft (150 m) on the fly.[13]
The Sox were favored by many to make the playoffs in 1973, but those hopes were dashed due in large measure to the fractured fibula that Allen suffered in June. (He tried to return five weeks after injuring the leg in a collision with Mike Epstein of the A's, but the pain ended his season after just one game in which he batted 3-for-5.) In 1974, despite his making the AL All-Star team in each of the three years with the Sox, Allen's stay in Chicago ended in controversy when he left the team on September 14 with two weeks left in the season. In his autobiography, Allen blamed his feud with third-baseman Ron Santo, who was playing a final, undistinguished season with the White Sox after leaving the crosstown Chicago Cubs.[14]
With Allen's intention to continue playing baseball uncertain, the White Sox reluctantly sold his contract to the Atlanta Braves for only $5,000, despite the fact that he had led the league in home runs, slugging (.563), and OPS (.938). Allen refused to report to the Braves and announced his retirement.
Return to the Phillies[edit]
The Phillies managed to coax Allen out of retirement for the 1975 season. The lay-off and nagging effects of his 1973 broken leg hampered his play. His numbers improved in 1976, a Phillies division winner, as he hit 15 home runs and batted .268 in 85 games. He continued his tape measure legacy during his second go-round with the Phillies. On August 22, 1975, Allen smashed a homer into the seldom reached upperdeck at San Diego's Qualcomm (née Jack Murphy) Stadium.
Oakland Athletics[edit]
Allen played in 54 games and hit 5 HR's with 31 RBI's during his final season for the Oakland Athletics in 1977 before leaving the team abruptly in June of that season.
Music career[edit]
Dick Allen sang professionally in a high, delicate tenor. The tone and texture of his voice has drawn comparisons to Harptones' lead singer Willie Winfield.[15] During Allen's time with the Sixties-era Phillies, he sang lead with a doo-wop group called The Ebonistics. Dick Allen and The Ebonistics sang professionally at Philadelphia night clubs. He once entertained during halftime of an NBA Philadelphia 76ers game. The Philadelphia Inquirer printed a review of his performance: Here came Rich Allen. Flowered shirt. Tie six-inches (152 mm) wide. Hiphugger bell-bottomed pants. A microphone in his hands. Rich Allen, the most booed man in Philadelphia from April to October, when Eagles coach Joe Kuharich takes over, walked out in front of 9,557 people at the Spectrum last night to sing with his group, The Ebonistics, and a most predictable thing happened. He was booed. Two songs later though, a most unpredictable thing happened. They cheered Rich Allen. They cheered him as warmly as they have ever cheered him for a game-winning home run.[16]
Although his music career was not as substantial or long-lasting as that of Milwaukee Braves outfielder Arthur Lee Maye, Allen gained lasting praise for a recording on the Groovy Grooves label titled, "Echoes of November." The song is featured in the Philles official hundred-year anniversary video and the novel '64 Intruder.[17] In 2010, Brazilian pop star Ana Volans rerecorded "Echoes of November;" her rendition sold briskly in Brazil. (The CD's jacket contains a dedication to Dick Allen and his Hall of Fame candidacy.)[18]
Hall of Fame candidacy[edit]
Nearly forty years after retiring, Allen remains a much discussed and still controversial ballplayer. An increasing number of Baseball historians regard him as the best player not inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame.[19] Allen appeared on the Hall of Fame's 2014 Golden Era Committee ballot (the committee votes every three years since 2011 when Ron Santo was elected by the committee) of 10 selected candidates (selected by a committee of the Baseball Writers' Association of America) from the 1947 to 1972 era[1] for consideration of Hall of Fame enshrinement in 2015. Allen and Tony Oliva were both one vote short of the required 12 votes by the committee which elected none of the candidates.[20]
Sabermetrician Bill James rated Dick Allen as the second-most controversial player in baseball history, behind Rogers Hornsby.[21] James called Allen's autobiography, Crash, "one of the best baseball books in recent years".[22] For many years Allen held the distinction of the highest slugging percentage among players eligible for but not in the National Baseball Hall of Fame. This only ended in 2006, when Albert Belle became eligible but was not elected.
Allen Barra wrote in his Wall Street Journal sports column that "A growing body of baseball historians think that Dick Allen is the best player eligible for the Hall of Fame." [19] The arguments usually center around his very high career averages, batting (.292), slugging (.534), and on-base (.378). They also point out that he began his career during the mid-1960s, a period so dominated by pitchers that it is sometimes called the "second dead ball era" [23] Of the Major League batters with 500 or more career home runs whose play intersected Dick Allen's career at the beginning or end, only Mickey Mantle's lifetime OPS+ of 172 topped Dick Allen's lifetime 156 OPS+ [24] His career OPS+ is the second highest of any retired player not in the Hall of Fame (only topped by Mark Mcgwire). Allen also played some of his career in pitcher-friendly parks such as Busch Memorial Stadium, Dodger Stadium, and Comiskey Park.[25]
In addition to hitting for high offensive percentages, Allen displayed prodigious power. Before scientific weight training, muscle-building dietary supplements, and anabolic steroids, Allen boasted a powerful and muscular physique along the lines of Mickey Mantle and Jimmie Foxx. Indeed, baseball historian Bill Jenkinson ranks Allen with Foxx and Mantle, and just a notch below Babe Ruth, as the four top long-distance sluggers ever to wield a baseball bat.[26] A segment of MLB Network's Prime 9 concurred with Jenkinson's findings. On that same broadcast, Willie Mays stated that Allen hit a ball harder than any player he had ever seen.[27] Dick Allen, like Babe Ruth, hit with a rather heavy bat. Allen's 40-ouncer bucked the Ted Williams-inspired trend of using a light bat for increased bat speed. Allen combined massive strength and body torque to produce bat speed and drive the ball. Two of his drives cleared Connie Mack Stadium's 65-foot-high left field grandstand.[26] Twice Allen cleared that park's 65-foot-high right center field scoreboard: a feat considered virtually impossible for a right-handed hitter.[26]
Detractors of Allen's Hall of Fame credentials argue that his career was not as long as most Hall of Famers, so he does not have the career cumulative numbers that others do. They further argue that the controversies surrounding him negatively impacted his teams.[28] Hall of Fame player Willie Stargell countered with a historical perspective of Dick Allen's time: "Dick Allen played the game in the most conservative era in baseball history. It was a time of change and protest in the country, and baseball reacted against all that. They saw it as a threat to the game. The sportswriters were reactionary too. They didn't like seeing a man of such extraordinary skills doing it his way. It made them nervous. Dick Allen was ahead of his time. His views and way of doing things would go unnoticed today. If I had been manager of the Phillies back when he was playing, I would have found a way to make Dick Allen comfortable. I would have told him to blow off the writers. It was my observation that when Dick Allen was comfortable, balls left the park."[29] The two managers for whom Allen played the longest—Gene Mauch of the Phillies and Chuck Tanner of the White Sox—agreed with Willie Stargell that Allen was not a "clubhouse lawyer" who harmed team chemistry. Asked if Allen's behavior ever had a negative influence on the team, Mauch said, "Never. Dick's teammates always liked him. I'd take him in a minute."[19] According to Tanner, "Dick was the leader of our team, the captain, the manager on the field. He took care of the young kids, took them under his wing. And he played every game as if it was his last day on earth."[30] Hall of Fame player Orlando Cepeda agreed, saying to author Tim Whitaker, "Dick Allen played with fire in his eyes." [31] Hall of Fame teammate Rich Gossage also confirmed Tanner's view. In an interview with USA TODAY Sports, Gossage said: "I've been around the game a long time, and he's the greatest player I've ever seen play in my life. He had the most amazing season (1972) I've ever seen. He's the smartest baseball man I've ever been around in my life. He taught me how to pitch from a hitter's prospective, and taught me how to play the game right. There's no telling the numbers this guy could have put up if all he worried about was stats. The guy belongs in the Hall of Fame." [32] Another of Allen's ex-White Sox teammates, pitcher Stan Bahnsen, said, "I actually thought that Dick was better than his stats. Every time we needed a clutch hit, he got it. He got along great with his teammates and he was very knowledgeable about the game. He was the ultimate team guy."[33] Another Hall of Fame teammate, Mike Schmidt, credited Dick Allen in his book, Clearing the Bases, as his mentor.[34] In Schmidt's biography, written by historian William C. Kashatus, Schmidt fondly recalls Allen mentoring him before a game in Chicago in 1976, saying to him, "Mike, you've got to relax. You've got to have some fun. Remember when you were just a kid and you'd skip supper to play ball? You were having fun. Hey, with all the talent you've got, baseball ought to be fun. Enjoy it. Be a kid again." Schmidt responded by hitting four home runs in that game. Mike Schmidt is quoted in the same book, "The baseball writers used to claim that Dick would divide the clubhouse along racial lines. That was a lie. The truth is that Dick never divided any clubhouse."[35]

Richard Anthony Allen (born March 8, 1942) is a former American Major League Baseball (MLB) player and Rhythm and Blues (R&B) singer. He played 15 seasons in the major leagues as a first baseman, third baseman, and outfielder most notably for the Philadelphia Phillies and Chicago White Sox, and is ranked among his sport's top offensive producers of the 1960s and early 1970s.
Allen was an All-Star for seven seasons. He won the 1964 National League Rookie of the Year Award and the 1972 American League Most Valuable Player Award. He also led the American League (AL) in home runs for two seasons, led the NL in slugging percentage one season and the AL two seasons, and led both leagues in on-base percentage each for one season. His .534 career slugging percentage ranks among the highest in an era marked by low offensive production.
Allen's older brother Hank was a reserve outfielder for three AL teams, and his younger brother Ron was briefly a first baseman with the 1972 St. Louis Cardinals.
In 2014, Allen appeared for the first time as a candidate on the National Baseball Hall of Fame's Golden Era Committee election ballot[1] for possible Hall of Fame consideration in 2015. He and the other candidates all missed getting elected by the committee.[2] The Committee meets and votes on 10 selected candidates from the 1947 to 1972 era every three years. Allen was one vote short of the required 12 votes needed for election.[3]

MLB career[edit]
Philadelphia Phillies[edit]
Dick Allen hit a baseball with an authority Philadelphia fans had not seen since Chuck Klein and Jimmie Foxx. Phillies scout John Ogden convinced the Phillies to sign Allen in 1960 for a $70,000 bonus. John Ogden played for the International League Baltimore Orioles from 1919 to 1925 under Jack Dunn, the discoverer of Babe Ruth, and later pitched against Ruth in the American League. Ogden stated in a Philadelphia Bulletin story printed on July 1, 1969, that Dick Allen was the only player he ever saw who hit a ball as hard as Babe Ruth.[4]
Allen's playing career got off to a turbulent start as he faced racial harassment while playing for the Phillies' minor league affiliate in Little Rock; residents staged protest parades against Allen, the local team's first black player. Nevertheless, he led the league in total bases.
His first season in the majors, 1964, ranks among the greatest rookie seasons ever.[5] He led the league in runs (125), triples (13), extra base hits (80) and total bases (352); he finished in the top five in batting average (.318), slugging average (.557), hits (201), and doubles (38); and won Rookie of the Year. Playing for the first time at third base, he led the league with 41 errors. Along with outfielder Johnny Callison and pitchers Chris Short and Jim Bunning, Allen led the Phillies to a six-and-a-half game hold on first place with 12 games to play in an exceptionally strong National League. The 1964 Phillies then lost ten straight games and finished tied for second place. The Phillies lost the first game of the streak to the Cincinnati Reds when Chico Ruiz stole home with Frank Robinson batting for the game's only run. In Allen's autobiography (written with Tim Whitaker), Crash: The Life and Times of Dick Allen, Allen stated that the play "broke our humps".[6] Despite the Phillies' collapse, Allen hit .438 with 5 doubles, 2 triples, 3 home runs and 11 RBI in those last 12 games.
Allen hit a home run off the Cardinals' Ray Washburn in 1965 which he cleared Connie Mack Stadium's left center field roof Coke sign. That home run, an estimated 529-footer, inspired Willie Stargell to say: "Now I know why they (the Phillies fans) boo Richie all the time. When he hits a home run, there's no souvenir."[7]
While playing for Philadelphia, Allen appeared on several All-Star teams including the 1965–67 teams (in the latter of these three games, he hit a home run off Dean Chance). He led the league in slugging (.632), OPS (1.027) and extra base hits (75) in 1966.
Non-baseball incidents soon marred Allen's Philadelphia career. In July 1965, he got into a fistfight with fellow Phillie Frank Thomas. According to two teammates who witnessed the fight, Thomas swung a bat at Allen, hitting him in the shoulder. Johnny Callison said, "Thomas got himself fired when he swung that bat at Richie. In baseball you don't swing a bat at another player—ever." Pat Corrales confirmed that Thomas hit Allen with a bat and added that Thomas was a "bully" known for making racially divisive remarks. Allen and his teammates were not permitted to give their side of the story under threat of a heavy fine. The Phillies released Thomas the next day. That not only made the fans and local sports writers see Allen as costing a white player his job, but freed Thomas to give his version of the fight.[8] In an hour-long interview aired December 15, 2009, on the MLB Network's Studio 42 with Bob Costas, Allen asserted that he and Thomas are in fact good friends now.[9]
Allen's name was a source of controversy: he had been known since his youth as "Dick" to family and friends, but for reasons which are still somewhat obscure, the media referred to him upon his arrival in Philadelphia as "Richie", possibly a conflation with the longtime Phillies star Richie Ashburn.[citation needed] After leaving the Phillies, he asked to be called "Dick", saying Richie was a little boy's name. In his dual career as an R&B singer, the label on his records with the Groovy Grooves firm slated him as "Rich" Allen.[10]
Some of the Phillies' own fans, known for being tough on hometown players even in the best of times, exacerbated Allen's problems. Initially the abuse was verbal, with obscenities and racial epithets. Eventually Allen was greeted with showers of fruit, ice, refuse, and even flashlight batteries as he took the field. He began wearing his batting helmet even while playing his position in the field, which gave rise to another nickname, "Crash Helmet", shortened to "Crash".[citation needed]
He almost ended his career in 1967 after mangling his throwing hand by pushing it through a car headlight. Allen was fined $2,500 and suspended indefinitely in 1969 when he failed to appear for the Phillies twi-night doubleheader game with the New York Mets. Allen had gone to New Jersey in the morning to see a horse race, and got caught in traffic trying to return.[11] (He was reinstated, but wanted to be traded. Due to problems in having a trade made right then, he agreed to finish the 1969 season with the Phillies.[citation needed])
St. Louis Cardinals and Los Angeles Dodgers[edit]
Allen finally had enough, and demanded the Phillies trade him. They sent him to the Cardinals in a trade before the 1970 season. Even this deal caused controversy, though not of Allen's making, since Cardinals outfielder Curt Flood refused to report to the Phillies as part of the trade. (Flood then sued baseball in an unsuccessful attempt to overthrow the reserve clause and to be declared a free agent.) Coincidentally, the player the Phillies received as compensation for Flood not reporting, Willie Montañez, hit 30 home runs as a 1971 rookie to eclipse Dick Allen's Phillies rookie home run record of 29, set in 1964.[12]
Allen earned another All-Star berth in St. Louis, and his personal problems seemed to abate. The Cardinals even acceded to his wishes regarding his name, as Cardinals broadcaster Jack Buck made a point from game one of calling him "Dick Allen."
Decades before Mark McGwire, Dick Allen entertained the St. Louis fans with some long home runs, at least one of them landing in the seats above the club level in left field. As Jack Buck said at the time, "Some of the folks in the stadium club might have choked on a chicken leg when they saw that one coming!"[citation needed] Nevertheless, the Cardinals traded Allen to the Los Angeles Dodgers before the 1971 season for 1969 NL Rookie of the Year Ted Sizemore and catcher Bob Stinson, the LA Dodgers 1966 first round draft pick. Allen had a relatively quiet season in 1971 although he hit .295 for the Dodgers.
Chicago White Sox[edit]
The Dodgers traded Allen to the White Sox for pitcher Tommy John prior to the 1972 season. For various reasons, Allen's previous managers had shuffled him around on defense, playing him at first base, third base, and the outfield in no particular order—a practice which almost certainly weakened his defensive play, and which may have contributed to his frequent injuries, not to mention his perceived bad attitude. Sox manager Chuck Tanner's low-key style of handling ballplayers made it possible for Allen to thrive, for a while, on the South Side. He decided to play Allen exclusively at first base, which allowed him to concentrate on hitting. That first year, his first in the American League, Allen almost single-handedly lifted the entire team to second place in the AL West, as he led the league in home runs (37) (setting a team record), RBI (113), walks (99), on-base percentage (.422), slugging average (.603), and OPS (1.023), while winning a well-deserved MVP award. However, the Sox fell short at the end and finished  5 1⁄2 games behind the World Series–bound Oakland Athletics.
Allen's feats during his years with the White Sox—particularly in that MVP season of 1972—are spoken of reverently by South Side fans who credit him with saving the franchise for Chicago (it was rumored to be bound for St. Petersburg or Seattle at the time). His powerful swing sent home runs deep into some of cavernous old Comiskey Park's farthest reaches, including the roof and even the distant (445 ft) center field bleachers, a rare feat at one of baseball's most pitcher-friendly stadiums. On July 31, 1972, Allen became the first player in baseball's "modern era" to hit two inside-the-park home runs in one game. Both homers were hit off Bert Blyleven in the White Sox' 8-1 victory over the Minnesota Twins at Metropolitan Stadium. On July 6, 1974, at Detroit's Tiger Stadium, he lined a homer off the roof facade in deep left-center field at a linear distance of approximately 415 feet (126 m) and an altitude of 85 feet (26 m). Anecdotal and mathematical evidence agreed that Allen's clout would've easily surpassed 500 ft (150 m) on the fly.[13]
The Sox were favored by many to make the playoffs in 1973, but those hopes were dashed due in large measure to the fractured fibula that Allen suffered in June. (He tried to return five weeks after injuring the leg in a collision with Mike Epstein of the A's, but the pain ended his season after just one game in which he batted 3-for-5.) In 1974, despite his making the AL All-Star team in each of the three years with the Sox, Allen's stay in Chicago ended in controversy when he left the team on September 14 with two weeks left in the season. In his autobiography, Allen blamed his feud with third-baseman Ron Santo, who was playing a final, undistinguished season with the White Sox after leaving the crosstown Chicago Cubs.[14]
With Allen's intention to continue playing baseball uncertain, the White Sox reluctantly sold his contract to the Atlanta Braves for only $5,000, despite the fact that he had led the league in home runs, slugging (.563), and OPS (.938). Allen refused to report to the Braves and announced his retirement.
Return to the Phillies[edit]
The Phillies managed to coax Allen out of retirement for the 1975 season. The lay-off and nagging effects of his 1973 broken leg hampered his play. His numbers improved in 1976, a Phillies division winner, as he hit 15 home runs and batted .268 in 85 games. He continued his tape measure legacy during his second go-round with the Phillies. On August 22, 1975, Allen smashed a homer into the seldom reached upperdeck at San Diego's Qualcomm (née Jack Murphy) Stadium.
Oakland Athletics[edit]
Allen played in 54 games and hit 5 HR's with 31 RBI's during his final season for the Oakland Athletics in 1977 before leaving the team abruptly in June of that season.
Music career[edit]
Dick Allen sang professionally in a high, delicate tenor. The tone and texture of his voice has drawn comparisons to Harptones' lead singer Willie Winfield.[15] During Allen's time with the Sixties-era Phillies, he sang lead with a doo-wop group called The Ebonistics. Dick Allen and The Ebonistics sang professionally at Philadelphia night clubs. He once entertained during halftime of an NBA Philadelphia 76ers game. The Philadelphia Inquirer printed a review of his performance: Here came Rich Allen. Flowered shirt. Tie six-inches (152 mm) wide. Hiphugger bell-bottomed pants. A microphone in his hands. Rich Allen, the most booed man in Philadelphia from April to October, when Eagles coach Joe Kuharich takes over, walked out in front of 9,557 people at the Spectrum last night to sing with his group, The Ebonistics, and a most predictable thing happened. He was booed. Two songs later though, a most unpredictable thing happened. They cheered Rich Allen. They cheered him as warmly as they have ever cheered him for a game-winning home run.[16]
Although his music career was not as substantial or long-lasting as that of Milwaukee Braves outfielder Arthur Lee Maye, Allen gained lasting praise for a recording on the Groovy Grooves label titled, "Echoes of November." The song is featured in the Philles official hundred-year anniversary video and the novel '64 Intruder.[17] In 2010, Brazilian pop star Ana Volans rerecorded "Echoes of November;" her rendition sold briskly in Brazil. (The CD's jacket contains a dedication to Dick Allen and his Hall of Fame candidacy.)[18]
Hall of Fame candidacy[edit]
Nearly forty years after retiring, Allen remains a much discussed and still controversial ballplayer. An increasing number of Baseball historians regard him as the best player not inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame.[19] Allen appeared on the Hall of Fame's 2014 Golden Era Committee ballot (the committee votes every three years since 2011 when Ron Santo was elected by the committee) of 10 selected candidates (selected by a committee of the Baseball Writers' Association of America) from the 1947 to 1972 era[1] for consideration of Hall of Fame enshrinement in 2015. Allen and Tony Oliva were both one vote short of the required 12 votes by the committee which elected none of the candidates.[20]
Sabermetrician Bill James rated Dick Allen as the second-most controversial player in baseball history, behind Rogers Hornsby.[21] James called Allen's autobiography, Crash, "one of the best baseball books in recent years".[22] For many years Allen held the distinction of the highest slugging percentage among players eligible for but not in the National Baseball Hall of Fame. This only ended in 2006, when Albert Belle became eligible but was not elected.
Allen Barra wrote in his Wall Street Journal sports column that "A growing body of baseball historians think that Dick Allen is the best player eligible for the Hall of Fame." [19] The arguments usually center around his very high career averages, batting (.292), slugging (.534), and on-base (.378). They also point out that he began his career during the mid-1960s, a period so dominated by pitchers that it is sometimes called the "second dead ball era" [23] Of the Major League batters with 500 or more career home runs whose play intersected Dick Allen's career at the beginning or end, only Mickey Mantle's lifetime OPS+ of 172 topped Dick Allen's lifetime 156 OPS+ [24] His career OPS+ is the second highest of any retired player not in the Hall of Fame (only topped by Mark Mcgwire). Allen also played some of his career in pitcher-friendly parks such as Busch Memorial Stadium, Dodger Stadium, and Comiskey Park.[25]
In addition to hitting for high offensive percentages, Allen displayed prodigious power. Before scientific weight training, muscle-building dietary supplements, and anabolic steroids, Allen boasted a powerful and muscular physique along the lines of Mickey Mantle and Jimmie Foxx. Indeed, baseball historian Bill Jenkinson ranks Allen with Foxx and Mantle, and just a notch below Babe Ruth, as the four top long-distance sluggers ever to wield a baseball bat.[26] A segment of MLB Network's Prime 9 concurred with Jenkinson's findings. On that same broadcast, Willie Mays stated that Allen hit a ball harder than any player he had ever seen.[27] Dick Allen, like Babe Ruth, hit with a rather heavy bat. Allen's 40-ouncer bucked the Ted Williams-inspired trend of using a light bat for increased bat speed. Allen combined massive strength and body torque to produce bat speed and drive the ball. Two of his drives cleared Connie Mack Stadium's 65-foot-high left field grandstand.[26] Twice Allen cleared that park's 65-foot-high right center field scoreboard: a feat considered virtually impossible for a right-handed hitter.[26]
Detractors of Allen's Hall of Fame credentials argue that his career was not as long as most Hall of Famers, so he does not have the career cumulative numbers that others do. They further argue that the controversies surrounding him negatively impacted his teams.[28] Hall of Fame player Willie Stargell countered with a historical perspective of Dick Allen's time: "Dick Allen played the game in the most conservative era in baseball history. It was a time of change and protest in the country, and baseball reacted against all that. They saw it as a threat to the game. The sportswriters were reactionary too. They didn't like seeing a man of such extraordinary skills doing it his way. It made them nervous. Dick Allen was ahead of his time. His views and way of doing things would go unnoticed today. If I had been manager of the Phillies back when he was playing, I would have found a way to make Dick Allen comfortable. I would have told him to blow off the writers. It was my observation that when Dick Allen was comfortable, balls left the park."[29] The two managers for whom Allen played the longest—Gene Mauch of the Phillies and Chuck Tanner of the White Sox—agreed with Willie Stargell that Allen was not a "clubhouse lawyer" who harmed team chemistry. Asked if Allen's behavior ever had a negative influence on the team, Mauch said, "Never. Dick's teammates always liked him. I'd take him in a minute."[19] According to Tanner, "Dick was the leader of our team, the captain, the manager on the field. He took care of the young kids, took them under his wing. And he played every game as if it was his last day on earth."[30] Hall of Fame player Orlando Cepeda agreed, saying to author Tim Whitaker, "Dick Allen played with fire in his eyes." [31] Hall of Fame teammate Rich Gossage also confirmed Tanner's view. In an interview with USA TODAY Sports, Gossage said: "I've been around the game a long time, and he's the greatest player I've ever seen play in my life. He had the most amazing season (1972) I've ever seen. He's the smartest baseball man I've ever been around in my life. He taught me how to pitch from a hitter's prospective, and taught me how to play the game right. There's no telling the numbers this guy could have put up if all he worried about was stats. The guy belongs in the Hall of Fame." [32] Another of Allen's ex-White Sox teammates, pitcher Stan Bahnsen, said, "I actually thought that Dick was better than his stats. Every time we needed a clutch hit, he got it. He got along great with his teammates and he was very knowledgeable about the game. He was the ultimate team guy."[33] Another Hall of Fame teammate, Mike Schmidt, credited Dick Allen in his book, Clearing the Bases, as his mentor.[34] In Schmidt's biography, written by historian William C. Kashatus, Schmidt fondly recalls Allen mentoring him before a game in Chicago in 1976, saying to him, "Mike, you've got to relax. You've got to have some fun. Remember when you were just a kid and you'd skip supper to play ball? You were having fun. Hey, with all the talent you've got, baseball ought to be fun. Enjoy it. Be a kid again." Schmidt responded by hitting four home runs in that game. Mike Schmidt is quoted in the same book, "The baseball writers used to claim that Dick would divide the clubhouse along racial lines. That was a lie. The truth is that Dick never divided any clubhouse."[35]

Philadelphia Baseball Wall of Fame




Richard Anthony Allen (born March 8, 1942) is a former American Major League Baseball (MLB) player and Rhythm and Blues (R&B) singer. He played 15 seasons in the major leagues as a first baseman, third baseman, and outfielder most notably for the Philadelphia Phillies and Chicago White Sox, and is ranked among his sport's top offensive producers of the 1960s and early 1970s.
Allen was an All-Star for seven seasons. He won the 1964 National League Rookie of the Year Award and the 1972 American League Most Valuable Player Award. He also led the American League (AL) in home runs for two seasons, led the NL in slugging percentage one season and the AL two seasons, and led both leagues in on-base percentage each for one season. His .534 career slugging percentage ranks among the highest in an era marked by low offensive production.
Allen's older brother Hank was a reserve outfielder for three AL teams, and his younger brother Ron was briefly a first baseman with the 1972 St. Louis Cardinals.
In 2014, Allen appeared for the first time as a candidate on the National Baseball Hall of Fame's Golden Era Committee election ballot[1] for possible Hall of Fame consideration in 2015. He and the other candidates all missed getting elected by the committee.[2] The Committee meets and votes on 10 selected candidates from the 1947 to 1972 era every three years. Allen was one vote short of the required 12 votes needed for election.[3]

MLB career[edit]
Philadelphia Phillies[edit]
Dick Allen hit a baseball with an authority Philadelphia fans had not seen since Chuck Klein and Jimmie Foxx. Phillies scout John Ogden convinced the Phillies to sign Allen in 1960 for a $70,000 bonus. John Ogden played for the International League Baltimore Orioles from 1919 to 1925 under Jack Dunn, the discoverer of Babe Ruth, and later pitched against Ruth in the American League. Ogden stated in a Philadelphia Bulletin story printed on July 1, 1969, that Dick Allen was the only player he ever saw who hit a ball as hard as Babe Ruth.[4]
Allen's playing career got off to a turbulent start as he faced racial harassment while playing for the Phillies' minor league affiliate in Little Rock; residents staged protest parades against Allen, the local team's first black player. Nevertheless, he led the league in total bases.
His first season in the majors, 1964, ranks among the greatest rookie seasons ever.[5] He led the league in runs (125), triples (13), extra base hits (80) and total bases (352); he finished in the top five in batting average (.318), slugging average (.557), hits (201), and doubles (38); and won Rookie of the Year. Playing for the first time at third base, he led the league with 41 errors. Along with outfielder Johnny Callison and pitchers Chris Short and Jim Bunning, Allen led the Phillies to a six-and-a-half game hold on first place with 12 games to play in an exceptionally strong National League. The 1964 Phillies then lost ten straight games and finished tied for second place. The Phillies lost the first game of the streak to the Cincinnati Reds when Chico Ruiz stole home with Frank Robinson batting for the game's only run. In Allen's autobiography (written with Tim Whitaker), Crash: The Life and Times of Dick Allen, Allen stated that the play "broke our humps".[6] Despite the Phillies' collapse, Allen hit .438 with 5 doubles, 2 triples, 3 home runs and 11 RBI in those last 12 games.
Allen hit a home run off the Cardinals' Ray Washburn in 1965 which he cleared Connie Mack Stadium's left center field roof Coke sign. That home run, an estimated 529-footer, inspired Willie Stargell to say: "Now I know why they (the Phillies fans) boo Richie all the time. When he hits a home run, there's no souvenir."[7]
While playing for Philadelphia, Allen appeared on several All-Star teams including the 1965–67 teams (in the latter of these three games, he hit a home run off Dean Chance). He led the league in slugging (.632), OPS (1.027) and extra base hits (75) in 1966.
Non-baseball incidents soon marred Allen's Philadelphia career. In July 1965, he got into a fistfight with fellow Phillie Frank Thomas. According to two teammates who witnessed the fight, Thomas swung a bat at Allen, hitting him in the shoulder. Johnny Callison said, "Thomas got himself fired when he swung that bat at Richie. In baseball you don't swing a bat at another player—ever." Pat Corrales confirmed that Thomas hit Allen with a bat and added that Thomas was a "bully" known for making racially divisive remarks. Allen and his teammates were not permitted to give their side of the story under threat of a heavy fine. The Phillies released Thomas the next day. That not only made the fans and local sports writers see Allen as costing a white player his job, but freed Thomas to give his version of the fight.[8] In an hour-long interview aired December 15, 2009, on the MLB Network's Studio 42 with Bob Costas, Allen asserted that he and Thomas are in fact good friends now.[9]
Allen's name was a source of controversy: he had been known since his youth as "Dick" to family and friends, but for reasons which are still somewhat obscure, the media referred to him upon his arrival in Philadelphia as "Richie", possibly a conflation with the longtime Phillies star Richie Ashburn.[citation needed] After leaving the Phillies, he asked to be called "Dick", saying Richie was a little boy's name. In his dual career as an R&B singer, the label on his records with the Groovy Grooves firm slated him as "Rich" Allen.[10]
Some of the Phillies' own fans, known for being tough on hometown players even in the best of times, exacerbated Allen's problems. Initially the abuse was verbal, with obscenities and racial epithets. Eventually Allen was greeted with showers of fruit, ice, refuse, and even flashlight batteries as he took the field. He began wearing his batting helmet even while playing his position in the field, which gave rise to another nickname, "Crash Helmet", shortened to "Crash".[citation needed]
He almost ended his career in 1967 after mangling his throwing hand by pushing it through a car headlight. Allen was fined $2,500 and suspended indefinitely in 1969 when he failed to appear for the Phillies twi-night doubleheader game with the New York Mets. Allen had gone to New Jersey in the morning to see a horse race, and got caught in traffic trying to return.[11] (He was reinstated, but wanted to be traded. Due to problems in having a trade made right then, he agreed to finish the 1969 season with the Phillies.[citation needed])
St. Louis Cardinals and Los Angeles Dodgers[edit]
Allen finally had enough, and demanded the Phillies trade him. They sent him to the Cardinals in a trade before the 1970 season. Even this deal caused controversy, though not of Allen's making, since Cardinals outfielder Curt Flood refused to report to the Phillies as part of the trade. (Flood then sued baseball in an unsuccessful attempt to overthrow the reserve clause and to be declared a free agent.) Coincidentally, the player the Phillies received as compensation for Flood not reporting, Willie Montañez, hit 30 home runs as a 1971 rookie to eclipse Dick Allen's Phillies rookie home run record of 29, set in 1964.[12]
Allen earned another All-Star berth in St. Louis, and his personal problems seemed to abate. The Cardinals even acceded to his wishes regarding his name, as Cardinals broadcaster Jack Buck made a point from game one of calling him "Dick Allen."
Decades before Mark McGwire, Dick Allen entertained the St. Louis fans with some long home runs, at least one of them landing in the seats above the club level in left field. As Jack Buck said at the time, "Some of the folks in the stadium club might have choked on a chicken leg when they saw that one coming!"[citation needed] Nevertheless, the Cardinals traded Allen to the Los Angeles Dodgers before the 1971 season for 1969 NL Rookie of the Year Ted Sizemore and catcher Bob Stinson, the LA Dodgers 1966 first round draft pick. Allen had a relatively quiet season in 1971 although he hit .295 for the Dodgers.
Chicago White Sox[edit]
The Dodgers traded Allen to the White Sox for pitcher Tommy John prior to the 1972 season. For various reasons, Allen's previous managers had shuffled him around on defense, playing him at first base, third base, and the outfield in no particular order—a practice which almost certainly weakened his defensive play, and which may have contributed to his frequent injuries, not to mention his perceived bad attitude. Sox manager Chuck Tanner's low-key style of handling ballplayers made it possible for Allen to thrive, for a while, on the South Side. He decided to play Allen exclusively at first base, which allowed him to concentrate on hitting. That first year, his first in the American League, Allen almost single-handedly lifted the entire team to second place in the AL West, as he led the league in home runs (37) (setting a team record), RBI (113), walks (99), on-base percentage (.422), slugging average (.603), and OPS (1.023), while winning a well-deserved MVP award. However, the Sox fell short at the end and finished  5 1⁄2 games behind the World Series–bound Oakland Athletics.
Allen's feats during his years with the White Sox—particularly in that MVP season of 1972—are spoken of reverently by South Side fans who credit him with saving the franchise for Chicago (it was rumored to be bound for St. Petersburg or Seattle at the time). His powerful swing sent home runs deep into some of cavernous old Comiskey Park's farthest reaches, including the roof and even the distant (445 ft) center field bleachers, a rare feat at one of baseball's most pitcher-friendly stadiums. On July 31, 1972, Allen became the first player in baseball's "modern era" to hit two inside-the-park home runs in one game. Both homers were hit off Bert Blyleven in the White Sox' 8-1 victory over the Minnesota Twins at Metropolitan Stadium. On July 6, 1974, at Detroit's Tiger Stadium, he lined a homer off the roof facade in deep left-center field at a linear distance of approximately 415 feet (126 m) and an altitude of 85 feet (26 m). Anecdotal and mathematical evidence agreed that Allen's clout would've easily surpassed 500 ft (150 m) on the fly.[13]
The Sox were favored by many to make the playoffs in 1973, but those hopes were dashed due in large measure to the fractured fibula that Allen suffered in June. (He tried to return five weeks after injuring the leg in a collision with Mike Epstein of the A's, but the pain ended his season after just one game in which he batted 3-for-5.) In 1974, despite his making the AL All-Star team in each of the three years with the Sox, Allen's stay in Chicago ended in controversy when he left the team on September 14 with two weeks left in the season. In his autobiography, Allen blamed his feud with third-baseman Ron Santo, who was playing a final, undistinguished season with the White Sox after leaving the crosstown Chicago Cubs.[14]
With Allen's intention to continue playing baseball uncertain, the White Sox reluctantly sold his contract to the Atlanta Braves for only $5,000, despite the fact that he had led the league in home runs, slugging (.563), and OPS (.938). Allen refused to report to the Braves and announced his retirement.
Return to the Phillies[edit]
The Phillies managed to coax Allen out of retirement for the 1975 season. The lay-off and nagging effects of his 1973 broken leg hampered his play. His numbers improved in 1976, a Phillies division winner, as he hit 15 home runs and batted .268 in 85 games. He continued his tape measure legacy during his second go-round with the Phillies. On August 22, 1975, Allen smashed a homer into the seldom reached upperdeck at San Diego's Qualcomm (née Jack Murphy) Stadium.
Oakland Athletics[edit]
Allen played in 54 games and hit 5 HR's with 31 RBI's during his final season for the Oakland Athletics in 1977 before leaving the team abruptly in June of that season.
Music career[edit]
Dick Allen sang professionally in a high, delicate tenor. The tone and texture of his voice has drawn comparisons to Harptones' lead singer Willie Winfield.[15] During Allen's time with the Sixties-era Phillies, he sang lead with a doo-wop group called The Ebonistics. Dick Allen and The Ebonistics sang professionally at Philadelphia night clubs. He once entertained during halftime of an NBA Philadelphia 76ers game. The Philadelphia Inquirer printed a review of his performance: Here came Rich Allen. Flowered shirt. Tie six-inches (152 mm) wide. Hiphugger bell-bottomed pants. A microphone in his hands. Rich Allen, the most booed man in Philadelphia from April to October, when Eagles coach Joe Kuharich takes over, walked out in front of 9,557 people at the Spectrum last night to sing with his group, The Ebonistics, and a most predictable thing happened. He was booed. Two songs later though, a most unpredictable thing happened. They cheered Rich Allen. They cheered him as warmly as they have ever cheered him for a game-winning home run.[16]
Although his music career was not as substantial or long-lasting as that of Milwaukee Braves outfielder Arthur Lee Maye, Allen gained lasting praise for a recording on the Groovy Grooves label titled, "Echoes of November." The song is featured in the Philles official hundred-year anniversary video and the novel '64 Intruder.[17] In 2010, Brazilian pop star Ana Volans rerecorded "Echoes of November;" her rendition sold briskly in Brazil. (The CD's jacket contains a dedication to Dick Allen and his Hall of Fame candidacy.)[18]
Hall of Fame candidacy[edit]
Nearly forty years after retiring, Allen remains a much discussed and still controversial ballplayer. An increasing number of Baseball historians regard him as the best player not inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame.[19] Allen appeared on the Hall of Fame's 2014 Golden Era Committee ballot (the committee votes every three years since 2011 when Ron Santo was elected by the committee) of 10 selected candidates (selected by a committee of the Baseball Writers' Association of America) from the 1947 to 1972 era[1] for consideration of Hall of Fame enshrinement in 2015. Allen and Tony Oliva were both one vote short of the required 12 votes by the committee which elected none of the candidates.[20]
Sabermetrician Bill James rated Dick Allen as the second-most controversial player in baseball history, behind Rogers Hornsby.[21] James called Allen's autobiography, Crash, "one of the best baseball books in recent years".[22] For many years Allen held the distinction of the highest slugging percentage among players eligible for but not in the National Baseball Hall of Fame. This only ended in 2006, when Albert Belle became eligible but was not elected.
Allen Barra wrote in his Wall Street Journal sports column that "A growing body of baseball historians think that Dick Allen is the best player eligible for the Hall of Fame." [19] The arguments usually center around his very high career averages, batting (.292), slugging (.534), and on-base (.378). They also point out that he began his career during the mid-1960s, a period so dominated by pitchers that it is sometimes called the "second dead ball era" [23] Of the Major League batters with 500 or more career home runs whose play intersected Dick Allen's career at the beginning or end, only Mickey Mantle's lifetime OPS+ of 172 topped Dick Allen's lifetime 156 OPS+ [24] His career OPS+ is the second highest of any retired player not in the Hall of Fame (only topped by Mark Mcgwire). Allen also played some of his career in pitcher-friendly parks such as Busch Memorial Stadium, Dodger Stadium, and Comiskey Park.[25]
In addition to hitting for high offensive percentages, Allen displayed prodigious power. Before scientific weight training, muscle-building dietary supplements, and anabolic steroids, Allen boasted a powerful and muscular physique along the lines of Mickey Mantle and Jimmie Foxx. Indeed, baseball historian Bill Jenkinson ranks Allen with Foxx and Mantle, and just a notch below Babe Ruth, as the four top long-distance sluggers ever to wield a baseball bat.[26] A segment of MLB Network's Prime 9 concurred with Jenkinson's findings. On that same broadcast, Willie Mays stated that Allen hit a ball harder than any player he had ever seen.[27] Dick Allen, like Babe Ruth, hit with a rather heavy bat. Allen's 40-ouncer bucked the Ted Williams-inspired trend of using a light bat for increased bat speed. Allen combined massive strength and body torque to produce bat speed and drive the ball. Two of his drives cleared Connie Mack Stadium's 65-foot-high left field grandstand.[26] Twice Allen cleared that park's 65-foot-high right center field scoreboard: a feat considered virtually impossible for a right-handed hitter.[26]
Detractors of Allen's Hall of Fame credentials argue that his career was not as long as most Hall of Famers, so he does not have the career cumulative numbers that others do. They further argue that the controversies surrounding him negatively impacted his teams.[28] Hall of Fame player Willie Stargell countered with a historical perspective of Dick Allen's time: "Dick Allen played the game in the most conservative era in baseball history. It was a time of change and protest in the country, and baseball reacted against all that. They saw it as a threat to the game. The sportswriters were reactionary too. They didn't like seeing a man of such extraordinary skills doing it his way. It made them nervous. Dick Allen was ahead of his time. His views and way of doing things would go unnoticed today. If I had been manager of the Phillies back when he was playing, I would have found a way to make Dick Allen comfortable. I would have told him to blow off the writers. It was my observation that when Dick Allen was comfortable, balls left the park."[29] The two managers for whom Allen played the longest—Gene Mauch of the Phillies and Chuck Tanner of the White Sox—agreed with Willie Stargell that Allen was not a "clubhouse lawyer" who harmed team chemistry. Asked if Allen's behavior ever had a negative influence on the team, Mauch said, "Never. Dick's teammates always liked him. I'd take him in a minute."[19] According to Tanner, "Dick was the leader of our team, the captain, the manager on the field. He took care of the young kids, took them under his wing. And he played every game as if it was his last day on earth."[30] Hall of Fame player Orlando Cepeda agreed, saying to author Tim Whitaker, "Dick Allen played with fire in his eyes." [31] Hall of Fame teammate Rich Gossage also confirmed Tanner's view. In an interview with USA TODAY Sports, Gossage said: "I've been around the game a long time, and he's the greatest player I've ever seen play in my life. He had the most amazing season (1972) I've ever seen. He's the smartest baseball man I've ever been around in my life. He taught me how to pitch from a hitter's prospective, and taught me how to play the game right. There's no telling the numbers this guy could have put up if all he worried about was stats. The guy belongs in the Hall of Fame." [32] Another of Allen's ex-White Sox teammates, pitcher Stan Bahnsen, said, "I actually thought that Dick was better than his stats. Every time we needed a clutch hit, he got it. He got along great with his teammates and he was very knowledgeable about the game. He was the ultimate team guy."[33] Another Hall of Fame teammate, Mike Schmidt, credited Dick Allen in his book, Clearing the Bases, as his mentor.[34] In Schmidt's biography, written by historian William C. Kashatus, Schmidt fondly recalls Allen mentoring him before a game in Chicago in 1976, saying to him, "Mike, you've got to relax. You've got to have some fun. Remember when you were just a kid and you'd skip supper to play ball? You were having fun. Hey, with all the talent you've got, baseball ought to be fun. Enjoy it. Be a kid again." Schmidt responded by hitting four home runs in that game. Mike Schmidt is quoted in the same book, "The baseball writers used to claim that Dick would divide the clubhouse along racial lines. That was a lie. The truth is that Dick never divided any clubhouse."[35]
