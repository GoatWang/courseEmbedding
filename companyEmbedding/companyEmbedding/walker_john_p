John was a professional truck driver for 32 years. He received a driver’s award for driving 500,000 miles safely for five years. He was a Merchant Marine, loved the Cleveland Indians and Lionel trains and enjoyed watching western movies.
His greatest joy in life came from spending time with his family. He was a family oriented man that loved his eight siblings, loving husband, best father ever to his four children and was a wonderful uncle.
Along with his loving wife of 51 years Jackie, John is survived by his children Gayle (Brian) Kreais of Fostoria, Ohio, Christopher Walker of Bowling Green, Carrie (Michael) Frey of Sandusky, Ohio and Keith Walker of Fostoria, Ohio.

 Jackie, Gayle,Chris, Carrie and Keith,  I am so very sorry for your loss. My thoughts and prayers are with you all in this time of sorrow... it's never easy to loose a loved one, but instead of thinking of it as a loss, think of it as the Lord calling him home and setting him free... he is young, pain free and flying high with his new perfect wings...

Johnnie Walker is a brand of Scotch whisky owned by Diageo that originates from the Scottish town of Kilmarnock, a large burgh in East Ayrshire, which is where the brand's creator, John Walker began making and distilling the whisky in the Johnnie Walker Bond located in the town centre. It is the most widely distributed brand of blended Scotch whisky in the world, sold in almost every country, with annual sales of the equivalent of over 226.2 million 750 ml bottles in 2015 (169.2 million litres).[1]
Despite being the birthplace of both John Walker, the creator of Johnnie Walker, and the Johnnie Walker brand and whisky itself, the brand's owners, Diageo, made the decision in 2009 to close all operations in the town of Kilmarnock, meeting with backlash from local people, local politics and then First Minister of Scotland, Alex Salmond. Despite petitions, a large-scale march around Kilmarnock and pressure placed upon the Scottish Government to persuade Diageo to change their minds, Diageo continued to press ahead with the closure. The Johnnie Walker plant situated in Hill Street in Kilmarnock closed its doors in March 2012[2].

History[edit]




Alexander Walker, son of John Walker, inherited the business following his father's death


Originally known as Walker's Kilmarnock Whisky, the Johnnie Walker brand is a legacy left by John "Johnnie" Walker after he started to sell whisky in his grocer's shop in Ayrshire, Scotland. The brand became popular, but after Walker's death in 1857 it was his son Alexander Walker and grandson Alexander Walker II who were largely responsible for establishing the whisky as a popular brand. Under John Walker, whisky sales represented eight percent of the firm's income; by the time Alexander was ready to pass on the company to his own sons, that figure had increased to between 90 and 95 percent.[3][4]
During that time John Walker sold a number of single malt whiskies—notably his own Walker's Kilmarnock. In 1867, he launched Johnnie Walker's first commercial blend and called it Old Highland Whisky. He then made the astute move of engaging ships' captains as his agents to carry his whisky wherever ships could sail. Before long, his unique blend was available around the globe.[5]
Alexander Walker introduced the iconic square bottle in 1860. This meant more bottles fitting the same space and resulted in fewer broken bottles. The other identifying characteristic of the Johnnie Walker bottle is the label, which is applied at an angle of 24 degrees and allows text to be made larger and more visible.[6]
From 1906 to 1909, John's grandsons George and Alexander II expanded the line and introduced the colour names. In 1908, when James Stevenson was the Managing Director, the re-branding was finalised and in 1909, Special Old Highland Whisky was renamed Johnnie Walker Red Label while the Extra Special Old Highland Whisky was renamed Johnnie Walker Black Label.[5] In addition, the slogan "Born 1820—Still going Strong!" was created, along with the Striding Man logo, a figure used in their advertisements to this day, created by illustrator Tom Browne, in honour of the founder, and given the same name.
Johnnie Walker White was dropped during World War I.[7] In 1932, Alexander II added Johnnie Walker Swing to the line, the name originating from the unusual shape of the bottle, which allowed it to rock back and forth.
The company joined Distillers Company in 1925. Distillers was acquired by Guinness in 1986, and Guinness merged with Grand Metropolitan to form Diageo in 1997.
Closure in Kilmarnock, Scotland[edit]
On 1 July 2009, Bryan Donaghey, Diageo Managing Director for Global Supply Scotland, announced that Diageo intended to cease production at the plant in Kilmarnock. Under a restructuring programme across Scotland, production would be moved from the brand's original home to Diageo plants in Leven, Fife, and Shieldhall, Glasgow. News of the planned closure had widespread media attention and condemnation. Following the decision, a public campaign was waged to try to persuade Diageo to reverse this decision. However, on 9 September 2009 Diageo stated that they intended to press ahead with the move away from Kilmarnock and that the matter was "closed".[8]
The Johnnie Walker plant, the largest employer in the town of Kilmarnock, closed its doors in March 2012.[9]
Blends[edit]
For most of its history Johnnie Walker only offered a few blends. In recent years there have been several special and limited bottlings.
Standard blends[edit]




A variety of blends.



Red Label: a 75 proof (40% ABV) blend of 35 grain and malt whiskies. It is intended for making mixed drinks.[10] According to William Manchester this was the favorite Scotch of Winston Churchill, who mixed it with soda.[11] Red Label has been reported to be former U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney's drink of choice.[12]
Black Label: a 75 proof (40% ABV) blend of about 40 whiskies, each aged at least 12 years. Caol Ila and Talisker are the dominating single malts in this blend. This drink was the favorite of journalist Christopher Hitchens, and as seen in Blade Runner.[13]
Double Black Label: a new addition, the whisky was created taking Black Label as a blueprint and influenced by peaty West Coast and Islay malts and matured in heavily charred old oak casks.[14]

Green Label: a 75 proof (43% ABV) whisky, this variety is a blended malt, meaning it is made just from single-malts with no grain whisky added. Green Label uses predominantly four malts "drawn from the four corners of Scotland." Each of the malts (Talisker, Linkwood, Cragganmore, and Caol Ila) was selected by the blender for balance, with each malt whisky matured for a minimum of 15 years.[15][16][17]
Gold Label: a 75 proof (40% ABV) blend of over 15 single malts, particularly Clynelish. It was derived from Alexander Walker II's blending notes for a whisky to commemorate Johnnie Walker's centenary. His original efforts were thwarted by a shortage of these malts following World War I. Gold Label is commonly bottled at 15 or 18 years and usually labelled "The Centenary blend". In 2013, Gold Label was replaced, with a No Age Statement (NAS) blend, labelled "Gold Label Reserve". The bottle and labeling of these two Gold Label offerings is very similar, while some will argue the whiskys inside are not.[18]
Platinum Label: a 75 proof (40% ABV) private blend—aged 18 years to replace the original Gold Label in the Asian market, and sold alongside Gold Label Reserve. It is also available in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Poland, South Africa and Israel.
Blue Label: Johnnie Walker's premium 70–75 proof (40–43% ABV[19][20]) blend with no age statement. Johnnie Walker Blue Label, also known as Max Walker, is blended to recreate the character and taste of some of the earliest whisky blends created in the 19th century.[21] Bottles are numbered serially and sold in a silk-lined box accompanied by a certificate of authenticity. It is one of the most expensive blended Scotches on the market, with prices in the range of US $174–$450.[22]
Johnnie Walker Swing: supplied in a distinctive bottle whose irregular bottom allows it to rock back and forth. This type of bottle design was originally used aboard sailing ships. It was Alexander II's last blend: it features a high proportion of Speyside malts, complemented by malts from the northern Highlands and Islay, and is "almost as sweet as a bourbon".[23]
Red & Cola: a premix of Red Label and cola, sold in cans and bottles similar to beer.

Note: The strength of the alcohol in a bottle is printed on the label as alcohol by volume(%ABV) or degrees proof. To convert %ABV into degrees proof globally (except in the US), multiply by 1.75(7/4). Thus a 40% ABV value denotes 40 x 7/4 = 70 proof.[24] In the US, proof value is twice the %ABV. Thus a 40% ABV whisky will be 80 proof in the US and 70 proof elsewhere.[25]

Johnnie Walker blends, by years of production, and from least expensive to most expensive. Note : While most of the whiskies with name changes are the same Old Highland/White Label is NOT the same as Red & Cola

Marketing[edit]
Every type of Johnnie Walker scotch has a label colour as previously noted, except for the aforementioned Swing label. The purpose is to denote the different types of scotch and to position them to be used for different occasions. For example, Johnnie Walker Blue Label is rare and expensive, and so it is intended to be used for special occasions.[citation needed]
A key feature of every bottle of Johnnie Walker scotch is the Striding Man logo. It was created in 1908 by illustrator Tom Browne to be a likeness of John Walker in traditional, upscale attire. In the logo, the man is walking forward, which Diageo says symbolises forward thinking and the pursuit of excellence. Diageo has created a members club for Johnnie Walker drinkers, called "The Striding Man Society".[37]
Another key aspect of its marketing is the slanted label, which is angled at exactly 24 degrees. This was an advertising tool developed by Alexander Walker, who thought it would help his bottles stand out on the shelf. The slanted label also accommodates more text than would a traditionally oriented label.[38]
In 2009, the advertising agency Bartle Bogle Hegarty (BBH) created a new short film, starring Robert Carlyle and directed by Jamie Rafn, titled The Man Who Walked Around the World, which outlined the history of the Johnnie Walker brand.[6][39][40]
In 2013, ahead of the sixth season of Mad Men, the firm launched an ad campaign featuring Christina Hendricks.[citation needed]
Johnnie Walker also launched the international John Walker & Sons Voyager tour in order to market its higher variants in the Asia-Pacific, Europe and Caribbean markets. The Voyager tour was developed in order to promote the special edition Odyssey blend and pay tribute to the original trade routes and sea voyages by which Johnnie Walker was distributed throughout the world. The final leg of the tour was completed in 2014 visiting six Caribbean countries on board the Regina Yacht (featured in the major motion picture Skyfall).
Controversies[edit]
2015 forged kosher certification allegations[edit]
Up until 2015 Johnnie Walker Black Label bottles had a Kosher sign, naming the OK Kosher organization as one that provide Kosher tests for the product. IBBL and Paneco groups export Johnny Walker to Israel.[41]
Following an inquiry by the Israeli Rabbinical authority, Rabbi Aharon Hesskel from the OK organization conducted an investigation and published that only IBBLS marks are genuine while the Paneco group did not get their certification.[42] The Israeli Rabbinical authority released a statement that urged customers to verify the producer and stated that the Paneco group is suspected of certificate forgery. Paneco representatives stated that they do have a Kosher certificate (from the Israeli rabbinical authority) and asked the Israeli police to perform an investigation.[43] A representative told the International Business Times, "All products sold on Paneco.com are completely and solely original. The Johnnie Walker whisky products sold on the site are created by the primary manufacturer at the Diageo distillery in Scotland and is exactly the same product marketed by a competing company in Israel, which holds the kosher certification for the product."[41]
