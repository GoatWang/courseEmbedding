	Re:


	Transocean Partners LLC Registration Statement on Form S-1




	Ladies and Gentlemen:


	We have acted as U.S. counsel for Transocean Partners LLC (the Company), a Marshall Islands limited liability company, with respect
	to certain legal matters in connection with the offer and sale by Transocean Partners Holdings Limited of common units representing limited liability company interests in the Company. We have also participated in the preparation of a Prospectus (the
	Prospectus) forming part of the Registration Statement on Form S-1, No. 333-196958 (the Registration Statement).


	This opinion is based on various facts and assumptions, and is conditioned upon certain representations made by the Company as to factual
	matters through a certificate of an officer of the Company (the Officers Certificate). In addition, this opinion is based upon the factual representations of the Company concerning its business, properties, and governing documents
	as set forth in the Registration Statement.


	In our capacity as counsel to the Company, we have made such legal and factual examinations
	and inquiries, including an examination of originals or copies certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction of such documents, corporate records, and other instruments, as we have deemed necessary or appropriate for purposes of this
	opinion. In our examination, we have assumed the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the genuineness of all signatures thereon, the legal capacity of natural persons executing such documents, and the conformity to authentic
	original documents of all documents submitted to us as copies. For the purpose of our opinion, we have not made an independent investigation or audit of the facts set forth in the above-referenced documents or in the Officers Certificate. In
	addition, in rendering this opinion we have assumed the truth and accuracy of all representations and statements made to us which are qualified as to knowledge or belief, without regard to such qualification.


	We are opining herein as to the effect on the subject transaction only of the federal income tax laws of the United States, and we express no
	opinion with respect to the applicability thereto, or the effect thereon, of other federal laws, foreign laws, the laws of any state or any other jurisdiction or as to any matters of municipal law or the laws of any other local agencies within any
	state. We hereby confirm that all statements of legal conclusions contained in the discussion in the Prospectus under the caption Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations constitute the opinion of Baker Botts L.L.P. with respect
	to the matters set forth therein as of the effective date of the Registration Statement, subject to the assumptions, qualifications, and limitations set forth therein. No opinion is expressed as to any matter not discussed therein.


	This opinion is rendered to you as of the effective date of the Registration Statement, and we undertake no obligation to update this opinion
	subsequent to the date hereof. This opinion is based on various statutory provisions, regulations promulgated thereunder, and interpretations thereof by the Internal Revenue Service and the courts having jurisdiction over such matters, all of which
	are subject to change either prospectively or retroactively. Also, any variation or difference in the facts from those set forth in the representations described above, including in the Registration Statement and the Officers Certificate, may
	affect the conclusions stated herein.

	This opinion is furnished to you, and is for your use in connection with the transactions set
	forth in the Registration Statement. This opinion may not be relied upon by you for any other purpose or furnished to, assigned to, quoted to, or relied upon by any other person, firm, or other entity, for any purpose, without our prior written
	consent. However, this opinion may be relied upon by you and by persons entitled to rely on it pursuant to applicable provisions of federal securities law, including persons purchasing common units pursuant to the Registration Statement.


	We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the Prospectus and to the use of our name under the captions Material
	U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations and Legal Matters in the Registration Statement. We further consent to the incorporation by reference of this letter and consent into any registration statement filed pursuant to Rule 462(b)
	under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), with respect to the common units. By giving this consent, we do not admit that we are within the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the
	Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission thereunder.

	EXPLANATORY NOTE




	DEREGISTRATION OF SECURITIES




	This Post-Effective Amendment relates to the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (the “Registration Statement”), File No. 333-206171, of Transocean Partners LLC, a Marshall Islands limited liability company (“Transocean Partners”) and Transocean Partners’ subsidiary guarantor registrants (together with Transocean Partners, the “Registrants”) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on August 6, 2015 and declared effective August 21, 2015. The Registration Statement registered the offer and sale from time to time of up to $2,000,000,000 of Transocean Partners’ common units representing limited liability company interests (“common units”), other classes of units representing limited liability company interests (“general units”), debt securities (“debt securities”) and guarantees of debt securities (“guarantees” and, together with common units, general units and debt securities, the “Securities”).




	On December 6, 2016, the unitholders of Transocean Partners approved the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of July 31, 2016 (the “Original Merger Agreement”), as amended on November 21, 2016 (the “Amendment” and the Original Merger Agreement as amended by the Amendment, the “Merger Agreement”), by and among Transocean Ltd., a Swiss corporation (“Transocean”), Transocean Partners, Transocean Partners Holdings Limited, a Cayman Islands exempted company (“Transocean Holdings”) and TPHL Holdings LLC, a Marshall Islands limited liability company (“Merger Sub”). Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, on December 9, 2016, Transocean Partners is anticipated to merge with Merger Sub, with Transocean Partners continuing as the surviving entity and as an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Transocean (the “Merger”). Each outstanding common unit representing a limited liability company interest of Transocean Partners, other than common units held by Transocean, Transocean Partners, Transocean Holdings, Merger Sub or any other subsidiary of Transocean, was converted into the right to receive 1.2000 Transocean shares.




	In connection with the anticipated completion of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the Registrants have terminated all offerings of Securities pursuant to the Registration Statement. In accordance with undertakings made by the Registrants in the Registration Statement to remove from registration, by means of a post-effective amendment, any of the Securities that had been registered for issuance that remain unsold at the termination of such offering, the Registrants hereby remove from registration all of such Securities of the Registrants registered but unsold under the Registration Statement.
