Power REIT Loses; What Now?


Tom Konrad CFA

 
On April 22nd, the court ruled against
Power REIT (NYSE:PW)
in the summary judgement phase of its litigation with Norfolk
Southern Corp (NYSE:NSC) and Wheeling and Lake Erie Railroad
(WLE).  At issue were if NSC and WLE were in default
on a lease of 112 miles of track, and a number of claims
surrounding the lease, and if they owed Power REIT's legal fees
under the lease.

Had power REIT prevailed on any of a number of counts, it could
have been worth as much as $15 dollars a share to Power REIT
shareholders.  

As it is, Power REIT still has the option to appeal, and there
are a couple of claims against Power REIT which will need to be
decided in a status conference scheduled by the court on April
29th, or at trial.  These remaining claims regard whether
Power REIT acted improperly when it reorganized itself into a
holding company which owns its predecessor entity, the Pittsburgh
& West Virginia Railway.  According to David Lesser,
Power REIT's CEO, NSC and WLE have said in court that it is
impossible to show financial harm because of these claims, and so
I expect them to be settled or dropped at the at the status
conference, unless Power REIT decides to appeal.

Grounds For Appeal?

I found the ruling shocking in that I did not expect much at all
to be decided in summary judgement.  While I thought many of
Power REITs claims were weak, I thought others (such as default
under the books and records clause of the lease, and the payment
of legal fees) were quite strong.  Another investor who has
read the judgement told me he was "Truly shocked how one sided
this went through, not that it matters but makes me wonder if
[the] judge [was] corrupted or biased somehow."

To me, the ruling seemed very biased as well, and I'm sure it
seemed so to Lesser, judging from a short conversation with
him.  He felt the judge had gone far beyond the bounds of
summary judgment, and was even creating new rights under the lease
where none had existed before.

I don't know if any of this constitutes grounds for appeal, but I
am confident that if PW were to appeal, NSC and WLE would again
fight the appeal vigorously, and the company could easily be left
to pay even more legal bills than it has to now.  Whatever
the grounds, I don't think such an appeal would be a
cost-effective way to create value for shareholders.

Valuing the Remains

Due to a very timely note from another investor who had seen the
ruling before I did, I was able to sell all of the client holdings
of PW in accounts I manage, but I did not have time to sell my own
before the stock fell below $8 and began to plummet. Shortly
thereafter, trading was halted, and Power REIT made a press
regarding the ruling.

When the market opens Thursday, the only remaining
questions  are if Power REIT will appeal, and what the stock
worth now.  Since I don't think an appeal would be in
shareholders' interests, and Lesser is the largest shareholder, an
appeal seems unlikely.  Hence, I will focus on the remaining
value.  This ruling means that the company will be able to
write off (for tax purposes) the $16.6 million value of a
"Settlement Account" under the lease because the account is
essentially un-collectible.  This write-off allows the next
$16.6 million worth of dividends on Power REIT's common and
Preferred stock to be taxed as return of capital rather than
income.  

The common stock does not currently pay a dividend, while the
preferred stock pays a 7.75% annual dividend based on its $25 par
value, or $1.875 per preferred share annually.  Power REIT's
most
recent shareholder update puts Funds From Operations (FFO)
available to pay dividends on both classes of stock at $1.260
million annually (slide 18).  $260 thousand of this is needed
to pay annual dividends on $3.5 million of preferred stock, with
the remaining $1 million available to pay the legal expenses which
are the majority of the accounts payable at $1.260 million. 
Approximately five quarters of free cash flow will be needed for
accounts payable before the dividend on the common stock can be
resumed.  

There are currently 1.7 million shares outstanding, which will
probably grow as the company continues to pay stock based
compensation.  Let us assume conservatively that Power REIT
resumes its dividend in late 2016, at which time it has 1.8 million
common shares outstanding.  Then FFO per share would be $0.56,
easily sufficient to resume its former $0.40 annual dividend, while
retaining significant capital to fund future growth.  This
dividend would now be categorized as return of capital, so
shareholders would not have to pay taxes on it until they sold the
stock, when it would be taxed as capital gains (usually at a much
more favorable rate than income.)  PW could choose to pay a
higher dividend, but given its plans to rapidly expand its renewable
energy holdings, I would expect it to retain some capital for
growth.  At any reasonable dividend rate, the tax write-off is
large enough to ensure all dividends count as return of capital for
well over a decade.

A 5-6% dividend yield seems reasonable for a tiny, but growing, REIT
like PW, depending on how much investors value the tax advantages of
the dividend and the growth prospects.  A 6% yield would put PW
$6.67 per share in late 2016, a 5% dividend would put the stock at
$8 per share.  Discounting that by 20% to account for the one
to two year wait for the dividend to resume, I see the company's
shares to be worth between $5.30 and $6.70 per share.

Upsides

There are a number of possible upsides to this estimate.  On
page 19 of the same investor presentation, the company valued its
assets based on discount rates currently being paid on the open
market for similar assets.  The jewel in the crown is the
railroad lease, which has similar cash flow characteristics as a
perpetual bond from NSC.  Valued at the 4% discount rate NSC
pays on long term debt, the lease is worth $13.21 per share. 
At a more conservative 6% which I think PW might be able to get if
it sold the lease to the highest bidder, it's still worth $8.80 per
share.  Such a sale would do a lot to increase the current
stock price by allowing Power REIT to repay its most expensive debt
and/or pay legal bills and resume the dividend sooner. 
The end of the litigation might also solve the problem of
expensive debt by making banks more willing to provide financing
with the perceived risks of the lawsuit are gone. 
Refinancing existing debt at a lower rate could immediately free
up cash flow to reduce accounts payable and resume the dividend
sooner, possibly at a higher rate.

Without the distraction of  the lawsuit, Power REIT could
continue the process of turning itself into a yieldco by buying
land under solar and wind parks with mostly debt financing. 
Given the large tax advantages of its REIT structure combined with
the return of capital treatment of its distributions for years to
come, it might be able to resume and begin to grow its dividend
much more quickly than I outlined above.

Conclusion

At $6.33 a share, where PW closed on the day of the summary
judgment, the company falls within the range of fair value based
on when I would expect it to resume its dividend.  As the
market adjusts to the new reality, look for buying opportunities
below $5, or chances to sell if it quickly advances above $7
without news (such as a refinancing of debt) which has the
potential to increase cash flow.

To me, the preferred stock, PW-PA
seems like a much more attractive proposition.  Power REIT
has plenty of cash flow to continue paying the preferred dividend,
and now that dividend will be categorized as return of capital for
the foreseeable future.  Even if the preferred dividend were
to be suspended, it would have to be paid in arrears before the
common dividend was resumed.

Power REIT: Light at the End of the Tunnel?








It Could Have Been The First Yieldco


October 31, 2014



By
Tom Konrad


Freelance Writer, Consultant






































 I first became interested in Power REIT (NYSE MKT:PW) in 2012 because of the company's plans to become what would have been the first US-listed "yieldco," i.e. a clean energy power producer paying a high level of reliable dividends to investors.  The company was an infrastructure Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) with a single asset: its subsidiary, Pittsburgh & West Virginia Railway (P&WV) which owned 122 miles of track leased to Norfolk Southern Corp. (NYSE:NSC), which had in turn subleased the track to Wheeling & Lake Erie (WLE.)  The rent on the rail asset was fixed at $915,000 per year with no adjustment for inflation, meaning that the expenses of remaining a public company had been taking a larger and larger share of income.  


In 2011, David Lesser was an executive with experience running REITs and a passion for renewable energy looking for his next opportunity. He realized that solar and wind farms produce reliable, long term cash flows, but at the time, there were no publicly traded vehicles for income oriented investors to benefit from these cash flows.  He saw the opportunity for a REIT to buy the land underlying wind and solar development, lease it back to the wind and solar operators, and deliver the payments to investors in the form of a sustainable yield.  Lesser and his allies saw P&WV as an appropriate vehicle for this, and began buying its stock.  In 2011, he became Chairman and CEO, and formed the holding company Power REIT to own P&WV and future renewable energy real estate assets as a publicly listed holding company.[Native Advertisement]
The immense appetite that investors have shown for the yeildcos launched by renewable energy developers in 2013 and 2014 has amply demonstrated Lesser's business plan to be a good one, but P&WV's railroad asset has side tracked its execution.  The company has only done two smallish solar deals because of the distraction.
Side Tracked on West End Branch
The side track started with a minor dispute over legal fees.  The lease is somewhat unusual, in that (according to the court filings of the lessees) it was designed to give the lessees as much control of the property as possible without taking legal ownership under US tax laws.  Since P&WV retained ownership of the property, but ceased to be an operating company when the lease was signed, the lease provides for the lessees to pay any of P&WV's expenses which are "necessary or desirable" to protect its interest in the property, unless those expenses were "solely" for the benefit of its shareholders.
When Lesser received notification in 2011 that WLE intended to sell a part of the property known as "West End Branch" he consulted with his attorneys to understand P&WV's rights and obligations under the lease. While WLE does have the right under the lease to sell parts of the property it does not need as long as it follows the appropriate procedures, it refused to pay the resulting attorney's fees.  Since the lease seemed to be clear to Lesser and his attorneys in this regard, after several attempts to get WLE to pay, this refusal became an incurable default under the lease.   Since the default was incurable, P&WV's only recourse was to foreclose.
WLE and NSC wanted to maintain what had become a very attractive agreement in their favor over the fifty years since it had initially been signed, and so they filed a civil action against P&WV and Power REIT to prevent the foreclosure in early 2012.  Over the last two years, increasing amounts of PW management and resources have been required in the litigation against two larger and much better funded companies, but Lesser feels firmly that the time and expense will eventually prove to be very attractive investments.  Not only does a reasonable interpretation of the lease provide for WLE and NSC to pay all the expenses (which seem to be a clear example of expenses which are "necessary or desirable" to maintain P&WV's interest in its property), but numerous other violations of the letter of lease have come to light since the initial dispute about West End Branch legal fees.  
If PW is able to foreclose, a bookkeeping "settlement account" under the lease worth at least $16 million and as much as $68 million will be due, and it (or part of it) may be due even if the court finds the lease not in default.  
The State of Litigation
The current litigation is complex, with multiple accusations in both directions.  Power REIT has posted an archive of most of the court documents on its website.  The most recently filed documents are each party's opposition to the other's Motion for Summary Judgement, and these documents do an excellent job of summarizing each party's position in a very complex case.
Perhaps the most remarkable feature is just how far apart the two sides are.  Power REIT spells out several counts on which WLE and NSC have violated the wording of the lease.  WLE and NSC deny them all, and say that Lesser is a money-grabbing capitalist whose intention has all along been to manufacture defaults under the lease to extract money out of them.  Their main argument is that the parties had been doing everything their way all along, and so that should not change, even if the lease says otherwise.  They also claim, somewhat hypocritically considering the above argument, that Lesser is trying to change the terms of the lease, and that should constitute a default.
I'm not a legal expert, and I have no way of knowing which side is in the right when it comes to the legal issues.  How much does the intent behind the lease count compared to the words of the lease itself?  How important are the previous actions of the parties?#rewpage#
All that said, my layman's reading of the lease tends to support PW's side in almost all cases. I am also repeatedly shocked that WLE and NSC repeatedly say things in their testimony that I find impossible to believe.  For instance, I know from my many interactions with Lesser that his business plan for Power REIT was always been to turn the company into a yieldco: The lease is a distraction, even if it may turn out to be a very lucrative one.  
The evidence in the case also seems to directly contradict some of their testimony.  For example, on page 4 of Document 210 "Plaintiff Opposition to PWV Motion for Summary Judgement", they state that the West End Branch invoice I discussed above "did not relate to the West End Branch sale," and that the attorney's testimony supported this statement.  Yet the attorney said that he recalled reviewing the lease with Lesser for "the general purpose of determining [P&WV's] rights under the lease" relating to the sale of such property (Document 211-4, pp.49-50.)
I found this contradiction because the opposing side's motions seemed to directly contradict each other when it came to the evidence in the exhibits.  Having found one such contradiction, I expect there are more.
Likely Outcome and Timing
With the opposition documents filed, the parties have two more weeks to file another round of attempts to refute each other, after which the judge will decide on each of the motions for summary judgement.  Given that the parties are so far apart, it seems unlikely that many (if any) of the issues will be decided in summary judgment.   At the judge's behest, the parties have also agreed to attempt mediation and have agreed on a mediator.  This seems even less likely to lead anywhere, given the complete lack of common ground, although if the judge were to rule mostly in one party's favor in summary judgment, the other party might be spurred to compromise on the remaining points rather than to go to trial before a clearly unsympathetic judge.
The most likely course seems unsuccessful mediation leading to a trial in early 2015.  I have no idea how long a trial will take, but with three years having past since the dispute began, the judge has been pushing for the speediest possible resolution.  
If WLE and NSC get their way on every count, the lease will continue as it was before PW's attempt to foreclose.  The company will be out its substantial legal fees, but will be able to write off the $16 million at which the "settlement account" is carried on its tax records as an asset.  This will cause future distributions to PW common and preferred shareholders to be characterized as return of capital rather than income, increasing their value to taxable shareholders.
If PW is able to foreclose, the settlement account will be due, as well as the likely reimbursement of its legal costs.  It will be able to re-lease or sell the track at market rates.   All this could be quite substantial: $16 million is $9.25 per share of common stock, which is currently trading around $10/share.  The company does have liabilities, but it also has other assets such as its solar land and leases and the railroad property itself. 
Conclusion
I first bought Power REIT stock because I saw a very promising yieldco in the making.  After this legal case is resolved, the company will be able to get back on track to becoming a promising if minor yieldco which takes advantage of the REIT tax structure.  (The only other REIT yieldco is Hannon Armstrong Sustainable Infrastructure (NYSE:HASI.))  The long litigation caused Power REIT to lose its first mover advantage, but it also offers the potential of a substantial upside and limited downside for shareholders.  Three years have passed since the dispute began, but it will likely reach a conclusion before the end of a fourth.
