Amec Foster Wheeler wins EPC contract for one of the largest undeveloped gold deposits in Australia 

Newsfacts:

Second major gold project awarded in 12 months reinforces Amec Foster Wheeler’s longstanding global leadership in the development of gold mines



Amec Foster Wheeler has been awarded an Engineering Procurement and Construction (EPC) contract by Gruyere Management Pty Ltd (GRM) (agent and manager for the joint venture between Gold Road Resources Limited and Gruyere Mining Company Pty Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of Gold Fields Limited) for the Gruyere Gold Project.
The value of the EPC contract is AUD$298 million.
The Gruyere Gold Project, located approximately 200 kilometres east of Laverton, in Western Australia, is one of the largest undeveloped gold deposits in Australia. The mine is expected to be a large-scale open pit operation feeding a 7.5 million to 8.8 million tonnes per annum processing plant.
The contract for GRM will be jointly executed by Amec Foster Wheeler and Civmec Construction and Engineering as the Amec Foster Wheeler Civmec JV (ACJV) and follows their successful joint delivery of the ‘Early Contractor Involvement’ phase. The scope of work includes the engineering, procurement and construction of the process plant and associated infrastructure.
Amec Foster Wheeler delivers services across the entire life cycle of mining projects, for a wide range of commodities including gold, copper, diamonds, iron ore, uranium, nickel and lithium.
Over the past three decades, Amec Foster Wheeler has developed a peerless level of expertise in gold extraction technology, having successfully delivered over 125 gold projects globally for key customers in the industry. This includes the current EPCM contract for the Çöpler Sulfide Expansion Project in Turkey for Anagold Madencilik, which was awarded in July 2016 and is scheduled for completion in 2018.





“

Amec Foster Wheeler has worked on some of the largest and most technically complex gold projects in the world. Winning this contract is testament to how we are delivering on our strategy to expand our EPC business, and our ability to work across all phases of a project to deliver solutions for customers. We look forward to drawing on our extensive international gold expertise to deliver a world class facility for Gruyere, one of the largest undeveloped gold deposits in Australia.
Dave Lawson, Amec Foster Wheeler’s President for Mining„

Amec Foster Wheeler wins EPC contract for one of the largest undeveloped gold deposits in Australia 

Newsfacts:

Second major gold project awarded in 12 months reinforces Amec Foster Wheeler’s longstanding global leadership in the development of gold mines



Amec Foster Wheeler has been awarded an Engineering Procurement and Construction (EPC) contract by Gruyere Management Pty Ltd (GRM) (agent and manager for the joint venture between Gold Road Resources Limited and Gruyere Mining Company Pty Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of Gold Fields Limited) for the Gruyere Gold Project.
The value of the EPC contract is AUD$298 million.
The Gruyere Gold Project, located approximately 200 kilometres east of Laverton, in Western Australia, is one of the largest undeveloped gold deposits in Australia. The mine is expected to be a large-scale open pit operation feeding a 7.5 million to 8.8 million tonnes per annum processing plant.
The contract for GRM will be jointly executed by Amec Foster Wheeler and Civmec Construction and Engineering as the Amec Foster Wheeler Civmec JV (ACJV) and follows their successful joint delivery of the ‘Early Contractor Involvement’ phase. The scope of work includes the engineering, procurement and construction of the process plant and associated infrastructure.
Amec Foster Wheeler delivers services across the entire life cycle of mining projects, for a wide range of commodities including gold, copper, diamonds, iron ore, uranium, nickel and lithium.
Over the past three decades, Amec Foster Wheeler has developed a peerless level of expertise in gold extraction technology, having successfully delivered over 125 gold projects globally for key customers in the industry. This includes the current EPCM contract for the Çöpler Sulfide Expansion Project in Turkey for Anagold Madencilik, which was awarded in July 2016 and is scheduled for completion in 2018.





“

Amec Foster Wheeler has worked on some of the largest and most technically complex gold projects in the world. Winning this contract is testament to how we are delivering on our strategy to expand our EPC business, and our ability to work across all phases of a project to deliver solutions for customers. We look forward to drawing on our extensive international gold expertise to deliver a world class facility for Gruyere, one of the largest undeveloped gold deposits in Australia.
Dave Lawson, Amec Foster Wheeler’s President for Mining„

History[edit]
AMEC was formed from the 1982 amalgamation of Leonard Fairclough & Son (founded 1883) and the William Press Group (founded 1913). In 1988, AMEC went on to acquire Matthew Hall Group.[6] In 1996, AMEC took a 40% stake in Spie Batignolles from Schneider in association with a management buyout.[7] Amec launched the AMEC SPIE brand for engineering services in Europe,[8] a rail construction business AMEC Spie Rail was created, and the remaining construction business was retained as Spie Batignolles.[9] The company announced that it would seek to sell the construction arm of the business Spie Batignolles, and entered negotiations to secure a management buyout of that division;[9][10] the management buyout of the construction arm of Spie was completed in September 2003 with the aid of Barclays Private Equity Finance[11] and later that year Amec took full control of the remaining parts of Spie.[12]
Acquisitions in the new millennium included Ogden Environmental & Energy Services[13] and AGRA Monenco Inc., a North American engineering and services company, both in 2000[14] as well as the U.S. operations and equipment of Lauren Kamtech in 2003.[15] Then in 2004, AMEC was awarded a contract to assist in the reconstruction effort in Iraq, as part of a joint venture with Fluor Corp.[16]
In 2005, AMEC acquired UK-based NNC, a large nuclear consulting company and its subsidiaries, including Ontario-based Nuclear Safety Solutions ('NSS'), the nuclear safety division of OPG, which was spun off when OPG was privatised.[17] The European engineering business, AMEC SPIE, was sold to PAI Partners for €1,040 million in 2006[18][19][20][21] and the European rail business joint venture Amec Spie Rail systems was sold for an estimated £200million in 2007, to Colas Group.[22][23][24]
In 2007, AMEC sold its UK construction arm to Morgan Sindall[25] and in 2008, it sold its internal plant hire division to Speedy Hire[26] before buying project services company Rider Hunt International,[27] North American environmental consulting firm Geomatrix Consultants, Inc., and Slovakian nuclear services company AllDeco.[28] In 2009, AMEC acquired Performance Improvement Group, Journeaux, Bedard & Associates and GRD Limited[29] and in 2010, it continued to expand with the £61.2 m purchase of Entec UK, one of the UK's largest Environmental Consultancies.[30] The company also acquired Australian-based businesses Currie and Brown (Australia)[31] and BurmanGriffiths and acquired a majority stake in S2V Consulting.[32]
In 2011, the company acquired US-based BCI Engineers & Scientists, Inc.,[33] MACTEC, a US-based engineering consultancy company,[34] and Zektin Group, an Australian-based specialist engineering consultancy for the oil and gas and resources industries.[35] In January 2014, AMEC provisionally agreed a £1.9bn takeover of Swiss rival Foster Wheeler.[36] AMEC completed its purchase of Foster Wheeler on 13 November 2014 and simultaneously changed its name to Amec Foster Wheeler plc.[37]
In March 2017, Wood Group announced it would acquire the company for £2.2 billion.[38]

History[edit]
AMEC was formed from the 1982 amalgamation of Leonard Fairclough & Son (founded 1883) and the William Press Group (founded 1913). In 1988, AMEC went on to acquire Matthew Hall Group.[6] In 1996, AMEC took a 40% stake in Spie Batignolles from Schneider in association with a management buyout.[7] Amec launched the AMEC SPIE brand for engineering services in Europe,[8] a rail construction business AMEC Spie Rail was created, and the remaining construction business was retained as Spie Batignolles.[9] The company announced that it would seek to sell the construction arm of the business Spie Batignolles, and entered negotiations to secure a management buyout of that division;[9][10] the management buyout of the construction arm of Spie was completed in September 2003 with the aid of Barclays Private Equity Finance[11] and later that year Amec took full control of the remaining parts of Spie.[12]
Acquisitions in the new millennium included Ogden Environmental & Energy Services[13] and AGRA Monenco Inc., a North American engineering and services company, both in 2000[14] as well as the U.S. operations and equipment of Lauren Kamtech in 2003.[15] Then in 2004, AMEC was awarded a contract to assist in the reconstruction effort in Iraq, as part of a joint venture with Fluor Corp.[16]
In 2005, AMEC acquired UK-based NNC, a large nuclear consulting company and its subsidiaries, including Ontario-based Nuclear Safety Solutions ('NSS'), the nuclear safety division of OPG, which was spun off when OPG was privatised.[17] The European engineering business, AMEC SPIE, was sold to PAI Partners for €1,040 million in 2006[18][19][20][21] and the European rail business joint venture Amec Spie Rail systems was sold for an estimated £200million in 2007, to Colas Group.[22][23][24]
In 2007, AMEC sold its UK construction arm to Morgan Sindall[25] and in 2008, it sold its internal plant hire division to Speedy Hire[26] before buying project services company Rider Hunt International,[27] North American environmental consulting firm Geomatrix Consultants, Inc., and Slovakian nuclear services company AllDeco.[28] In 2009, AMEC acquired Performance Improvement Group, Journeaux, Bedard & Associates and GRD Limited[29] and in 2010, it continued to expand with the £61.2 m purchase of Entec UK, one of the UK's largest Environmental Consultancies.[30] The company also acquired Australian-based businesses Currie and Brown (Australia)[31] and BurmanGriffiths and acquired a majority stake in S2V Consulting.[32]
In 2011, the company acquired US-based BCI Engineers & Scientists, Inc.,[33] MACTEC, a US-based engineering consultancy company,[34] and Zektin Group, an Australian-based specialist engineering consultancy for the oil and gas and resources industries.[35] In January 2014, AMEC provisionally agreed a £1.9bn takeover of Swiss rival Foster Wheeler.[36] AMEC completed its purchase of Foster Wheeler on 13 November 2014 and simultaneously changed its name to Amec Foster Wheeler plc.[37]
In March 2017, Wood Group announced it would acquire the company for £2.2 billion.[38]

History[edit]
AMEC was formed from the 1982 amalgamation of Leonard Fairclough & Son (founded 1883) and the William Press Group (founded 1913). In 1988, AMEC went on to acquire Matthew Hall Group.[6] In 1996, AMEC took a 40% stake in Spie Batignolles from Schneider in association with a management buyout.[7] Amec launched the AMEC SPIE brand for engineering services in Europe,[8] a rail construction business AMEC Spie Rail was created, and the remaining construction business was retained as Spie Batignolles.[9] The company announced that it would seek to sell the construction arm of the business Spie Batignolles, and entered negotiations to secure a management buyout of that division;[9][10] the management buyout of the construction arm of Spie was completed in September 2003 with the aid of Barclays Private Equity Finance[11] and later that year Amec took full control of the remaining parts of Spie.[12]
Acquisitions in the new millennium included Ogden Environmental & Energy Services[13] and AGRA Monenco Inc., a North American engineering and services company, both in 2000[14] as well as the U.S. operations and equipment of Lauren Kamtech in 2003.[15] Then in 2004, AMEC was awarded a contract to assist in the reconstruction effort in Iraq, as part of a joint venture with Fluor Corp.[16]
In 2005, AMEC acquired UK-based NNC, a large nuclear consulting company and its subsidiaries, including Ontario-based Nuclear Safety Solutions ('NSS'), the nuclear safety division of OPG, which was spun off when OPG was privatised.[17] The European engineering business, AMEC SPIE, was sold to PAI Partners for €1,040 million in 2006[18][19][20][21] and the European rail business joint venture Amec Spie Rail systems was sold for an estimated £200million in 2007, to Colas Group.[22][23][24]
In 2007, AMEC sold its UK construction arm to Morgan Sindall[25] and in 2008, it sold its internal plant hire division to Speedy Hire[26] before buying project services company Rider Hunt International,[27] North American environmental consulting firm Geomatrix Consultants, Inc., and Slovakian nuclear services company AllDeco.[28] In 2009, AMEC acquired Performance Improvement Group, Journeaux, Bedard & Associates and GRD Limited[29] and in 2010, it continued to expand with the £61.2 m purchase of Entec UK, one of the UK's largest Environmental Consultancies.[30] The company also acquired Australian-based businesses Currie and Brown (Australia)[31] and BurmanGriffiths and acquired a majority stake in S2V Consulting.[32]
In 2011, the company acquired US-based BCI Engineers & Scientists, Inc.,[33] MACTEC, a US-based engineering consultancy company,[34] and Zektin Group, an Australian-based specialist engineering consultancy for the oil and gas and resources industries.[35] In January 2014, AMEC provisionally agreed a £1.9bn takeover of Swiss rival Foster Wheeler.[36] AMEC completed its purchase of Foster Wheeler on 13 November 2014 and simultaneously changed its name to Amec Foster Wheeler plc.[37]
In March 2017, Wood Group announced it would acquire the company for £2.2 billion.[38]

History[edit]
AMEC was formed from the 1982 amalgamation of Leonard Fairclough & Son (founded 1883) and the William Press Group (founded 1913). In 1988, AMEC went on to acquire Matthew Hall Group.[6] In 1996, AMEC took a 40% stake in Spie Batignolles from Schneider in association with a management buyout.[7] Amec launched the AMEC SPIE brand for engineering services in Europe,[8] a rail construction business AMEC Spie Rail was created, and the remaining construction business was retained as Spie Batignolles.[9] The company announced that it would seek to sell the construction arm of the business Spie Batignolles, and entered negotiations to secure a management buyout of that division;[9][10] the management buyout of the construction arm of Spie was completed in September 2003 with the aid of Barclays Private Equity Finance[11] and later that year Amec took full control of the remaining parts of Spie.[12]
Acquisitions in the new millennium included Ogden Environmental & Energy Services[13] and AGRA Monenco Inc., a North American engineering and services company, both in 2000[14] as well as the U.S. operations and equipment of Lauren Kamtech in 2003.[15] Then in 2004, AMEC was awarded a contract to assist in the reconstruction effort in Iraq, as part of a joint venture with Fluor Corp.[16]
In 2005, AMEC acquired UK-based NNC, a large nuclear consulting company and its subsidiaries, including Ontario-based Nuclear Safety Solutions ('NSS'), the nuclear safety division of OPG, which was spun off when OPG was privatised.[17] The European engineering business, AMEC SPIE, was sold to PAI Partners for €1,040 million in 2006[18][19][20][21] and the European rail business joint venture Amec Spie Rail systems was sold for an estimated £200million in 2007, to Colas Group.[22][23][24]
In 2007, AMEC sold its UK construction arm to Morgan Sindall[25] and in 2008, it sold its internal plant hire division to Speedy Hire[26] before buying project services company Rider Hunt International,[27] North American environmental consulting firm Geomatrix Consultants, Inc., and Slovakian nuclear services company AllDeco.[28] In 2009, AMEC acquired Performance Improvement Group, Journeaux, Bedard & Associates and GRD Limited[29] and in 2010, it continued to expand with the £61.2 m purchase of Entec UK, one of the UK's largest Environmental Consultancies.[30] The company also acquired Australian-based businesses Currie and Brown (Australia)[31] and BurmanGriffiths and acquired a majority stake in S2V Consulting.[32]
In 2011, the company acquired US-based BCI Engineers & Scientists, Inc.,[33] MACTEC, a US-based engineering consultancy company,[34] and Zektin Group, an Australian-based specialist engineering consultancy for the oil and gas and resources industries.[35] In January 2014, AMEC provisionally agreed a £1.9bn takeover of Swiss rival Foster Wheeler.[36] AMEC completed its purchase of Foster Wheeler on 13 November 2014 and simultaneously changed its name to Amec Foster Wheeler plc.[37]
In March 2017, Wood Group announced it would acquire the company for £2.2 billion.[38]

History[edit]
AMEC was formed from the 1982 amalgamation of Leonard Fairclough & Son (founded 1883) and the William Press Group (founded 1913). In 1988, AMEC went on to acquire Matthew Hall Group.[6] In 1996, AMEC took a 40% stake in Spie Batignolles from Schneider in association with a management buyout.[7] Amec launched the AMEC SPIE brand for engineering services in Europe,[8] a rail construction business AMEC Spie Rail was created, and the remaining construction business was retained as Spie Batignolles.[9] The company announced that it would seek to sell the construction arm of the business Spie Batignolles, and entered negotiations to secure a management buyout of that division;[9][10] the management buyout of the construction arm of Spie was completed in September 2003 with the aid of Barclays Private Equity Finance[11] and later that year Amec took full control of the remaining parts of Spie.[12]
Acquisitions in the new millennium included Ogden Environmental & Energy Services[13] and AGRA Monenco Inc., a North American engineering and services company, both in 2000[14] as well as the U.S. operations and equipment of Lauren Kamtech in 2003.[15] Then in 2004, AMEC was awarded a contract to assist in the reconstruction effort in Iraq, as part of a joint venture with Fluor Corp.[16]
In 2005, AMEC acquired UK-based NNC, a large nuclear consulting company and its subsidiaries, including Ontario-based Nuclear Safety Solutions ('NSS'), the nuclear safety division of OPG, which was spun off when OPG was privatised.[17] The European engineering business, AMEC SPIE, was sold to PAI Partners for €1,040 million in 2006[18][19][20][21] and the European rail business joint venture Amec Spie Rail systems was sold for an estimated £200million in 2007, to Colas Group.[22][23][24]
In 2007, AMEC sold its UK construction arm to Morgan Sindall[25] and in 2008, it sold its internal plant hire division to Speedy Hire[26] before buying project services company Rider Hunt International,[27] North American environmental consulting firm Geomatrix Consultants, Inc., and Slovakian nuclear services company AllDeco.[28] In 2009, AMEC acquired Performance Improvement Group, Journeaux, Bedard & Associates and GRD Limited[29] and in 2010, it continued to expand with the £61.2 m purchase of Entec UK, one of the UK's largest Environmental Consultancies.[30] The company also acquired Australian-based businesses Currie and Brown (Australia)[31] and BurmanGriffiths and acquired a majority stake in S2V Consulting.[32]
In 2011, the company acquired US-based BCI Engineers & Scientists, Inc.,[33] MACTEC, a US-based engineering consultancy company,[34] and Zektin Group, an Australian-based specialist engineering consultancy for the oil and gas and resources industries.[35] In January 2014, AMEC provisionally agreed a £1.9bn takeover of Swiss rival Foster Wheeler.[36] AMEC completed its purchase of Foster Wheeler on 13 November 2014 and simultaneously changed its name to Amec Foster Wheeler plc.[37]
In March 2017, Wood Group announced it would acquire the company for £2.2 billion.[38]

History[edit]
AMEC was formed from the 1982 amalgamation of Leonard Fairclough & Son (founded 1883) and the William Press Group (founded 1913). In 1988, AMEC went on to acquire Matthew Hall Group.[6] In 1996, AMEC took a 40% stake in Spie Batignolles from Schneider in association with a management buyout.[7] Amec launched the AMEC SPIE brand for engineering services in Europe,[8] a rail construction business AMEC Spie Rail was created, and the remaining construction business was retained as Spie Batignolles.[9] The company announced that it would seek to sell the construction arm of the business Spie Batignolles, and entered negotiations to secure a management buyout of that division;[9][10] the management buyout of the construction arm of Spie was completed in September 2003 with the aid of Barclays Private Equity Finance[11] and later that year Amec took full control of the remaining parts of Spie.[12]
Acquisitions in the new millennium included Ogden Environmental & Energy Services[13] and AGRA Monenco Inc., a North American engineering and services company, both in 2000[14] as well as the U.S. operations and equipment of Lauren Kamtech in 2003.[15] Then in 2004, AMEC was awarded a contract to assist in the reconstruction effort in Iraq, as part of a joint venture with Fluor Corp.[16]
In 2005, AMEC acquired UK-based NNC, a large nuclear consulting company and its subsidiaries, including Ontario-based Nuclear Safety Solutions ('NSS'), the nuclear safety division of OPG, which was spun off when OPG was privatised.[17] The European engineering business, AMEC SPIE, was sold to PAI Partners for €1,040 million in 2006[18][19][20][21] and the European rail business joint venture Amec Spie Rail systems was sold for an estimated £200million in 2007, to Colas Group.[22][23][24]
In 2007, AMEC sold its UK construction arm to Morgan Sindall[25] and in 2008, it sold its internal plant hire division to Speedy Hire[26] before buying project services company Rider Hunt International,[27] North American environmental consulting firm Geomatrix Consultants, Inc., and Slovakian nuclear services company AllDeco.[28] In 2009, AMEC acquired Performance Improvement Group, Journeaux, Bedard & Associates and GRD Limited[29] and in 2010, it continued to expand with the £61.2 m purchase of Entec UK, one of the UK's largest Environmental Consultancies.[30] The company also acquired Australian-based businesses Currie and Brown (Australia)[31] and BurmanGriffiths and acquired a majority stake in S2V Consulting.[32]
In 2011, the company acquired US-based BCI Engineers & Scientists, Inc.,[33] MACTEC, a US-based engineering consultancy company,[34] and Zektin Group, an Australian-based specialist engineering consultancy for the oil and gas and resources industries.[35] In January 2014, AMEC provisionally agreed a £1.9bn takeover of Swiss rival Foster Wheeler.[36] AMEC completed its purchase of Foster Wheeler on 13 November 2014 and simultaneously changed its name to Amec Foster Wheeler plc.[37]
In March 2017, Wood Group announced it would acquire the company for £2.2 billion.[38]
