Fort Washington Raises $450 Million in Private Equity Funds
Capital raised exceeds target 
CINCINNATI – January 20, 2015   Fort Washington Capital Partners Group ("FW Capital"), the institutional private equity division of Fort Washington Investment Advisors, Inc., is pleased to announce the final closing of private equity funds in two investment strategies:  Fort Washington Private Equity Investors VIII, LP and its parallel vehicle (together, "Fund VIII") and Fort Washington Private Equity Opportunities Fund III, LP and its parallel vehicle (together, "Opportunities III").
Fund VIII, a private equity fund-of-funds, closed with $300 million of capital commitments in December 2014, significantly above the fund’s original target of $200 million. Opportunities III, a special situations private equity fund, closed at its target fund size and hard-cap of $150 million in capital commitments in May 2014. The $450 million in aggregate capital raised from investors is the largest ever for these FW Capital strategies.
"We are very pleased with the support from our existing investors, new investors, and their consultants," said Steve Baker, managing director and deputy head of private equity. "Raising capital in two strategies in just under 17 months is a testament to our team’s track record, capabilities, and relationships with our investment partners. This is really an exceptional step for our private equity business. We set out to raise $350 million and were oversubscribed due to significant investor interest in our two strategies."
Fund VIII launched with a target of $200 million in capital commitments. However, because of outstanding support from institutional investors and consultants, FW Capital increased its target to $300 million.  Fund VIII was formed to make primary investments in a diversified portfolio of private equity funds that FW Capital believes exhibit an attractive investment strategy.  Fund VIII represents a continuation of FW Capital’s primary investment strategy of targeting smaller, leading fund managers.
Opportunities III launched with a target fund size and hard-cap of $150 million in capital commitments, which was achieved when it held a final closing in May 2014. FW Capital formed Opportunities III to continue its demonstrated strategy of investing in special situations with unique and/or complicated structuring requirements, and acquiring limited partnership interests in private equity funds on the secondary market.

Investment Strategies




Since inception, Siguler Guff has managed over $15 billion of investor commitments, of which over $3 billion have been in separate accounts and other advisory activities.
 








Distressed, Special Situations and Specialty Finance










Distressed Opportunities Funds




Investor Commitments: $5.3 billion 



Siguler Guff’s Distressed Opportunities Funds are diversified portfolios that invest in the securities and other interests of companies, structures or assets undergoing financial distress, operating difficulties or restructuring. The portfolios use an active management, broad-based approach and include corporate debt and equity, structured credit, real estate, other special situations and niche opportunities, as well as secondary investments. The Firm takes a dynamic approach, looking across geographies, asset classes and strategies to tactically allocate capital to investments appropriate to the market opportunity and cycle. Siguler Guff actively reevaluates market conditions to target market inefficiencies and dislocations in value which are inherently limited in time. The strategy is implemented through a variety of fund structures, separate accounts, joint ventures, secondary transactions, and direct investments / co-investments.
 













Trade Finance Opportunities Fund




Investor Commitments: $263 million 



Through the Distressed Opportunities Funds, Siguler Guff identified a unique opportunity to take advantage of the disconnect between mandatory new capital charges for trade finance assets and low expected losses. Siguler Guff’s Trade Finance Opportunities Fund seeks to structure and enter into separate accounts or joint ventures with operating partners to negotiate investments primarily in trade finance regulatory capital relief transactions and to own, hold, sell or otherwise dispose of such investments.
 













Secondary Opportunities Fund




Investor Commitments: $337 million 



Siguler Guff has been investing in the secondary market since 2010 through its distressed investment platform. The Firm focuses on special situations/credit-focused secondary market opportunities including purchasing interests in funds managed by traditional distressed managers and out-of-favor managers/fallen angels, side pocket liquidations, and value and yield-oriented strategies.
 





 

 



Real Estate








Investor Commitments: $1.8 billion 



Siguler Guff’s Distressed Real Estate Opportunities Funds are diversified portfolios that invest in various types of real property interests, including equity interests in commercial property, commercial mortgages and commercial mortgage-backed securities, and the debt and equity securities of real estate operating companies and real estate investment trusts. The portfolios target high quality properties, primarily in the U.S. and Europe, which have deteriorated in value due to high levels of vacancy and deferred maintenance issues resulting from overleveraged capital structures. Siguler Guff employs a value-oriented, cycle-aware and structure-agnostic strategy to target the evolving opportunity in the current cycle. The Firm seeks to create a program with access to a broad universe of value opportunities at lower fees and with better governance than the traditional opportunity fund or fund-of-fund models, through greater control and alignment of managers.
Siguler Guff’s real estate experience dates back to 1993 when the Firm, in partnership with a leading small business lender, formed Business Mortgage Investors, Inc. in the wake of the Savings and Loan Crisis to purchase performing small business mortgages from the Resolution Trust Company and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

 



 

 



Small Business








Investor Commitments: $1.7 billion 



Siguler Guff’s Small Buyout Opportunities Funds are diversified portfolios that invest in small buyout funds (funds capitalized with less than $250 million) and small-lower middle market companies (companies with $3-$15 million of EBITDA) which are difficult for many investors to access. The program targets specialized, small, yet well-established, companies that are typically family-owned, founder-owned and/or owner-operated. Siguler Guff believes that the small and lower middle market offers inefficiencies and a variety of appealing characteristics, including substantial deal flow, less competitive transactions, lower purchase multiples, low leverage and significant value creation potential. To effectively and efficiently target this segment of the market, Siguler Guff works with small buyout fund managers as both a limited partner and a co-investment partner. The Firm seeks to partner with managers who have reliably demonstrated the ability to acquire high-quality companies at purchase price and leverage multiples below prevailing market multiples, stemming from their ability to source robust deal flow and exert a disciplined investment style.

 



 

 



Emerging Markets










BRIC Opportunities Funds and Emerging Markets Separate Accounts




Investor Commitments: $2.6 billion 



Siguler Guff’s BRIC Opportunities Funds are diversified portfolios that selectively invest in the rapidly growing economies of Brazil, Russia, India and China, and other emerging markets with attractive private equity characteristics. The Firm targets small and medium-sized businesses that benefit from the expanding middle class, growth of local industries and growth in per capita GDP of these emerging economies. Siguler Guff partners with local teams who are capable of sourcing attractively priced, high-growth companies in non-competitive processes and who focus on fast growing Tier II and Tier III cities and regions.
 













Russia Partners Funds




Investor Commitments:  $1.3 billion 



Operating since 1991, Russia Partners is a leading private equity investor in Russia and the countries of the former Soviet Union. Russia Partners has managed six private equity funds and more than 65 investments. The core investment strategy of Russia Partners is to make direct equity and equity-related investments in fast-growing medium-sized companies operating in industries that meet the developing demands of the region’s rapidly growing and maturing middle class. Russia Partners’ founding partners have worked together for over 20 years, investing in the region through numerous economic cycles, including the economic crises of 1998 and 2008.
 













RP Tech




Investor Commitments: $93 million 



RP Tech was established in 2011 to make direct equity and equity-related investments in high-growth businesses in areas related to technology and innovation in Russia and the countries of the former Soviet Union, as well as in companies that are implementing global technologies and processes throughout this region. Notable investments made by RP Tech include GlobalLogic, a full-lifecycle product development services leader, Viagogo, a leading European online ticket marketplace, Mirantis, a leading pure-play OpenStack software company, and RetailNext, the worldwide market leader for in-store retail analytics.

Separate Accounts








Investor Commitments: $2.8 billion 



Siguler Guff recognizes the need for certain clients to maintain a unique degree of focus and diversification within their private equity portfolios, and consequently works with select clients to provide customized solutions through separate accounts. The Firm currently manages separate accounts with aggregate investor commitments of approximately $2.8 billion on behalf of clients such as public and corporate pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, unions, endowments, foundations and superannuation funds.
Siguler Guff began managing its first separate account in 1993 and has prudently increased the number of separate accounts that it manages over time. These portfolios include a range of investment strategies such as buyouts, growth capital, distressed and special situations, venture capital, mezzanine, real estate, and secondary investments that invest globally across North America, Europe, and the emerging markets. Siguler Guff’s separate account mandates typically include direct investments / co-investments as well as underlying fund investments and leverage resources across the Firm to manage customized portfolios for investors.
As an advisor, Siguler Guff evaluates the global private equity market, assesses the best investment opportunities in the market at any given point in time and provides specific advice on sectors of particular interest to its clients. Siguler Guff provides extensive due diligence and a comprehensive evaluation of fund managers and direct investments / co-investments in these sectors. The Firm manages all transactions (investor capital calls and distributions) and provides consolidated, customized client reports and portfolio analysis. Siguler Guff also advocates on behalf of its clients through advisory board participation and active management of underlying investments.
 



 

 



Advisory Activities and Other Strategies










Venture Lending & Leasing




Investor Commitments: $374 million 



Venture Lending & Leasing was formed as a joint venture between Siguler Guff Advisers and Western Technology Investments in 1994. Siguler Guff served as a co-adviser to the first three Venture Lending & Leasing funds. Starting with Venture Lending & Leasing IV, Siguler Guff's role transitioned to that of a special limited partner.
The Venture Lending & Leasing funds were organized to provide asset-backed financing to carefully selected venture capital-backed companies in the form of secured loans and equipment leases and in exchange for current coupon payments and equity warrants. Loans to each company range from $1 million to $25 million, with warrant coverage of 7% to 12% of the loan amount. Venture Lending & Leasing provides an alternative, carefully structured layer of financing that complements venture capital equity. 
 













Siguler Guff Capital Partners




Investor Commitments: $265 million 



Established in 1999, Siguler Guff Capital Partners is a unique program in which Siguler Guff co-invests with investors in top-quality, best of breed private equity funds, both domestically and internationally, across a range of opportunities including buyouts, venture capital, distressed, mezzanine financing, and special situations/turnarounds. The Firm identifies, evaluates, and accesses these unique private equity opportunities and allows each investor in the Siguler Guff Capital Partners program to decide on a case-by-case basis whether to participate. In most cases, access to these top-tier private equity firms and investment minimums would otherwise be prohibitive to smaller investors.
 













WMAM Funds




Investor Commitments: $529 million 



In April 2009, Siguler Guff became the investment adviser to the WMAM funds, a portfolio of four multi-manager funds and one direct investment fund that were part of a joint venture between BNY Mellon and WestLB.

About Us
Over the past few months, we have been secretly working to do something that's never been done before... compile
        a detailed list of active private lenders in every city.
When someone visits our real estate investing website, we've been asking them if they want to lend private money.
        And if they say Yes, we get all sorts of valuable information about their loan terms, property requirements, and
        more.
At first, we were disappointed because most people were saying that they are NOT interested in lending private
        money. They just want to wholesale, rehab, landlord, etc.
But then we realized something. Enough people ARE saying "Yes, I'm a lender!" And enough people ARE giving us
        their contact information... that we've found ourselves sitting on a "Goldmine of Private Lenders!"
This goldmine is a list of private lenders that gives you the power to do more deals than you ever thought
        possible. The list contains some VERY important information. Information that you have NEVER seen anyone else
        compile. In addition to each lender's name, it has:

Their phone number
Their email address
The interest rate they plan to charge
The amount they have to lend

Not only is the information we collected special, but so are the people. Why? Because most have not been spoiled
        yet! You see, when potential lenders go to real estate meetings, they eventually learn that they can lend at up
        to 18%.
Most of the lenders in this list haven't been going to those meetings, so they're still willing to lend at MUCH
        lower rates. Many are lending at 6-12%!
These lenders are also special because they raised their hand and said, "Contact me!" So not only do they want
        your call or email, they EXPECT it. In other words, you can breathe easy because when you reach out to them, you
        are NOT making a cold call.
Borrowing from private lenders, especially at such low rates can do incredible things for your investing
        business, so enter your zip code here and access these lenders today!

		New York —
	


 Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) announced today that Morgan Stanley Alternative Investment Partners (Morgan Stanley AIP) raised $1 billion in commitments for Morgan Stanley Private Markets Fund III ("Private Markets Fund III"). "We've had strong demand for this offering from clients worldwide," said Cory Pulfrey, Head of Morgan Stanley AIP. "The majority of our largest existing investors in our prior private markets fund have committed to Private Markets Fund III and we've also added a number of new limited partners, including insurance companies, endowments, foundations, pension plans, family offices and other high net worth investors. We believe that our successful fund-raising effort demonstrates a vote of confidence in both our highly opportunistic investment approach and our talented team of investors."  The objective of Private Markets Fund III is to provide investors with superior risk-adjusted returns through global investments in primary funds, co-investments and direct secondaries. Morgan Stanley AIP Global Diversified Fund LP ("Private Markets Fund II"), which Morgan Stanley AIP launched in April 2004, shared the same objective and raised $500 million in commitments.  Private Markets Fund III incorporates three main strategies: Buyouts, primarily North American and Western European, Global Venture Capital and Special Situations. Morgan Stanley AIP's investment strategy emphasizes less efficient market segments and targets managers with unique skill sets in the U.S., Western Europe and emerging private-equity markets like Japan. Morgan Stanley AIP currently expects that Private Markets Fund III, in addition to investing in private equity funds, will invest approximately one third of its committed capital in a combination of secondary interests and direct co-investments made alongside high quality financial sponsors.  "We proactively seek out investment opportunities that are unique and that other managers may not be as likely to consider," said Tom Dorr, Chief Investment Officer, Private Markets Team. "We continue to believe that attractive risk-adjusted returns can be achieved by having a global focus, a diversified portfolio and also by considering a wide range of investment opportunities broadly within private equity."  "The success of Private Markets Fund III clearly demonstrates investors' high demand for expertise in the alternatives space," said Stuart Bohart, Head of Alternative Investments at Morgan Stanley Investment Management. "Building our alternatives business is a key priority for the Firm and providing our clients market leading, innovative product offerings like this is critical to our strategy."  Morgan Stanley Morgan Stanley is a global financial services firm and a market leader in securities, asset management and credit services. With more than 600 offices in 30 countries, Morgan Stanley connects people, ideas and capital to help clients achieve their financial aspirations.  Morgan Stanley Investment Management The firm's investment management division, with over 400 investment professionals around the world, manages assets in excess of $442 billion and offers asset management services to a diverse client base which includes: governments, institutions, corporations, and individuals.
