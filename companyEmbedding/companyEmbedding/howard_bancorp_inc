Howard Bancorp, Inc. Completes Acquisition Of Patapsco Bancorp, Inc.






Business Wire




Aug 31, 2015 8:00 AM EDT













 




























































  Howard Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ: HBMD, "Howard"), the parent company of Howard Bank, announced today that it has completed its acquisition of Patapsco Bancorp, Inc., the parent company of Patapsco Bank ("Patapsco").  The combination of Howard and Patapsco creates the largest publicly traded bank headquartered in the Greater Baltimore Marketplace and the seventh largest bank in the state of Maryland, with total assets of nearly $1 billion and 16 branches. In addition, the combination significantly reinforces Howard's present franchise in Baltimore County and provides Howard entry to Baltimore City allowing Howard the opportunity to expand its reach of diversified financial solutions in these very desirable markets and to leverage Patapsco's legacy of over 100 years of banking service in these communities.  Pursuant to the merger agreement, the transaction had an aggregate fixed value of $10.064 million. Patapsco shareholders received $5.09 per share in cash (20% of total consideration) or 0.3547 shares of Howard common stock for each share of Patapsco common stock (80% of total consideration).  "Howard, a 2004 de novo, has experienced significant growth over the past 11 years, through consistent execution on organic growth - one customer at a time- supplemented by the execution of team lift outs in the residential mortgage arena, branch acquisitions, purchase of assets in an FDIC resolution transaction and now a traditional whole bank merger. The combination of Howard and Patapsco is, however, in and of itself, transformational and of exceptional strategic importance to us," said Mary Ann Scully, Howard's Chairman and CEO. "Howard has nearly tripled its asset size since its capital raise in 2012 and is now achieving the size and scale that is so important in the highly regulated and highly competitive banking industry today. It also demonstrates our disciplined ability to deploy capital quickly and in a way that supports growth both organically and by acquisition."

Howard Bancorp, Inc. Added To The Russell 2000 Stock Index






Business Wire




Jun 26, 2017 2:00 PM EDT













 


















































  Howard Bancorp, Inc. (Nasdaq: HBMD), the parent company of Howard Bank, a locally owned community bank serving businesses, professionals and individuals in the Greater Baltimore area, announced today that it has been named to the Russell 2000 stock index.  The listing on the closely watched Russell 2000, which measures the performance of 2,000 small-cap companies in the United States, recognizes the growth in Howard Bancorp's market capitalization - total shares outstanding multiplied by its current stock price - which climbed to nearly $185 million on May 31, 2017, up 75% percent since the beginning of the year, and its stock price has risen 25 percent over the same period.  "The listing on the Russell 2000 index reflects the increased value of the market capital levels we have attained in support of our consistently executed regional growth strategy to be the go-to commercial bank in greater Baltimore," said Mary Ann Scully, President and CEO of Howard Bancorp. "But even more important than what it reflects about our history, and positive market reception is the value it provides to shareholders of our currency. Additional visibility, access, and liquidity often accompany inclusion in the Russell 2000."  The rebalanced Russell Global, Russell 1000, Russell 2000, Russell 3000, Russell Midcap, and Russell Microcap Indexes began trading on June 26, 2017.  Annual Russell indexes reconstitution captures the 4,000 largest U.S. stocks as of the end of May, ranking them by total market capitalization. Membership in the Russell 3000®, which remains in place for one year, means automatic inclusion in the large-cap Russell 1000® Index or small-cap Russell 2000® Index as well as the appropriate growth and value style indexes. FTSE Russell determines membership for these indexes primarily by objective, market-capitalization rankings, and style attributes.  Russell indexes are widely used by investment managers and institutional investors for index funds and as benchmarks for active investment strategies. Approximately $8.4 trillion in assets are benchmarked to the Russell U.S. indexes. Russell indexes are part of FTSE Russell, a leading global index provider.
