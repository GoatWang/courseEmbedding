Priority Access to Care while reducing health care costs.




WHAT WE KNOW
Consumers are willing to pay out of pocket for access to health care services

                Studies confirm that consumers already seek out health information through technology platforms.   Pew Internet health fact  (2015) reports that 72% of internet users say they looked online for health information within the past year, 31% of cell phone owners and 52% of smartphone owners used their phone to find health or medical information.  Furthermore, physician on-call , online companies like AMWELL, TELADOC, and DoctorOnDemand have led the way to technology adoption for quick and easy access to health care specialties by ambiguous devices through video on demand technologies.  A recent Harris poll conducted with American Well revealed that 64% of consumers are willing to see doctors through video technology.  Potential health care sector growth in telehealth will continue to climb exponentially with more and more payers, including the Centers of Medicaid and Medicare, offering and paying for health care services delivered virtually.  Go 2 Care is the rehab version of “docs on call” business delivery model.   We believe that consumers will be attracted to having access to physical and occupational therapists without the hassles and delay of services all too common from the traditional store front entry point.
                

Private and government insurers are increasing access and coverage to virtual care

                The Affordable Care Act requires and supports the use of ICTs (information and communication technologies) thus many aspects of health informatics such as EMRs, meaningful use, innovative service and payment methodology pilots and programs are already in place and pushing health care changes.  Incentives exist for purposes of decreasing costs and re-hospitalizations and to drive innovative solutions.  Thus, the market of telemedicine has gained traction several years ago and is spiraling to consumer and provider adoption as payers, employers and agencies see the benefit.   And now that same interest and energy has trickled into the rehabilitation industry.  
                

Telerehabilitation is  proven effective and ranked high in patient satisfaction

                Research has demonstrated the capacity of technology to improve access to health care services and facilitate care within local communities, enhance efficiency, increase effectiveness of chronic disease management, and promote individual adoption of healthy lifestyles and decrease costs both for consumers and providers.   The convergence of wireless technology, health care services, and mobile devices can lead to a more effective medical and rehabilitative delivery system with a better continuum of care and wellness.
                

TRANSFORMATIVE SOLUTION. SIMPLE.  INTUITIVE.
Urgent need for innovation in the rehab industry from operations to care delivery
GO 2 CARE utilizes a cutting-edge proprietary, predictive analytics triaging tool iRAP® to establish the right kind of care by the right kind of rehab specialist within seconds.  iRAP® determines  which health conditions are appropriate for self-service education, remote treatment, or referral to an on-site provider/standard medical system. The integration of process intelligence and intuitive, value based rehabilitative clinical solution sets drives highly improved cost-efficient care management environment saving time and money.
                

GO 2 CARE Service provides virtual access to advanced trained physical therapists, occupational therapists, and other rehabilitation health and wellness specialists through the use of everyday technology.  A face-to-face relationship with a provider who is there when you need them.  Prevention and recovery for common injuries and conditions treated in minutes, not hours. 
                

GO 2 CARE TeleRehab Provider Network (TRPN) brings together credentialed onsite facilities and online virtual care to meet regulatory compliance and on-demand hybrid telerehab business modeling and services lines.  Clients and health care businesses have choices for quality services and continuum of care through our advanced option plans. 
                

GO 2 CARE has made available to all rehab providers a 3 hour online course on  “Implementing Telehealth Services for Rehab Professionals” authored by CEO and Founder, Tammy Richmond MS, OTR/L, FAOTA.  Learn what, where, how and how to provide telehealth services with this introductory course on the administrative, clinical and technical guidelines to implementing telehealth services for PT/OT/SLPs.

What technology do I need to start?
