The clinical trial ecosystem is experiencing a period of revolutionary change due to cost consolidation, technology innovation, increased globalization, and evolving regulation. OmniComm Professional Services consultants can help you sort out the decision / priority tree and build a roadmap for:

Technology Innovation – Disruptive technologies such as mobile computing, cloud computing, EHR/EMR integration, and device integration have the ability to optimize processes, and improve data transparency. OmniComm Professional Services can help you prioritize these initiatives and develop a value proposition for each.
Regulatory Adoption – Evolving regulatory guidelines endorsing risk-based monitoring, central monitoring, and eSource can transform the way trials have been conducted for the past three decades. Let OmniComm Professional Services help you to choose the tools and define the processes to adopt of these new regulatory practices.
Operational Transformation - The roadmap to end-to-end operational transformation requires recognition of operational change opportunities, the implementation of new technology innovations, an investment in process design, SOPs, planning, training and business deployment.  OmniComm Professional Services will help you define your strategic advantage.

Clinical Business Process Optimization

Our OmniAdvance Methodology includes an approach for implementing process improvement and business optimization.   We will conduct an “as-is/to-be” gap analysis, and facilitate workshops that will lead to improved processes, new SOPs, increased automation, change management, training, and a clearer vision to help set your organization apart.

e-Clinical Metrics 
Given the industry-wide initiatives related to operational improvement and Risk-Based Monitoring (RBM), the need to collect metrics on clinical operations, along with data quality critical.
OmniComm can work with you team to define:

Quality Metrics – measurements that define the quality of the data entered and cleaned within a system
Key Performance Indicators – measurements of organizational or operational success / achievement.

e-Clinical Standards
OmniComm Professional Services has strong experience helping customers define and deploy Clinical Data Standards.

CDASH – OmniComm was the first to implement a library of CDISC-CDASH eCRF forms in October 2008.
SDTM – OmniComm was the first to deploy an SDTM mapping utility that maps EDC forms into CDISC-SDTM compliant datasets, enabling clients to generate and download current SDTM datasets on demand immediately following initial SDTM implementation.
Company Standards – OmniComm has worked with companies to develop corporate clinical data standards based on industry standards and therapeutic-area specific requirements or best practices.
E2B – Using our SafetyLink™ solution, OmniComm can transfer serious adverse event data between our EDC technology and your company’s global Pharmacovigilance solution, leveraging the ICH E2B standard.
MedDRA and WHODRUG – Using our proprietary Autoencoder technology, OmniComm can deliver solutions to code against MedDRA, WHODRUG, and other standard industry vocabularies.

            Integration and Migration

Our tool sets allow for both tightly coupled and loosely coupled interoperability – and our Transformation Services teams can help you design and develop the most scalable and cost-effective integration solution, to ensure that data flows seamlessly throughout your eClinical ecosystem.
Data Migration
The roadmap for migrating from one application to another does not have to be so overwhelming, if you bring knowledge, experience, and methodology to the project. OmniComm will employ our OmniAdvance™ implementation methodology, and follow a set of basic steps to ensure that your migration goes smoothly.
Our migration program is designed to lower costs, mitigate risk, ensure quality, maintain existing processes, and leverage your current investment.
Custom Reporting
While our robust eClinical software solutions offer numerous “canned” or “out-of-the-box” reports and capabilities, many customers require data representation that are customized to their specific trial, indication, or business process.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

TrialMaster has open application programming interfaces (APIs) that allow other clinical trial applications to send and receive data over the Internet. TrialMaster has an integrated electronic learning system, a set of standard reports and integrated ad-hoc reporting using business intelligence tool, LogiXML.

TrialMaster Archive allows the Company to provide human and machine-readable copies of the data when a clinical study has been completed. The human-readable format consists of portable document format (PDF) files that represent the data exactly as it was displayed on the interactive Webpages. These are delivered to the client through compact disc (CD) in a read-only format. The TrialMaster Archive also includes an optional Submission Module, which creates a casebook containing PDF formatted copies of all case report forms (CRFs).TrialOne is a Web-based application, which provides real-time access to all study information, in particular trial sponsors and investigators are provided with information that allows for decision making.
