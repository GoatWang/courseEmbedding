AbstractThe residential mortgage activity of financial institutions in metropolitan Boston was analyzed to identify and assess patterns of disinvestment. Data were obtained from most state-chartered institutions and larger national banks on the geographic breakdown of their mortgage portfolios, recent mortgage activities, and deposits. Additional information on home sales, population and housing characteristics, and homeowner interviews were used. The measures of disinvestment were (1) mortgage-to-deposit ratios, (2) number of bank mortgage applications compared to home sales, and (3) bank-financed home sales to total home sales. Results indicate that (1) the mortgage dollars invested relative to the savings dollars deposited by residents were disproportionately low in most urban neighborhoods; (2) the proportion of bank-financed home sales was substantially higher in suburban than in urban areas; and (3) bank home mortgage lending is disproportionately lower in minority and racially changing neighborhoods. These analytical techniques and results are compared with those of major redlining studies in other metropolitan areas.

Principal, Taggart Associates

For media inquiries, please contact Media RelationsIn Their Own Words


Harriet "Tee" Taggart manages a professional practice, Taggart Associates. She serves as a director on two NYSE corporate boards, Albemarle (ALB) and Lubrizol (LZ), and as a trustee, executive committee member, and endowment investment advisor for several major nonprofit organizations. Taggart is a trustee of Reed College, where she is a member of the Executive and Endowment Management committees. She is also an Investment Committee member at the Phi Beta Kappa Society Foundation and a member of the Dean's Alumni Leadership Council at Harvard's Kennedy School. She has taught graduate-level courses in finance at several universities in the Boston area. Her professional affiliations include the Boston Society of Security Analysts, where she currently serves on the board of directors; the National Association of Corporate Directors (NACD); and the NACD's New England Chapter.  
For 24 years, Taggart was a partner and senior vice president at Wellington Management, a global investment company for pension fund, endowment, and mutual fund clients. From 1992 through 2006, she had firm-wide responsibility for global investments in publicly traded stocks of companies in specialty and basic chemicals, environmental services, and innovative materials industries with active portfolio management responsibility for equity investments in these sectors. From 1983 to 1992, she pioneered the development of a credit research department with portfolio management, client service, and marketing responsibilities for rapidly growing high yield bond portfolios. For six consecutive years (2000-2006), she was annually recognized as one of "The Best of the Buy-side" by Institutional Investor. Prior to joining Wellington, for over a decade Taggart held a number of management positions in the public sector where she worked in legislative, regulatory, state, and regional levels of government.
Taggart holds a Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (M.I.T.) and a master's degree from the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. She graduated magna cum laude from Smith College.
Taggart and her husband, Jack Turner, live in Cambridge. They have two grown children and a grandson.
