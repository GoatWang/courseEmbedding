Experiences That Sell
Great commerce experiences increase conversion and lifetime value.






 



From engaging and relevant storefronts to subscriptions and kits that drive conversion and lifetime value, with Symphony, you’ll turn your visitors into customers and your customers into brand evangelists.
 
 
 
 



Deliver high-impact storefronts, branded your way
Symphony enables you to create storefronts that capture the full impact of your brand and are optimized to pull visitors in to discover and purchase your products with ease and speed.  Fully-responsive design ensures pixel-perfect display on any device from mobile to desktop.
 
 


 
 
 
 




With real-time personalization, you can automatically deliver the appropriate offer for a first-time visitor vs. a returning customer.
 
 

Create premium commerce experiences with
Adobe Experience Cloud
For brands that are ready to engage one-to-one to win and retain customers, Symphony and Adobe provide a joint offering that enables the creation of fully-personalized commerce experiences based on user behavior, preferences and past purchases.   The solution brings together targeted promotional content and personalized storefronts, allowing users to shop right from an ad or landing page with their order immediately processed by Symphony.

Target by new vs. returning customers, shopper demographics, past products purchased or customer lifetime value.
Dynamically design, create and manage pages based on user profiles that swap out calls to action, offers, and personalized product recommendations.
Easily add and style Symphony’s drop-in commerce components, including subscriptions, kits, one-page checkout, and real-time order status.

 
 
 
 



Boost conversion with optimized checkout
We’ve tirelessly refined our checkout page to tackle the top issues that cause shoppers to abandon their carts.  Our result is an extremely smooth and frictionless one-page checkout process that converts shoppers at higher rates than our brands have experienced before.

Dynamically calculates and displays taxes and shipping charges.
Address autofill and instant error checking cuts checkout times in half.
Payment as final step increases confidence and purchase rates.
Natively supports Apple Pay.
Customer accounts are automatically created on submission.
The checkout page renders perfectly on all devices.

2x
increase in conversion rates
seen by brands switching to Symphony.
 
 


 
 
 
 



Maximize order and customer lifetime value
Symphony simplifies launching subscriptions and product kits (bundles) so you can create new offerings without long planning cycles or changes to your inventory or warehouse.  Simply create a new catalog entry for your subscription or kit and it’s ready to go.  Symphony automatically handles the details to ensure orders flow seamlessly from cart and payments through fulfillment.  No other commerce platform can do that without integration and customization.
 
 
 


 
 



 
 

Subscriptions
Use subscriptions to drive recurring sales to increase retention and overall customer lifetime value as well as reduce customer acquisition costs.  Some of our CPG brands have grown subscription sales to +80% of their overall business.

Customers have direct visibility and control over their subscriptions – to update payment type, postpone a shipment, change renewal frequency, cancel, etc.
Because the system is always connected, Symphony can automatically confirm product availability before charging the customer for their shipment.

Brands that offer subscriptions see 3-4X increase in CLV.
 
 
 


 
 


Kits
Virtually bundle products into multi-item kits, offering new promotions and merchandising opportunities that increase average order value and customer experimentation with more of your product line:

Offer a discount on the kit to incent purchase without having to do a markdown on the individual items.
No need to set new SKUs or pre-pack, Kits are pick-and-packed at the time of order.
Set kits to be purchased on a subscription basis for even higher revenue and customer value.

Brands that offer kits see 2X increase in CLV.

Welcome Ken Fine
2nd February 2017
The world is a better place when we do what we love, which is why we designed Symphony’s commerce infrastructure as a service to allow our customers to do what they love – making products, merchandising and marketing.  We wouldn’t be where we are today without the trust and support of our customers.
In order to focus on product and continue doing what I love at Symphony, I am thrilled to introduce Ken Fine as our new CEO.  I am incredibly proud of our progress to date, as it is a testament to the hard work and passion of the Symphony-ites I have the fortune of working with everyday.  I know Ken will be an incredible asset and addition to the team.
Since inception, we have executed over 15 million end-to end commerce transactions. Leading global brands now run mission critical business on Symphony’s platform. This Cyber Monday our platforms gracefully handled transaction loads annualized at over $1 billion.
This rapid growth has affirmed our conviction in the opportunity to democratize commerce – the ability to offer an Amazon-like infrastructure to any brand in the world.  It has also highlighted the need for strong leadership for organizational scaling and alignment.
Since founding Symphony, Henry and I always thought that to build a meaningful company we’d have to bring in leaders who have the skills and the passion to take organizations through massive growth phases.  I realized the time had come for us to add a leader who is adept at this phase of company growth.  This will free me up to leverage my skills in areas where I can have the most impact. With this clarity, I selectively started to source candidates that could fill this need and help lead Symphony in with its next phase of growth.
After a thoughtful search, with support from the board, I met Ken Fine. In Ken, I found a leader who loves building and aligning the high-performing teams needed to support rapid go-to-market and company scaling.
He is also very good at it.  He has done it twice – first leading the reinvention of Financial Engines, a $2.3 billion public company as the Executive Vice President of Marketing and Product.  And most recently as the Chief Customer Officer and Vice President of Product at Medallia, one of the fastest growing SaaS companies, where Ken helped scale the company and business across key go-to-market organization.
With Ken onboard I will do what I love – continue to lead the product and technology vision for the company while maintaining a seat on the board.
I could not be more excited to work with Ken.  Together with Ken and the rest of the Symphony team, I am confident we will continue to democratize commerce.  And we will make the world a better place in our own little way by doing what we love.

Symphony eCommerce Platform | Symphony Commerce | Symphony Commerce

Platform Overview
Delivering the best commerce experience to your customers.






 



Symphony provides you with a single, complete commerce system that’s delivered as a service to free you up to focus on your core business of marketing and selling great products.  That’s Commerce as a Service.
 
 
 
 



Commerce as a Service
 
 
 



One complete commerce system
Symphony Commerce is natively-built from the ground up as a single system for orchestrating the entire flow of commerce, from store through orders, inventory, and fulfillment. All critical commerce functionality is included and designed to work together in real-time so everything is always in sync and orders flow seamlessly, exactly as they should.
Delivered as a service
We work as your extended ecommerce team, managing everything from system maintenance to implementation, operations, and guidance supporting your ecommerce growth strategies.  Our depth of knowledge has been built over years of working with brands, developing best practices and insights that drive success, so you can rest assured your system is in great hands.

 
 


 
 
 


Enabling technologies included
Symphony Commerce includes the full range of enabling technologies needed, such as sales tax management, fraud prevention, payments, transactional email, maps, search, and more. We’ve incorporated and manage it all as one, always-connected, unified system to ensure it’s always on and always working.
 
 

Always on and ready to scale
Our cloud-hosted platform is based on a world-class infrastructure that’s ready for your business. Designed for continuous uptime, performance, and scalability – even in highest traffic times like Black Friday or Cyber Monday.   With an average uptime of 99.99%, our peak GMV throughput is clocked at $1B/year, without a hiccup.
 
 

Rapid deployment
Because the Symphony Commerce platform is built-out and ready to go, there’s no time spent integrating routine ecommerce functionality. We work with you to understand your products, business process and growth objectives, configure the platform to support your goals, and prepare you for a successful launch.
 
 
 
 




 
 

Full-range commerce
We built Symphony Commerce with a focus on optimizing the processes from shopping through fulfillment, because we know that storefronts are just the first step and that at least half of the commerce process happens after the order is placed.
Most ecommerce platforms are focused on shopping capabilities, with add-ons and plug-ins to stitch together additional functionality.  Only Symphony natively orchestrates the full range of commerce all the way through fulfillment, because we know that last leg is a crucial part of your customer’s brand journey.
Rapid, cost-effective delivery drives consumer purchases these days. So our certified multi-warehouse fulfillment network is built to ensure you can compete and win their loyalty.
 
 
 
 



Our natively-built system drives smarter commerce
As a natively-built commerce platform, Symphony is designed so the store, orders/inventory, and fulfillment modules work together continuously to ensure that orders are moving through the system and out to customers.  The visibility and control provided by this system design are what enable Symphony to deliver a superior commerce experience for your customers and simplified operations for brand ecommerce teams.
Our returns process is a great example.  When an item is returned and checked back in at the warehouse, Symphony automatically triggers real-time updates to inventory levels and store availability, and then refunds payment – with an accurate price/tax allocation.   The customer experience is smooth and operations are simplified, with no manual intervention required.  That’s the power of a natively-built commerce system that other ecommerce platforms just can’t touch.
 
 
 
 




 
 

Manage multiple channels in one view
Symphony uniquely enables brands to manage multiple ecommerce channels on a single platform that’s based on a common product catalog, inventory, and fulfillment network, which dramatically streamlines your operations.  Easily set up direct-to-consumer, boutique wholesale, or marketplace channels and specify the appropriate products and pricing for each and you’re ready to go.

Get a unified view into your orders and inventory for each channel to ensure you stay on top of planning and servicing each channel.
Virtually allocate inventory to each channel to ensure you meet SLAs and projected demand – without having to make changes at the warehouse.
Easily adjust as needed when demand changes.
Analyze sales performance and trends across each channel to understand the dynamics of each – do shoppers browse on brand.com and buy on the marketplace?  With Symphony, you’ll know.

 
 
 
 



Build deep knowledge of your customers and business
Symphony gives you access to the vital business analytics you need to develop a deeper connection with your customers, your channels and your business overall so you can make smarter, data-driven decisions to drive growth.

Develop customer profiles based on shopping habits, product preferences, and customer lifetime value for better targeting.
Master the dynamics of each of your channels to understand profitability and cannibalization to find growth opportunities.
Understand your top selling products and categories to identify areas for cross-sell and up-sell.
Deep-dive into fulfillment to assess shipping profitability and returns.
Build a complete margin analysis of your commerce value chain, from order to cash.

 
 


 
 
 
 



Your Team of Experts
Symphony’s seasoned and dedicated ecommerce pros provide fulfillment, technical, operational and business growth expertise to put the service in Commerce as a Service for our customers. Our ‘brand-first’ approach focuses on understanding your brand ethos, business processes, and growth objectives so we can craft a strategy for implementing Symphony in a way that meets your precise brand and ecommerce goals.
 
 
 
 



Driving growth
We support your growth at a strategic level so you can get the most out of Symphony. Our team helps you tackle key issues whether it’s measuring the impact of 2-day shipping, analyzing data to help drive your merchandising mix, or anything in-between.

Driving excellence
Our team provides ecommerce best practices that range from methods for preventing stock outs to supporting ERP integrations.  We’ve built expertise over years of working with a broad base of brands and are ready to put our insights to work for you.

 
 


Your named Brand Strategy Manager ensures that all of the appropriate resources are available to meet your business needs.

Real-Time Order Status & Tracking Services | Symphony Commerce

Commerce That Flows
Real-time visibility and control makes great customer experiences.






 



Not only do your orders flow quickly through Symphony, but you’ll know it.  And so will your customers. Today’s consumers expect immediate results.  Having real-time visibility and control over your orders enables you to keep your service levels on track.
 
 
 
 



Real-time order status
Symphony provides real-time visibility as orders flow from purchase through fulfillment.  Since everything is interconnected, orders move automatically to the appropriate warehouse for fulfillment – with no manual intervention required.   Plus, you’ll be better able to provide service and keep your customers informed.

Get a quick view into orders in process by order value, status, or customer.
Drill down to see order details, including a history of any changes to the order made by your service team.
Orders suspected as fraud are automatically held for review until they’re reviewed and released by a team member.

 
 


 
 
 
 




 
 

Mitigate stockouts, capture more sales
Handle demand surges and alleviate customer frustrations in just one step.  Because your storefront maintains a real-time sync to your inventory,  it knows when a product is out of stock and can automatically set new purchase options that you select.

Turn on backorders when a product runs out, so you can set customer expectations and still capture the order.
Enable pre-orders if you’re ready to capitalize on product demand from a campaign or holiday surge in traffic, before the item is in your inventory.
Instantly remove a product from your storefront once inventory is depleted and you don’t plan to replenish.

65% of online shoppers go elsewhere or don’t buy if their first-choice retailer is out-of-stock – GT Nexus Survey
 
 
 
 



Real-time inventory status & allocation
Gain real-time view into inventory levels at all times – across orders received, in process, shipping, and channels.  Manage inventory in a single system, even when held in multiple warehouse locations.
Virtually allocate inventory across channels to ensure availability in top priority channels and accounts.  Traditional, physically-separated inventory pools are too inflexible and time consuming to manage in the world of online sales.

Prioritize certain channels over others to guarantee you’ll meet your fulfillment goals and SLAs.
Reallocate in an instant to accommodate changes in demand across channels, maximizing revenue opportunities.

 
 


 
 
 
 



Service Makes the Experience
 
 
 
 



Keep your customers informed
A customer’s ability to quickly get order information and support is crucial to resolving issues – and optimizing retention. Unlike many other ecommerce vendors, Symphony provides real-time customer service and order notification, so your customer service is just as delightful as the rest of the shopping experience.

Customers access real-time order status updates directly from your website.
Instant notifications with order tracking keeps customers informed on orders and deliveries.

 
 


 


 
Provide great customer service
Customer service agents have real-time visibility into each order, so they can modify or cancel an order for the customer.

With access into a customer’s account history, agents can update account details, place orders, or offer coupons for customers to resolve issues and drive loyalty.
Service request tickets are managed using ZenDesk, so you’re sure your team can easily stay on top of customer inquiries.
