Travelzoo is a global Internet media company. With 28 million members in North America, Europe, and Asia Pacific and 26 offices worldwide, Travelzoo publishes deals from more than 2,000 travel, entertainment and local businesses such as restaurants and spas. Travelzoo is the largest publisher of travel, entertainment and local deals[citation needed].
Travelzoo employs more than 250 "Deal Experts" worldwide who research, evaluate, negotiate and test offers to find and confirm the best deals[citation needed]. Travelzoo Deal Experts are ex-journalists and researchers[citation needed]. Each deal published by Travelzoo is tested for accuracy, availability and overall ease of the booking process.

In October 2015, Travelzoo’s CEO Chris Loughlin announced he would step down by the end of the year, to be succeeded temporarily by chairman Holger Bartel.[1]
History[edit]
In October 1998, Travelzoo founder Ralph Bartel, a former print and television journalist, launched Travelzoo.com with an initial investment of $10,000. In September 2000, Travelzoo published its first Top 20 and e-mailed one million U.S. members. All deals were researched, evaluated and tested by Travelzoo Deal Experts. In December 2003, Travelzoo became publicly traded on the NASDAQ SmallCap Market under the ticker symbol "TZOO".
In April 2004, Travelzoo Inc. announced that the Company's publications had reached over 7.0 million members, a 75% increase over the 4.0 million members Travelzoo counted in April 2003.[2]
On March 31, 2006, Travelzoo Inc. announced that Forbes.com rated the Travelzoo Web site as one of the best Web sites for travel-related information and travel deals.[3]
Travelzoo acquired Travelzoo Asia Pacific in 2015 to take advantage of the region's increased travel growth.[4]

Travelzoo is a global Internet media company. With 28 million members in North America, Europe, and Asia Pacific and 26 offices worldwide, Travelzoo publishes deals from more than 2,000 travel, entertainment and local businesses such as restaurants and spas. Travelzoo is the largest publisher of travel, entertainment and local deals[citation needed].
Travelzoo employs more than 250 "Deal Experts" worldwide who research, evaluate, negotiate and test offers to find and confirm the best deals[citation needed]. Travelzoo Deal Experts are ex-journalists and researchers[citation needed]. Each deal published by Travelzoo is tested for accuracy, availability and overall ease of the booking process.
Companies pay to advertise their deals with Travelzoo, but only those approved by Travelzoo are listed.
In October 2015, Travelzoo’s CEO Chris Loughlin announced he would step down by the end of the year, to be succeeded temporarily by chairman Holger Bartel.[1]
History[edit]
In October 1998, Travelzoo founder Ralph Bartel, a former print and television journalist, launched Travelzoo.com with an initial investment of $10,000. In September 2000, Travelzoo published its first Top 20 and e-mailed one million U.S. members. All deals were researched, evaluated and tested by Travelzoo Deal Experts. In December 2003, Travelzoo became publicly traded on the NASDAQ SmallCap Market under the ticker symbol "TZOO".
In April 2004, Travelzoo Inc. announced that the Company's publications had reached over 7.0 million members, a 75% increase over the 4.0 million members Travelzoo counted in April 2003.[2]
On March 31, 2006, Travelzoo Inc. announced that Forbes.com rated the Travelzoo Web site as one of the best Web sites for travel-related information and travel deals.[3]
Travelzoo acquired Travelzoo Asia Pacific in 2015 to take advantage of the region's increased travel growth.[4]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.source> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11x1gf2m6>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/type.object.type> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.rate> 4.5 .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage>  .


If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
