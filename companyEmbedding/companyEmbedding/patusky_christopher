Christopher Patusky 
 


Sunday, March 28th, 2010 - 12:47

Christopher Patusky is the Director, Office of Real Estate, for the Maryland Department of  Transportation, where he is responsible for overseeing the Department's  real estate matters statewide, including its transit-oriented  development program. 
Professor Patusky was  the Executive Director of the University of Pennsylvania’s Fels Institute of Government from 2002 to 2007 where he was responsible for managing the fulltime Masters of Governmental Administration (MGA) program and the Fels Government Research Service (GRS). He was also a member of the Fels faculty and teaches a course on governmental law.  Patusky also served on the Faculty Advisory Board for the Graduate School of Education’s Teach for America teacher certification program. Patusky’s research and project work at Fels focused on two areas: performance management and elections. He served as project director for the Philadelphia SchoolStat Performance Management Program, the Philadelphia Workforce Development Corporation training evaluation, and the 866-MyVote1 and the HAVA Local Election Official Support projects, among others.
Prior to joining Fels, Patusky practiced law for 12 years. He clerked with the Honorable Benjamin Kaplan and Ammi Cutter of the Massachusetts Appeals Court before entering private practice with the Boston firm of Hill & Barlow. In 1995, he co-founded the Washington, DC firm of Mahon Patusky Rothblatt & Fisher. His practice areas included administrative law, business startups, copyright, and litigation. He is a member of the bars of Maryland, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and the District of Columbia. Patusky also serves as the vice chairman of the Board of United Therapeutics Corporation and is the past president and chairman of the Fairmount Community Development Corporation, a nonprofit organization dedicated to improving the Fairmount neighborhood of Philadelphia.
Patusky received a B.A. from Northwestern University, a J.D. from The Harvard Law School, and a Masters of Governmental Administration from the University of Pennsylvania’s Fels Institute of Government.
