 Columbus Circle Investors is a hedge fund that was established in 1975 and currently holds around $16 billion in assets under management. The firm's investment philosophy is positive momentum & positive surprise and their target is investing in good companies that are exceeding expectations of investors. The firm is especially successful in picking small-cap and mid-cap stocks, although the largest portion of its assets is dedicated toward large-cap stocks. Their small-cap portfolio has returned 14.4% annually (net of fees) during the last 10 years and has beaten the annual return of the Russell 2000 Growth index by 7 percentage points. Our studies have shown that hedge funds' small cap picks are more successful than their large-cap picks when it comes to outperforming the market. Hedge funds are managed by the most skilled and experienced investment analysts, but they charge a 2% fixed fee and an additional 20% of any profits earned. This cuts out a significant part of the gross returns that hedge funds earn on behalf of their investors. To enable people to use the best investment ideas of hedge funds and avoid paying any fees we have developed a small-cap strategy based on hedge funds' most popular ideas. This strategy delivered around 80 basis points in monthly alpha in a 13-year long backtest (read the details here). We have also been tracking the performance of this strategy in real time and it managed to outperform the S&P 500 ETFs by nearly 79 percentage points since the end of August 2012 (see the details). Columbus Circle Investors has recently disclosed its 13F portfolio for the first quarter of 2015, valued at $14.7 billion.

                                         are among the top holdings of Columbus Circle Investors as of the end of the first quarter of 2015. The largest holding of Columbus Circle Investors is represented by Apple Inc., in which the fund owns 4.88 million shares, valued at $607.57 million. Apple, which owns one of the most profitable businesses ever, has recently announced a revenue of $58.0 billion and net profit of $13.6 billion for its second fiscal quarter of 2015. This is significantly above $45.6 billion in revenue and earnings of $10.2 billion for the same period of last year. Moreover, Apple announced a dividend of $0.52 per share, payable on May 14, 2015. The company has returned $112 billion to shareholders, including $80 billion in share repurchases in the last 2.5 years and the board has further raised the buyback to $140 billion from the $90 billion level. In the previous round of 13F filings, Apple Inc. ranked as the most popular stock among more than 700+ funds that we track. Taking into account the company's strong financial results and the stock's 13% growth in the first three months of 2015, the probability is very high that Apple will stay at the top as the most popular stock at the end of March. So far, two investors already expressed their bullish sentiment regarding Apple. In its recent letter to investors, David Einhorn of Greenlight Capital said that "AAPL is a superior company that merits a premium multiple" and Carl Icahn has tweeted that Apple Inc. is "still undervalued and misunderstood." Columbus Circle Investors had $409.03 million invested in Gilead Sciences, Inc. at the end of first quarter of 2015, the stake containing 4.17 million shares. Gilead Sciences, Inc. reported revenue of $7.4 billion and net income of $4.3 billion for the first quarter of 2015. This represents a 52% increase in revenue and a 95% increase in net income in comparison with the same period of 2014. One of the main impacts on Gilead Sciences, Inc.'s earnings jump was the company's hepatitis C new drug Harvoni, which had sales of almost $3.60 billion in the first quarter. Amid a biotech bubble, Gilead is considered a safe bet on the industry, which is confirmed by the fact that it was the most popular biotech stock among billionaire investors from our database with David Shaw, Israel Englander, and Julian Robertson disclosing substantial long positions as of the end of 2014. Columbus Circle Investors also owns a $309.78 million stake in McKesson Corporation, which contains 1.37 million shares, down by 8% on the quarter. McKesson Corporation is one of the three major players of the U.S. medical distribution market, sporting a market cap of $53 billion. The company acquired Celesio, Rite Aid and expanded its distribution agreement with Omnicare in 2014 and in the near future the deals are expected to pay off in cost synergies. Aside from Columbus, other funds that hold long positions in McKesson Corporation include Larry Robbins' Glenview Capital, Samuel Isaly's Orbimed Advisors, and Leon Cooperman's Omega Advisors. Finally, on the fifth spot is Facebook Inc., in which Columbus owns 3.51 million shares valued at $288.42 million. The fund reduced its holding in the company by 3% during the first quarter of 2015. In its latest financial results, Facebook, one of the biggest websites in the World, posted a 40% annual jump in revenue for the first quarter to $3.54 billion, but at the same time, its expenses surged by more than 80% on the year, which drove the earnings lower in year-over-year terms to $0.18 per share, from $0.25. At of the end of 2014, billionaire Stephen Mandel's Lone Pine Capital was the largest shareholder of Facebook Inc. among the funds we track with 13.50 million shares, followed by Philippe Laffont's Coatue Management and Citadel Investment Group.

What our customers say ...








                                    I really like Angel Investment Network.  I have received more serious interested investors than any other network I have tried so far.                                 







Elie Haddad
 www.pegasuseh.com                                        








                                    I was doubtful this site would work for me, but was so impressed with the site structure and its ease of use. I then got excited to see the view count of my proposal increase, then in two days the first angel investor decided to commit by investing in us.

Let me first start by saying I believe your site is THE BEST there is for connecting Entrepreneurs and Investors.  It is the site I've had most success with.  I had about 6 Investors either respond back or contact me because of your site with an interest in investing in my company. Thank you very much!  I love your site and will recommend it to any of my Colleagues.  I love the fact that we are able to contact the Investors directly (which many of the sites joining Entrepreneurs and Investors don't allow).  It looks like I'm about to go into contract with an Investor because of your site.  Thank you again.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
