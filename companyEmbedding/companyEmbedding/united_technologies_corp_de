Form a Delaware LLC or Corporation

Companies Served Since 1981

     











Harvard Business Services, Inc. has been Delaware's premiere business formation specialist since 1981. We are family-owned and operated, and our mission is to make the Delaware incorporation process quick, easy and efficient. Learn more about our services and why Delaware is the corporate capital of the world in the two videos below.





Why Incorporate in Delaware?

Over half of Fortune 500 companies have selected Delaware as the state in which to incorporate. We'll tell you why.

Why You Should Incorporate in Delaware





Why Use Harvard to Incorporate?

Thirty years of lightning-fast filings, unparalleled customer service and the lowest fees in the industry make Harvard Business Services, Inc. the smart choice.

How Harvard Business Services, Inc. Works





Message From the Chairman:

Welcome to DelawareInc.com. You've come to the right place to form your Delaware LLC or set up a Delaware corporation. We have helped more than 125,000 people form Delaware companies in our 30+ years in business, and we'll form more than 10,000 new companies this year. We consider it an honor to help you form your Delaware company, and we're here to help you be successful.
We specialize in excellent customer service. When you call, email or live chat with our offices, you will receive personal attention from a knowledgeable specialist happy to help you learn about the Delaware incorporation process and how you can incorporate in Delaware.
 
Once your company is formed, we'll be your Delaware Registered Agent for the life of your company. Our annual Registered Agent Fee is the lowest in the industry—only $50 per year, per company, and we do something no other Registered Agent does: we guarantee your Registered Agent Fee will remain fixed at $50 per year. We've held to that guarantee for more than 3 decades and we'll hold to it for the life of the company you form with us.
We'll remind you every year at Delaware Franchise Tax time, and even offer to take care of your tax filing for you for a small fee, guaranteeing on-time payment and ensuring your company remains in compliance and good standing with the state of Delaware.
If you're considering incorporating in Delaware, I suggest you take a look at the two videos above. You'll get a first-hand tour of our offices and meet some of the people at your service and ready to help you when you call us at 1-800-345-2677. You'll also learn the basics about why Delaware is known all over the world as the corporate capital of the United States, and how to register a company in Delaware.
Finally, I invite you to contact me personally if you have any comments about our service, questions about forming an LLC or corporation in Delaware or you'd like to share your opinions about our website, DelawareInc.com.
Here's to you, and to your success!
Sincerely,

Richard H. Bell
Chairman & CEO

History[edit]
Pre-1970s[edit]
Main article: United Aircraft
1970s and 1980s[edit]
In 1974, Harry Gray left Litton Industries to become the CEO of United Aircraft.[8] He pursued a strategy of growth and diversification, changing the parent corporation's name to United Technologies Corporation (UTC) in 1975 to reflect the intent to diversify into numerous high tech fields beyond aerospace.[9] (The change became official on May 1, 1975.) The diversification was partially to balance civilian business against any overreliance on military business.[8] UTC became a mergers and acquisitions (M&A)–focused organization, with various forced takeovers of unwilling smaller corporations.[8] The next year (1976), UTC forcibly acquired Otis Elevator.[10] In 1979, Carrier Refrigeration and Mostek were acquired;[11] the Carrier deal was forcible, while the Mostek deal was a white knight move against hostile takeover designs by Gould.
At one point the military portion of UTC's business, whose sensitivity to "excess profits" and boom/bust demand drove UTC to diversify away from it, actually carried the weight of losses incurred by the commercial M&A side of the business.[8] Although M&A activity was not new to United Aircraft, the M&A activity of the 1970s and 1980s was higher-stakes and arguably unfocused. Rather than aviation being the central theme of UTC businesses, high tech (of any type) was the new theme. Some Wall Street watchers questioned the true value of M&A at almost any price, seemingly for its own sake.[8]
Mostek was sold in 1985 to the French electronics company Thomson.
1990s[edit]
UTC acquired Sundstrand Corporation in 1999, and merged it into UTC's Hamilton Standard unit to form Hamilton Sundstrand.
2000s[edit]
In 2003, UTC entered the fire and security business by purchasing Chubb Security.
In 2004, UTC acquired the Schweizer Aircraft Corporation which planned to operate as a wholly owned subsidiary[12] under their Sikorsky Aircraft division.
In 2005, UTC further pursued its stake in the fire and security business by purchasing Kidde. Also in 2005, UTC acquired Boeing's Rocketdyne division, which was merged into the Pratt & Whitney business unit.
In 2007, UTC opened the Hawk Works,[13] a Rapid Prototyping and Military Derivatives Completion Center (RPMDCC) located west of the Elmira-Corning Regional Airport in Big Flats, NY.
In March 2008, UTC made a $2.63 billion bid to acquire Diebold, a Canton, Ohio based manufacturer of banking and voting machines.[14] Diebold rejected the buyout bid as inadequate.[15]
In November 2008, UTC's Carrier Corporation acquired NORESCO,[16][17] which is one of the nation's largest energy service companies.
In December 2009, it was announced that UTC would acquire a 49.5% stake in Clipper Windpower for $206 million.[18][19][20][21]
2010s[edit]
In April 2010, UTC announced that it was investing €15 million ($20 million) to set up the United Technologies Research Centre Ireland in University College Cork which will carry out research on energy and security systems.[22]
In October 2010, UTC agreed with Clipper to acquire the rest of the company.[23]
In September 2011, UTC acquired a $18.4 billion deal (including $1.9 billion in net debt assumed) for aircraft components maker Goodrich Corporation.[24]
In June 2012, it was discovered that UTC sold military technology to the Chinese.[25] For pleading guilty to violating the Arms Export Control Act and making false statements, United Technologies and its subsidiaries were fined $75 million.[26]
In July 2012, United Technologies acquired Goodrich and merged it with Hamilton Sundstrand; the resulting organization is UTC Aerospace Systems.
In February 2013, UTC Power was sold to ClearEdge Power.[27]
In October 2014, Toshiba and United Technologies made a deal to expand their joint venture outside Japan.[28]
In January 2015, UTC Building & Industrial Systems completed the acquisition of CIAT Group, a leading HVAC manufacturing company in France.[29]
In November 2015, Lockheed Martin completed its $9.0 billion acquisition of Sikorsky Aircraft.[30]
In February 2016, UTC subsidiary Carrier Air Conditioner announced to employees at its Indianapolis plant that Carrier is moving manufacturing to Mexico: “The best way to stay competitive and protect the business for long-term is to move production from our facility in Indianapolis to Monterrey, Mexico.” [31] In December, Carrier agreed to keep the Indianapolis plant open, keeping 1,100 jobs in Indianapolis.[32]

History[edit]
Pre-1970s[edit]
Main article: United Aircraft
1970s and 1980s[edit]
In 1974, Harry Gray left Litton Industries to become the CEO of United Aircraft.[8] He pursued a strategy of growth and diversification, changing the parent corporation's name to United Technologies Corporation (UTC) in 1975 to reflect the intent to diversify into numerous high tech fields beyond aerospace.[9] (The change became official on May 1, 1975.) The diversification was partially to balance civilian business against any overreliance on military business.[8] UTC became a mergers and acquisitions (M&A)–focused organization, with various forced takeovers of unwilling smaller corporations.[8] The next year (1976), UTC forcibly acquired Otis Elevator.[10] In 1979, Carrier Refrigeration and Mostek were acquired;[11] the Carrier deal was forcible, while the Mostek deal was a white knight move against hostile takeover designs by Gould.
At one point the military portion of UTC's business, whose sensitivity to "excess profits" and boom/bust demand drove UTC to diversify away from it, actually carried the weight of losses incurred by the commercial M&A side of the business.[8] Although M&A activity was not new to United Aircraft, the M&A activity of the 1970s and 1980s was higher-stakes and arguably unfocused. Rather than aviation being the central theme of UTC businesses, high tech (of any type) was the new theme. Some Wall Street watchers questioned the true value of M&A at almost any price, seemingly for its own sake.[8]
Mostek was sold in 1985 to the French electronics company Thomson.
1990s[edit]
UTC acquired Sundstrand Corporation in 1999, and merged it into UTC's Hamilton Standard unit to form Hamilton Sundstrand.
2000s[edit]
In 2003, UTC entered the fire and security business by purchasing Chubb Security.
In 2004, UTC acquired the Schweizer Aircraft Corporation which planned to operate as a wholly owned subsidiary[12] under their Sikorsky Aircraft division.
In 2005, UTC further pursued its stake in the fire and security business by purchasing Kidde. Also in 2005, UTC acquired Boeing's Rocketdyne division, which was merged into the Pratt & Whitney business unit.
In 2007, UTC opened the Hawk Works,[13] a Rapid Prototyping and Military Derivatives Completion Center (RPMDCC) located west of the Elmira-Corning Regional Airport in Big Flats, NY.
In March 2008, UTC made a $2.63 billion bid to acquire Diebold, a Canton, Ohio based manufacturer of banking and voting machines.[14] Diebold rejected the buyout bid as inadequate.[15]
In November 2008, UTC's Carrier Corporation acquired NORESCO,[16][17] which is one of the nation's largest energy service companies.
In December 2009, it was announced that UTC would acquire a 49.5% stake in Clipper Windpower for $206 million.[18][19][20][21]
2010s[edit]
In April 2010, UTC announced that it was investing €15 million ($20 million) to set up the United Technologies Research Centre Ireland in University College Cork which will carry out research on energy and security systems.[22]
In October 2010, UTC agreed with Clipper to acquire the rest of the company.[23]
In September 2011, UTC acquired a $18.4 billion deal (including $1.9 billion in net debt assumed) for aircraft components maker Goodrich Corporation.[24]
In June 2012, it was discovered that UTC sold military technology to the Chinese.[25] For pleading guilty to violating the Arms Export Control Act and making false statements, United Technologies and its subsidiaries were fined $75 million.[26]
In July 2012, United Technologies acquired Goodrich and merged it with Hamilton Sundstrand; the resulting organization is UTC Aerospace Systems.
In February 2013, UTC Power was sold to ClearEdge Power.[27]
In October 2014, Toshiba and United Technologies made a deal to expand their joint venture outside Japan.[28]
In January 2015, UTC Building & Industrial Systems completed the acquisition of CIAT Group, a leading HVAC manufacturing company in France.[29]
In November 2015, Lockheed Martin completed its $9.0 billion acquisition of Sikorsky Aircraft.[30]
In February 2016, UTC subsidiary Carrier Air Conditioner announced to employees at its Indianapolis plant that Carrier is moving manufacturing to Mexico: “The best way to stay competitive and protect the business for long-term is to move production from our facility in Indianapolis to Monterrey, Mexico.” [31] In December, Carrier agreed to keep the Indianapolis plant open, keeping 1,100 jobs in Indianapolis.[32]

History[edit]
Pre-1970s[edit]
Main article: United Aircraft
1970s and 1980s[edit]
In 1974, Harry Gray left Litton Industries to become the CEO of United Aircraft.[8] He pursued a strategy of growth and diversification, changing the parent corporation's name to United Technologies Corporation (UTC) in 1975 to reflect the intent to diversify into numerous high tech fields beyond aerospace.[9] (The change became official on May 1, 1975.) The diversification was partially to balance civilian business against any overreliance on military business.[8] UTC became a mergers and acquisitions (M&A)–focused organization, with various forced takeovers of unwilling smaller corporations.[8] The next year (1976), UTC forcibly acquired Otis Elevator.[10] In 1979, Carrier Refrigeration and Mostek were acquired;[11] the Carrier deal was forcible, while the Mostek deal was a white knight move against hostile takeover designs by Gould.
At one point the military portion of UTC's business, whose sensitivity to "excess profits" and boom/bust demand drove UTC to diversify away from it, actually carried the weight of losses incurred by the commercial M&A side of the business.[8] Although M&A activity was not new to United Aircraft, the M&A activity of the 1970s and 1980s was higher-stakes and arguably unfocused. Rather than aviation being the central theme of UTC businesses, high tech (of any type) was the new theme. Some Wall Street watchers questioned the true value of M&A at almost any price, seemingly for its own sake.[8]
Mostek was sold in 1985 to the French electronics company Thomson.
1990s[edit]
UTC acquired Sundstrand Corporation in 1999, and merged it into UTC's Hamilton Standard unit to form Hamilton Sundstrand.
2000s[edit]
In 2003, UTC entered the fire and security business by purchasing Chubb Security.
In 2004, UTC acquired the Schweizer Aircraft Corporation which planned to operate as a wholly owned subsidiary[12] under their Sikorsky Aircraft division.
In 2005, UTC further pursued its stake in the fire and security business by purchasing Kidde. Also in 2005, UTC acquired Boeing's Rocketdyne division, which was merged into the Pratt & Whitney business unit.
In 2007, UTC opened the Hawk Works,[13] a Rapid Prototyping and Military Derivatives Completion Center (RPMDCC) located west of the Elmira-Corning Regional Airport in Big Flats, NY.
In March 2008, UTC made a $2.63 billion bid to acquire Diebold, a Canton, Ohio based manufacturer of banking and voting machines.[14] Diebold rejected the buyout bid as inadequate.[15]
In November 2008, UTC's Carrier Corporation acquired NORESCO,[16][17] which is one of the nation's largest energy service companies.
In December 2009, it was announced that UTC would acquire a 49.5% stake in Clipper Windpower for $206 million.[18][19][20][21]
2010s[edit]
In April 2010, UTC announced that it was investing €15 million ($20 million) to set up the United Technologies Research Centre Ireland in University College Cork which will carry out research on energy and security systems.[22]
In October 2010, UTC agreed with Clipper to acquire the rest of the company.[23]
In September 2011, UTC acquired a $18.4 billion deal (including $1.9 billion in net debt assumed) for aircraft components maker Goodrich Corporation.[24]
In June 2012, it was discovered that UTC sold military technology to the Chinese.[25] For pleading guilty to violating the Arms Export Control Act and making false statements, United Technologies and its subsidiaries were fined $75 million.[26]
In July 2012, United Technologies acquired Goodrich and merged it with Hamilton Sundstrand; the resulting organization is UTC Aerospace Systems.
In February 2013, UTC Power was sold to ClearEdge Power.[27]
In October 2014, Toshiba and United Technologies made a deal to expand their joint venture outside Japan.[28]
In January 2015, UTC Building & Industrial Systems completed the acquisition of CIAT Group, a leading HVAC manufacturing company in France.[29]
In November 2015, Lockheed Martin completed its $9.0 billion acquisition of Sikorsky Aircraft.[30]
In February 2016, UTC subsidiary Carrier Air Conditioner announced to employees at its Indianapolis plant that Carrier is moving manufacturing to Mexico: “The best way to stay competitive and protect the business for long-term is to move production from our facility in Indianapolis to Monterrey, Mexico.” [31] In December, Carrier agreed to keep the Indianapolis plant open, keeping 1,100 jobs in Indianapolis.[32]

Philanthropy[edit]
In 1981, a contribution from UTC made possible the exhibition "Paris/Magnum: Photographs 1935–1981", featuring photographs of Paris taken by photographers of Magnum Photos, the agency founded in 1947 by Robert Capa, George Rodger, Henri Cartier-Bresson, William Vandivert, and David Seymour. A volume of the same title, with text by Irwin Shaw and an introduction by Inge Morath, was also published in 1981.
UTC is the sponsor of the exhibition "Aphrodite and the Gods of Love" at Boston's Museum of Fine Arts that opened in fall 2011.[45]
UTC and its subsidiaries are major contributors to museums such as the New England Air Museum.[46]
Environmental record[edit]
Researchers at the University of Massachusetts Amherst have identified UTC as the 38th-largest corporate producer of air pollution in the United States as of 2008. UTC released roughly 110,000 pounds of toxic chemicals annually into the atmosphere[47] including manganese, nickel, chromium and related compounds.[48][49]
In the 2016 University of Massachusetts Amherst Toxic 100 Air Polluters Index, UTC was ranked 9th by a toxicity population exposure score. It was also reported they release 60,000 pounds of toxins into the air, the second lowest amount by the top 10 listed companies.[50]

History[edit]
Pre-1970s[edit]
Main article: United Aircraft
1970s and 1980s[edit]
In 1974, Harry Gray left Litton Industries to become the CEO of United Aircraft.[8] He pursued a strategy of growth and diversification, changing the parent corporation's name to United Technologies Corporation (UTC) in 1975 to reflect the intent to diversify into numerous high tech fields beyond aerospace.[9] (The change became official on May 1, 1975.) The diversification was partially to balance civilian business against any overreliance on military business.[8] UTC became a mergers and acquisitions (M&A)–focused organization, with various forced takeovers of unwilling smaller corporations.[8] The next year (1976), UTC forcibly acquired Otis Elevator.[10] In 1979, Carrier Refrigeration and Mostek were acquired;[11] the Carrier deal was forcible, while the Mostek deal was a white knight move against hostile takeover designs by Gould.
At one point the military portion of UTC's business, whose sensitivity to "excess profits" and boom/bust demand drove UTC to diversify away from it, actually carried the weight of losses incurred by the commercial M&A side of the business.[8] Although M&A activity was not new to United Aircraft, the M&A activity of the 1970s and 1980s was higher-stakes and arguably unfocused. Rather than aviation being the central theme of UTC businesses, high tech (of any type) was the new theme. Some Wall Street watchers questioned the true value of M&A at almost any price, seemingly for its own sake.[8]
Mostek was sold in 1985 to the French electronics company Thomson.
1990s[edit]
UTC acquired Sundstrand Corporation in 1999, and merged it into UTC's Hamilton Standard unit to form Hamilton Sundstrand.
2000s[edit]
In 2003, UTC entered the fire and security business by purchasing Chubb Security.
In 2004, UTC acquired the Schweizer Aircraft Corporation which planned to operate as a wholly owned subsidiary[12] under their Sikorsky Aircraft division.
In 2005, UTC further pursued its stake in the fire and security business by purchasing Kidde. Also in 2005, UTC acquired Boeing's Rocketdyne division, which was merged into the Pratt & Whitney business unit.
In 2007, UTC opened the Hawk Works,[13] a Rapid Prototyping and Military Derivatives Completion Center (RPMDCC) located west of the Elmira-Corning Regional Airport in Big Flats, NY.
In March 2008, UTC made a $2.63 billion bid to acquire Diebold, a Canton, Ohio based manufacturer of banking and voting machines.[14] Diebold rejected the buyout bid as inadequate.[15]
In November 2008, UTC's Carrier Corporation acquired NORESCO,[16][17] which is one of the nation's largest energy service companies.
In December 2009, it was announced that UTC would acquire a 49.5% stake in Clipper Windpower for $206 million.[18][19][20][21]
2010s[edit]
In April 2010, UTC announced that it was investing €15 million ($20 million) to set up the United Technologies Research Centre Ireland in University College Cork which will carry out research on energy and security systems.[22]
In October 2010, UTC agreed with Clipper to acquire the rest of the company.[23]
In September 2011, UTC acquired a $18.4 billion deal (including $1.9 billion in net debt assumed) for aircraft components maker Goodrich Corporation.[24]
In June 2012, it was discovered that UTC sold military technology to the Chinese.[25] For pleading guilty to violating the Arms Export Control Act and making false statements, United Technologies and its subsidiaries were fined $75 million.[26]
In July 2012, United Technologies acquired Goodrich and merged it with Hamilton Sundstrand; the resulting organization is UTC Aerospace Systems.
In February 2013, UTC Power was sold to ClearEdge Power.[27]
In October 2014, Toshiba and United Technologies made a deal to expand their joint venture outside Japan.[28]
In January 2015, UTC Building & Industrial Systems completed the acquisition of CIAT Group, a leading HVAC manufacturing company in France.[29]
In November 2015, Lockheed Martin completed its $9.0 billion acquisition of Sikorsky Aircraft.[30]
In February 2016, UTC subsidiary Carrier Air Conditioner announced to employees at its Indianapolis plant that Carrier is moving manufacturing to Mexico: “The best way to stay competitive and protect the business for long-term is to move production from our facility in Indianapolis to Monterrey, Mexico.” [31] In December, Carrier agreed to keep the Indianapolis plant open, keeping 1,100 jobs in Indianapolis.[32]

United Technologies Corp (UTX) Outlines Growth Strategy: 3 Things Investors Should Consider
New United Technologies CEO Gregory Hayes recently updated investors on the company's strategic direction and hinted at a future major acquisition. Here is what he said.

            Feb 28, 2015 at 1:07PM
            
            





United Technologies Corp (NYSE:UTX) investors can expect some changes in 2015, not least because the company appears to be shaping up for a major acquisition. In addition, recently appointed CEO Gregory Hayes is actively reviewing the company's portfolio of businesses.

Hayes discussed such matters at the recent Barclays Industrial Select Conference. Let's take a closer look at what he said. Can we draw any conclusions about what can investors expect in 2015? 
Three things to look at with United Technologies Ever since Louis Chenevert abruptly retired as CEO in November, analysts have been speculating on what direction Hayes would take the company as he stepped up from CFO. In this article I'm going to focus on three talking points from his recent presentation.

The future of its military and commercial helicopter segment, Sikorsky
Acquisition plans, scale, and nature
Change in strategic or operational direction

The future of Sikorsky -- best known as being the manufacturer of Black Hawk helicopters -- has long been a moot point, with speculation rife that management would be willing to sell or spin off the business. 
It's not hard to see the logic behind a potential sale. Unlike the other two aerospace segments, Sikorsky has heavy exposure to military spending, with 52% of its sales going to the U.S. government alone in 2014. The other two aerospace-focused segments, Pratt & Whitney and UTC Aerospace Systems, have less exposure, with 22% and 19% of sales going to the U.S. government in 2014.





Moreover, Sikorsky has the lowest operating profit margin of all its segments -- suggesting management could sell it and use resources to focus on generating synergies within the overall company's commercial aerospace operations.
 Source: United Technologies 10k filing
With that said, some investors might have been disappointed when Hayes stated, "We are not going to sell Sikorsky" at the investor meeting in December. However, his emphasis seemed to change, albeit subtly, at the recent Barclays conference.
He consistently referred to commercial aerospace and building as the company's core activities, amid making it clear that he was reviewing the portfolio and seeing if there were "pieces of the portfolio that didn't fit." Might Sikorsky be sold after all?
Acquisition plans Hayes also spoke about his willingness to make an acquisition for more than $5 billion. It's a large amount, but as he pointed out, a company of United Technologies' size needs scale in order to efficiently use management resources and generate significant synergies from a deal.





He also outlined the intent of not doing something outside of its core commercial aerospace and buildings operations, while highlighting the strengths of being in two separate industries. For example, the buildings operations generated the cash flow to enable Pratt & Whitney to invest in developing the geared turbofan engine.
Therefore, investors shouldn't be too hopeful of the company splitting into two separate parts (aerospace and buildings). Within aerospace, he pretty much ruled out an acquisition in avionics -- an area of strength for its rival, Honeywell International (NYSE:HON) -- because the opportunity to generate cost synergies with United Technologies in existing aerospace business wasn't obvious. However, Hayes stated that he would look at companies with "mechanically actuated systems."
One company long associated as a potential target is U.K. aerospace company Meggitt (LSE:MGGT). With a market cap of around $7 billion, it has the scale to attract United Technologies, and it already manufactures parts for Sikorsky military rotorcraft. Meggitt currently generates 48% of its revenue from civil aerospace, and its aircraft braking systems (21% of first-half 2014 revenue) and control systems (23% of first-half revenue) appear to be a good fit for United Technologies. Moreover, around 57% of Meggitt's military revenue already goes to the U.S. 
Increasing productivity  Indeed, in a previous article on United Technologies, readers saw a breakout of its segmental return on assets, or ROA, (updated chart below), which suggested that management could look to increase the ROA generated with UTC Aerospace Systems.





 Source: United Technologies 10k filing
Furthermore, a DuPont analysis comparing United Technologies with Honeywell International shows how United Technologies' asset utilization fell after the acquisition of Goodrich in 2012. Also, Honeywell's aerospace segment ROA is significantly higher than United Technologies.
Cutting out unnecessary costs for UTC Aerospace is obviously a focus. In January, management announced plans to eliminate UTC Propulsion & Aerospace Systems, or PAS. Pratt & Whitney and UTC Aerospace used to operate under the PAS structure. Hayes outlined that this move would help cut costs by $50 million to $60 million. Moreover, he stressed the need to make the organization leaner -- classic stuff from a former CFO.
Where next for United Technologies? It's possible that Sikorsky could be sold--something the market would welcome in my opinion. Potential upside could also come from the acquisition of a company like Meggitt, not least because United Technologies could generate cost synergies from such a deal.
All told, United Technologies investors should prepare themselves for an active year in 2015, and management making the right strategic moves could propel the stock higher.

Innovation
As a company that does business with the environment in mind, it makes sense that the inspiration for one of our most sustainable technology breakthroughs came from the atmosphere itself. We’re talking about carbon dioxide.


See the future








Sustainability
Carrier understands the green building movement because we were there when it began. Before green building was cool, we were founding company number one of the U.S. Green Building Council® and a founding member of Green Building Councils around the world in Argentina, China, India, Singapore and France.

We are family-owned and operated, and our mission is to make the Delaware incorporation process quick, easy and efficient.

Why You Should Incorporate in Delaware





Why Use Harvard to Incorporate?

Thirty years of lightning-fast filings, unparalleled customer service and the lowest fees in the industry make Harvard Business Services, Inc. the smart choice.

How Harvard Business Services, Inc. Works





Message From the Chairman:

Welcome to DelawareInc.com. You've come to the right place to form your Delaware LLC or set up a Delaware corporation. We have helped more than 125,000 people form Delaware companies in our 30+ years in business, and we'll form more than 10,000 new companies this year. We consider it an honor to help you form your Delaware company, and we're here to help you be successful.
We specialize in excellent customer service. When you call, email or live chat with our offices, you will receive personal attention from a knowledgeable specialist happy to help you learn about the Delaware incorporation process and how you can incorporate in Delaware.
 
Once your company is formed, we'll be your Delaware Registered Agent for the life of your company. Our annual Registered Agent Fee is the lowest in the industry—only $50 per year, per company, and we do something no other Registered Agent does: we guarantee your Registered Agent Fee will remain fixed at $50 per year. We've held to that guarantee for more than 3 decades and we'll hold to it for the life of the company you form with us.
We'll remind you every year at Delaware Franchise Tax time, and even offer to take care of your tax filing for you for a small fee, guaranteeing on-time payment and ensuring your company remains in compliance and good standing with the state of Delaware.
If you're considering incorporating in Delaware, I suggest you take a look at the two videos above. You'll get a first-hand tour of our offices and meet some of the people at your service and ready to help you when you call us at 1-800-345-2677. You'll also learn the basics about why Delaware is known all over the world as the corporate capital of the United States, and how to register a company in Delaware.
Finally, I invite you to contact me personally if you have any comments about our service, questions about forming an LLC or corporation in Delaware or you'd like to share your opinions about our website, DelawareInc.com.
Here's to you, and to your success!
Sincerely,

Richard H. Bell
