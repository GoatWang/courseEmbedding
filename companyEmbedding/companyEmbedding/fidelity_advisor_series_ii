FAQs: Fidelity Portfolio Advisory Service®


Who is this service appropriate for?  

This service may be right for individuals who'd like a team of professionals to manage their money in pursuit of retirement or other large, long-term goals.



Who manages my money?  

Strategic Advisers, Inc., a Fidelity Investments company, will actively research, evaluate, and select investments to help you reach your goals. Strategic Advisers employs some of the best minds in the industry, and will act as your adviser, always putting your interests first.



What kind of investments can I expect in my account?  

Your account will contain a diversified mix of mutual funds, and potentially exchange-traded funds (ETFs), depending on your investment preference. You will also have access to investments designed specifically for clients with assets in Fidelity Portfolio Advisory Service®.



How are the investments chosen for my account?  

Your goals, time horizon, and comfort with risk will help us select investments for your strategy. Depending on the investment approach you prefer, you may choose to have us invest in funds from both Fidelity and other firms or in Fidelity Funds only, or you may choose to have us invest primarily in index funds from both Fidelity and other firms.



Can I choose my own investments?  

You may not buy and sell investments in your Fidelity Portfolio Advisory Service® account. By enrolling in a managed account service like this, you turn the day-to-day management of your investments over to a team of investment professionals. Once we understand your goals and tolerance for risk, we'll propose an appropriate investment strategy for your account. We will also work closely with you to help you select an investment approach to help meet your needs. You’re also entitled to place reasonable investment restrictions on your account. Feel free to contact us and we'll do our best to accommodate you.



Can I change my investment strategy?  

You can contact us at any time to discuss changing either your investment strategy or your investment approach if you believe that your financial situation or goals have changed. In addition, we'll conduct an annual strategic review of your goals and your financial situation and ask you to either confirm or update the information we have on file for you. At that time, based on any new information you provide, we may propose changes for your account.



Can I add funds to my account?  

Yes, you can add funds at any time.



Can I withdraw funds from my account?  

Yes, there are several ways to access your funds, including scheduled withdrawals.



How much do I need to open an account?  

The minimum funding amount is $50,000. Accounts can be funded with a check, bank wire, an exchange of assets from an existing Fidelity account, or a transfer of eligible assets from an account at another institution.



How much does it cost?  

Gross advisory fees range from 0.60% to 1.70% based on the amount of assets you invest.*

          * The advisory fee does not cover charges resulting from trades effected with or through brokerdealers other than affiliates of Strategic Advisers, mark-ups or mark-downs by broker-dealers, transfer taxes, exchange fees, regulatory fees, odd-lot differentials, handling charges, electronic fund and wire transfer fees, or any other charges imposed by law or otherwise applicable to your account. You will also incur underlying expenses associated with the investment vehicles selected. For more information on the advisory fee, including a detailed fee schedule, please refer to the Program Fundamentals or Client Agreement. Note that the annual net advisory fee for your account does not include underlying fund expenses charged at the individual fund level for any funds in your account. These are the standard expenses that all fund shareholders pay. Your Gross Advisory Fee is reduced by a Credit Amount, which reflects investment management and certain service fees received by Strategic Advisers, Inc., or its affiliates from funds held in your account.
	
    


Keep in mind that investing involves risk. The value of your investment will fluctuate over time, and you may gain or lose money.



Diversification and asset allocation do not ensure a profit or guarantee against loss.



ETFs are subject to market fluctuation and the risks of their underlying investments. ETFs are subject to management fees and other expenses. Unlike mutual funds, ETF shares are bought and sold at market price, which may be higher or lower than their NAV, and are not individually redeemed from the fund.



Fidelity Portfolio Advisory Service® is a service of Strategic Advisers, Inc., a registered investment adviser and a Fidelity Investments company. This service provides discretionary money management for a fee.

 
 Brokerage services are provided by Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC. Custody and other services are provided by National Financial Services LLC. Both are Fidelity Investments companies and members of NYSE and SIPC.



Before investing in any mutual fund or exchange-traded fund, you should consider its investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus, offering circular or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.

In this role, Joanna serves as the lead portfolio manager on the Strategic Family of Funds. Before joining Fidelity in 1997, Joanna was a fixed income analyst at Federated Investors from 1990 to 1997. She has been in the investments industry since 1990. Joanna earned her degree in accounting from Ohio University and her MBA in finance from Katz Graduate School of Business at the University of Pittsburgh. She is also a CFA charterholder.Morningstar Style BoxYahoo partners with Morningstar a leading market research and investment data group to help investors rate and compare funds on Yahoo Finance. The Morningstar Category is shown next to the Morningstar Style Box which identifies a fund's investment focus, based on the underlying securities in the fund.Morningstar CategoryWhile the investment objective stated in a fund's prospectus may or may not reflect how the fund actually invests, the Morningstar category is assigned based on the underlying securities in each portfolio. Morningstar categories help investors and investment professionals make meaningful comparisons between funds. The categories make it easier to build well-diversified portfolios, assess potential risk, and identify top-performing funds. We place funds in a given category based on their portfolio statistics and compositions over the past three years. If the fund is new and has no portfolio history, we estimate where it will fall before giving it a more permanent category assignment. When necessary, we may change a category assignment based on recent changes to the portfolio.Fund OverviewCategoryMultisector BondFund FamilyFidelity InvestmentsNet Assets8.68BYTD Return4.65%Yield3.08%Morningstar Rating★★★★Inception DateSep 2, 1996Fund OperationsLast Dividend0.03Last Cap Gain0.00Holdings Turnover76.00%Average for CategoryN/AFees & ExpensesExpenseFSTAXCategory AverageAnnual Report Expense Ratio (net)1.01%1.04%Prospectus Net Expense Ratio1.01%N/AProspectus Gross Expense Ratio1.01%N/AMax 12b1 Fee0.25%N/AMax Front End Sales Load4.00%3.93%Max Deferred Sales LoadN/A1.56%3 Yr Expense Projection709N/A5 Yr Expense Projection936N/A10 Yr Expense Projection1,587N/AYahoo Small BusinessData DisclaimerHelpSuggestionsPrivacyAbout Our AdsTerms (Updated)
