Investment Philosophy
Universa views investing through the lense of the scientific method; that is, investments are hypotheses that are subjected to refutation, or loss. Some investments are more exposed, in consequence, to refutation (the problem of induction) than others, and are thus riskier.
Universa's basic approach is to subject its investment hypotheses to benign refutation through asymmetric, positively-skewed payoffs exposed to small losses when refuted and very large gains when not.
This nonlinear positioning comes with a long-term specialization in extreme financial market tails, where Universa offers a unique combination of focused options trading experience and technical expertise in rare events (or black swans).
Universa’s edge is derived from its ability to provide tail hedging (portfolio protection) and investing in a manner that is exceedingly more efficient than that offered through "naïve" options strategies and other risk management strategies. Significant edge is also derived from acting as a liquidity provider, as well as from systematic options market supply and demand imbalances, structural and behavioral biases and unrivaled access to order flows.

Capital Asset Pricing Mistakes: The Consistent Opportunities in Tail Hedged Equities
 (Jan 2015)
              Chitpuneet Mann, Mark Spitznagel, and Brandon Yarckin
 The introduction of asymmetric beta to the CAPM framework can allow an investor to construct a portfolio with expectations well above the security market line. Incorporating asymmetric beta provides evidence of a mispricing in certain payoff profiles, namely tail hedged equities, that can be analyzed by using variants of the CAPM type of framework. CAPM based asset allocations are misspecified and ill-equipped to handle asymmetric returns.



 
 



The Austrians and the Swan: Birds of a Different Feather
 (May 2012)
              Mark Spitznagel, Chief Investment Officer 
 What is a black swan event, or tail event, in the stock market?
                - It depends on who’s asking.
                - To those familiar with Austrian capital theory, the impending U.S. stock market plunge (of even well over 40%)—like pretty much all that came before in the past century—will certainly not be a Black Swan, nor even a tail event.
                - Nonetheless, the black swan notion is paramount—in perception: Market participants’ failure to expect a perfectly expected event—that is, they price in only Anglo swans despite the Viennese bird lurking conspicuously in the weeds—much like what is happening today, brings tremendous opportunity.



 
 



The Dao of Corporate Finance, Q Ratios, and Stock Market Crashes (June 2011)
              Mark Spitznagel, Chief Investment Officer 
 This white paper provides clear and rigorous evidence of a direct relationship between overvaluation and subsequent extreme losses in the aggregate stock market.
                Of equal importance is the use of the Q ratio as the most robust aggregate overvaluation metric, which isolates the key drivers of valuation.
                At current valuations (Q ≈ 1.04)—and if this 110-year relationship continues—there is an expected (median) drawdown of 20%, and a 20% chance of a larger than 40% correction in the S&P500 within the next few years; these probabilities continually reset as valuations remain elevated, making an eventual deep drawdown from current levels highly likely.

Tail Hedging
















About Universa Investments L.P.
Universa is an investment management firm that specializes in tail hedging as a means to enhance long-term equity returns. Universa portfolios are, by construction, exceedingly positively-skewed, robust to extreme risk assumptions, and non-linear to common risk factors (such as beta). 
Universa's economic edge derives ultimately from basic behavioral biases. Universa captures that edge through a focused and disciplined investment approach employing positively-skewed payoffs, empirical and fundamental-based option valuation, and trading/providing liquidity against systematic order flow imbalances and resulting mispricings in options markets.  
Universa was founded in January 2007 by CIO Mark Spitznagel, with over a decade of implementation and cumulative, incremental development of its focused, positive asymmetric investment approach. Universa has thus created an innovative investment niche and risk management methodology within an increasingly homogeneous industry. 
Universa is currently registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
