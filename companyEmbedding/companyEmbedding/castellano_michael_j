Capital One® Secured Mastercard®


                                            I never had played in credit before, and someone suggested this card to me to build credit for the first time.

Wells Fargo


                                            I find it quite disturbing to see 24 one star, the lowest, ratings on the first page of Wallet Hub's most recent reviews of Wells Fargo. Somehow, in its overall summary, Wallet Hub still gives the impression Wells Fargo is a good banking option. What's going on here?

I live on a fixed income. Its very difficult. My father and I are fairly comfortable, but due to the 40+ derogatory items on my credit report, which are all medically related. Lexington law, if you can afford their services, have done soo much for me. In only two months time, they removed 25+ items off my report. Unfortunately I'm unable to continue working with them, due to the roughly $100/mo fee, which is a bit too high for me.… read more

Who is taking it?  If you are just paying taxes and insurance no one can take it from you if you send a letter of intentions and pay what you can every month.  You might put the home up for a fast sale and with the money move into something affordable while paying the six thousand.

Title: Another Coastal Assistant
               Company: Catawba College
Job Details
               Established in 1851, Catawba College is the sixth oldest college in North Carolina. Its purpose is to enrich the educational experiences of students and to prepare these students for productive and meaningful lives of purpose following their graduation. A strong sense of community is fostered at Catawba. Caring and engaged faculty and staff challenge and support new students making the academic transition from high school to college. While coursework is demanding, Catawba also effectively prepares students to both ponder the meaning of vocation within a liberal arts context and to ultimately pursue meaningful careers or graduate studies. Catawba's campus is located in the historic piedmont North Carolina city of Salisbury and consists of 30 buildings on 276 acres. It is a beautiful blend of neo-gothic architecture set on a shaded hillside adjacent to its own ecological preserve. Centrally located, it is only two hours away from the Appalachian Mountains of western North Carolina and four hours away from the beaches on the Atlantic Coast.

FRN Registration

Before using ULS, you must first register with the FCC's Commission Registration System (CORES) to receive an FCC Registration
      Number (FRN). Click the Register button on the ULS Home page to access CORES for your FRN. Follow the onscreen prompts and instructions, providing the password information requested
      by CORES. CORES will present you with a confirmation page. We recommend printing this page for your records -- you will need
      to use your FRN and password to apply for and manage licenses within ULS and register antenna structures within ASR. Under
      the heading, "To continue on to another FCC Filing system," choose the ULS link to return to ULS.
   
Once you have completed your registration, use the Log In button on the ULS Home page to associate call signs with your FRN. To associate ASR numbers with your FRN, use the Log In button on the ASR Home page To update your CORES registration at any time, click on the Register button on the ULS Home page or the ASR Home page. 
   
 Return to Top
ULS Online Filing

If you have registered in CORES and wish to use ULS for online application filing, click on the Log In button (located on the ULS Home page) to begin the electronic filing process. ULS will load the appropriate online application form based on the purpose of the
      application and radio service you select. For more details, please see Getting Started 2. File: Using ULS online filing. 
   
Please Note: The copy of your filing resulting from Print Preview in ULS may be submitted to the FCC for manual filing ONLY
      if it is a complete application with the addition dates printed clearly at the bottom of the page. 
   
 Return to Top
Application Search

The Application Search button (located on the ULS Home page) enables you to search for specific wireless service applications submitted within ULS. You can view applications, associated
      schedules, attachments, status information, and historical data. For more details, please see Getting Started 3. Search.
   
 Return to Top
License Search

Use the License Search button (located on the ULS Home page) to search the ULS database for specific licenses. You can view the status, special conditions, comments, technical information,
      history, and associated applications and attachments for each license. For more details, please see Getting Started 3. Search. 
   
 Return to Top
Archive License Search

Use the Archives button (located on the ULS Home page) to link to the Archive License Search. The ULS License Archive Search enables you to search for prior versions of a license
      as well as the current version. Each time a license is acted upon, the current version is captured within ULS creating a "snapshot"
      history of the license and its modifications. Searching these archived versions allows you to see the exact status of a license
      at various points in time. The search interface uses the same display as ULS Advanced License Search and allows you to search
      on many of the same criteria.  Note: The ULS data warehouse stores archived licenses for radio services converted to ULS beginning
      in August 1999 or, if the service was converted to ULS after August 1999, from the date the service was converted. Licenses
      from previous wireless databases are not archived in the license warehouse.

Ownership Information Filing

To file Ownership Information electronically, the filer must select the Log In button (located on the ULS Home page) and login with its FCC Registration Number (FRN) and password. In addition, an FRN, but not a password, is required for
