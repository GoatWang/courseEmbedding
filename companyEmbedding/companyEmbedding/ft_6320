Product Overview





			            Johnson's 16 ft. Durable Aluminum Grade Rod has graduations printed on both sides. One side features inch/foot graduations with a white background while the second side features metric graduations on a yellow background. This dual side graduated tool allows one tool to do the job of two. The durable aluminum construction assures years of use in the toughest work environments. A 1 ft. grade rod is tall enough for most any excavating jobs, including basements, and is a necessary tool whenever rotary lasers and detectors are used for measuring elevations. This grade rod is a universal dimension and can be used with any brand detector and detector bracket.
			        

Durable aluminum with anodized finish
Telescoping rod for easy storage
Dual graduations - feet/tenths and feet/inches
Tough aluminum construction
Great for many applications
Great solution for laser tool needs

Price Guarantee:
At Acme Tools we pride ourselves on offering you the best selection of tools, equipment and supplies in the industry at guaranteed low prices. From time to time we are not always able to see what the competition is doing. Our product is priced as low as possible. However, our prices won't be beat. If you see the exact item currently advertised for less (including the competitor's shipping and handling charges, taxes or any other hidden charges) we will match that price. We reserve the right to verify current and net prices in these situations. See terms and conditions below.
