Tumor monitoring in a drop of blood
Precision medicine starts with a finger stick

Your genes, right now.
Circulogene’s “liquid biopsy” is based on the discovery that as tumors grow, they also die, releasing their DNA into the bloodstream. Circulogene’s liquid biopsy tumor DNA sequencing is the only test available that combines finger-stick volumes of blood and the most advanced next-generation sequencing (NGS) to monitor tumor-mutant DNA within well-characterized, well-documented, cancer-associated genes.
With a simple finger stick, Circulogene’s patented technology utilizes NGS to monitor known tumor mutations (approximately 3,000) in 50 established cancer-associated genes and further provides information on current FDA-approved treatment options.
Access
Droplet-volume input with maximal yield. A finger stick versus venipuncture means the access to patient’s blood is even less invasive.
Enrich
Patented enrichment technology locates and captures cell-free DNA, identifying and quantifying any tumor mutations for accurate reporting and monitoring.
Detect
Capable of testing 50 genes for approximately 3,000 possible mutations. Multimutation monitoring capabilities encompass a broad range of tumor profiles and allow for patient-centered precision medicine.
The Circulogene AdvantageNoninvasive Precision MedicineBecause our patented technique enriches the sample, Circulogene analysis only requires 50 microliters of blood from a finger stick, more convenient for health care professionals and patients.Accurate Identification of Tumor MutationsCirculogene’s tests analyze for the presence of cell-free DNA, identifying and quantifying any tumor mutations for accurate reporting and monitoring.Tumor Mutations Matched with TreatmentIn our personalized gene reports, Circulogene further provides information on current FDA-approved treatment options proven effective for the tumor DNA mutations identified.Track Responsiveness Frequently
The efficiency of Circulogene’s process empowers physicians to closely monitor tumor responsiveness and adjust treatment protocols. Turnaround time is five to seven days, much faster than tissue biopsy results and other liquid biopsies.
Tumor Burden and RecurrenceThe Circulogene process uses precise baseline data from which to measure cell turnover and progression.A Yield of 100x with 1/10 of the SampleWe compared the sensitivity of our proprietary cell-free DNA enrichment method to the standard DNA extraction kit used industry-wide today. Results demonstrated 100x more cell-free tumor DNA in the original sample using a single drop of blood.CLIA Certified: Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)

Overview








			Overview

Circulogene’s “liquid biopsy” services leverage proven technology and provide a non-invasive and cost-effective solution for high-sensitivity monitoring across a variety of samples, including blood. Our unique fingerstick technology provides unprecedented tumor monitoring information with an up-to-date clinical status in a more complete, accurate, timely, less expensive and less invasive fashion.

CLIA-readyClinically validated assaysUnprecedented high recovery of cell-free DNA from droplet volumes of blood translates into high sensitivityOpen platforms, Ion Torrent Proton for both mutation monitoring and profilingIntegrated workflow for consistent and reliable longitudinal studies

Clinical Challenges
Individualized cancer management for treating cancer patients with precision therapy is currently still challenged by the following limitations:
Tumor heterogeneity; Tumors are heterogeneous and exhibit continuously polyclonal expansion; in turn complicating diagnosis, treatment and the assessment of acquired resistance. Furthermore, tumor tissues are limited both spatially to the region biopsied and temporarily to the state of tumor at the time of biopsy.
Accessibility of tumor tissue; the majority of patients treated with targeted therapies ultimately develop resistance, metastasis or recurrence. Effective monitoring with several tumor samples is not clinically practical with current, invasive biopsy techniques. Most importantly, tumor tissue may not be available or has been exhausted due to multiple testings.


Unmet Needs in Liquid Biopsy and Circulogene’s Solution
Novel cell-free DNA enrichment method for high quantity and high quality starting materials:
Circulating, cell-free DNA is highly fragmented and presented at very low concentrations. This makes its isolation challenging due to the requirements of high-volume input, costs and labor intensity. Our proprietary cell-free DNA enrichment process possesses the novel characteristic of low input (as low as 50 uL of plasma) and high output (>300ng/mL) allowing ultra-high recovery and detection of tumor DNA directly from a droplet volume of unprocessed blood.
Advanced NGS technology for sensitive longitudinal mutation detection:
Detection of low-frequency mutations through periodic cell-free DNA analysis could predict tumor progression before the lesions are large enough to be detected by imaging. Analysis beyond a single mutation could also be warranted to capture tumor heterogeneity for effective treatment decision making. Liquid biopsies are not as spatially limited as tissue biopsies and can show a global spectrum of mutations that occur throughout tumor development in our body. The sensitivity of conventional analytical methods such as Sanger sequencing is not sufficient to detect low-frequency variants. Targeted deep sequencing by next-generation sequencing (NGS) provides a cost-effective alternative for high-throughput analysis of multiple mutations with high sensitivity.
Validated sample processing and analysis procedure in clinical practice:
The utility of cell-free DNA for clinical application demands the implementation of stringent pre-analytical validation of our laboratory-developed tests to ensure consistent quality data acquisition in our CLIA-certified laboratory.


Key Metrics

Regions Analyzed: Mutation hotspot regions of 50 cancer-associated genes
Sequencing Method: Ion Proton NGS
Assay Sensitivity: >1.0%
Target Sequencing Coverage: 5,000x
Turnaround Time: 5-7 days
Sample Requirements: Finger stick, blood/microcontainer, purple top EDTA 250-500 uL tube
Sample Types: Plasma or Serum
Sample Input Required: Droplet Volumes (50-500 uL)



Sample Collection
Large sample volume, low-yield and labor-intensiveness are the major barriers to the routine use of cell-free DNA-based testing in current clinical settings. Specifically, cell-free DNA recovery efficiency using the current standard silica membrane/bead method is extremely low due to unavoidable loss in steps such as binding, washing and elution. This in turn results in a minimum sample requirement of 5-10mL of blood.
While almost all liquid biopsy providers are working and perfecting their novel technologies to selectively enrich or amplify tumor-specific, cell-free DNA from a dominantly normal population, their starting materials are still those “incomplete” DNA molecules that survived after extraction/isolation. As a result, no matter how sensitive their technology is (downstream), they cannot detect cell-free DNA already lost during sample preparation (upstream). Further, there is uncertainty if even 10 mL of blood is enough.
In contrast, Circulogene Theranostics focuses on the first step in the cell-free DNA process, making sure we capture all of the cell-free DNA molecules existing in the original sample. Our breakthrough, proprietary method enables recovery of both necrotic and apoptotic cell-death-associated, cell-free DNA, with a high-yield, high-degree genomic representation and high sequencing quality.


Sample Quality and Quantity
Circulogene’s proprietary method provides a simple, streamlined, and robust workflow optimized for cell-free DNA enrichment/recovery from a droplet of plasma or serum as an alternative to low-quantity, poor quality DNA from challenging tissue biopsy samples. This sample preparation breakthrough enables multiple analyses on a droplet sample by a broad range of genomic platforms, including next-generation sequencing (NGS), microarrays, quantitative PCR (qPCR) and droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). Working with challenging and precious samples is no longer a barrier to personalized cancer therapy. Our technology allows us to work with a sample volume as small as 50 microliters, saving the remainder of your biobank for other clinical testing.
We compared the sensitivity of our proprietary cell-free DNA enrichment method to the standard DNA extraction kit used industry-wide today. Results demonstrated 100x more cell-free tumor DNA in the original sample using a single drop of blood.


Sensitivity and Accuracy
Circulogene’s cell-free DNA enrichment process is a complete solution for generations of high-yield, high-quality, well-represented tumor DNA from droplet amounts of plasma or serum. It is the first non-invasive method that allows accurate NGS genomic analyses directly from droplet volumes of blood. Our protocol can be applied to a broad range of clinical genetic tests with the advantages of minimal sample volume, maximal yield and streamlined workflow with reduced cost and turnaround time.


Automation
Circulogene’s automated solutions have been developed to streamline the complete next-generation sequencing workflow from sample-in to report-out. The simplicity and robustness of our automated process enables interfaces and cross-talks between a variety of platforms and laboratory information management systems. Using this simplified workflow, an automated workstation can easily process 96 or more samples at one time.

Circulogene Launches Liquid Biopsy Product Into Market 
Proprietary Finger-Stick Cancer Monitoring Technology Launches Circulogene Theranostics into Liquid Biopsy Market
Breakthrough, cell-free DNA testing method enables fast, accurate, personalized cancer monitoring and treatment guidance with a single blood drop
BIRMINGHAM, Ala., November 10, 2015 (BUSINESS WIRE)–Circulogene Theranostics has announced the commercial launch of its cell-free DNA (cfDNA) liquid biopsy products for the fast, accurate and personalized testing of 10 tumor types, including breast, lung and colon cancer. Circulogene becomes the first and only biotechnology company able to enrich circulating cfDNA from a single blood drop for patient-specific monitoring of cancer.
Cell-free DNA comes from tumor cells that break open and release small pieces of DNA into the bloodstream.
“As soon as a patient receives a positive diagnosis of cancer from his or her physician, our test provides a rapid and cost effective tool to aid the physician in planning, implementing and monitoring the treatment process,” said Circulogene CEO Mike Mullen. “Research has shown cancers change rapidly and shed tumor DNA into circulating blood. Our technology detects and monitors tumor changes in a very specific and sensitive way. This allows us to report to physicians in just days to aid them in selecting the right therapy for the right patient at the right time.”
The result is potentially the most precise, rapid and cost-effective monitoring and targeted treatment of cancer possible. Newly published clinical research demonstrates the company’s proprietary method can collect more than 100 times more cfDNA with just 1/10 of the blood (as little as 20 microliters) compared to the current industry standard for non-invasive liquid biopsy testing. Circulogene’s proprietary technology is capable of detecting nearly 3000 cancer mutations on 50 well-established cancer-associated genes for its 10 cancer profiles.
Non-invasive liquid biopsies represent a major advance over traditional surgical tumor biopsies, which are costly, time consuming and only sample a small portion of tumor tissue, leading to a high failure rate. However, current industry-standard liquid biopsy methods require large sample amounts and could miss critical tumor information that can significantly change a patient’s treatment and prognosis.
“Our science team is pioneering the next generation of liquid biopsy cancer management: tumor monitoring from droplet volumes of blood. No one else is doing that,” said Circulogene Chief Scientific Officer Chen-Hsiung Yeh. “Our proprietary DNA enrichment method results in near-full recovery of cfDNA with just 20 to 50 microliters of blood. No venipuncture is required, and when combined with next-generation genomic sequencing, we have an unprecedented laboratory diagnostic test platform for improving cancer management.”
In addition to providing the most accurate, actionable information, the company’s proprietary cfDNA enrichment method delivers highly cost-effective genetic results from a single drop of various body fluids, including blood, in as little as seven days instead of weeks or months. With this major technological advance, Mullen shares the industry’s belief that tumor genome sequencing of circulating cfDNA to manage cancer treatment can potentially become an important component of the standard of care.
“We’ve assembled a highly experienced and credentialed diagnostic team around a much-needed technology,” said Mullen. “Similar to how diabetics monitor glucose levels, our test can accurately identify established genetic tumor mutations, drug resistance and remission in diagnosed cancer patients using a simple finger stick and drops of blood. This allows oncologists to use current FDA-approved and NCCN/ASCO-endorsed treatment options to respond to these changes at a fraction of the cost of standard liquid biopsy testing.”
Circulogene will initially provide testing for the following cancers: breast, colorectal, lung, gastric, gastrointestinal stromal (GIST), hematological, melanoma, ovarian, pancreatic and thyroid. The company is currently partnering with researchers across the country to conduct further clinical trials at leading biotechnology research universities and exploring partnership opportunities.
Circulogene is Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certified, and it plans to expand research initiatives to independently demonstrate greatly increased sensitivity and specificity compared to current methods. For more information, visit our website, connect with us on LinkedIn, email us at info@circulogene.com or call 205-278-1600. Clinicians interested in ordering the test may visit the Contact page on Circulogene’s website.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

It's amazing what three letters can do.
Adding "Inc." or "LLC" to your business' name is more than a good look. It protects your personal assets, creates tax advantages, and much more.

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC

Tumor monitoring in a drop of blood
Precision medicine starts with a finger stick

Your genes, right now.
Circulogene’s “liquid biopsy” is based on the discovery that as tumors grow, they also die, releasing their DNA into the bloodstream. Circulogene’s liquid biopsy tumor DNA sequencing is the only test available that combines finger-stick volumes of blood and the most advanced next-generation sequencing (NGS) to monitor tumor-mutant DNA within well-characterized, well-documented, cancer-associated genes.
With a simple finger stick, Circulogene’s patented technology utilizes NGS to monitor known tumor mutations (approximately 3,000) in 50 established cancer-associated genes and further provides information on current FDA-approved treatment options.
Access
Droplet-volume input with maximal yield. A finger stick versus venipuncture means the access to patient’s blood is even less invasive.
Enrich
Patented enrichment technology locates and captures cell-free DNA, identifying and quantifying any tumor mutations for accurate reporting and monitoring.
Detect
Capable of testing 50 genes for approximately 3,000 possible mutations. Multimutation monitoring capabilities encompass a broad range of tumor profiles and allow for patient-centered precision medicine.
The Circulogene AdvantageNoninvasive Precision MedicineBecause our patented technique enriches the sample, Circulogene analysis only requires 50 microliters of blood from a finger stick, more convenient for health care professionals and patients.Accurate Identification of Tumor MutationsCirculogene’s tests analyze for the presence of cell-free DNA, identifying and quantifying any tumor mutations for accurate reporting and monitoring.Tumor Mutations Matched with TreatmentIn our personalized gene reports, Circulogene further provides information on current FDA-approved treatment options proven effective for the tumor DNA mutations identified.Track Responsiveness Frequently
The efficiency of Circulogene’s process empowers physicians to closely monitor tumor responsiveness and adjust treatment protocols. Turnaround time is five to seven days, much faster than tissue biopsy results and other liquid biopsies.
Tumor Burden and RecurrenceThe Circulogene process uses precise baseline data from which to measure cell turnover and progression.A Yield of 100x with 1/10 of the SampleWe compared the sensitivity of our proprietary cell-free DNA enrichment method to the standard DNA extraction kit used industry-wide today. Results demonstrated 100x more cell-free tumor DNA in the original sample using a single drop of blood.CLIA Certified: Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)
