Kennedy-Wilson Holdings Inc. (KW) Earns “Buy” Rating from BTIG Research


					Posted by Joanna Charbonneau on Jul 19th, 2017 // No Comments




Kennedy-Wilson Holdings Inc. (NYSE:KW)‘s stock had its “buy” rating reissued by research analysts at BTIG Research in a research report issued on Thursday, June 22nd. They currently have a $33.00 target price on the financial services provider’s stock. BTIG Research’s price target points to a potential upside of 68.80% from the company’s current price. 
The analysts wrote, “Examined; Conclusion: Attractive Buying Opportunity Shares of Kennedy Wilson Holdings (KW) have declined by more than 19% since the company on April 24 announced an agreement to buy Kennedy Wilson Europe (KWE, Not Rated) in an all-stock deal, and we have heard investors express their bafflement at the stock’s poor performance following what appeared to be a good deal for KW and its future prospects. Yet more investors have been confused by the stock’s continued weakness after KW countered a challenge to its initial offer by a prominent KWE shareholder by putting forth a revised deal in which it would provide cash and a special dividend as part of the total consideration while owning a higher percentage of KWE.””

Kennedy-Wilson Holdings Inc. (KW) Earns “Buy” Rating from BTIG Research


					Posted by Joanna Charbonneau on Jul 19th, 2017 // No Comments




Kennedy-Wilson Holdings Inc. (NYSE:KW)‘s stock had its “buy” rating reissued by research analysts at BTIG Research in a research report issued on Thursday, June 22nd. They currently have a $33.00 target price on the financial services provider’s stock. BTIG Research’s price target points to a potential upside of 68.80% from the company’s current price. 
The analysts wrote, “Examined; Conclusion: Attractive Buying Opportunity Shares of Kennedy Wilson Holdings (KW) have declined by more than 19% since the company on April 24 announced an agreement to buy Kennedy Wilson Europe (KWE, Not Rated) in an all-stock deal, and we have heard investors express their bafflement at the stock’s poor performance following what appeared to be a good deal for KW and its future prospects. Yet more investors have been confused by the stock’s continued weakness after KW countered a challenge to its initial offer by a prominent KWE shareholder by putting forth a revised deal in which it would provide cash and a special dividend as part of the total consideration while owning a higher percentage of KWE.””

Ski-in/ski-out is music to any snow-lovers ears. Cody House in Jackson Hole’s Teton Village has the magic capability for you to strap on your skis and be on the slopes within minutes. It’s a spacious 3,320-square foot condominium with stellar mountain views and the little extra touches that make it feel immediately like home.
After a day in below-zero temperatures, warm up beside the toasty fireplace with a cup of hot cocoa. The villa has Wi-Fi access, and a DVD player and television to ensure you can unwind in whichever way you please. Outside, a whirlpool spa complete with mountain views is the perfect place for an apres-ski glass of bubbly. There you’ll also find a barbecue, perfect for visiting Jackson Hole in the summer months and cooking up your favorite grilled goods.
The chalet’s decor is understated and elegant—classic pine wood furniture and antiques bring life to the space, while paintings of the vast American landscape decorate the wall. The kitchen was made with the active types in mind, just as much as those who are looking to spend special moments with their family. It’s equipped with all the necessities to make a quick meal before taking to the slopes, such as a toaster and coffee maker. The large centre island is likely to become the gathering spot for evening drinks and afternoon snacks.
Cody House’s four bedrooms comfortably accommodate up to eight guests. The master bedroom has a king size bed, en-suite bathroom with jetted tub and steam shower. The second bedroom has a queen size bed and its own en-suite bathroom. The second and third bedrooms, perfect for the kids, are equipped with two twin beds each, a bunk bed in one. The cozy bunk room bed is finished with a reading corner, TV and DVD player.
Jackson Hole is a playground for those who love active travel. In the summer months, canoe, kayak or explore the mountains with a rugged hike. In the winter, it’s a no brainer—get your skis and snowboard and brace yourself for an exhilarating day. Explore the village’s charming shops, upscale eateries and fun-loving bars.

Great experience!

Luxury Retreat staff was fantastic to work with and our condo was simply beautiful. We had a lot of special circumstances with this trip and Jeff and Michelle could not have been easier to work with or more helpful. We had our groceries all there when we arrived and Cody House is a truly special property that met all of our requirements and then some. It was a wonderful trip!

A fantastic condo with plenty of room and great location!

The condo was first class! The deck though was very small considering the size of the condo. We had a party of 6 and could only comfortably sit 4.

Have your private chef prepare dinner for you, then dine under the stars on your patio. Afterward, take a dip in your indoor pool, dry off in the sauna and get ready for yet another day of exploring the many mountainous wonders of Greater Aspen.Experience Greater AspenWhen you hear Aspen, the first thing that comes to mind is skiing.

Utah Villas & Vacation Rentals


Exploring UtahNature is at its most spectacular in the mountains around our luxury Utah villas, nestled in the famed ski resorts where Olympic glory was won just a few years ago. The wilds of this unique state are dramatic, with rocky red canyons and dense pine forests, but most people stay at Utah rental homes for the snow, which falls soft and thick. Visit Park City and dine and dance into the wee hours or settle back into sophisticated Deer Valley. Utah ski vacation rentals offer something for everyone, even in the summer, when the mountain is alive and kicking with hiking, biking and activities on the river.Experience Utah rentalsOffering the kind of first-rate service rarely seen on the slopes, Deer Valley ski resort is a new approach to luxury winter getaways. It is clearly doing something right – the park consistently ranks among the top resorts in North America, especially among those who prefer more sophisticated après-ski. Deer Valley rentals run the gamut in style and size, but all offer a comfortable, luxurious place to lay your head at the end of an activity-filled day.
