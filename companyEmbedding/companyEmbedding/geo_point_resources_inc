	FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS



	In this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, references to Geo Point Resources, the Registrant, the Company, we, us, our and words of similar import refer to Geo Point Resources, Inc., a Nevada corporation, unless the context requires otherwise.





	This Quarterly Report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act).  In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by the following words: anticipate, believe, continue, could, estimate, expect, intend, may, ongoing, plan, potential, predict, project, should, will, would, or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology, although not all forward-looking statements contain these words. Forward-looking statements are not a guarantee of future performance or results, and will not necessarily be accurate indications of the times at, or by, which such performance or results will be achieved. Forward-looking statements are based on information available at the time the statements are made and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from the information expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report. These factors include, among others:





	·


	our ability to raise capital;


	·


	our ability to identify suitable acquisition targets;


	·


	our ability to successfully execute acquisitions on favorable terms;


	·


	declines in general economic conditions in the markets where we may compete;


	·


	unknown environmental liabilities associated with any companies we may acquire; and


	·


	significant competition in the markets where we may operate.





	You should read any other cautionary statements made in this Quarterly Report as being applicable to all related forward-looking statements wherever they appear in this Quarterly Report. We cannot assure you that the forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report will prove to be accurate, and therefore, prospective investors are encouraged not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. You should read this Quarterly Report completely, and it should be considered in light of all other information contained in the reports or registration statement that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC), including all risk factors outlined therein. Other than as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements, even though our situation may change in the future.

	JUMPSTART OUR BUSINESS STARTUPS ACT DISCLOSURE



	We qualify as an emerging growth company, as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Securities Act by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the JOBS Act). An issuer qualifies as an emerging growth company if it has total annual gross revenues of less than $1.0 billion during its most recently completed fiscal year, and will continue to be deemed an emerging growth company until the earliest of:















	 




	




	the last day of the fiscal year of the issuer during which it had total annual gross revenues of $1.0 billion or more;


















	 




	




	the last day of the fiscal year of the issuer following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of common equity securities of the issuer pursuant to an effective registration statement;


















	 




	




	the date on which the issuer has, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt; or


















	 




	




	the date on which the issuer is deemed to be a large accelerated filer, as defined in Section 240.12b-2 of the Exchange Act.








	As an emerging growth company, we are exempt from various reporting requirements. Specifically, we are exempt from the following provisions:















	 




	




	Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which requires evaluations and reporting related to an issuers internal controls;


















	 




	




	Section 14A(a) of the Exchange Act, which requires an issuer to seek shareholder approval of the compensation of its executives not less frequently than once every three years; and


















	 




	




	Section 14A(b) of the Exchange Act, which requires an issuer to seek shareholder approval of its so-called golden parachute compensation, or compensation upon termination of an employees employment.








	Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies may delay adopting new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.

	NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	(unaudited)







	NOTE 1  ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS






	On June 13, 2012, the Board of Directors of Geo Point Technologies, Inc., a Utah corporation (Geo Point Utah), approved a stock dividend that resulted in a spin-off (Spin-Off) of Geo Point Resources, Inc. (the Company) common stock to the Geo Point Utah stockholders, pro rata, on the record date (the Record Date). Prior to the Spin-Off, the Company was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Geo Point Utah. The Company was incorporated on June 13, 2012, comprising all of Geo Point Utahs Environmental and Engineering Divisions assets, business, operations, rights or otherwise, along with its Hydrocarbon Identification Technology License Agreement with William C. Lachmar dated January 31, 2008.  The Spin-Off had a Record Date of January 17, 2013; an ex-dividend date of January 15, 2013; and a Spin-Off payment date of April 22, 2013.






	NOTE 2  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES







	Going Concern






	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As reflected in the financial statements, the Company has incurred significant current period losses, negative cash flows from operating activities, has negative working capital, an accumulated deficit, and a revolving line of credit from a third party in order to fund its operations. These conditions, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plans regarding these matters, if needed, include raising additional debt or equity financing. The terms of which might not be acceptable to the Company. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.






	Interim Financial Statements






	The accompanying unaudited interim financial statements have been prepared by the Company pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC).  The accompanying balance sheet as of December 31, 2016, and the statements of operations and cash flows for the nine months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, are unaudited. The unaudited interim financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the annual financial statements and, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the Companys financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for such periods.  The financial data and other information disclosed in these notes to the financial statements related to the three and nine month periods are unaudited.  The results of the nine months ended December 31, 2016, are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending March 31, 2017, any other interim period, or any other future year.






	Use of Estimates






	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the accompanying notes to financial statements.  Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates made by management include allowance for doubtful accounts and the useful life of property and equipment.






	Fair Value of Financial Instruments






	The Company complies with the accounting guidance under Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 820-10,

	Fair Value Measurements,

	as well as certain related FASB staff positions.  This guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact business and considers assumptions that marketplace participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions, and risk of nonperformance.









	F-5







	The guidance also establishes a fair value hierarchy for measurements of fair value as follows:






	



	Level 1 


	quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.






	



	Level 2 


	inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.  






	



	Level 3 


	unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.  





	As of December 31, 2016 and March 31, 2016, the Company did not have Level 1, 2, or 3 financial assets or liabilities. Financial instruments consist of cash, accounts receivable, payables, and a line of credit.  The fair value of financial instruments approximated their carrying values as of December 31, 2016 and March 31, 2016, due to the short-term nature of these items.






	Concentration of Credit Risks and Customer Concentrations






	During the nine months ended December 31, 2016, services provided to two customers accounted for 81.9% (related party) and 11.2% of total revenues.  During the nine months ended December 31, 2015, services provided to two customers accounted for 46.7% and 38.5% of total revenues.  One of these customers is considered a related party, see Note 6. Management believes the loss of these customers would have a material impact on the Company.






	Revenue Recognition






	The Company recognizes revenue when it is realized and earned.  The Company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when: (1) it has persuasive evidence of an arrangement; (2) services have been rendered and are invoiced; (3) the price is fixed or determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured.





	The Companys primary source of revenue has been in its environmental division, providing historical site data searches, preliminary investigation and drilling, site characterization modeling, regulatory agency liaison, and full environmental clean-ups using such methods as vapor extraction, air sparging, bio-remediation, ORC (Oxygen Release Compound) and HRC (Hydrogen Release Compound) injection treatment, air stripping, and ionic exchange.  Revenues from providing historical site data searches, preliminary investigation and drilling, site characterization modeling, regulatory agency liaison, and full environmental clean-ups using such methods as vapor extraction, air sparging, bio-remediation, ORC (Oxygen Release Compound) and HRC (Hydrogen Release Compound) injection treatment, air stripping, and ionic exchange are recognized after services have been performed.  The Company also has operations associated with the oil and gas segment that have limited activity and have not yet generated revenues.  All revenues are reported inclusive of shipping and handling costs billed and exclusive of any taxes billed to customers, if any.  Shipping and handling costs incurred, if any, are reported in cost of products sold.





	See Note 6 for revenue transactions with a related party.






	Basic and Diluted (Income) Loss per Common Share






	Basic income (loss) per common share is calculated by dividing net loss by the weighted average common shares outstanding during the period.  Diluted income (loss) per common share reflects the potential dilution to basic earnings per share that could occur upon conversion or exercise of securities, options, or other such items to common shares using the treasury stock method, based upon the weighted average fair value of the Companys common shares during the period. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company did not have any dilutive securities.












	F-6








	NOTE 3  FINANCIAL STATEMENT ELEMENTS







	Loans Receivable  Construction Project






	In July 2015, the Company loaned $75,000 to an unrelated third party. The loan does not incur interest and is due on demand. The loan is intended to be a short term loan used for a construction project by the borrower.





	On November 9, 2015, the Company loaned $100,000 to an unrelated third party.  The loan incurs interest at 2% per annum and is due upon the earlier of October 31, 2018, or completion by the borrower of one or more projects having an aggregate value of not less than $40 million. The loan is intended to be a short term bridge loan used for working capital for the third party.








	Property and Equipment






	Property and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation, and are comprised of the following at December 31, 2016 and March 31, 2016:

	$   4,075









	Depreciation expense for the nine months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, was $3,500 and $750, respectively.






	NOTE 4  LINE OF CREDIT AND SHORT TERM ADVANCES







	On January 1, 2013, the Company entered into a $100,000 revolving line of credit with a third party.  Under the terms of the agreement the outstanding principal incurs interest at 24% per annum with principal and interest due nine months from the date of the agreement or July 1, 2013.  The revolving line of credit is unsecured and currently in default; however, no demands for repayment have been made. Subsequent to the agreement date, the third party has continued to advance additional funds as needed under the same terms of the initial revolving line of credit.  Proceeds from the revolving line of credit were used for operations.  As of December 31, 2016, the revolving line of credit had a principal and an accrued interest balance of $260,260 and $155,321, respectively. As of March 31, 2016, the revolving line of credit had a principal and an accrued interest balance of $222,160 and $111,478, respectively.





	During the nine months ended December 31, 2016, two individuals advanced the Company a total of $40,000. The advances do not incur interest and are due on demand.  The proceeds were used to purchase drilling equipment which was used on one of the Company's jobs.






	NOTE 5  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES






	In November 2013, the Company was notified from a group insurance policy that projects in which the Company previously provided services to was in litigation due to defects within the projects. The group policy claimed that the Company owed $75,000 in deductibles in connection with this litigation.  The Company maintained that they were not involved with the areas in which the suit is being bought, and did not op for the group insurance and thus are not liable for any of the deductible amounts. However, in March 2015, the Company agreed to settle the claim for $5,000, in which was paid immediately and included within general and administrative expenses during the year ended March 31, 2015.






	NOTE 6 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTION






	During the nine months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded revenues of $174,809 and $0 for services performed for an entity partially owned by the Companys Chief Executive Officer, respectively. The Company performs engineering services for the related entity and bills its services based upon time and expenses incurred. The Companys management maintains that the fees charged to the related party are no less favorable than would be charged to unrelated parties for similar services.

	Item 2. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.







	Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements






	This Quarterly Report includes forward-looking statements based on managements beliefs, assumptions and plans for the future, information currently available to management and other statements that are not historical in nature.  Forward-looking statements include statements in which words such as expect, anticipate, intend, plan, believe, estimate, consider, or similar expressions are used.  These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including among others: a general economic downturn; a downturn in the securities markets; regulations that affect trading in the securities of penny stocks; the enactment of United States or foreign laws, rules and regulations that could have a materially adverse impact on current and intended operations; and other risks and uncertainties.  For additional forward-looking statement information, see the heading Forward-Looking Statements at the forepart of this Quarterly Report on page 3.





	Our future results and stockholder values may differ materially from those expressed in these forward-looking statements. Many of the factors that will determine these results and values are beyond our ability to control or predict.  We may be required to update these forward-looking statements from time to time as circumstances change.  





	References to we, our or us and words of similar import under this heading refer to Geo Point Nevada, unless the context implies otherwise.






	Plan of Operation






	Our business is primarily comprised of services related to identifying any recognized environmental condition (REC) or the lack thereof as provided by the federal, state or local governmental agencies in any real property of any owner, potential owner or lender, governmental agency or other person that may have a concern or may have or be seeking an interest in the subject property.  Once our services are engaged, we contract with a drilling company to drill into the ground locations selected by us to collect a physical soil sample; if the project is small and can be handled by our smaller drilling equipment, this service is not contracted out.  Once the soil sample is obtained, it is submitted to a State of California certified laboratory for analysis of the existence of hazardous materials.  Based upon the laboratorys analysis, William C. Lachmar, our President, who is a Licensed Professional Geologist in Texas and California, prepares a written report that is sanctioned by the particular laboratory that conducted the analysis. Mr. Lachmars licensing as a Professional Geologist is a requirement to prepare any such report.  If an REC is identified to exist, then we will provide project management and engineering conclusions and recommendations necessary to remediate the property and bring it back into regulatory compliance based upon the California tables of acceptable levels of product contamination.  Acceptable levels are further qualified based upon residential, commercial and industrial zoned properties, with the residential levels being the most stringent.  Examples of contaminations that result in concern include those that are inadvertently or otherwise inoculated into the shallow subsurface soils or groundwater, like gasoline, diesel fuel, dry cleaning fluid, rocket fuel, arsenic, mercury, lead and other toxic substances.  These services are basically the same in each project: examine the property; drill or have it drilled for soil samples; submit the soil samples to a State of California certified laboratory; prepare a report on the soil samples; and if an REC is found to exist, provide the described services, directly or through subcontractors, by or under the supervision of Mr. Lachmar.  Sometimes, we merely assess the environmental impact of any hazardous materials found and prepare the requested report.  





	We have provided consulting and compliance services for new utility installation and general site erosion control for housing tracts and updating service station underground storage tanks and fuel dispensing systems to comply with continually changing California Air Resources Board (CARB) regulations.  Other engineering services provided are for soil dewatering for underground structure installations and small demolition and construction work.  These utility landing services comprise subsurface trench work where underground utilities are installed such as electrical, fiber optic, water and gas.  The other engineering services are for gasoline service stations where updated monitoring equipment must be installed or the monitoring equipment shows an error code that needs to be corrected before the gas station can begin to pump gas again; or where more crash posts must be installed around a propane tank, other fuel or similar dispenser island or a like setting.  Other engineering services are to plan and construct dewatering systems for the install of subsurface structures such as underground parking lots, underground storage tanks, etc. that are placed within a shallow groundwater zone and must be dewatered prior to construction, and closure of underground water treatment systems where a manufacturing plant has underground processed water systems that treat their production waste water streams prior to discharge to the common sewer system.  Light construction work consists of tenant improvement build-outs and small

	During the three months ended December 31, 2016, we had sales of $86,662, compared to $77,972 for the three months ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $8,690.  Cost of sales for the three months ended December 31, 2016, was $28,241, compared to $40,981 for the three months ended December 31, 2015, a decrease of $6,690.  Cost of sales decreased during the three months ended December 31, 2016, due to most of our services being primarily performed by our chief executive officer. The gross profit percentage increased during the period due to lack of additional costs incurred for contract work paid to third parties for their assistance, and in the previous period, this assistance was needed.  In addition, during fiscal 2016, 81% of our sales were generated from a related party entity whereby a limited amount was generated in the prior comparable period. We have seen an increase in the need for our services due to increased activity in the construction industry in Southern California.  However, we are continuing to see significant pressure on fees within our industry due to competition.





	General and administrative expenses during the three months ended December 31, 2016, were $28,241, compared to $40,981, during the three months ended December 31, 2015, a decrease of $12,740.  The decrease in general and administrative expenses during the three months ended December 31, 2016, was directly related to additional compensation paid in the prior comparable period paid to our Chief Executive Officer.






	Nine months Ended December 31, 2016, Compared to the Nine months Ended December 31, 2015






	During the nine months ended December 31, 2016, we had sales of $215,241, compared to $133,391 for the nine months ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $81,850.  Cost of sales for the nine months ended December 31, 2016, was $65,970, compared to $29,702 for the nine months ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $36,268.  Cost of sales increased during the nine months ended December 31, 2016, due primarily to an increase in revenues. The gross profit percentage decreased during the current year due to additional costs incurred for contract work paid to third parties for their assistance, and in the previous period, this assistance was not needed.  In addition, during nine months ended December 31, 2016, 81% of our sales were generated from a related party entity whereby 47% of our sales were generated by this related party for the nine months ended December 31, 2015. We have seen an increase in the need for our services due to increased activity in the construction industry in Southern California.  However, we are continuing to see significant pressure on fees within our industry due to competition.





	General and administrative expenses during the nine months ended December 31, 2016, were $151,963, compared to $111,323, during the nine months ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $40,640.  The increase in general and administrative expenses during the nine months ended December 31, 2016, was directly related to additional compensation of $25,500 paid to our Chief Executive Officer in the second quarter and the additional costs related to an additional administrative position.






	Liquidity






	Current assets at December 31, 2016, included cash of $44,500.  At December 31, 2016, we had a negative working capital of $431,315, as compared a negative working capital of $396,702 at March 31, 2016.  The negative working capital at December 31, 2016, is a result of the historical net losses incurred by the Company, as revenues, at times, are still not sufficient to cover our minimum operating costs.






	Capital Resources






	During the nine months ended December 31, 2016, operating activities used cash of $986 compared to $9,632 net cash used in the nine months ended December 31, 2015, a decrease of $8,646. The decrease was primary related to the current period net income due to having better operational results than the comparable period. We funded operations during the nine months ended December 31, 2016, primarily through operations, the use of cash on hand and proceeds from a line of credit.









	13











	During the nine months ended December 31, 2016, we used cash in investing activities of $64,980 due to the purchase of drilling equipment and vehicles to be used in our operations. During the nine months ended December 31, 2015, we used cash in investing activities of $177,505 of which $175,000 related to a loan to a third party.





	During the nine months ended December 31, 2016, we received cash from financing activities of $78,100 from proceeds on a line of credit of $38,100 and $40,000 advanced from two third parties which was used to purchase the equipment discussed in investing activities. $40,600 was provided by the line of credit for the nine months ended December 31, 2015.





	We intend to fund future operations for the next 12 months through cash flows generated from operations and current cash on hand.  These contributions are expected to satisfy amounts in accounts payable and potentially be used for operations. If these cash flows are not sufficient to fund operations, we may be required to raise capital through either a debt or equity financing.  Currently, we cannot provide assurance that such financing will be available to us on favorable terms, or at all.  If, after utilizing the existing sources of capital available to us, further capital needs are identified and if we are not successful in obtaining the required financing, we may be forced to curtail our existing or planned future operations.  We believe our plans will enable us to continue our current operations for in excess of one year from the date of financial statements contained in this Quarterly Report.






	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements






	We had no off balance sheet arrangements during the quarter ended December 31, 2016.










	Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.






	Not required.









	Item 4.  Controls and Procedures.







	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures






	Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.  In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.  The design of any disclosure controls and procedures also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.





	Based on that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective, and provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules, regulations and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.






	Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting






	Our management, with the participation of the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, has concluded there were no significant changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS

In this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, references to “Geo Point
Resources,” the “Registrant,” the
“Company,” “we,” “us,”
“our” and words of similar import refer to Geo Point
Resources, Inc., a Nevada corporation, unless the context requires
otherwise.

 

This
Quarterly Report contains forward-looking statements within the
meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the “Securities Act”), and Section 21E of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange
Act”).  In some cases, you can identify forward-looking
statements by the following words: “anticipate,”
“believe,” “continue,” “could,”
“estimate,” “expect,” “intend,”
“may,” “ongoing,” “plan,”
“potential,” “predict,”
“project,” “should,” “will,”
“would,” or the negative of these terms or other
comparable terminology, although not all forward-looking statements
contain these words. Forward-looking statements are not a guarantee
of future performance or results, and will not necessarily be
accurate indications of the times at, or by, which such performance
or results will be achieved. Forward-looking statements are based
on information available at the time the statements are made and
involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors
that may cause our results, levels of activity, performance or
achievements to be materially different from the information
expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements in this
Quarterly Report. These factors include, among others:

 

·

our
ability to raise capital;

·

our
ability to identify suitable acquisition targets;

·

our
ability to successfully execute acquisitions on favorable
terms;

·

declines
in general economic conditions in the markets where we may
compete;

·

unknown
environmental liabilities associated with any companies we may
acquire; and

·

significant
competition in the markets where we may operate.

 

You
should read any other cautionary statements made in this Quarterly
Report as being applicable to all related forward-looking
statements wherever they appear in this Quarterly Report. We cannot
assure you that the forward-looking statements in this Quarterly
Report will prove to be accurate, and therefore, prospective
investors are encouraged not to place undue reliance on
forward-looking statements. You should read this Quarterly Report
completely, and it should be considered in light of all other
information contained in the reports or registration statement that
we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
“SEC”), including all risk factors outlined therein.
Other than as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update
or revise these forward-looking statements, even though our
situation may change in the future.

JUMPSTART
OUR BUSINESS STARTUPS ACT DISCLOSURE

We
qualify as an “emerging growth company,” as defined in
Section 2(a)(19) of the Securities Act by the Jumpstart Our
Business Startups Act (the “JOBS Act”). An issuer
qualifies as an “emerging growth company” if it has
total annual gross revenues of less than $1.0 billion during its
most recently completed fiscal year, and will continue to be deemed
an emerging growth company until the earliest of:

 




 



 



 





 



•



the last
day of the fiscal year of the issuer during which it had total
annual gross revenues of $1.0 billion or more;




 




 



 



 





 



•



the last
day of the fiscal year of the issuer following the fifth
anniversary of the date of the first sale of common equity
securities of the issuer pursuant to an effective registration
statement;




 




 



 



 





 



•



the date
on which the issuer has, during the previous three-year period,
issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt;
or




 




 



 



 





 



•



the date
on which the issuer is deemed to be a “large accelerated
filer,” as defined in Section 240.12b-2 of the Exchange
Act.




 

As an
emerging growth company, we are exempt from various reporting
requirements. Specifically, we are exempt from the following
provisions:

 




 



 



 





 



•



Section
404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which requires
evaluations and reporting related to an issuer’s internal
controls;




 




 



 



 





 



•



Section
14A(a) of the Exchange Act, which requires an issuer to seek
shareholder approval of the compensation of its executives not less
frequently than once every three years; and




 




 



 



 





 



•



Section
14A(b) of the Exchange Act, which requires an issuer to seek
shareholder approval of its so-called “golden
parachute” compensation, or compensation upon termination of
an employee’s employment.




 

Under the
JOBS Act, emerging growth companies may delay adopting new or
revised accounting standards that have different effective dates
for public and private companies until such time as those standards
apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to
avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting
standards and, therefore, will be subject to the same new or
revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not
emerging growth companies.

NOTES TO
THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(unaudited)

 

NOTE 1
– ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS

 

On June
13, 2012, the Board of Directors of Geo Point Technologies, Inc., a
Utah corporation (“Geo Point Utah”), approved a stock
dividend that resulted in a spin-off (“Spin-Off”) of
Geo Point Resources, Inc. (the “Company”) common stock
to the Geo Point Utah stockholders, pro rata, on the record
date (the “Record Date”). Prior to the
Spin-Off, the Company was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Geo Point
Utah. The Company was incorporated on June 13, 2012, comprising all
of Geo Point Utah’s Environmental and Engineering
Divisions’ assets, business, operations, rights or otherwise,
along with its “Hydrocarbon Identification Technology”
License Agreement with William C. Lachmar dated January 31,
2008.  The Spin-Off had a “Record Date” of January
17, 2013; an ex-dividend date of January 15, 2013; and a
Spin-Off payment date of April 22, 2013.

 

NOTE 2
– SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

 

Going
Concern

 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that
the Company will continue as a going concern. As reflected in the
financial statements, the Company has incurred significant current
period losses, negative cash flows from operating activities, has
negative working capital, an accumulated deficit, and a revolving
line of credit from a third party in order to fund its operations.
These conditions, among others, raise substantial doubt about the
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Management’s plans regarding these matters, if needed,
include raising additional debt or equity financing. The terms of
which might not be acceptable to the Company. The accompanying
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might
result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

 

Interim
Financial Statements

 

The
accompanying unaudited interim financial statements have been
prepared by the Company pursuant to the rules and regulations of
the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).
 The accompanying balance sheet as of September 30, 2016, and
the statements of operations and cash flows for the six months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, are unaudited. The unaudited
interim financial statements have been prepared on the same basis
as the annual financial statements and, in the opinion of
management, reflect all adjustments, which include only normal
recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the
Company’s financial position, results of operations, and cash
flows for such periods.  The financial data and other
information disclosed in these notes to the financial statements
related to the three and six month periods are unaudited. The
results of the six months ended September 30, 2016, are not
necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year
ending March 31, 2017, any other interim period, or any other
future year.

 

Use of
Estimates

 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the amounts reported in the financial statements and the
accompanying notes to financial statements.  Actual results
could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates made by
management include allowance for doubtful accounts and the useful
life of property and equipment.

 

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments

 

The
Company complies with the accounting guidance under Financial
Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting
Standards Codification (“ASC”) 820-10, Fair Value
Measurements, as well as certain related FASB staff positions.
 This guidance defines fair value as the price that would be
received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in
an orderly transaction between market participants at the
measurement date.  When determining the fair value
measurements for assets and liabilities required to be recorded at
fair value, the Company considers the principal or most
advantageous market in which it would transact business and
considers assumptions that marketplace participants would use when
pricing the asset or liability, such as inherent risk, transfer
restrictions, and risk of nonperformance.

 




F-5

 

  

The
guidance also establishes a fair value hierarchy for measurements
of fair value as follows:

 

•

Level 1
–

quoted
market prices in active markets for identical assets or
liabilities.

 

•

Level 2
–

inputs
other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or
indirectly, such as quoted prices in active markets for similar
assets or liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar
assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other
inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable
market data for substantially the full term of the assets or
liabilities.  

 

•

Level 3
–

unobservable
inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that
are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
 

 

As of
September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, the Company did not have
Level 1, 2, or 3 financial assets or liabilities. Financial
instruments consist of cash, accounts receivable, payables, and a
line of credit.  The fair value of financial instruments
approximated their carrying values as of September 30, 2016 and
March 31, 2016, due to the short-term nature of these
items.

 

Concentration
of Credit Risks and Customer Concentrations

 

During
the six months ended September 30, 2016, services provided to two
customers accounted for 80.7% (related party) and 12.4% of total
revenues.  During the six months ended September 30, 2015,
services provided to two customers accounted for 64.3% and 18.7% of
total revenues.  One of these customers is considered a
related party, see Note 6. Management believes the loss of these
customers would have a material impact on the Company.

 

Revenue
Recognition

 

The
Company recognizes revenue when it is realized and earned.
 The Company considers revenue realized or realizable and
earned when: (1) it has persuasive evidence of an arrangement; (2)
services have been rendered and are invoiced; (3) the price is
fixed or determinable; and (4) collectibility is reasonably
assured.

 

The
Company’s primary source of revenue has been in its
environmental division, providing historical site data searches,
preliminary investigation and drilling, site characterization
modeling, regulatory agency liaison, and full environmental
clean-ups using such methods as vapor extraction, air sparging,
bio-remediation, ORC (Oxygen Release Compound) and HRC (Hydrogen
Release Compound) injection treatment, air stripping, and ionic
exchange.  Revenues from providing historical site data
searches, preliminary investigation and drilling, site
characterization modeling, regulatory agency liaison, and full
environmental clean-ups using such methods as vapor extraction, air
sparging, bio-remediation, ORC (Oxygen Release Compound) and HRC
(Hydrogen Release Compound) injection treatment, air stripping, and
ionic exchange are recognized after services have been performed.
 The Company also has operations associated with the oil and
gas segment that have limited activity and have not yet generated
revenues.  All revenues are reported inclusive of shipping and
handling costs billed and exclusive of any taxes billed to
customers, if any.  Shipping and handling costs incurred,
if any, are reported in cost of products sold.

 

See Note
6 for revenue transactions with a related party.

 

Basic and
Diluted (Income) Loss per Common Share

 

Basic
income (loss) per common share is calculated by dividing net loss
by the weighted average common shares outstanding during the
period.  Diluted income (loss) per common share reflects the
potential dilution to basic earnings per share that could occur
upon conversion or exercise of securities, options, or other such
items to common shares using the treasury stock method, based upon
the weighted average fair value of the Company’s common
shares during the period. As of September 30, 2016 and 2015, the
Company did not have any dilutive securities.

ITEM 1.
 BUSINESS

 

Business
Development

 

On
February 24, 2015, we filed a Form 8-A Registration Statement with
the SEC, and we are now required to file reports under Section 13
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
“Exchange Act”); and our directors, officers, 10% and
5% shareholders are required to file beneficial ownership reports
with the SEC on applicable Forms.

 

Introduction

 

On June
13, 2012, we were formed as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Geo Point
Technologies, Inc., a Utah corporation (“Geo Point
Utah”), and into which Geo Point Utah simultaneously
authorized the conveyance of the segment of its business comprising
all of its Environmental and Engineering Divisions’ assets,
business, operations, rights or otherwise, along with its
“Hydrocarbon Identification Technology” (“HI
Technology”) License Agreement dated January 31, 2008 (the
“License Agreement”), subject to the assumption by us
of all related liabilities and the indemnification of Geo Point
Utah by us from any liabilities relating to these assets and
operations.  Also on June 13, 2012, the Board of Directors of
Geo Point Utah approved a stock dividend that resulted in a
spin-off of all of our shares of common stock to the Geo Point Utah
stockholders, pro rata, on a one share for one share basis, on the
record date (the “Spin-Off”).  The Spin-Off had a
record date of January 17, 2013; and ex-dividend date of January
15, 2013; and a Spin-Off payment date of April 22, 2013.  On
the effective date of the Spin-Off, there were approximately
1,002,167 outstanding shares of our common stock.  For
additional information about the Spin-Off, see our Prospectus dated
January 7, 2013, and filed with the SEC on January 8, 2013; and our
8-K Current Report dated April 22, 2013, and filed with the SEC on
such date.  See Part IV, Item 15.  

 

The
Environmental and Engineering Divisions comprised the initial
operations of Geo Point Utah at its inception and were commenced as
a “DBA” in 1997, by Geo Point Utah’s founder,
William C. Lachmar, our President and sole director, in the State
of California, where these business operations are presently
conducted by us.  

 

Business

 

Our
business is primarily comprised of services related to identifying
any recognized environmental condition (“REC”) or the
lack thereof as provided by the federal, state or local
governmental agencies in any real property of




3

 

 

  

any owner,
potential owner or lender, governmental agency or other person that
may have a concern or may have or be seeking an interest in the
subject property.  Once our services are engaged, we contract
with a drilling company to drill into the ground locations selected
by us to collect a physical soil sample; if the project is small
and can be handled by our smaller drilling equipment, this service
is not contracted out.  Once the soil sample is obtained, it
is submitted to a State of California certified laboratory for
analysis of the existence of hazardous materials.  Based upon
the laboratory’s analysis, William C. Lachmar, our President,
who is a Licensed Professional Geologist in Texas and California,
prepares a written report that is sanctioned by the particular
laboratory that conducted the analysis. Mr. Lachmar’s
licensing as a “Professional Geologist” is a
requirement to prepare any such report.  If an REC is
identified to exist, then we will provide project management and
engineering conclusions and recommendations necessary to remediate
the property and bring it back into regulatory compliance based
upon the California tables of acceptable levels of product
contamination.  Acceptable levels are further qualified based
upon residential, commercial and industrial zoned properties, with
the residential levels being the most stringent.  Examples of
contaminations that result in concern include those that are
inadvertently or otherwise inoculated into the shallow subsurface
soils or groundwater, like gasoline, diesel fuel, dry cleaning
fluid, rocket fuel, arsenic, mercury, lead and other toxic
substances.  These services are basically the same in each
project: examine the property; drill or have it drilled for soil
samples; submit the soil samples to a State of California certified
laboratory; prepare a report on the soil samples; and if an REC is
found to exist, provide the described services, directly or through
subcontractors, by or under the supervision of Mr. Lachmar.
 Sometimes, we merely assess the environmental impact of any
hazardous materials found and prepare the requested report.
 

 

We have
provided consulting and compliance services for new utility
installation and general site erosion control for housing tracts
and updating service station underground storage tanks and fuel
dispensing systems to comply with continually changing California
Air Resources Board (“CARB”) regulations.  Other
engineering services provided are for soil dewatering for
underground structure installations and small demolition and
construction work.  These “utility landing”
services comprise subsurface trench work where underground
utilities are installed such as electrical, fiber optic, water and
gas.  The other engineering services are for gasoline service
stations where updated monitoring equipment must be installed or
the monitoring equipment shows an error code that needs to be
corrected before the gas station can begin to pump gas again; or
where more crash posts must be installed around a propane tank,
other fuel or similar dispenser island or a like setting.
 Other engineering services are to plan and construct
dewatering systems for the install of subsurface structures such as
underground parking lots, underground storage tanks, etc. that are
placed within a shallow groundwater zone and must be dewatered
prior to construction, and “closure” of underground
water treatment systems where a manufacturing plant has underground
processed water systems that treat their production waste water
streams prior to discharge to the common sewer system.  Light
construction work consists of tenant improvement build-outs and
small American Disabilities Act (ADA), compliance issues such as
wheelchair access ramp construction, hand rail design and
installation, parking area upgrades and other related
matters.

 

In
addition to these business operations,  we have been
attempting to fund additional research of the HI Technology (as
defined below), without success to date.

Distribution
Methods of the Products or Services

 

We do not
advertise our services in any publications, and we rely primarily
on past customers for repeat business, including large property
management companies, wholesale fuel distributors and automobile
dealers, among others, for referrals.   Most of our
referrals come from two long standing clients; or three major
commercial real estate management companies in California; or two
health specialists to whom we pay commissions for
referrals.

 

Typically,
a client contacts us about an environmental related issue on a
particular parcel of real property.  The client could be the
property owner or lender, seeking information on whether there is
an adverse environmental issue related to the real property, and if
so, how it can be remediated; or a prospective purchaser of the
particular parcel of real property or a governmental agency,
seeking similar information.  We receive contacts on
properties that have known contamination and those desiring to
determine if there is any contamination.  If engaged, we
develop an environmentally sound investigation to be conducted
under our direction as a HAZ-MAT (a toxic material that is
radioactive, flammable, explosive or poisonous, among others, that
would be a danger to life or to the environment if released without
the necessary precautions) specialist contractor with a Licensed
Professional Geologist on staff, like our President, William C.
Lachmar.  Once the investigational strategy is developed, and
we are engaged, necessary soil samples are taken and submitted by
us to a California Certified Environmental Laboratory.

 

All field
work that requires a drill rig is subcontracted, though some drill
work can be hand drilled through the use of a rotor hammer, which
is operated by Mr. Lachmar.

 

All
chemicals required for our services are supplied by subcontractors
and are readily available; we do not store any regulated chemicals
or waste at our facilities; nor do we manufacture any such
products.

 

We have
no real suppliers of products other than some environmental hand
held equipment that is competitively marketed by numerous
distributors, and there is little chance that any equipment that is
necessary to conduct our environmental services would not be
available to rent or purchase.

 

Status of
any Publicly Announced New Product or Service

 

We have
not had any recent public announcement of any new product or
service.

 

Competitive
Business Conditions and Smaller Reporting

Company’s
Competitive Position in the Industry and Methods of
Competition

 

Our
competitors include mostly large and well funded entities whose
businesses and subsidiaries focus solely on the industries in which
we operate.  In this respect, we are at a distinct
disadvantage to these competitors.  Our services may be
limited to smaller projects by reason of our limited financial
resources and staff.  We believe our competitive position in
this industry as a whole is not presently significant.

 

We also
believe our fees for these services are usually lower than what the
larger companies in this industry charge for similar services
because of our lower overhead costs; and our lower costs for
professional oversight, which is provided by our President, Mr.
Lachmar.  With just one employee, who overseas our projects,
the number of projects we can handle at one time is limited, based
upon oversight requirements.

 

Our
principal competitors are AECOM Technology Corporation, URS,
Kleinfelter, Levine Fricke, CH2M Hill Companies, Ltd., The Reynolds
Group and Geosyntec, most all of which are larger, well financed
multinational publicly-held companies or are divisions or
subsidiaries of large, well financed multinational
companies.

Seasonal
Nature of Our Business

 

The
second quarter of our fiscal year (July 1 to September 30) is
typically our strongest quarter. The U.S. federal government has
historically authorized more work during the period preceding the
end of its fiscal year, September 30. In addition, many U.S.
state governments with fiscal years ending on June 30 have
historically accelerated spending during the fiscal first quarter
when new funding budgets become available.  There is no
assurance that this trend will continue.

 

Insurance
and Risk Management

 

Risk
management is an integral part of our project management approach
and our project execution process.  We maintain insurance
covering professional liability and claims involving bodily injury
and property damage, with a maximum of $1,000,000 per occurrence
and $2,000,000 in the aggregate. We consider our present limits of
coverage, deductibles and reserves to be more than adequate for our
present business operations, based upon our assessment of the small
number (one claim during the past two fiscal years and to the date
hereof) of past claims made against us; this particular claim was
resolved for approximately $2,800.  Wherever possible, we
endeavor to eliminate or reduce the risk of loss on a project
through the use of quality assurance/control, risk management,
workplace safety and similar methods.  Our subcontractors are
also all required to maintain adequate insurance on our
projects.

Dependence
on One or a Few Major Customers

 

During
the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, services provided to two
customers accounted for 42.8% and 42.0% of total revenues.
 One of these customers, which represented 42.0%, is a related
party (see Note 7 of our audited financial statements that
accompany this Annual Report for additional information, in Part
II, Item 8, below).  During the fiscal year ended March 31,
2015, services provided to three customers accounted for 40.7%,
36.3% and 18.1%. One of these customers, which represented 40.7%,
is a related party (see Note 7 of our audited financial statements
that accompany this Annual Report for additional information, in
Part II, Item 8, below). Management believes the loss of these
customers would have a material adverse impact on the
Company.

 

Patents,
Trademarks, Licenses, Franchises, Concessions,

Royalty
Agreements or Labor Contracts, including Duration

 

We are a
California General Engineering, Construction and Hazardous
Materials consulting company.

 

We do not
hold any patents; however, we have proprietary technology
applications related to our hydrocarbon- indicating methods and
technology (the “HI Technology”), which was developed
and licensed by Mr. Lachmar to our predecessor parent, Geo Point
Utah, and assigned to us on our formation on June 13,
2012.

 

The
material terms of the License Agreement are as follows:

 

Mr.
Lachmar granted to us an exclusive, world-wide license to use the
HI Technology for commercial exploitation, including subleasing the
HI Technology to other parties.  

 

The
intellectual property associated with the HI Technology, as well as
any additional related intellectual property developed by Mr.
Lachmar, is included within the scope of the license.
 Currently, the intellectual property is maintained as trade
secrets and protected by the confidentiality provisions of the
License Agreement; however, any patents, trademarks or copyrights
or applications therefor, related to the HI Technology, will also
be included within the scope of the License Agreement.
 

 

Upon
execution of the License Agreement, Geo Point Utah, the original
licensee under the License Agreement, paid Mr. Lachmar a one-time
license fee of $125,000.  Except as otherwise provided therein
and as discussed below, the License Agreement is
irrevocable.

 

Mr.
Lachmar retained the right to exploit the Hi Technology and
processes.

The
License Agreement may be terminated by either party, subject to a
60-day notice period, upon a breach of the License Agreement that
remains uncured during the notice period.  

 

The
License Agreement may be terminated by Mr. Lachmar in the event we
become insolvent or unable to pay our debts as they come due,
become the subject of a bankruptcy proceeding (voluntary or
involuntary), other than a reorganization, or enter into a general
assignment for the benefit of our creditors.  

 

The HI
Technology underlying the License Agreement, which is related to
petroleum geology, has not been promoted to customers and requires
substantial research and development of hydrocarbon-indicating
methods and technology.  No funds were expended for research
and development of the HI Technology during the fiscal years ended
March 31, 2016, and 2015.  We intend to use our proprietary HI
Technology, if we are successful in its further development and
commercialization, to become a competitor in the oil and gas
exploration services industry.

 

Following
such research and development, as we enter the commercialization
stage of the HI Technology development, we must acquire projects
and business opportunities that build the credibility of the HI
Technology and develop our ability to deliver quality oil and gas
exploration prospect areas.  Substantial additional funding
will be required for research and development respecting the
efficacy of the HI Technology to locate oil and gas prospect areas.
 It is estimated that approximately $15,000 will be needed for
laboratory equipment to analyze attendant microwaves produced by
the attendant process; and that an additional sum of approximately
$80,000 will be needed for testing and software development for
fast video processing boards.  Even then, assuming the HI
Technology functions as hoped, the process to determine the best
locations to drill for oil and gas will take about two years, after
recording data and quantifying it, following the examination of
zones or areas in oil and gas fields that are known to have oil and
gas reserves.  The professional we had intended to utilize for
our research and development of this technology has been and
continues to be seriously ill.  We are attempting to find
another person whom we believe has the qualifications necessary to
assist in the research and development of this technology; however,
with funding constraints, it is not anticipated that this research
and development will begin in the near future.  These plans
have been in place for the past three fiscal years, and we have not
make any progress by reason of our inability to raise the capital
necessary for our development of this technology.

 

Need for
any Governmental Approval of Principal Products or
Services

 

We have
the necessary licenses and qualifications, singly or through our
subcontractors, to conduct our business operations, without
government approval, except to the extent of compliance with
applicable governmental regulations related to our business, which
are summarized below under the heading “Effect of Existing or
Probable Governmental Regulations on Our Business,”
below.

 

Effect of
Existing or Probable Governmental Regulations on the
Business

 

Federal
and State Law

 

We are
regulated in a number of fields in which we operate.  In the
United States, we deal with numerous U.S. and California state
governmental agencies and entities, including the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency, the Carpenter-Presley-Tanner
Hazardous Substance Account Act (the “California Superfund
Act”), the Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act (the
“California Water Control Act”) and CARB.  When
working with these governmental agencies and entities, we must
comply with laws and regulations relating to the formation,
administration and performance of our contracts.

 

Risk
assessment practices under these acts include the most current
sound scientific methods for data evaluation, exposure assessment,
toxicity assessment and risk characterization, documentation of all
assumptions, methods, models and calculations used in the
assessment including any health risk assessment.  These
assessments generally include:

 

·

Evaluation
of risks posed by acutely toxic hazardous substances based on
levels at which no known or anticipated adverse effects on health
will occur, with an adequate margin of safety.

·

Evaluation
of risks posed by carcinogens or other hazardous substances that
may cause chronic disease based on a level that does not pose any
significant risk to health.




7

 

 

  

 

·

Consideration
of possible synergistic effects resulting from exposure to, or
interaction with, two or more hazardous substances.

·

Consideration
of the effect of hazardous substances upon subgroups that comprise
a meaningful portion of the general population, including, but not
limited to, infants, children, pregnant women, the elderly,
individuals with a history of serious illness, or other
subpopulations, that are identifiable as being at greater risk of
adverse health effects due to exposure to hazardous substances than
the general population.

·

Consideration
of exposure and body burden level that alter physiological function
or structure in a manner that may significantly increase the risk
of illness and of exposure to hazardous substances in all media,
including, but not limited to, exposures in drinking water, food,
ambient and indoor air, and soil.

·

If
currently available scientific data is insufficient to determine
the level of a hazardous substance at which no known or anticipated
adverse effects on health will occur, with an adequate margin of
safety, or the level that poses no significant risk to public
health, the risk assessment prepared in conjunction with a response
action taken or approved shall be based on the level that is
protective of public health, with an adequate margin of safety.
 This level shall be based exclusively on public health
considerations; shall, to the extent scientific data are available,
take into account the factors set forth; and shall be based on the
most current principles, practices and methods used by public
health professionals who are experienced practitioners in the
fields of epidemiology, risk assessment, fate and transport
analysis, and toxicology.

 

Compliance
with federal, state and local laws enacted for the protection of
the environment has to date had no significant effect on our
capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.  These
costs are an integral part of the services that we provide.
 In the future, compliance with environmental laws could
materially adversely affect us. We will continue to monitor the
impact of such laws on our business and will develop appropriate
compliance programs.

 

Emerging
Growth Company

 

We are an
“emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart
Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or “JOBS Act.”
 As long as we remain an “emerging growth
company,” we may take advantage of certain exemptions from
various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public
companies that are not an “emerging growth company,”
like those applicable to a “smaller reporting company,”
including, but not limited to, a scaled down description of our
business in SEC filings; no requirements to include risk factors in
the Exchange Act filings; no requirement to include certain
selected financial data and supplementary financial information in
SEC filings; not being required to comply with the auditor
attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;
reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in
our periodic reports and proxy statements that we file under the
Exchange Act; no requirement for Sarbanes-Oxley Act Section 404(b)
auditor attestations of internal control over financial reporting;
and exemptions from the requirements of holding an annual
nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and seeking
nonbinding shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments
not previously approved.  We are also only required to file
audited financial statements for the previous two fiscal years when
filing registration statements, together with reviewed financial
statements of any applicable subsequent quarter.

 

We may
take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer
an “emerging growth company.”  We can remain an
“emerging growth company” for up to five years.
 We would cease to be an “emerging growth company”
prior to such time if we have total annual gross revenues of $1
billion or more and when we become a “larger accelerated
filer,” have a public float of $700 million or more or we
issue more than $1 billion of non-convertible debt over a
three-year period.

 

Under the
JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can also delay adopting new or
revised accounting standards until such time as those standards
apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to
avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting
standards and, therefore, will be subject to the same new or
revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not
emerging growth companies.

Smaller
Reporting Company

 

We became
subject to the reporting requirements of Section 15(d) of the
Exchange Act, subject to the disclosure requirements of Regulation
S-K of the SEC, as a “smaller reporting company,” on
the effective date of our Registration Statement.  The
designation of being a “smaller reporting company”
relieves us of some of the more detailed informational requirements
of Regulation S-K.  See the heading “Emerging Growth
Company” directly above for a brief summary of some of the
principal reduced requirements available to a “smaller
reporting company.”

 

Sarbanes/Oxley
Act

 

We are
subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.  The Sarbanes/Oxley
Act created a strong and independent accounting oversight board to
oversee the conduct of auditors of public companies and strengthens
auditor independence.  It also requires steps to enhance the
direct responsibility of senior members of management for financial
reporting and for the quality of financial disclosures made by
public companies; establishes clear statutory rules to limit, and
to expose to public view, possible conflicts of interest affecting
securities analysts; creates guidelines for audit committee
members’ appointment, compensation and oversight of the work
of public companies’ auditors; management assessment of our
internal controls; prohibits certain insider trading during pension
fund blackout periods; requires companies and auditors to evaluate
internal controls and procedures; and establishes a federal crime
of securities fraud, among other provisions. Compliance with the
requirements of the Sarbanes/Oxley Act will substantially increase
our legal and accounting costs.

 

Exchange
Act Reporting Requirements

 

Section
15(d) of the Exchange Act requires all companies that have filed a
registration statement under the Securities Act to file annual
reports on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q with the
SEC for a period of one year from the effective date of the
Registration Statement, and we will be required to timely disclose
certain material events (e.g., changes in corporate control;
acquisitions or dispositions of a significant amount of assets
other than in the ordinary course of business; and bankruptcy) in a
Current Report on Form 8-K.  We intend to file a Form 8-A with
the SEC before the expiration of this one year period so that we
will become a “reporting issuer” under Section 13 of
the Exchange Act.

 

Research
and Development Costs during the Last Two Fiscal
Years

 

We had no
research and development costs during our last two fiscal years
ended March 31, 2016 and 2015.

 

Cost and
Effects of Compliance with Environmental Laws

 

We do not
maintain any hazardous chemicals on-site, and those chemicals we
utilize in our remediation services are shipped directly to the
impacted site from the supplier of chemicals, with all the proper
manifests by a certified Hazardous Materials transporter.
 These chemicals are available from a wide array of
suppliers.

 

We
neither store nor manufacture any materials that require us to
maintain any federal, state or local permits. Accordingly, the cost
and effects of compliance with environmental laws on our business
is negligible.

 

Number of
Total Employees and Number of Full-Time Employees

 

We have
only one employee, Mr. Lachmar, our President; our services are
primarily subcontracted, and are performed under the supervision of
Mr. Lachmar, a Registered Geologist in the States of California and
Texas.

 

Additional
Information

 

You may
read and copy any materials that we file with the SEC at the
SEC’s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, N.E.,
Washington, D.C. 20549.  You may also find all of the reports
or registration statements that we have filed electronically with
the SEC at its Internet site at www.sec.gov.  Please call the
SEC at 1-202-551-8090 for further information on this or other
Public Reference Rooms.  Our SEC reports and registration
statements are also

available
from commercial document retrieval services, such as CCH Washington
Service Bureau, whose telephone number is
1-800-344-3734.

  

ITEM 1A.
 RISK FACTORS

 

As a
smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide risk
factors.

  

ITEM 2:
 PROPERTIES

 

Our
facilities are located at 1421 East Pomona Street, Santa Ana,
California 92705.  Our telephone and facsimile numbers are,
respectively, (714) 665-8777; and (714) 665-8778  These
facilities consist of approximately 1,200 square feet of office
space, 2,000 square feet of work shop and 3,000 square feet of
fenced and protected yard space, all leased on a month-to-month
basis, for a total of $1,100 per month.  These facilities are
shared with one of our suppliers of drilling and soil samples for
our Environmental Division’s remediation business
operations.

  

ITEM 3:
 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

 

We are
not a party to any pending legal proceeding.  To the knowledge
of management, no federal, state or local governmental agency is
presently contemplating any proceeding against us.  No
director, executive officer or “affiliate” of ours or
owner of record or beneficially of more than 5% of our common stock
is a party adverse to us or has a material interest adverse to us
in any proceeding.

  

ITEM 4:
 MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES

 

Not
applicable.

  

PART
II

  

ITEM 5:
 MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED
STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY
SECURITIES

 

Market
Information

 

Commencing
on or about April 8, 2013, our shares of common stock began being
quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board of the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority, Inc. (“FINRA”); our current
trading symbol is “GCNG,” which was effective on June
19, 2013.  No assurance can be given that any market for our
common stock will develop or be maintained. If an
“established trading market” ever develops in the
future, the sale of shares of our common stock that are deemed to
be “restricted securities”  or “control
securities” pursuant to Rule 144 of the SEC by members of
management or others may have a substantial adverse impact on any
such market.  Since shares issued to our stockholders in the
Spin-Off from Geo Point Utah were registered with the SEC, they are
not considered to be “restricted securities” under SEC
Rule 144; therefore, all of our shares of common stock may be
publicly traded under Rule 144, subject to the resale limitations
outlined below under the heading “Rule 144” respecting
“affiliates.”  

 

Set forth
below are the high and low closing bid prices for our common stock
for each quarter of fiscal years ended March 31, 2016, and 2015.
 These bid prices were obtained from the FINRA composite feed
or other qualified interdealer quotation medium.  All prices
listed herein reflect inter-dealer prices, without retail mark-up,
mark-down or commissions and may not represent actual
transactions.

indeterminate number of shareholders who may hold shares in
“street name.”

 

Dividends




11

 

 

  

 

We have
not declared any cash dividends with respect to our common stock,
and do not intend to declare dividends in the foreseeable future.
 Our dividend policy cannot be ascertained with any certainty
at this time because of our potential lack of any profitable
operations.  There are no material restrictions limiting, or
that are likely to limit, our ability to pay dividends.
 

 

Securities
Authorized for Issuance under Equity Compensation
Plans

 

We have
no equity, incentive, pension or other compensatory plans that have
or are presently contemplated to be adopted by our Board of
Directors; however, we may adopt one or more of these plans in the
future to maintain or attract key personnel.

 

Recent
Sales of Unregistered Securities

 

There
were no sales of unregistered securities by us during the fiscal
years ended March 31, 2016 or 2015.

 

Use of
Proceeds of Registered Securities

 

There
were no proceeds received by us during the fiscal years ended March
31, 2016, or 2015, from the sale of registered
securities.

 

Purchases
of Equity Securities by Us and Affiliated Purchasers

 

There
were no purchases of our equity securities by us during the fiscal
years ended March 31, 2016 or 2015.

  

ITEM 6:
 SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA

 

Not
required for smaller reporting companies.

  

ITEM 7:
 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION

 

When used
in this Annual Report, the words “may,”
“will,” “expect,” “anticipate,”
“continue,” “estimate,”
“project,” “intend,” and similar
expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements
regarding events, conditions, and financial trends that may affect
our future plans of operations, business strategy, operating
results, and financial position.  Persons reviewing this
Annual Report are cautioned that any forward-looking statements are
not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks and
uncertainties and actual results may differ materially from those
included within the forward-looking statements as a result of
various factors.  

 

Our
future results and shareholder values may differ materially from
those expressed in these forward-looking statements.  Many of
the factors that will determine these results and values are beyond
our ability to control or predict.  We may be required to
update these forward-looking statements from time to time as
circumstances change; however, we undertake no duty to do so.
 

 

Plan of
Operation

 

We
anticipate continuing our current business operations comprising
the Engineering and Environmental Divisions’ operations
formerly conducted by Geo Point Utah, and we believe with the
resurgence on the U.S. Economy and the real estate market in
general, that our efforts during fiscal 2016 should result in
modest increases in revenues.

 

We may
also attempt to raise the capital necessary for research and
development of our HI Technology.  Substantial additional
funding will be required for research and development respecting
the efficacy of the HI Technology to locate oil and gas prospect
areas, though we have been unsuccessful in this respect for the
past three fiscal years  It is estimated that approximately
$15,000 will be needed for laboratory equipment to analyze
attendant microwaves produced by the attendant process; and that an
additional sum of approximately $80,000 will be needed for testing
and software development for fast video processing boards.
 Even then, assuming the HI Technology functions as




12

 

 

  

hoped, the
process to determine the best locations to drill for oil and gas
will take about two years, after recording data and quantifying it,
following the examination of zones or areas in oil and gas fields
that are known to have oil and gas reserves.   No
assurance can be given that any efforts respecting the HI
Technology will prove to be successful.  For additional
information on our License Agreement respecting the Hi Technology,
see the heading “Patents, Trademarks, Licenses, Franchises,
Concessions, Royalty Agreements or Labor Contracts, including
Duration” of Part I, Item 1, above.

  

Results
of Operations

 

Year Ended
March 31, 2016, Compared to Year Ended March 31,
2015

 

During
the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, we had sales of $148,222,
compared to $229,807 for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015, a
decrease of $81,585.  Cost of sales for the fiscal year ended
March 31, 2016, was $33,793, compared to $60,334 for the previous
fiscal year, a decrease of $26,541.   In addition, during the
year ended March 31, 2016, we have seen a decrease in the need for
our services due to significant pressure on fees within our
industry due to competition.  Due to our overall low cost
structure, we believed our ability to provide our services at a
lower cost than most competitors is resulting in a greater level of
bid acceptance. However, our competitors continue to lower the
prices for their services as well.

 

General
and administrative expenses during the fiscal year ended March 31,
2016, were $138,166, compared to $148,763, during the fiscal year
ended March 31, 2015, a decrease of $10,597.  The decrease in
general and administrative expenses was directly related to a
decrease in professional costs incurred in connection with the
Company's public filings.

 

We had
other expenses, which primarily consisted of interest expense on
the line of credit of $48,854 in fiscal 2016 and $35,099 in fiscal
2015, an increase of $13,755, primarily related to the increase in
the balance of the line of credit.  

  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources

 

Current
assets at March 31, 2016, included $32,336 in cash and a note
receivable of $75,000, for total current assets of $107,366, a
decrease of $79,100 from total current assets of $186,466 at March
31, 2015.

 

At March
31, 2016, we had a negative working capital of $288,688, as
compared to negative working capital of $113,117 at March 31,
2015.

 

Capital
Resources

 

During
the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, operating activities used
cash of $23,720, as compared to $20,879 in net cash provided by for
the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015.  For the fiscal year
ended March 31, 2016, the net cash used by operating activities was
mainly driven by our net loss.

 

During
the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, investing activities used
cash of $178,980, as compared to $0 in cash provided for the fiscal
year ended March 31, 2015.   Investing activities
consisted $175,000 in loans to third parties.

 

During
the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, financing activities provided
cash of $48,600, as compared to $54,810 in cash provided for the
fiscal year ended March 31, 2015.  Financing activities
consisted of $48,600 and $54,810 in proceeds from our line of
credit in fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively, the proceeds of which
were used for operations.

 

We intend
to fund future operations for the next 12 months through cash flows
generated from operations, current cash on hand and the proceeds
from the line of credit.  If these cash flows are not
sufficient to fund operations, we may be required to raise capital
through either a debt or equity financing. These contributions are
expected to satisfy amounts in accounts payable and potentially be
used for operations. Currently, we cannot provide assurance that
such financing will be available to us on favorable terms, or at
all.  If, after utilizing the existing sources of capital
available to us, further capital needs are identified and if we are
not successful in obtaining the required financing,




13

 

 

  

we may be
forced to curtail our existing or planned future operations.
 We believe our plans will enable us to continue our current
operations for a period in excess of one year from the date of our
most recent balance sheet.

 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements

 

We had no
off-balance sheet arrangements for the two fiscal years ended March
31, 2016 and 2015.
