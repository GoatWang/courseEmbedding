Why FreeStor

NEW APPROACHES ARE REQUIRED TO ADDRESS LONG-STANDING CHALLENGES
Modernizing existing infrastructure results in IT organizations needing to achieve greater efficiencies, minimal downtime, lower costs, and improved simplicity in a way that only a software-defined approach can deliver. Adding flexibility to address ever-changing business and IT requirements give organizations the freedom to choose the right physical storage platform, based on the price and performance they need to achieve their business goals.

        Too many independent silos that don’t always work or communicate with each other; that have unique
        
        tool sets and licensing schemes that wind up adding complexity and cost. Eliminate the complexity
        
        and cost with FreeStor’s ability to apply common data services in a common approach across the
        
        portfolio. This reduces costly license fees and minimizes complexity through a common tool set
        
        with single-pane-of-glass management.

            TO UNIFY IS TO SIMPLIFY
          

            Unified data services across heterogeneous storage — whether it be physical, virtual or hybrid — eliminates vendor lock-in, silos, and platform incompatibilities. With a single pane-of-glass interface, sometimes less is more.

INTELLIGENT ACTION








ACTIONS SPEAK LOUDER THAN WORDS…


        Lack of real-time and historical information, lack of a common “pane-of-glass” and toolset to make
        
        informed decisions and take both proactive and reactive actions is a real problem.
      













              TO TAKE ACTION…
              
              YOU NEED INSIGHT
            

              When it comes to workloads, IT organizations need complete insight from core-to-edge across their infrastructure, both on premise and in the cloud. FreeStor provides that insight in a single-pane-of-glass regardless of hardware or location.

INTELLIGENT ACTION



ACTIONS SPEAK LOUDER THAN WORDS…

Lack of real-time and historical information, lack of a common “pane-of-glass” and toolset to make informed decisions and take both proactive and reactive actions is a real problem.



TO TAKE ACTION… YOU NEED INSIGHT
When it comes to workloads, IT organizations need complete insight from core-to-edge across their infrastructure, both on premise and in the cloud. FreeStor provides that insight in a single-pane-of-glass regardless of hardware or location.




SMART RULES ENABLE FASTER ACTION
The ability to use the SMART Rules engine combines intelligent analytics with limits, thresholds and actions to enable organizations to address workload and infrastructure performance in real time.

The possibility exists that you could sustain a loss of some or more of your initial investment, and therefore you should not invest money that you cannot afford to lose. You should be aware of all the risks associated with trading, and seek advice from your broker and or an independent financial advisor if you have any doubts. Anyone opening a live trading account needs to adhere to the laws of their local country as such laws may differ from country to country.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Latest Dividend N/A     Ex-Dividend Date N/A       ?    Shares Sold Short The total number of shares of a security that have been sold short and not yet repurchased. Change from Last Percentage change in short interest from the previous report to the most recent report. Exchanges report short interest twice a month. Percent of Float Total short positions relative to the number of shares available to trade.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.      Stock Money Flow    Uptick/Downtick Trade Ratio  0 2    0.72      Net Money Flow ($)  -5,764    Money flow gives a snapshot of relative buying and selling pressure in a stock.
