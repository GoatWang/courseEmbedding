Villa del Balbianello is located next to Lake Como, Italy. In the spring of 2006, the movie Casino Royale was filmed in front of the villa. The villa doubles as a hospital where James Bond (Daniel Craig) is recovering, together with Vesper (Eva Green) and where the Swiss banker comes to get the code to transfer the money.Built for Cardinal Angelo Maria Durini at the end of the XVIII century, the Villa stands on the tip of a steep promontory overlooking Lake Como, almost opposite Bellagio. Today, the villa has the appearance desired by its last owner, the explorer Guido Monzino, with a rich collection of Chinese, African and pre-Colombian art, precious English and French furniture of the 1700s and the small museum with documents and mementoes of his expeditions. Yet the true masterpiece is the panoramic terraced garden dominated by the elegant "loggia" with three arches rising on the highest point of the promontory.The same villa can also be seen in Star Wars II: Attack of the Clones.The Villa is now owned by Fondo per l'Ambiente Italiano (FAI). A private, non-profit trust, FAI receives sites of historic, artistic and naturalist value through donations, bequests or loans for use, restores them, opens them to the public and ensures that everyone can enjoy them.AddressVia Comoedia - Lenno, COMOOpening timesMid-March - Mid-November: 10 am - 6 pmOpen every day, except Mondays and Wednesday (unless public holidays).Last entrance time: half an hour before closing.Find hotels near Villa BalbianelloVisit for route descriptions and more information the official website (see below).Links: Official website (Italian)Hotels near Villa Balbianello

Villa del Balbianello is absolutely stunning, and well worth a visit. 
The Villa and the surrounding grounds are beautiful and the view across the lake is absolutely breathtaking. The atmosphere is very peaceful and relaxed and you are able to explore the grounds and the building at your own leisure. All the areas used in Casino Royale are accessible to the public.
Whilst you can’t actually stay in the Villa itself, there is fantastic and reasonably priced accommodation in the form of the Hotel San Giorgio, Lenno, which is walking distance from the Villa.
Whilst you can walk to the Villa from Lenno, I’d suggest getting a boat either there or back as you get a wonderful view from the water as the boat passes alongside the promontory.  
A flight to Milan form the UK was under £40, then a train trip to Como, which was very reasonable. You can catch a bus from Como to Lenno, although beware; it is not for the faint of heart! 
If you want to enjoy a slice of the Bond lifestyle, but haven’t the budget for the Ocean Club, this is highly recommended.

Individual Collection
These villas are those that caught our eye, and we’re sure they’ll catch yours. A James iNDIVIDUAL villa doesn't quite fit the mould, which is why it has been specifically handpicked and recommended by one of our Product team. Our iNDIVIDUAL villas are just that, something different that we know you will love.
Individual Showcase





As iNDIVIDUAL as you are...
Fitting in with the crowd is not your style. You crave something different and we like that about you. That’s why our iNDIVIDUAL villas are your perfect holiday match. With the fantastic comforts and great location you’d expect of a James Villa property, we’re proud to put our name to them. The facilities in our iNDIVIDUAL villas vary from property to property – so they don’t quite slot into our other Collections. But whether you are looking for a special stand out feature or luxurious living, there is an iNDIVIDUAL villa to suit all budgets and tastes – all specially chosen by our Product team. Different, yes – but very James!

Making the most of your villa holiday...


Individual - What is an iNDIVIDUAL villa?
At James we love handpicking villas. Simple bolt-holes to extravagant mansions, we’ve got it covered. Testing out the sofa, sitting and admiring the nicest viewpoint, and measuring the swimming pool are all just part of the job. Our Product Team imagine what it’s like to be you when you first arrive on holiday at your villa. We want to be confident that yes, this is a great holiday home for our guests.We tick boxes as we explore, of course. All of our iNDIVIDUAL villas needs to meet at least the standard of our Signature properties. But these villas are as unique as you are – not every box will be ticked. But our Contractors love them. We know you will too.Explore this collection to find a villa that fits you. If you’ve got a spirit of adventure but still love your comfort, iNDIVIDUAL villas from James Villas represent the very best in unique self-catering.


“Our job is to choose villas that our guests will love. We’ve explored all of our iNDIVIDUAL properties and given them our seal of approval – now it’s your turn!”

It starts with a booking
The only way to leave a review is to first make a booking. That's how we know our reviews come from real guests who have stayed at the property.







2



Followed by a trip
When guests stay at the property they check out how quiet the room is, how friendly the staff are and more.







3



And finally, a review
After their trip, guests tell us about their stay. We check for naughty words and verify the authenticity of all guest reviews before adding them to our site.
