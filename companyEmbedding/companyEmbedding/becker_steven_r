Home


I have been honored to serve the people of the 104 House District for the past four years. In that time I have stood up for the people in my district and not followed the party line set forth by the governor.
As we look ahead, we must:
RETURN to a sensible, sustainable tax policy
SUPPORT public schools and teachers
PRESERVE the independence & integrity of the Kansas courts
PROTECT funding of early education programs
These are the things I’ll continue striving for as your representative. I intend to represent my district, not the wishes of leadership.
