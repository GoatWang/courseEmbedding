5 Questions to Ask Your Financial Advisor

















There is never a bad time to review your financial plan with your financial advisor. You should make it a point to do so at least once a year. To help ensure you get the most out of the discussion, get prepared and plan to participate.
 

	Prepare
Gather your financial documents, such as your income tax return and your latest statements for any mutual funds, annuities, retirement plans, life insurance policies, and savings accounts.
 

	Participate
Balance your advisor's questions with some questions of your own, such as:


What tax-saving strategies do I need to know about?
		Discuss your mix of tax-free or tax-deferred assets versus taxable costs.
		 

Am I taking advantage of the right financial products?
		Your financial advisor can review the advantages and limitations of new investment products and features, and help determine if they could fit into your portfolio.
		 

How has the risk level of my portfolio changed in light of the economic events of the past year?
		Your financial advisor should be ready, willing, and able to address your concerns about investments. Make sure the risk level of your portfolio matches your risk tolerance, especially if either one has changed.
		 

What changes should I make, based on changes to my family situation or finances?
		Discuss personally significant events you experienced in the past year, as well as any changes in your viewpoint on saving taxes, budgeting, or other financial issues.
		 

Is anything missing from my financial strategy?
		While reviewing your financial documents, your financial advisor can help identify and fill any gaps in your portfolio. For example, your income tax return (Form 1040) may uncover more tax-efficient ways to save in the future.

(1) These expenses are annualized. The Fund began operations on June 17, 1999.

(2) The Fund's Class 2 distribution plan or "Rule 12b-1 Plan" is described in
the Fund's prospectus. While the maximum amount payable under the Fund's
Class 2 Rule 12b-1 Plan is 0.35% per year of the Fund's average daily net
assets, the Board of Trustees of Franklin Templeton Variable Insurance
Products Trust has set the current rate at 0.25% per year through at least
April 30, 2001.

(3) The fund administration fee is paid indirectly through the management fee.

(4) On 2/8/00, a merger and reorganization was approved that combined the
Franklin Small Cap Fund with a similar fund of the Templeton Variable
Products Series Fund, effective 5/1/00. On 2/8/00, fund shareholders
approved new management fees, which apply to the combined fund effective
5/1/00. The table shows restated total expenses based on the new fees and
assets of the fund as of 12/31/99, and not the assets of the combined fund.
However, if the table reflected both the new fees and the combined assets,
the fund's expenses after 5/1/00 would be estimated as: Management Fees
0.55%, Distribution and Service Fees 0.25%, Other Expenses 0.27%, and Total
Fund Operating Expenses 1.07%.





(5) The management fees shown are based on the fund's maximum contractual
amount. Other expenses are estimated. The manager and administrator have
agreed in advance to waive or limit their respective fees and to assume as
their own expense certain expenses otherwise payable by the fund so that
Total Fund Operating Expenses do not exceed 0.75% of average net assets for
the current fiscal year. After December 31, 2001, the manager and
administrator may end this arrangement at any time. Without this reduction
Total Fund Operating Expenses were:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------








(6) The management fees shown are based on the fund's maximum contractual
amount. Other expenses are estimated. The manager and administrator have
agreed in advance to waive or limit their respective fees and to assume as
their own expense certain expenses otherwise payable by the fund so that
Total Fund Operating Expenses do not exceed 1.30% of average net assets,
including Class 2's 12b-1 plan fee, for the current fiscal year. After
December 31, 2001, the manager and administrator may end this arrangement at
any time.


(7) Each Series has an expense offset arrangement which reduces the series'
custodian fee based upon the amount of cash maintained by the series with
its custodian and dividend disbursing agent. Each series may enter into
other such arrangements and directed brokerage arrangements, which would
also have the effect of reducing the series' expenses. After these
reductions, the Total Fund Operating Expenses would be:

(8) MFS has contractually agreed, subject to reimbursement, to bear expenses for
these series such that each such series' "Other Expenses" (after taking into
account the expense offset arrangement described above), do not exceed 0.15%
of the average daily net assets of the series during the current fiscal
year. These contractual fee arrangements will continue until at least
May 1, 2001, unless changed with the consent of the board of trustees which

Item 26. Persons Controlled By or Under Common Control with the Depositor or
Registrant



Filed herewith as Exhibit 16.



Item 27. Number of Contract Owners




As of July 31, 2000, there were 10,733 Contract Owners.




Item 28. Indemnification



Sections 33-770 to 33-778, inclusive, of the Connecticut General
Statutes ("CGS") provide that a corporation may provide indemnification
of or advance expenses to a director, officer, employee or agent.
Reference is hereby made to Section 33-771(e) of CGS regarding
indemnification of directors and Section 33-776(d) of CGS regarding
indemnification of officers, employees and agents of Connecticut
corporations. These statutes provide, in general, that Connecticut
corporations incorporated prior to January 1, 1997 shall, except to the
extent that their certificate of incorporation expressly provides
otherwise, indemnify their directors, officers, employees and agents
against "liability" (defined as the obligation to pay a judgment,
settlement, penalty, fine, including an excise tax assessed with
respect to an employee benefit plan, or reasonable expenses incurred
with respect to a proceeding) when (1) a determination is made pursuant
to Section 33-775 that the party seeking indemnification has met the
standard of conduct set forth in Section 33-771 or (2) a court has
determined that indemnification is appropriate pursuant to Section
33-774. Under Section 33-775, the determination of and the
authorization for indemnification are made (a) by the disinterested
directors, as defined in Section 33-770(3); (b) by special counsel; (c)
by the shareholders; or (d) in the case of indemnification of an
officer, agent or employee of the corporation, by the general counsel
of the corporation or such other officer(s) as the board of directors
may specify. Also, Section 33-772 provides that a corporation shall
indemnify an individual who was wholly successful on the merits or
otherwise against reasonable expenses incurred by him in connection
with a proceeding to which he was a party because he was a director of
the corporation. In the case of a proceeding by or in the right of the
corporation or with respect to conduct for which the director, officer,
agent or employee was adjudged liable on the basis that he received a
financial benefit to which he was not entitled, indemnification is
limited to reasonable expenses incurred in connection with the
proceeding against the corporation to which the individual was named a
party.


Under the Depositor's bylaws, the Depositor must indemnify both
directors and officers of the Depositor for (1) any claims and
liabilities to which they become subject by reason of being or having
been directors or officers of the Depositor and (2) legal and other
expenses incurred in defending against such claims, in each case, to
the extent such is consistent with statutory provisions.





Section 33-777 of CGS specifically authorizes a corporation to procure
indemnification insurance on behalf of an individual who was a
director, officer, employer or agent of the corporation. Consistent
with the statute, the directors and officers of the Depositor and
Hartford Securities Distribution Company, Inc. ("HSD") are covered
under a directors and officers liability insurance policy issued to The
Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries.


Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities
Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling
persons of the Registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or
otherwise, the Registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the
Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against
public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable.
In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities
(other than the payment by the Registrant of expenses incurred or paid
by a director, officer or controlling person of the Registrant in the
successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by
such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the
securities being registered, the Registrant will, unless in the opinion
of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent,
submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such
indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act
and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.

be kept by Section 31(a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 and
rules thereunder, are maintained by Hartford at 200 Hopmeadow

Item 31. Management Services

FUND PARTICIPATION AGREEMENT



THIS AGREEMENT, made as of this ___ day of ____________, 2000 by and
among Hartford Life Insurance Company ("Hartford"); a Connecticut corporation,
on its behalf and on behalf of each separate account set forth on SCHEDULE A
attached as it may be amended from time to time (the "Separate Accounts");
___________________ (the "Fund"); ___________________ (the "Distributor"); and
___________________ (the "Adviser").


WHEREAS, the Fund engages in business as an open-end management
investment company and is available to act as the investment vehicle for
separate accounts established by insurance companies for life insurance policies
and annuity contracts; and


WHEREAS, the Distributor is registered as a broker/dealer under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act"), is a member in
good standing of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (the
"NASD") and serves as principal underwriter of the shares of the Fund; and


WHEREAS, the Adviser is registered as an investment adviser under the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, and any applicable state securities
laws and serves as the investment adviser to the Fund; and


WHEREAS, the Fund intends to make available shares of its series set
forth on SCHEDULE B, as it may be amended from time to time by mutual agreement
of the parties (the "Series"), to the Separate Accounts of Hartford; and


WHEREAS, Hartford is an insurance company which has registered or will
register the variable annuities and/or variable life insurance policies listed
in Schedule A under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "1933 Act") and the
Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act"), unless exempt from such
registration, to be issued by Hartford for distribution (the "Contracts"); and


NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of their mutual promises, Hartford,
the Fund, the Distributor and the Adviser agree as follows:



ARTICLE I. FUND SHARES



1.1     The Fund and the Distributor agree to make shares of the Series
available for purchase on each Business Day by the Separate Accounts. The Fund
will execute orders placed for each Separate Account on a daily basis at the
net asset value of each Series next computed after receipt by the Fund or its
designee of such order.


3





A.     For purposes of this Agreement, Hartford shall be the designee
of the Fund and Distributor for receipt of orders from each Separate Account
and receipt by Hartford constitutes receipt by the Fund, provided that the Fund
receives notice of orders by 9:30 a.m. (Eastern time) on the next following
Business Day.


B.     For purposes of this Agreement, "Business Day" shall mean any
day on which the New York Stock Exchange is open for trading and on which the
Fund calculates the net asset value of each Series pursuant to the rules of the
Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), as set forth in the Series'
prospectus.


1.2    The Board of Directors of the Fund (the "Board"), acting in good faith
and in the exercise of its fiduciary responsibilities, may refuse to permit the
Fund to sell shares of any Series to any person, or suspend or terminate the
offering of shares of any Series if such action is required by law or by
regulatory authorities having jurisdiction over the sale of shares.


1.3    The Fund and the Distributor agree that shares of the Fund or any of its
Series will be sold only to insurance companies for use in conjunction with
variable life insurance policies or variable annuities. No shares of the Fund
or any of its Series will be sold to the general public.


1.4    The Fund and the Distributor agree to redeem for cash, at Hartford's
request, any full or fractional shares of the Series held by the Separate
Accounts, on a daily basis at the net asset value next computed after receipt
by the Fund or its designee of the request for redemption.


A.     For the purposes of this Agreement, Hartford shall be the
designee of the Fund for receipt of redemption requests from each Separate
Account and receipt by Hartford constitutes receipt by the Fund, provided that
the Distributor receives notice of the redemption request by 9:30 a.m. (Eastern
time) on the next following Business Day.


1.5    Hartford agrees that purchases and redemptions of Series shares offered
by the then current prospectus of the Series shall be made in accordance with
the provisions of the prospectus.


A.     Hartford will place separate orders to purchase or redeem
shares of each Series. Each order shall describe the net amount of shares and
dollar amount of each Series to be purchase or redeemed.


B.     In the event of net purchases, Hartford will pay for shares
before 3:00 p.m. (Eastern time) on the next Business Day after receipt of an
order to purchase shares.


C.     In the event of net redemptions, the Fund shall pay the
redemption proceeds in federal funds transmitted by wire before 3:00 p.m.
(Eastern time) on the next Business Day after an order to redeem Fund shares is
made.


4





1.6    Issuance and transfer of the Series' shares will be by book entry only.
Share certificates will not be issued to Hartford or any Separate Account.
Shares purchased will be recorded in an appropriate title for each Separate
Account or the appropriate sub-account of each Separate Account. The Fund shall
furnish to Hartford the CUSIP number assigned to each Series identified in
Schedule B attached as may be amended from time to time.


1.7    The Distributor shall notify Hartford in advance of any dividends or
capital gain distributions payable on the Series' shares, but by no later than
same day notice by 6:00 p.m. Eastern time (by wire or telephone, followed by
written confirmation). Hartford elects to reinvest all such dividends and
capital gain distributions in additional shares of that Series. The Fund shall
notify Hartford of the number of shares issued as payment of dividends and
distributions. Hartford reserves the right to revoke this election and to
receive all such dividends and capital gain distributions in cash.


1.8    The Distributor shall make the net asset value per share of each Series
available to Hartford on a daily basis as soon as reasonably practical after
the net asset value per share is calculated. The Fund shall use its best
efforts to make such net asset value per share available by 6:00 p.m. Eastern
time.


A.     If the Distributor provides materially incorrect share net
asset value information through no fault of Hartford, the Separate Accounts
shall be entitled to an adjustment with respect to the Series shares purchased
or redeemed to reflect the correct net asset value per share.


B.     The determination of the materiality of any net asset value
pricing error and its correction shall be based on the SEC's recommended
guidelines regarding these errors. Any material error in the calculation or
reporting of net asset value per share, dividend or capital gain information
shall be reported promptly to Hartford upon discovery. The Fund and/or its
agents shall indemnify and hold harmless Hartford against any amount Hartford
is legally required to pay qualified plans ("Plans") or annuity or life
insurance contract owners that have selected a Series as an investment option
("Contract owners"), and which amount is due to the Fund's or its agents'
material miscalculation and/or incorrect reporting of the daily net asset
value, dividend rate or capital gains distribution rate. Hartford shall submit
an invoice to the Fund or its agents for such losses incurred as a result of
the above which shall be payable within sixty (60) days of receipt. Should a
material miscalculation by the Fund or its agents result in a gain to Hartford,
Hartford shall immediately reimburse the Fund, the applicable Series or its
agents for any material losses incurred by the Fund, the applicable Series or
its agents as a result of the incorrect calculation. Should a material
miscalculation by the Fund or its agents result in a gain to the Plans or
Contract owners, Hartford will consult with the Fund or its designee as to what
reasonable efforts shall be made to recover the money and repay the Fund, the
applicable Series or its agents. Hartford shall then make such reasonable
effort, at the expense of the Fund or its


5





agents, to recover the money and repay the Fund, the applicable Series or its
agents; but Hartford shall not be obligated to take legal action against the
Plans or Contract owners.


With respect to the material errors or omissions described above, this section
shall control over other indemnification provisions in this Agreement.

Section or regulations. In the event a Series ceases to so qualify, the Fund
will notify Hartford immediately of such event and the Adviser will take all
steps necessary to adequately diversify the Series so as to achieve compliance
within the grace period afforded by Treasury Regulation Sections 1.817-5.



ARTICLE VI. POTENTIAL CONFLICTS



6.1    The Board of Directors of the Fund will monitor the Series for the
existence of any material irreconcilable conflict between the interests of the
Contract owners of all separate accounts investing in the Series. The Board of
Directors of the Fund shall promptly inform Hartford if it determines that an
irreconcilable material conflict exists and the implications thereof.


9





6.2    Hartford will report any potential or existing material irreconcilable
conflict of which it is aware to the Board of Directors of the Fund. This
includes, but is not limited to, an obligation by Hartford to inform the Board
of Directors of the Fund whenever Contract owner voting instructions are
disregarded.


6.3    If it is determined by a majority of the Board of Directors of the Fund,
or a majority of its independent Directors, that a material irreconcilable
conflict exists due to issues relating to the Contracts, Hartford will, at its
expense and to the extent reasonably practicable, take whatever steps it can
which are necessary to remedy or eliminate the irreconcilable material
conflict, including, without limitation, withdrawal of the affected Separate
Account's investment in the Series. No charge or penalty will be imposed as a
result of such withdrawal.


6.4    Hartford, at the request of the Adviser will, at least annually, submit
to the Board of Directors of the Fund such reports, materials or data as the
Board may reasonably request so that the Board may fully carry out the
obligations imposed upon them. All reports received by the Board of potential
or existing conflicts, and all Board action with regard to determining the
existence of a conflict, and determining whether any proposed action adequately
remedies a conflict, shall be properly recorded in the minutes of the Board or
other appropriate records, and such minutes or other records shall be made
available to the Securities and Exchange Commission upon request.



ARTICLE VII. INDEMNIFICATION



7.1    Indemnification by Hartford


A.     Hartford agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Distributor,
the Adviser, the Fund and each of their directors (if applicable), officers,
employees and agents and each person, if any, who controls the Fund within the
meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act (collectively, the "Indemnified Parties"
and individually, an "Indemnified Party" for purposes of this Section 7.1)
against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities (including amounts
paid in settlement with the written consent of Hartford, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld) or expenses (including the reasonable costs of
investigating or defending any alleged loss, claim, damage, liability or
expense and reasonable legal counsel fees incurred in connection therewith)
(collectively, "Losses"), to which the Indemnified Parties may become subject
under any statute or regulation, or at common law or otherwise, insofar as such
Losses are related to the sale or acquisition of Series shares or the Contracts
and:


1.     Arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in a disclosure
document for the Contracts or in the Contracts themselves or in sales
literature generated or approved by Hartford applicable to the Contracts or
Separate Accounts (or any amendment or supplement to any of the foregoing)
(collectively, "Company Documents" for the purposes of this Article VII), or
arise out of or are based upon the omission or the


10





alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, provided that this
indemnity shall not apply as to any Indemnified Party if such statement or
omission or such alleged statement or omission was made in reliance upon and
was accurately derived from written information furnished to Hartford by or on
behalf of the Fund for use in Company Documents or otherwise for use in
connection with the sale of the Contracts or Series shares; or


2.     Arise out of or result from statements or
representations (other than statements or representations contained in and
accurately derived from Fund Documents as defined in Section 7.2 (A)(1)) or
wrongful conduct of Hartford or persons under its control, with respect to the
sale or acquisition of the Contracts or Series shares; or


3.     Arise out of or result from any untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in Fund Documents as
defined in Section 7.2(A)(1) or the omission or alleged omission to state
therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading if such statement or omission was made in
reliance upon and accurately derived from written information furnished to the
Fund by or on behalf of Hartford; or


4.     Arise out of or result from any failure by Hartford to
provide the services or furnish the materials required under the terms of this
Agreement; or


5.     Arise out of or result from any material breach of any
representation and/or warranty made by Hartford in this Agreement or arise out
of or result from any other material breach of this Agreement by Hartford; as
limited by and in accordance with, Sections 7.1(B) and 7.1(C) hereof.


B.     Hartford shall not be liable under this indemnification
provision with respect to any Losses which are due to an Indemnified Party's
willful misfeasance, bad faith, or gross negligence in the performance of such
Indemnified Party's duties or by reason of such Indemnified Party's reckless
disregard of obligations and duties under this Agreement or to the Fund or
Distributor, whichever is applicable.


C.     Hartford shall not be liable under this indemnification
provision with respect to any claim made against an Indemnified Party unless
such Indemnified Party shall have notified Hartford in writing within a
reasonable time after the summons or other first legal process giving
information of the nature of the claim shall have been served upon such
Indemnified Party (or after such Indemnified Party shall have received notice
of such service on any designated agent), but failure to notify Hartford of any
such claim shall not relieve Hartford from any liability which it may have to
the Indemnified Party against whom such action is brought otherwise than on
account of this indemnification provision. In case any such action is brought
against the Indemnified Parties, Hartford shall be entitled to participate, at
its own expense, in the


11





defense of such action. Hartford also shall be entitled to assume the defense
thereof, with counsel satisfactory to the party named in the action. After
notice from Hartford to such party of Hartford's election to assume the defense
thereof, the Indemnified Party shall bear the fees and expenses of any
additional counsel retained by it, and Hartford will not be liable to such
party under this Agreement for any legal or other expenses subsequently
incurred by such party independently in connection with the defense thereof
other than reasonable costs of investigation.


D.     The Indemnified Parties will promptly notify Hartford of the
commencement of any litigation or proceedings against them or any of their
officers or directors in connection with the issuance or sale of the Series
shares or the Contracts or the operation of the Fund.


7.2    Indemnification by the Distributor, the Adviser, and the Fund


A.     The Distributor, the Adviser, and the Fund agree to indemnify and
hold harmless Hartford and each of its directors, officers, employees and

Section 15 of the 1933 Act (collectively, the "Indemnified Parties" and
individually, an "Indemnified Party" for purposes of this Section 7.2) against
any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities (including amounts paid in
settlement with the written consent of the Distributor, the Adviser, and the
Fund, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) or expenses (including
the reasonable costs of investigating or defending any alleged loss, claim,
damage, liability or expense and reasonable legal counsel fees incurred in
connection therewith) (collectively, "Losses"), to which the Indemnified
Parties may become subject under any statute or regulation, or at common law or
otherwise, insofar as such Losses are related to the sale or acquisition of the
Series' shares or the Contracts and:


1.     Arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the registration
statement, prospectus or sales literature of the Fund applicable to the Series
(or any amendment or supplement to any of the foregoing) (collectively, "Fund
Documents" for purposes of Article this VII) or arise out of or are based upon
the omission or the alleged omission to state therein a material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading, provided that this indemnity shall not apply as to any Indemnified
Party if such statement or omission of such alleged statement or omission was
made in reliance upon and was accurately derived from written information
furnished to the Fund, the Adviser, or the Distributor by or on behalf of
Hartford for use in Fund Documents or otherwise for use in connection with the
sale of the Contracts or Series shares; or


2.     Arise out of or result from statements or
representations (other than statements or representations contained in and
accurately derived from Company


12





Documents) or wrongful conduct of the Fund, Adviser or Distributor or persons
under their control, with respect to the sale or distribution of the Contracts
or Series shares; or


3.     Arise out of or result from any untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in Company Documents, or
the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading if
such statement or omission was made in reliance upon and accurately derived
from written information furnished to Hartford by or on behalf of the
Distributor, the Adviser, or the Fund; or


4.     Arise out of or result from any failure by the
Distributor, the Adviser, or the Fund to provide the services or furnish the
materials required under the terms of this Agreement; or


5.     Arise out of or result from any material breach of any
representation and/or warranty made by the Distributor, the Adviser, or the
Fund in this Agreement or arise out of or result from any other material breach
of this Agreement by the Distributor, the Adviser, or the Fund; as limited by,
and in accordance with, Sections 7.2(B) and 7.2(C) hereof.


B.     The Distributor, the Adviser, or the Fund shall not be liable
under this indemnification provision with respect to any Losses which are due
to an Indemnified Party's willful misfeasance, bad faith, or gross negligence
in the performance of such Indemnified Party's duties or by reason of such
Indemnified Party's reckless disregard of obligations and duties under this
Agreement or to Hartford or the Separate Account, whichever is applicable.


C.     The Distributor, the Adviser, or the Fund shall not be liable
under this indemnification provision with respect to any claim made against an
Indemnified Party unless such Indemnified Party shall have notified the
Distributor, the Adviser, or the Fund, as applicable, in writing within a
reasonable time after the summons or other first legal process giving
information of the nature of the claim shall have been served upon such
Indemnified Party (or after such Indemnified Party shall have received notice
of such service on any designated agent), but failure to notify the
Distributor, the Adviser, or the Fund of any such claim shall not relieve the
Distributor, the Adviser, or the Fund from any liability which they may have to
the Indemnified Party against whom such action is brought otherwise than on
account of this indemnification provision. In case any such action is brought
against the Indemnified Parties, the Distributor, the Adviser, and the Fund
shall be entitled to participate, at their own expense, in the defense thereof.
The Distributor, the Adviser, and the Fund also shall be entitled to assume the
defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to the party named in the action.
After notice from the Distributor, the Adviser, and the Fund to such party of
their election to assume the defense thereof, the Indemnified Party shall bear
the expenses of any additional counsel retained by it, and the Distributor, the
Adviser, and the Fund will not be liable to such party under this Agreement for
any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred


13





by such party independently in connection with the defense thereof other than
reasonable costs of investigation.


D.     The Indemnified Parties shall promptly notify the Distributor,
the Adviser, and the Fund of the commencement of any litigation or proceedings
against them or any of their officers or directors in connection with the
issuance or sale of the Contracts or the operation of a Separate Account.


7.3    Any party seeking indemnification (the "Potential Indemnitee") will
promptly notify any party from whom they intend to seek indemnification (each a
"Potential Indemnitor") of all demands made and/or actions commenced against
the Potential Indemnitee which may require a Potential Indemnitor to provide
such indemnification. At its option and expense, a Potential Indemnitor may
retain counsel and control any litigation for which it may be responsible to
indemnify a Potential Indemnitee under this Agreement.


7.4    With respect to any claim, the parties each shall give the others
reasonable access during normal business hours to its books, records, and
employees and those books, records, and employees within its control pertaining
to such claim, and shall otherwise cooperate with one and other in the defense
of any claim. Regardless of which party defends a particular claim, the
defending party shall give the other parties written notice of any significant
development in the case as soon as practicable, and such other parties, at all
times, shall have the right to intervene in the defense of the case.


7.5    If a party is defending a claim and indemnifying another party hereto,
and: (i) a settlement proposal is made by the claimant, or (ii) the defending
party desires to present a settlement proposal to the claimant, then the
defending party promptly shall notify the Indemnified Party of such settlement
proposal together with its counsel's recommendation. If the defending party
desires to enter into the settlement and the Indemnified Party fails to consent
within five (5) business days (unless such period is extended, in writing, by
mutual agreement of the parties hereto), then the Indemnified Party, from the
time it fails to consent forward, shall defend the claim and shall indemnify
the defending party for all costs associated with the claim which are in excess
of the proposed settlement amount.


Regardless of which party is defending the claim: (i) if a settlement requires
an admission of liability by the non-defending party or would require the
non-defending party to either take action (other than purely ministerial
action) or refrain from taking action (due to an injunction or otherwise) (a
"Specific Performance Settlement"), the defending party may agree to such
settlement only after obtaining the express, written consent of the
non-defending party. If a non-defending party fails to consent to a Specific
Performance Settlement, the consequences described in the last sentence of the
first paragraph of this Section 7.5 shall NOT apply.


14





7.6    The parties shall use good faith efforts to resolve any dispute
concerning this indemnification obligation. Should those efforts fail to
resolve the dispute, the ultimate resolution shall be determined in a DE NOVO
proceeding, separate and apart from the underlying matter complained of, before
a court of competent jurisdiction. Either party may initiate such proceedings
with a court of competent jurisdiction at any time following the termination of
the efforts by such parties to resolve the dispute (termination of such efforts
shall be deemed to have occurred thirty (30) days from the commencement of the
same unless such time period is extended by the written agreement of the
parties). The prevailing party in such a proceeding shall be entitled to
recover reasonable attorneys' fees, costs, and expenses.



ARTICLE VIII. APPLICABLE LAW



8.1    This Agreement shall be construed and the provisions hereof interpreted
under and in accordance with the laws of the State of Connecticut.


8.2    This Agreement, its terms and definitions, shall be subject to the

9.1    This Agreement shall continue in full force and effect until the first
to occur of:


A.     Termination by any party for any reason upon six-months advance
written notice delivered to the other parties; or


B.     Termination by Hartford by written notice to the Fund, the
Adviser or the Distributor with respect to any Series in the event any of the
Series' shares are not registered, issued or sold in accordance with applicable
state and/or federal law, or such law precludes the use of such shares as the
underlying investment medium of the Contracts issued or to be issued by
Hartford; or,


C.     Termination by Hartford upon written notice to the Fund with
respect to any Series in the event that such Series ceases to qualify as a
Regulated Investment Company under Subchapter M of the Code or under any
successor or similar provision; or


D.     Termination by Hartford upon written notice to the Fund and the
Distributor with respect to any Series in the event that such Fund fails to
meet the diversification requirements specified in Section 5.1 of this
Agreement.


E.     Termination upon mutual written agreement of the parties to
this Agreement.


15





9.2    Effect of Termination.


A.     Notwithstanding any termination of this Agreement, the Fund
shall, at the option of Hartford, continue to make available additional shares
of the Series pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, for all
Contracts in effect on the effective date of termination of this Agreement (the
"Existing Contracts") unless such further sale of Series shares is proscribed
by law, regulation or applicable regulatory body. Specifically, without
limitation, the owners of the Existing Contracts will be permitted to direct
allocation and reallocation of investments in the Fund, redeem investments in
the Series and invest in the Series through additional purchase payments.


B.     Hartford agrees not to redeem Series shares attributable to the
Contracts except (i) as necessary to implement Contract owner initiated or
approved transactions, or (ii) as required by state and/or federal laws or
regulations or judicial or other legal precedent of general application or

(iii) as permitted by an order of the SEC. Upon request, Hartford will promptly
furnish to the Fund the opinion of counsel for Hartford to the effect that any
redemption pursuant to clause (ii) above is a legally required redemption.


C.     In addition to the foregoing, Article VII Indemnification shall
survive any termination of this Agreement.

RE:    HARTFORD LIFE AND ANNUITY INSURANCE COMPANY SEPARATE ACCOUNT SEVEN
FILE NO. 333-76423



Dear Sir/Madam:


I have acted as General Counsel to Hartford Life and Annuity Insurance Company
(the "Company"), a Connecticut insurance company, and Separate Account Seven
(the "Account") in Connecticut with the registration of an indefinite amount of
securities in the form of variable annuity contracts (the "Contracts") with the
Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
I have examined such documents (including the Form N-4 registration statement)
and reviewed such questions of law as I considered necessary and appropriate,
and on the basis of such examination and review, it is my opinion that:


1.     The Company is a corporation duly organized and validly existing as a
stock life insurance company under the laws of the State of Connecticut
and is duly authorized by the Insurance Department of the State of
Connecticut to issue the Contracts.


2.     The Account is a duly authorized and existing separate account
established pursuant to the provisions of Section 38a-433 of the
Connecticut Statutes.


3.     To the extent so provided under the Contracts, that portion of the assets
of the Account equal to the reserves and other contract liabilities with
respect to the Account will not be chargeable with liabilities arising
out of any other business that the Company may conduct.


4.     The Contracts, when issued as contemplated by the Form N-4 Registration
Statement, will constitute legal, validly issued and binding obligations
of the Company.


I hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the Form N-4
registration statement for the Contracts and the Account.


Sincerely yours,






/s/ Lynda Godkin

Re:��������� See Exhibit�A
�
Dear Ms.�Skeens:
�
Presented below please find specific responses to each of your comments and questions of November�30, 2012, as well as your final comment of December�20, 2012:
�
General Comments
�
1.������������������������� COMMENT: How many people are eligible for the offer?
�
RESPONSE:� There are currently 46,048 contracts eligible for the offer.
�
2.������������������������� COMMENT: What will the average amount of the enhanced surrender value be?
�
RESPONSE:� The average amount of the Enhanced Surrender Value will be $112,135. That is $11,988 greater than the average amount of the cash surrender value provided under the contract without the enhancement.
�
3.������������������������� COMMENT: Approximately how many people and what percentage of eligible contract owners would actually receive an enhanced surrender value?
�
RESPONSE:� Assuming every contract owner eligible accepted the offer:
�
������ Nearly 100% of eligible contract owners would receive an enhanced surrender value through the program.
�




�
������ 24% will benefit from both enhanced account value and waiver of surrender charges and fees;
�
������ 24% will benefit from enhanced account value and waiver of fees;
�
������ 32% will benefit from waiver of surrender charge and fees; and
�
�� 20% will benefit from waiver of fees.
�
4.������������������������� COMMENT: Is any compensation paid to financial intermediaries?� If so, how much?
�
RESPONSE:� No.� There is no compensation paid to financial intermediaries for this program.
�
5.������������������������� COMMENT: Provide a copy of the written notice that will be sent to contract owners and any other documents or cover letters that will be sent.
�
RESPONSE:� Agreed. We have attached the current drafts of the written notices and marketing materials that, when finalized, will be sent to contract owners when the program is available. Please note that prior to launching the program and sending the attached materials to contract owners, we will file such materials as appropriate with the Securities Exchange Commission and/or the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.� The attached notices are in draft form.
�
6.������������������������� COMMENT: How long will the offer be open for?
�
RESPONSE:� Currently we do not have a date when this offer will terminate. We added a defined term �Offer Termination Date� in the supplement as the date we determine that the offer will terminate in the future.� All eligible contract owners will receive prior written notice of this date.
�
Specific Comments
�
7.������������������������� COMMENT:� The name of the program �Enhanced� Surrender Value is misleading as the value may not actually be enhanced.�� Please rename the program.
�
RESPONSE:� Registrant respectfully submits that nearly 100% of eligible contract owners who choose to accept the offer will receive an enhancement.� As noted above, everyone who accepts the offer will no longer have the fees associated to the rider or underlying contract. A percentage of those eligible will no longer have the fees and will benefit from waiver of remaining surrender charges.� Further, a percentage will benefit from the enhanced account value as well as the waiver of surrender charges and fees. Accordingly, Registrant respectfully declines to rename the program as each contract owner will receive some type of enhancement above contract level surrender value.
�
8���������������������������� COMMENT: Use either �full surrender request� or �liquidation request� but don�t use both.
�
RESPONSE:� Agreed. Registrant updated the supplement to only use the term �full surrender request.�
�
2




�
9.������������������������� COMMENT:� Add a definition of �in good order.�
�
RESPONSE:� Agreed. Registrant defined In Good Order in the supplement.
�
10.������������������ COMMENT: If there is no compensation paid to agents consider stating this in the supplement.
�
RESPONSE:� Agreed.� Registrant added disclosure in the supplement that no compensation is paid to financial intermediaries.
�
11.������������������ COMMENT:� In the 2nd�paragraph, please clarify that accepting the offer will result in termination of the contract and any benefits.
�
RESPONSE:� Agreed. Registrant clarified that the contract, riders and benefits terminate and made the disclosure prominent in bold typeset.
�
12.������������������ COMMENT:� In the 3rd�paragraph, please clarify that if you do not accept the offer that your contract and riders will continue unchanged.
�
RESPONSE:� Agreed. Registrant added disclosure that if the offer is not accepted, the contract owner does not need to take any action and the contract and riders benefits will continue.
�
13.������������������ COMMENT: Bold the sentence that states you are not required to accept this offer.
�
RESPONSE:� Agreed.� Registrant has bolded the sentence that states contract owners are not required to accept this offer.
�
14.������������������ COMMENT:� Please provide a description in the supplement of the acknowledgement form and the surrender form in the supplement and bold the sentence that states if we don�t receive the acknowledgement form and just receive the liquidation form we will process the surrender but you won�t get the enhanced value.
�
RESPONSE:� Agreed. A description of the forms has been added to the supplement with bolded disclosure that both forms must be received in order for the contract owner to receive the enhanced surrender value.
�
15.������������������ COMMENT: In the formula calculation in (b)�� state whether any applicable fees will be deducted.
�
RESPONSE:� Agreed. Disclosure was added to the formula (b)�that any applicable fees upon Surrender will be waived.
�
16.������������������ COMMENT: Please clarify at what point the Payment Base will not be increased (e.g., supplement date?).
�
3




�
RESPONSE:� Agreed. Disclosure was added that the Payment Base will be locked in as of supplement effective date.
�
17.������������������ COMMENT: In the discussion of if you plan on using the proceeds to purchase a new annuity and there will be a new surrender, please change �will� to �may.�
�
RESPONSE:� Agreed.� Registrant has changed the wording from �will� to �may.�
�
18.������������������ COMMENT: In the examples, please add an example where the contact owner does not benefit and get an enhanced surrender value.
�
RESPONSE:� Agreed. Registrant added as Example 4, an illustration where there is no additional Surrender value amount, however fees are waived.
�
19.������������������ COMMENT: Please add a description of the Life Income Benefit II rider.
�
RESPONSE:� Agreed. Registrant added disclosure describing the Lifetime Income Benefit II rider as a guaranteed benefit rider designed to help protect your investment from poor market performance through potential annual automatic Payment Base increases, provide longevity protection through Lifetime Benefit Payments, and ensure a Death Benefit equivalent to the greater of Premium Payments reduced for partial Surrenders or Contract Value.
�
20.������������������ COMMENT: Why do some filings include the prospectus and others don�t?
�
RESPONSE:� Registrant is bringing previously Great Wested products out of Great West.� We confirm that we have not made any other material changes.
�
21.������������������ COMMENT:� If the Enhanced Surrender Value program is eligible on any contracts that have a bonus feature describe how the bonus feature works with the program (will the bonus be recaptured?).
�
RESPONSE:� Certain �bonus� or Plus contracts are eligible for the program. If the offer is accepted, we will not recapture any bonuses or payment enhancements. We added disclosure that Premium Enhancements will not be recaptured.
�
22.������������������ COMMENT: If Hartford may make a better offer in the future, consider adding this disclosure.
�
RESPONSE:� Agreed. Disclosure was added in the last paragraph of the supplement that after the Offer Termination Date, we may offer different and/or more favorable programs to other contract owners.
�
23.������������������ COMMENT: Include a copy of the rider in the registration statement.
�
4




�
RESPONSE:� Agreed.� The rider is incorporated as an exhibit to the Part�C of each registration statement.
�
24.������������������ COMMENT: Please update the Powers of Attorney to include Lisa Proch.
�
RESPONSE:� Agreed.� The Powers of Attorney have been updated and incorporated into Part�C of each registration statement.
�
25.������������������ COMMENT:� Please consider adding the amount of the surrender value the customer would get in the letter that we will be sent to customers or a phone number where they could obtain it.
�
Response:� Since the actual amount of the surrender value fluctuates due to market performance we are not going to include the surrender value in the letter because we feel it will provide confusion.� The letter does include a phone number for our Annuity Customer Service area and customers can obtain the amount of the current surrender value from the customer service representatives.
�
26.������������������ Tandy Representation
�

Enhance Your Variable Annuity Options
�
The Hartford�s Enhanced Surrender Value Offer
�
You�re eligible for an offer that may enhance the surrender value of your variable annuity with The Hartford.
�
When you purchased a variable annuity with The Hartford, you most likely did so to meet your needs for the future, including retirement.
�
The Lifetime Income Builder II optional benefit you purchased as part of your variable annuity is designed to provide a stream of guaranteed lifetime income that will not decrease due to negative market performance and has the potential to increase based on increases in the Contract Value due to positive market performance.
�
Your needs may have changed since you purchased your annuity with The Hartford. For example, you may have an unexpected need for liquidity that your variable annuity doesn�t provide or you would like access to your Contract Value.
�
This brochure is designed to help provide information as you consider this offer. You should discuss this offer carefully with your financial advisor to determine whether it�s right for you.
�
Who does this offer apply to?
�
This offer applies to Director M and Leaders 3 variable annuities (generally offered between August�2006 and October�2008) with the Lifetime Income Builder II optional benefit rider.� For full eligibility rules, please refer to your prospectus supplement.
�
Being eligible does not always equate to this offer having an increased surrender value for you. This offer is entirely voluntary and you should discuss the offer with your financial advisor to determine if it�s appropriate for you.
�
What are my options?
�
1.������������� Participate in the Enhanced Surrender Value offer. If you do so, you�ll surrender your contract and either receive an amount greater than your current Contract Value or avoid incurring certain charges associated with a full surrender of your contract.
�
2.������������� Determine that you don�t want to participate in this offer. If you choose not to participate, you don�t need to do anything. We�ll continue to service your contract and are committed to honoring our obligations to you.
�
You should discuss your options with your financial advisor. This offer may not be available in all states.
�




�
Why is The Hartford making me this offer?
�
As part of the company�s long-term strategy, we are currently taking steps to reduce the risks associated with our annuity business. We also realize that for some contract holders, taking advantage of this offer may help meet current financial needs that differ from the ones you identified when you purchased your variable annuity.
�
What do I receive if I participate in this program?
�
You�ll receive the greater of:
�
������������������ Your Contract Value OR
�
������������������ Your Contract Value plus 20% of your Payment Base, not to exceed a cap of 90% of your Payment Base.
�
For the purposes of this offer, your Payment Base is locked in as of your offer date noted in the enclosed letter, and no automatic Payment Base increases will apply. The cap will be adjusted for any Partial Surrenders taken between the offer date and the Valuation Day the Enhanced Surrender Value is calculated. Your Contract Value will continue to fluctuate based on market performance.
�
If you decide not to accept this offer, your contract will retain the Lifetime Income Builder II benefit riders (including Payment Base increases, if applicable), and any benefits provided under other riders you may own including death benefits.
�
What benefits do I give up if I participate in this offer?
�
The decision to accept this offer is irrevocable and you must surrender your annuity contract.� This means that you�ll no longer be able to receive Lifetime Benefit Payments as guaranteed by your Lifetime Income Builder II rider.� Also, any death benefit guarantee ceases upon the surrender of your annuity contract.
�
How do I participate in this offer?
�
If you decide you want to accept this offer, you must complete the enclosed acknowledgement form along with a full surrender request or request to send the proceeds to another provider. While this offer is in effect, any request for a full surrender of your contract received in good order but without a completed acknowledgement form will not receive the benefit of this offer. Again, we recommend that you discuss your options and the specifics of your situation in detail with your financial advisor.
�
Is there a deadline?
�
The Hartford reserves the right to end the offer at any time; however a deadline has not been set. Prior to the offer expiring we�ll notify you in writing.
�
What should I consider as I make my decision?
�
If you participate in this offer, you will fully surrender your Director M or Leaders 3 variable annuity, as well as your Lifetime Income Builder II rider benefits, and any benefits provided under other riders you may own including death benefits. This means you�ll no longer receive Lifetime Benefit Payments and Death Benefit protection provided under the Lifetime Income Builder II rider. Your contract will be terminated and the benefits cannot be reinstated after accepting this offer.
�
This offer may not be right for everyone and you have full discretion regarding whether to accept this offer or not. We�ll continue to honor all of our financial obligations to our contract holders and are here to support you as you consult with your financial advisor to determine what the right decision is for you.
�




�
Additional details are available in the prospectus and prospectus supplement you recently received.

EXAMPLES:
�
Upon a full surrender, the Offer provides the greater of:
�
(1)�the Contract Value (CV) plus 20% of the Payment Base (PB), capped at 90% of Payment Base
(2)�the Contract Value, applicable charges will be waived
�
Example #1 � Offer is the contract value plus 20% of the PB
Contract Value = $60,000
Payment Base = $100,000
90% of Payment Base = $90,000
(CV) $60,000 + (20% x (PB) $100,000) = $80,000
Offer = $80,000
�
Example #2 � Offer is capped at 90% of the PB
Contract Value = $80,000
Payment Base = $110,000
90% of Payment Base = $99,000
(CV) $80,000 + (20% x (PB) $110,000) = $102,000
Offer = $99,000
�
Example #2 � Offer is contract value, applicable charges waived
Contract Value = $120,000
Payment Base = $125,000
90% of Payment Base = 112,500
The Contract Value is already above the ESV cap of 90% of the PB
Offer = $120,000

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
The following is a summary of the application. The complete application is available for a fee from the Commission's Public Reference Branch, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549-0102 (telephone (202) 942-8090).
Applicants' Representations
1. Hartford Life is a stock life insurance company engaged in the business of writing life insurance and annuities, both individual and group, in all states and the District of Columbia. Hartford Life is ultimately controlled by Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation whose stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Hartford Life is the depositor and sponsor of HL Account Two, HL Account Seven and the Putnam Account.
2. Hartford L&A is a stock life insurance company engaged in the business of writing individual and group life insurance and annuity contracts in the District of Columbia and all states but New York. Hartford L&A  is ultimately controlled by Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation whose stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Hartford L&A is the depositor and sponsor of HLA Account One, HLA Account Seven and Putnam Account Two.
3. Each Account was established either by Hartford Life or Hartford L&A  as a separate account and is registered under the Act as a unit investment trust on Form N-4. Each Account is divided into a number of subaccounts that invest exclusively in shares representing an interest in a separate corresponding investment portfolio (each, a “Portfolio”) of one of several series-type open-end management investment companies. The assets of each Account support several varieties of variable annuity contracts, including the Contracts.
4. HSDCI is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hartford Life. It serves as the principal underwriter of a number of Hartford Life and Hartford L&A separate accounts registered as unit investment trusts under the Act, including the Accounts, and is the distributor of the variable life insurance contracts and variable annuity contracts issued through such separate accounts, including the Contracts. HSDCI is registered as a broker-dealer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and is a member of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (the “NASD”). In addition, each Future Underwriter will be registered as a broker-dealer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and a member of the NASD.
5. The Contracts are flexible premium variable annuity contracts that Hartford Life or Hartford L&A  may issue to individuals or groups on a “non-qualified” basis or in connection with employee benefit plans that receive favorable federal income tax treatment under Sections 401, 403(b), 408, 408A or 457 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). The Contracts make available a number of subaccounts of an Account to which owners may allocate net premium payments and associated credits and to which owners may transfer contract value. The Contracts also offer fixed-interest allocation options under which Hartford Life or Hartford L&A  credits guaranteed rates of interest for periods of one year or more. Transfers of contract value among and between the subaccounts and, subject to certain restrictions, among and between the subaccounts and the fixed-interest options, may be made at any time. The Contracts offer a variety of fixed and variable annuity payment options to owners. In the event of an owner's or annuitant's death prior to the annuity Start Printed Page 56349commencement date, beneficiaries may elect to receive death benefits in the form of one of the annuity payment options instead of a lump sum.
6. The Contracts generally may only be purchased with a minimum initial premium of $10,000. Hartford Life or Hartford L&A  may deduct a premium tax charge from premium payments in certain states, but otherwise deducts a charge for premium taxes upon surrender or annuitization of the Contract or upon the payment of a death benefit, depending upon the jurisdiction. The Contracts provide for an annual contract maintenance fee of $30 that Hartford Life or Hartford L&A  deducts on each Contract Anniversary and upon a full surrender of a Contract, a daily administrative charge deducted from the assets of each Account at an annual rate of up to 0.15% of such Accounts' average daily net assets and a daily mortality and expense risk charge deducted from the assets of each Account at annual rates ranging from 1.45% to 1.60% of such  Accounts' average daily net assets. The Contracts also provide for a charge of $25 for each transfer of contract value in excess of 12 per contract year. An optional death benefit rider is available with the Contracts. If purchased, the charge for the optional death benefit is 0.15% of the applicable Account's average daily net assets.
7. The Contracts have a surrender charge in the form of a contingent deferred sales charge (“CDSC”). The CDSC is equal to the percentage of each premium payment surrendered or withdrawn as specified in the table below. The CDSC is separately calculated and applied to each premium payment at any time that the payment (or part of the payment) is surrendered or withdrawn. The CDSC applicable to each premium payment diminishes as the payment ages beyond four years. No CDSC applies to contract value representing an annual withdrawal amount or to contract value in excess of aggregate premium payments (less prior withdrawals of premium payments) (“earnings”).
Number of years since payment of each premiumCharge  (In percent)18.028.038.048.057.066.075.08 and over0.0
During the first seven contract years, the CDSC is calculated using the assumption that contract value is withdrawn in the following order: (1) The annual withdrawal amount for that contract year, (2) premium payments, (3) bonus credits (explained below), and (4) earnings. Starting in the eighth contract year, the CDSC is calculated using the assumption that contract value is withdrawn in the following order: (1) The annual withdrawal amount for that contract year, (2) earnings, (3) premium payments no longer subject to a CDSC, (4) bonus credits on premium payments no longer subject to a CDSC, (5) premium payments still subject to a CDSC, and (6) bonus credits on premium payments still subject to a CDSC. In all contract years, the CDSC is calculated using the assumption that premium payments are withdrawn on a first-in, first-out basis. The annual withdrawal amount is 10% of premium payments still subject to a CDSC measured at the time of withdrawal.
8. If an owner or annuitant dies before the annuity commencement date, the Contracts provide, under most circumstances, for a death benefit payable to a beneficiary. The death benefit is the greatest of (1), (2) or (3) (or (4), if the optional death benefit rider is purchased), computed as of the date that Hartford Life or Hartford L&A  receives proof of death, where:
(1) Contract value reduced by the amount of any bonus credit applied during the twelve months prior to the date of computation;
(2) Total premiums payments reduced by the amount of all withdrawals of contact value;
(3) The maximum anniversary value (as defined in the Contract), reduced by the amount of any bonus credits applied during the twelve months prior to the date of computation; or
(4) Interest accumulation value (as defined in the Contract).
9. The Contracts include a bonus payment provision pursuant to which Hartford Life or Hartford L&A  credits an owner's contract value with an additional amount when a net premium payment is applied. The amount of the bonus payment is a percentage of each premium payment made by the owner. The percentage is a function of premiums received under a Contract, as shown in the following table.
Aggregate premiumsCredit  (in percent)From $10,000 to $49,9993.0$50,000 or more4.0
If a premium payment raises the amount of aggregate payments above $49,999, then Hartford Life or Hartford L&A will add another bonus credit to the owner's contract value in an amount equal to 1% of the prior premium payments.
10. Hartford Life or Hartford L&A recaptures or retains the credited amount in the event that the owner exercises his or her cancellation right during the right to examine period. In addition the owner elects to annuitize the Contract, the amount applied to purchase any annuity payment option is the contract value less bonus credits applied during the twenty-four months prior to annuitization. Also, as indicated above, in computing death benefits, Hartford Life or Hartford L&A may “recapture” bonus credits applied within twelve months prior to the date as of which the death benefit is computed. Finally, in the event of a surrender or withdrawal of contract value where the surrender charge is waived due to the owner's or annuitant's confinement to a hospital, nursing home or other long-term care facility (as defined in the Contract), Hartford Life or Hartford L&A will “recapture” all bonus credits applied during the period of confinement (a “confinement period”).
11. As a result of the recapture provisions, increases in the value of accumulation units representing bonus credits accrue to the owner immediately, but the initial value of such units only belongs to the owner when, or to the extent that, the recapture period for the bonus payment expires and the units vest. On the other hand, decreases in the value of accumulation units representing bonus credits do not diminish the dollar amount of contract value subject to recapture. Therefore, additional units must become subject to recapture as their value decreases and the proportionate share of any owner's variable contract value (or the owner's interest in an Account) that Hartford Life or Hartford L&A can “recapture” increases as variable contract value (or the owner's interest in an Account) decreases. This dilutes the owner's interest in the Account vis-a-vis Hartford Life or Hartford L&A and in his or her variable contract value vis-a-vis Hartford Life or Hartford L&A.
12. Because it is not administratively feasible to track the value of bonus credits in an Account that have not vested, Hartford Life or Hartford L&A deducts the daily mortality and expense risk charge and the daily administrative charge from the entire net asset value of the Accounts. As a result, the daily mortality and expense risk charge and the daily administrative charge paid by any owner is greater than that which he Start Printed Page 56350or she would pay without the bonus credit.
13. Applicants request that the Commission issue an order pursuant to section 6(c) of the Act, exempting them as well as Future Accounts and Future Underwriters from the provisions of sections 2(a)(32), 22(c) and 27(i)(2)(A) of the Act and Rule 22c-1 thereunder, to the extent necessary to permit the recapture of certain credits applied to premium payments made in consideration of the Contracts and Future Contracts.
Applicants' Legal Analysis
1. Subsection (i) of section 27 provides that section 27 does not apply to any registered separate account supporting variable annuity contracts, or to the sponsoring insurance company and principal underwriter of such account, except as provided in paragraph (2) of subsection (i). Paragraph (2) provides that it shall be unlawful for a registered separate account or sponsoring insurance company to sell a variable annuity contract supported by the separate account unless, among other things, the contract is a redeemable security. Section 2(a)(32) defines a “redeemable security” as any security, other than short-term paper, under the terms of which the holder, upon presentation to the issuer, is entitled to receive approximately his proportionate share of the issuer's current net assets, or the cash equivalent thereof.
2. Section 22(c) of the Act authorizes the Commission to make rules and regulations applicable to registered investment companies and to principal underwriters of, and dealers in, the redeemable securities of any registered investment company. Rule 22c-1 thereunder imposes requirements with respect to both the amount payable on redemption of a redeemable security and the time as of which such amount is calculated. Specifically, Rule 22c-1, in pertinent part, prohibits a registered investment company issuing any redeemable security, a person designated in such issuer's prospectus as authorized to consummate transactions in any such security, and a principal underwriter of, or dealer in, such security from selling, redeeming or repurchasing any such security, except at a price based on the current net asset value of such security which is next computed after receipt of a tender of such security for redemption, or of an order to purchase or sell such security.
3. Section 6(c) of the Act authorizes the Commission to exempt any person, security, or transaction or any class of persons, securities, or transactions from any provision or provisions of the Act and/or any rule under it if, and to the extent that, such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act.
4. Applicants assert that the requested exemptions are appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act.
5. Applicants assert that the recapture of bonus credits would not, at any time, deprive an owner of his or her proportionate share of the current net assets of an Account. Until the appropriate recapture period expires, Hartford Life or Hartford L&A retains the right to and interest in each owner's contract value representing the dollar amount of any unvested bonus credits. Therefore, if Hartford Life or Hartford L&A recaptures any bonus credit or part of a bonus credit in the circumstances described above, it would merely be retrieving its own assets. Hartford Life or Hartford L&A would grant bonus credits out of its general account assets and the amount of the credits (although not the earnings on such amounts) would remain Hartford Life's or Hartford L&A's until such amounts vest with the owner. Thus, to the extent that Hartford Life or Hartford L&A may grant and recapture bonus credits in connection with variable contract value, it would not, at either time, deprive any owner of his or her then proportionate share of an Account's assets.
6. Applicants state that the nature of the bonus recapture provisions as they apply to variable contract value dictate that an owner will obtain a benefit from a bonus credit in a rising market because any earnings on the bonus credit amount will vest immediately and over time cause the owner's share of both the Contract's variable contract value and an Account's net assets to be greater on a relative basis than it would have been without the bonus credit. Conversely, in a falling market an owner will suffer a detriment from a bonus credit because losses on the bonus credit amount also will “vest” immediately and cause the owner's share of both the Contract's variable contract value and the Account's net assets to decrease on a relative basis.
7. Applicants do not believe that the dynamics of Hartford Life's and Hartford L&A's proposed bonus credit provisions violate sections 2(a)(32) or 27(i)(2)(A) of the Act. Nonetheless, in order to avoid any uncertainty as to full compliance with the Act, Applicants seek exemptions from these two sections.
8. Hartford Life's or Hartford L&A's recapture of any bonus credit could be viewed as the redemption of such an interest at a price other than net asset value. If such is the case, then the bonus credit provisions could be viewed as conflicting with section 22(c) of the Act and Rule 22c-1 thereunder. Applicants believe that the recapture of the bonus credits does not violate section 22(c) of the Act or Rule 22c-1 thereunder. Nonetheless, in order to avoid any uncertainty as to full compliance with the Act, Applicants seek exemptions from section 22(c) and Rule 22c-1.
9. Applicants argue that the bonus credit recapture provisions do not give rise to the evils that Rule 22c-1 was designated to address. The Rule was intended to eliminate or reduce, as far as was reasonably practicable, the dilution of the value of outstanding redeemable securities of registered investment companies through their redemption at a price above net asset value, or other unfair results, including speculative trading practices. The evils prompting the adoption of Rule 22c-1 were primarily the result of backward pricing, the practice of basing the price of a mutual fund share on the net asset value per share determined as of the close of the market on the previous day. Backward pricing permitted certain investors to take advantage of increases or decreases in net asset value that were not yet reflected in the price, thereby diluting the values of outstanding shares. The proposed bonus credit recapture provisions pose no such threat of dilution.
10. Recaptures of bonus credits result in a redemption of Hartford Life's or Hartford L&A's interest in an owner's contract value or in an Account at a price determined on the basis of the Account's current net asset value and not at an inflated price. Moreover, Applicants represent that the amount recaptured will always equal the amount that Hartford Life or Hartford L&A paid from its general account for the credits. Similarly, although owners are entitled to retain any investment gains attributable to the bonus credits, the amount of such gains would always be computed at a price determined on the basis of net asset value.
11. Applicants assert that even if the proposed bonus credit provisions conflict with sections 2(a)(32), 22(c) or 27(i)(2)(A) of the Act or Rule 22c-1 thereunder, the Commission should grant the exemptions because the bonus credit provisions are generally favorable for prospective owners. The bonus credits are beneficial to prospective Start Printed Page 56351owners. The recapture provisions do not, on balance, diminish the overall value of the bonus credit provisions and are fully disclosed in the prospectus for the Contracts.
12. Applicants assert that the bonus credit recapture provisions are necessary if Hartford Life or Hartford L&A are to offer the bonus credits. it would be unfair to Hartford Life or Hartford L&A to permit owners to keep their bonus credits upon their exercise of the Contracts' right to examine provision. Because no CDSC applies to the exercise of the right to examine provision, the owner could obtain a quick profit in the amount of the bonus credit at Hartford Life's or Hartford L&A's expense by exercising that right. Likewise, because no additional CDSC applies upon death of an owner or annuitant or upon annuitization, and no CDSC applies during a confinement period, such a death, annuitization or confinement period surrender or withdrawal shortly after the award of bonus credits would afford an owner or a beneficiary a similar profit. In the event of such profits to owners or beneficiaries, Hartford Life and Hartford L&A could not recover the cost of granting the bonus credits. This is because Hartford Life and Hartford L&A both intend to recoup the costs of providing the bonus credits through the charges under the Contract, particularly the daily mortality and expense risk charge and the daily administrative charge. If the profits described above are permitted, certain owners could take advantage of them, greatly reducing the base from which the daily charges are deducted and greatly increasing the amount of bonus credits that Hartford Life and Hartford L&A must provide. Therefore, the recapture provisions are the price of offering the bonus credits. Hartford Life and Hartford Life and Hartford L&A simply cannot offer the proposed bonus credits without the ability to recapture those credits in the limited circumstances described herein.
13. Applicants assert that the Commission's authority under Section 6(c) of the Act to grant exemptions from various provisions of the Act and rules thereunder is broad enough to permit orders of exemption that cover classes of unidentified persons. Applicants request an order of the Commission that would exempt them, Future Accounts and Future Underwriters from the provisions of sections 2(a)(32), 22(c) and 27(i)(2)(A) of the Act and Rule 22c-1 thereunder. The exemption of these classes of persons is appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act because all of the potential members of the class could obtain the foregoing exemptions for themselves on the same basis as the Applicants, but only at a cost to each of them that is not justified by any public policy purpose. The Commission has previously granted exemptions to classes of similarly situated persons in various contexts and in a wide variety of circumstances, including future exemptions for recapturing bonus credits under variable annuity contracts.
14. Applicants represent that Future Contracts will be substantially similar in all material respects to the Contracts and that each factual statement and representation about the bonus credit provisions of the Contracts will be equally true of Future Contracts. Applicants also represent that each material representation made by them about Hartford Life and Hartford L&A, each Account and HSDCI will be equally true of Future Accounts and Future Underwriters, to the extent that such representations relate to the issues discussed in this application.
Conclusion
Applicants request that the Commission issue an order pursuant to section 6(c) of the Act exempting them as well as Future Accounts and Future Underwriters from the provisions of sections 2(a)(32), 22(c) and 27(i)(2)(A) of the Act and Rule 22c-1 thereunder, to the extent necessary to permit the recapture of certain credits applied to purchase payments made in consideration of the Contracts and Future Contracts.
Applicants assert, based on the grounds summarized above, that their exemptive request meets the standards set out in section 6(c) of the 1940 Act, namely, that the exemptions requested are necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act.

Applicants' Representations
1. Hartford Life is a stock life insurance company incorporated under the laws of the state of Connecticut. Hartford Life was engaged in the business of writing individual and group life insurance and annuity contracts until April 30, 2013, and remains authorized to do business in every state and the District of Columbia. Hartford Life is an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. (“The Hartford”), a Delaware corporation whose stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange.
2. Hartford Life and Annuity is a stock life insurance company incorporated under the laws of the state of Connecticut. Hartford Life and Annuity was engaged in the business of writing individual and group life insurance and annuity contracts until April 30, 2013, and remains authorized to do business in every state (except New York), the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Hartford Life and Annuity is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of The Hartford.
3. Hartford Life established HL Separate Account 3 and HL Separate Account 7 as segregated asset accounts under Connecticut law on June 22, 1994 and December 8, 1986, respectively. Hartford Life and Annuity established HLA Separate Account 3 and HLA Separate Account 7 as segregated asset accounts under Connecticut law on June 22, 1994 and April 1, 1999, respectively. Each of the Separate Accounts meets the definition of “separate account,” as defined in Section 2(a)(37) of the Act. The Separate Accounts are registered with the Commission under the Act as unit investment trusts. The assets of the Separate Accounts support the Contracts and interests in the Separate Accounts offered through such Contracts. The Separate Accounts are segmented into subaccounts, and certain of these subaccounts invest in the Existing Portfolios. The Contracts are individual and group deferred variable Start Printed Page 90399annuity contracts, with group participants acquiring certain ownership rights as described in the group contract or plan documents. Contract owners and participants in group contracts (each, a “Contract owner,” and collectively, “Contract owners”) may allocate some or all of their Contract value to one or more subaccounts available as investment options under their respective Contracts and any rider(s).
4. By the terms of each Contract (and as set forth in the prospectuses for the Contracts), the Hartford Insurance Companies reserve the right to substitute shares of another registered investment company for the shares of any registered investment company already purchased or to be purchased in the future by the Separate Accounts.
5. The Trust is a Delaware statutory trust that was established on January 13, 2012. The Trust is registered with the Commission as an open-end management investment company under the Act and its shares are registered under the Securities Act of 1933. The Trust is a series investment company and currently has twenty-four (24) separate portfolios (each a “HIMCO VIT Fund,” and collectively, the “HIMCO VIT Funds”). Five (5) HIMCO VIT Funds comprise the Replacement Portfolios.
6. HIMCO, a Delaware corporation and a registered investment adviser, serves as investment adviser to each of the HIMCO VIT Funds pursuant to an investment advisory agreement between the Trust, on behalf of each HIMCO VIT Fund, and HIMCO. In addition, the Trust has obtained an exemptive order from the Commission (File No. 812-11684) (the “Manager of Managers Order”). The Replacement Portfolios may rely on the the Manager of Managers Order, and the Trust's registration statement discloses and explains the existence, substance and effect of the Manager of Managers Order.[1] 

7. The Section 26 Applicants propose to substitute shares of the Existing Portfolios with shares of the corresponding Replacement Portfolios, as shown in the table below. As discussed in greater detail in the application, the Section 26 Applicants believe that each Existing Portfolio has substantially similar investment objectives, principal investment strategies, and principal investment risks, and has substantially similar risk and return characteristics, as its corresponding Replacement Portfolio.

8. The Hartford Insurance Companies state that the proposed Substitutions are intended to improve the administrative efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the Contracts, as well as to make the Contracts more attractive to existing Contract owners. Applicants state that by eliminating overlapping investment options that duplicate one another by having substantially similar investment objectives, strategies and risks, the Hartford Insurance Companies can present a more streamlined menu of investment options under the Contracts. Applicants further state that since the proposed Substitutions were designed to reduce investment-option redundancy, the diversity of available investment styles under the Contracts will not be adversely impacted. Additional information for each Existing Portfolio and the corresponding Replacement Portfolio, including investment objectives, principal investment strategies, principal risks, and fees can be found in the application.
9. Applicants state that through the proposed Substitutions, the Hartford Insurance Companies seek to replace certain investment options in the Contracts' current fund lineups with investment options that will provide Contract owners with lower expenses, while maintaining a high-quality menu of investment options. In this regard, the Section 26 Applicants believe that Contract owners with Contract value allocated to the subaccounts of the Existing Portfolios will have lower total and net annual operating expenses immediately after the proposed Substitutions than before the proposed Substitutions. Applicants also state that, for each Substitution, the combined management fee and Rule 12b-1 fee of each Replacement Portfolio is lower than that of the corresponding Existing Portfolio. The application sets forth the fees and expenses of each Existing Portfolio and its corresponding Replacement Portfolio in greater detail.
10. The Section 26 Applicants also agree that, during a period of two (2) years following the implementation of the proposed Substitution (the “Substitution Date”), and for those Contracts with assets allocated to an Existing Portfolio on the Substitution Date, the Hartford Insurance Companies will reimburse, on the last business day of each fiscal quarter, the owners of those Contracts invested in the applicable Replacement Portfolio to the extent that the Replacement Portfolio's total net annual operating expenses (taking into account fee waivers and expense reimbursements) for such period exceeds, on an annualized basis, the total net annual operating expenses of the Existing Portfolio for fiscal year 2015. In addition, the Hartford Insurance Companies will not increase the Contract fees and charges that would otherwise be assessed under the terms of those Contracts for a period of at least two (2) years following the Substitution Date.
11. Applicants state that the Hartford Insurance Companies or their affiliates will pay all expenses and transaction costs of the proposed Substitutions, including legal and accounting expenses, any applicable brokerage expenses and other fees and expenses. Applicants state that no fees or charges will be assessed to the affected Contract owners to effect the proposed Substitutions. Applicants state that the proposed Substitutions will not cause the Contract fees and charges currently being paid by existing Contract owners to be greater after the Substitutions than before the Substitutions.
12. Applicants state that the Contract value of each Contract owner affected by the proposed Substitutions will not change as a result of the proposed Substitutions. Applicants state that, because the Substitutions will occur at relative net asset value, and the fees and charges under the Contracts will not change as a result of the Substitutions, the benefits offered by the guarantees under the Contracts will be the same immediately before and after the Substitutions. Applicants further state that what effect the Substitutions may have on the value of the benefits offered by the Contract guarantees would depend, among other things, on the relative future performance of each Existing Portfolio and Replacement Portfolio, which the Section 26 Applicants cannot predict. Nevertheless, the Section 26 Applicants note that at the time of the Substitutions, the Contracts will offer a comparable variety of investment options with as broad a range of risk/return characteristics.
13. At least 30 days prior to the Substitution Date, Contract owners will be notified via prospectus supplements, which will be filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 497 under the Securities Act of 1933, that the Section 26 Applicants received or expect to receive Commission approval of the applicable proposed Substitutions and of the anticipated Substitution Date (the “Pre-Substitution Notice”). The Pre-Substitution Notice will advise Contract owners that Contract values attributable to investments in the Existing Portfolios will be transferred to the Replacement Portfolios, without any charge that would otherwise apply and without being subject to any limitations on transfers, on the Substitution Date. The Pre-Substitution Notice also will state that, from the date of the Pre-Substitution Notice through the date thirty (30) days after the Substitutions, Contract owners may transfer Contract value from the subaccounts investing in the Existing Portfolios (before the Substitutions) or the Replacement Portfolios (after the Substitutions) to any other available investment option without charge and without imposing any transfer limitations.
14. The Section 26 Applicants will also deliver to affected Contract owners, at least thirty (30) days before the Substitution Date, a prospectus for each applicable Replacement Portfolio. In addition, within five (5) business days after the Substitution Date, Contract owners whose assets are allocated to a Replacement Portfolio as part of the proposed Substitutions will be sent a written notice (each, a “Confirmation”) informing them that the Substitutions were carried out as previously notified. The Confirmation will also restate the information set forth in the Pre-Substitution Notice. The Confirmation will also reflect the Contract owners Contract values before and after the Substitution(s).Start Printed Page 90401

15. Each Substitution will be effected at the relative net asset values of the respective shares of the Replacement Portfolios in conformity with Section 22(c) of the 1940 Act and Rule 22c-1 thereunder without the imposition of any transfer or similar charges by the Section 26 Applicants. The Substitutions will be effected without change in the amount or value of any Contracts held by affected Contract owners. As such, the Section 26 Applicants believe that the procedures to be implemented are sufficient to assure that each Contract owner's cash values immediately after the Substitution will be equal to the cash value immediately before the Substitution. As of the Substitution Date, the Separate Accounts will redeem shares of the Existing Portfolios for cash or in-kind. The proceeds of such redemptions will then be used to purchase shares of the corresponding Replacement Portfolio, as each subaccount of the Separate Accounts will invest the proceeds of its redemption from the Existing Portfolios in the applicable Replacement Portfolios.
Legal Analysis
1. The Section 26 Applicants request that the Commission issue an order pursuant to section 26(c) of the Act approving the proposed Substitutions. Section 26(c) of the Act prohibits any depositor or trustee of a unit investment trust holding the security of a single issuer from substituting another security of another issuer without the approval of the Commission. Section 26(c) provides that such approval shall be granted by order of the Commission “if the evidence establishes that [the substitution] is consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of [the Act].”
2. The Section 26 Applicants submit that each of the Substitutions meet the standards set forth in section 26(c) and that, if implemented, the Substitutions would not raise any of the concerns underlying this provision. The Section 26 Applicants believe that each Replacement Portfolio and its corresponding Existing Portfolio(s) have substantially similar investment objectives, principal investment strategies and principal risks. Applicants state that, accordingly, no Contract owner will involuntarily lose his or her rider(s) as a result of any proposed Substitution. Contract owners will not incur any fees or charges as a result of the proposed Substitutions.
3. The Section 17 Applicants request that the Commission issue an order pursuant to section 17(b) of the Act exempting them from section 17(a) of the Act to the extent necessary to permit them to carry out, as part of the Substitutions, the In-Kind Transactions. Section 17(a)(1) of the Act prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company, or any affiliated person of such person, acting as principal, from selling any security or other property to such registered investment company. Section 17(a)(2) of the Act prohibits any of the persons described above, acting as principals, from purchasing any security or other property from such registered investment company.
4. Because the proposed Substitutions may be effected, in whole or in part, by means of in-kind redemptions and purchases, the proposed Substitutions may be deemed to involve one or more purchases or sales of securities or property between affiliated persons. The proposed transactions may involve a transfer of portfolio securities by the Existing Portfolios to the Separate Accounts. Immediately thereafter, the Separate Accounts would purchase shares of the Replacement Portfolios with the portfolio securities received from the Existing Portfolios. Accordingly, to the extent the Separate Accounts and the Existing Portfolios, and the Separate Accounts and the Replacement Portfolios, are deemed to be affiliated persons of one another under Section 2(a)(3) of the Act, it is conceivable that this aspect of the proposed Substitutions could be viewed as being prohibited by Section 17(a). As such, the Section 17 Applicants have determined that it is prudent to seek relief from Section 17(a) in the context of this application.
5. The Section 17 Applicants maintain that the terms of the proposed In-Kind Transactions, including the consideration to be paid by each Existing Portfolio and received by each Replacement Portfolio involved, are reasonable, fair and do not involve overreaching, principally because the transactions will conform with all but one of the conditions enumerated in Rule 17a-7. The In-Kind Transactions will take place at relative net asset value in conformity with the requirements of Section 22(c) of the Act and Rule 22c-1 thereunder without the imposition of any transfer or similar charges by the Section 26 Applicants. The Substitutions will be effected without change in the amount or value of any Contract held by the affected Contract owners. The Substitutions will in no way alter the tax treatment of affected Contract owners in connection with their Contracts, and no tax liability will arise for Contract owners as a result of the Substitutions. The fees and charges under the Contracts will not increase because of the Substitutions. Even though the Separate Accounts, the Hartford Insurance Companies and the Trust may not rely on Rule 17a-7, the Section 17 Applicants believe that the Rule's conditions outline the type of safeguards that result in transactions that are fair and reasonable to registered investment company participants and preclude overreaching in connection with an investment company by its affiliated persons.
6. The Section 17 Applicants submit that the proposed in-kind purchases by the Separate Accounts are consistent with the policies of the Trust and the Replacement Portfolios, as recited in the Trust's current registration statement and reports filed under the Act. Finally, the Section 17 Applicants submit that the proposed Substitutions are consistent with the general purposes of the Act.
Applicants' Conditions
The Section 26 Applicants, and HIMCO as applicable, agree that any order granting the requested relief will be subject to the following conditions.
1. The Substitutions will not be effected unless the Section 26 Applicants determine that: (i) The Contracts allow the substitution of shares of registered open-end investment companies in the manner contemplated by this application; (ii) the Substitutions can be consummated as described in this application under applicable insurance laws; and (iii) any regulatory requirements in each jurisdiction where the Contracts are qualified for sale have been complied with to the extent necessary to complete the Substitutions.
2. The Hartford Insurance Companies will seek approval of the proposed Substitutions from any state insurance regulators whose approval may be necessary or appropriate.
3. HIMCO will not change a sub-adviser, add a new sub-adviser, or otherwise rely on the Manager of Managers Order or any replacement order from the Commission with respect to any Replacement Portfolio without first obtaining shareholder approval of the change in sub-adviser, the new sub-adviser, or the Replacement Portfolio's ability to add or to replace a sub-adviser at a shareholder meeting, the record date for which shall be after the proposed Substitution has been effected.
4. The Hartford Insurance Companies or their affiliates will pay all expenses and transaction costs of the Substitutions, including legal and Start Printed Page 90402accounting expenses, any applicable brokerage expenses and other fees and expenses. No fees or charges will be assessed to the affected Contract owners to effect the Substitutions. The proposed Substitutions will not cause the Contract fees and charges currently being paid by Contract owners to be greater after the proposed Substitution than before the proposed Substitution.
5. The Substitutions will be effected at the relative net asset values of the respective shares of the Replacement Portfolios in conformity with Section 22(c) of the 1940 Act and Rule 22c-1 thereunder without the imposition of any transfer or similar charges by the Section 26 Applicants. The Substitutions will be effected without change in the amount or value of any Contracts held by affected Contract owners.
6. The Substitutions will in no way alter the tax treatment of affected Contract owners in connection with their Contracts, and no tax liability will arise for Contract owners as a result of the Substitutions.
7. The obligations of the Section 26 Applicants, and the rights of the affected Contract owners, under the Contracts of affected Contract owners will not be altered in any way.
8. Affected Contract owners will be permitted to transfer Contract value from the subaccount investing in the Existing Portfolio (before Substitution Date) or the Replacement Portfolio (after the Substitution Date) to any other available investment option under the Contract without charge for a period beginning at least 30 days before the Substitution Date through at least 30 days following the Substitution Date. Contract owners with guaranteed living and/or death benefit riders, as applicable, may transfer Contract value from the subaccounts investing in the Existing Portfolios (before the Substitutions) or the Replacement Portfolios (after the Substitutions) to any other available investment option available under their respective riders without charge and without imposing any transfer limitations. Except as described in any market timing/short-term trading provisions of the relevant prospectus, the Section 26 Applicants will not exercise any rights reserved under the Contracts to impose restrictions on transfers between the subaccounts under the Contracts, including limitations on the future number of transfers, for a period beginning at least 30 days before the Substitution Date through at least 30 days following the Substitution Date.
9. All affected Contract owners will be notified, at least 30 days before the Substitution Date about: (a) The intended Substitution of Existing Portfolios with the Replacement Portfolios; (b) the intended Substitution Date; and (c) information with respect to transfers as set forth in Condition 8 above. In addition, the Section 26 Applicants will also deliver to affected Contract owners, at least thirty (30) days before the Substitution Date, a prospectus for each applicable Replacement Portfolio.
10. The Section 26 Applicants will deliver to each affected Contract owner within five (5) business days of the Substitution Date a written confirmation which will include: (a) A confirmation that the Substitutions were carried out as previously notified; (b) a restatement of the information set forth in the Pre-Substitution Notice; and (c) values of the Contract owner's positions in the Existing Portfolio before the Substitution and the Replacement Portfolio after the Substitution.
11. For a period of two years following the Substitution Date, for those Contracts with assets allocated to the Existing Portfolio on the Substitution Date, the Hartford Insurance Companies will reimburse, on the last business day of each fiscal quarter, the Contract owners whose subaccounts invest in the applicable Replacement Portfolio to the extent that the Replacement Portfolio's net annual operating expenses (taking into account fee waivers and expense reimbursements) for such period exceeds, on an annualized basis, the net annual operating expenses of the Existing Portfolio for fiscal year 2015. In addition, the Section 26 Applicants will not increase the Contract fees and charges that would otherwise be assessed under the terms of the Contracts for a period of at least two years following the Substitution Date.

History[edit]




1875 postcard calendar for the Hartford Accident Insurance Co.


The Hartford was founded in 1810 in Hartford, Connecticut. A group of local merchants gathered in a Hartford inn and, with working capital of $15,000, founded the Hartford Fire Insurance Company. The company survived some of the greatest peacetime tragedies in American history. After a huge fire destroyed New York's financial district in 1835, The Hartford's president, Eliphalet Terry, used his personal wealth to cover all of the company's damage claims. Other catastrophic events included the Chicago fire of 1871 and the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire.
The company logo shows a male deer, which in full maturity was referred to by the medieval hunting term hart. The etymology of 'Hartford' is the ford where harts cross (deer crossing). The Seal of the City of Hartford[4] likewise features a mature male deer.
Acquisitions, divestitures and related changes[edit]

1913: Formed the Hartford Accident and Indemnity Company to provide a wide variety of insurance coverage, including accident, automobile-liability, personal-damage, business-interruption and more.
1959: Expanded into the life-insurance business by acquiring The Columbian National Life Insurance Company in Boston, Massachusetts.
1970: The Hartford was acquired by ITT Corporation for $1.4 billion,[5] at the time the largest corporate takeover in American history. The combined company was renamed ITT-Hartford Group, Inc.
1995: ITT decided to streamline its operations and release some of its subsidiaries, and The Hartford became an independent entity once again, trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "HIG."
1997: Changed name from ITT-Hartford Group, Inc. to the Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc., and also issued an IPO for its Hartford Life business under the ticker symbol “HLI.”
2000: Reacquired all the shares of Hartford Life (HLI was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange in 2006).
2004: Purchased the Group Benefits Division of CNA Financial. The division was based in Chicago, Illinois.[citation needed]
March 2012: Announced it would focus on property and casualty insurance, group benefits and mutual funds, and would sell its wealth management businesses.[6]
2013: Sold its life insurance business to Prudential, retirement plans to MassMutual, and a broker-dealer to AIG.[7]
2014: Sold its Japan annuities business to Orix Life Insurance Corp.[8]

External recognition[edit]
In 2008, the Ethisphere Institute named The Hartford one of the "World’s Most Ethical Companies" for the first time,[9] and was subsequently recognized in 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012.[10]

History[edit]




1875 postcard calendar for the Hartford Accident Insurance Co.


The Hartford was founded in 1810 in Hartford, Connecticut. A group of local merchants gathered in a Hartford inn and, with working capital of $15,000, founded the Hartford Fire Insurance Company. The company survived some of the greatest peacetime tragedies in American history. After a huge fire destroyed New York's financial district in 1835, The Hartford's president, Eliphalet Terry, used his personal wealth to cover all of the company's damage claims. Other catastrophic events included the Chicago fire of 1871 and the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire.
The company logo shows a male deer, which in full maturity was referred to by the medieval hunting term hart. The etymology of 'Hartford' is the ford where harts cross (deer crossing). The Seal of the City of Hartford[4] likewise features a mature male deer.
Acquisitions, divestitures and related changes[edit]

1913: Formed the Hartford Accident and Indemnity Company to provide a wide variety of insurance coverage, including accident, automobile-liability, personal-damage, business-interruption and more.
1959: Expanded into the life-insurance business by acquiring The Columbian National Life Insurance Company in Boston, Massachusetts.
1970: The Hartford was acquired by ITT Corporation for $1.4 billion,[5] at the time the largest corporate takeover in American history. The combined company was renamed ITT-Hartford Group, Inc.
1995: ITT decided to streamline its operations and release some of its subsidiaries, and The Hartford became an independent entity once again, trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "HIG."
1997: Changed name from ITT-Hartford Group, Inc. to the Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc., and also issued an IPO for its Hartford Life business under the ticker symbol “HLI.”
2000: Reacquired all the shares of Hartford Life (HLI was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange in 2006).
2004: Purchased the Group Benefits Division of CNA Financial. The division was based in Chicago, Illinois.[citation needed]
March 2012: Announced it would focus on property and casualty insurance, group benefits and mutual funds, and would sell its wealth management businesses.[6]
2013: Sold its life insurance business to Prudential, retirement plans to MassMutual, and a broker-dealer to AIG.[7]
2014: Sold its Japan annuities business to Orix Life Insurance Corp.[8]

External recognition[edit]
In 2008, the Ethisphere Institute named The Hartford one of the "World’s Most Ethical Companies" for the first time,[9] and was subsequently recognized in 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012.[10]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
