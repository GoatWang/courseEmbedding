	NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS





	(USD In Thousands, Except Shares and Per Share Values)




	(Unaudited)



	 



	NOTE 1 – ORGANIZATIONAL AND GOING CONCERN:



	 


	Crowd 4 Seeds, Inc. (the "Company") was formed on April 11, 2014 as a Nevada corporation. During 2014 the Company issued 9,054,000 shares of its common stock, for a total consideration of $20 thousands. The Company has yet to start operational or research and development activities. The Company plans to operate in the field of crowdfunding and to run an online platform for investments in Israeli startup companies. This online platform would present startup companies in various fields. The Company plans to match up Israeli startups looking to raise funds with potential investors from all over the world seeking to make investments in such startups. Potential investors will be able to have access to the marketing information and legal and financial disclosures of any startup Company they would like to know more about. The current legislation in Israel for crowdfunding is still in process. The online service could be offered only following the final approval of the legislation.


	 


	The accompanying unaudited interim financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has suffered cumulative losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception. Until the Company will achieve profitability and revenues in the future it intends to finance its operation through the issuance of its shares which is uncertain at the moment. These conditions give rise to substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

	Basis of Presentation



	 


	The unaudited interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for interim financial statements and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. Accordingly, they do not contain all information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for annual financial statements. In the opinion of the Company’s management, the accompanying unaudited interim financial statements contain all the adjustments necessary (consisting only of normal recurring accruals) to present the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2016 and the results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full fiscal year or any future period. These unaudited interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. The Company’s accounting policies are described in the accompanying audited financial statements.


	 



	Use of Estimates



	 


	The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

	Recent Accounting Pronouncements



	 


	In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, "Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs", requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability in a manner consistent with the treatment for debt discounts. In August 2015, the FASB published ASU 2015-15 (Subtopic 835-30), "Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of Credit Arrangements", which provides additional guidance on the presentation and subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements. The standard is effective for fiscal years and the interim periods within those fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2015. The Company does not expect material impacts on its financial statements upon adoption.


	 



	NOTE 3 – PROMISSORY NOTE FROM SHAREHOLDER



	 


	The Company has an outstanding note payable provided by the major shareholder and sole officer and director which is unsecured and bears no interest. The note is payable upon demand. The shareholder has loaned $29 thousand to the Company during the current year. The outstanding balance under the note was $52 thousand as of September 30, 2016 and $23 thousand as of December 31, 2015.


	 



	NOTE 4 – COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES



	 


	In May 2014, the Company engaged a legal counsel in order to receive legal services concerning the registration statement to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). According to the agreement, the fees will be paid if and only upon receiving the first $50 thousand from external investors following the effectiveness of the registration statements. Since this expense was probable it was recorded as a provision and as expenses amounting to $50 thousand outstanding at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The legal counsel is considered to be a related party - see also note 5.


	 



	NOTE 5 – TRANSACTION WITH RELATED PARTY



	 







	 



	A.


	During the period from Inception (April 2014) and up to the balance sheet date the CEO and majority shareholder devoted approx. 20 hours per week to promote the business plan of the Company. The expense incurred by the CEO and majority shareholder on behalf and for the benefit of the Company for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 amounted to $9 thousands and $28 thousands respectively.





	 




	 




	 






	 



	B.


	The services described in note 4 are provided by a related party. The related party is the son of the major shareholder and provides legal advice to the Company. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 the liability amounted to $50 thousand – see also note 4.

	ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS




	 



	The following discussion contains certain statements that may be deemed “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements appear in a number of places in this Report, including, without limitation, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and requirements that are difficult to predict or are beyond our control. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this quarterly report. You should not put undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. We assume no responsibility to update the forward-looking statements contained in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. The following should also be read in conjunction with the unaudited Financial Statements and notes thereto that appear elsewhere in this report.



	 



	Company Overview



	 


	Crowd 4 Seeds was incorporated in Nevada on April 11, 2014. Most of the activity through September 30, 2016 involved incorporation efforts, registration to become a reporting company, planning our business and developing our website.


	 


	We are a development stage company and have limited financial resources. We have not established a source of equity or debt financing. Our financial statements include a note emphasizing the uncertainty of our ability to remain a going concern.


	 


	Crowd 4 Seeds plans to become an online platform for investments in Israeli startup companies through equity-based crowdfunding.


	 



	Results of Operation



	 




	Nine and three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to nine and three months ended September 30, 2015




	 



	Selling, General and Administrative Expenses



	 


	Selling, general and administrative expenses amounted to $61,000 and $39,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively and to $32,000 and $13,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses stems from two non-recurring payments for services.

	Since inception, most of our resources and work have been devoted to planning our business and web site development. We need additional funding to continue the implementation of our business plan. If we are unable to raise any funds, the development costs would have to be provided by our president and chief executive officer to the extent that he is capable and willing to provide such funds.


	 


	Private capital, if sought, we believe will be sought from former business associates of our president and chief executive officer or through private investors referred to us by those same business associates. To date, we have sold 804,000 shares of our common stock for $20,100 through a private placement.


	 


	If a market for our shares ever develops, of which there can be no assurances, we may use restricted shares of our common stock to compensate employees/consultants and independent contractors wherever possible. We cannot predict the likelihood or source of raising capital or funds that may be needed to complete the development of our business plan.


	 


	As a public company, we will incur ongoing expenses associated with professional fees for accounting, legal and a host of other expenses including annual reports and proxy statements, if required. We estimate that these costs will range up to $50,000 per year over the next few years and may be significantly higher if our business volume and transactional activity increases but should be lower during our first year of being public because our overall business volume (and financial transactions) will be lower, and we will not yet be subject to the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 for an opinion on our system on internal controls by our independent audit firm until we exceed $75 million in market capitalization (if ever). These obligations may reduce our ability and resources to expand our business plan and activities. We hope to be able to use our status as a public company to increase our ability to use noncash means of settling outstanding obligations (i.e. issuance of restricted shares of our common stock) and compensate independent contractors who provide professional services to us, although there can be no assurances that we will be successful in any of these efforts.


	 


	We hope to eventually be able to use our status as a public company to enable us to use non-cash means of settling obligations and compensate persons and/or firms providing services to us, although there can be no assurances that we will be successful in any of those efforts. However, these actions, if successful, will result in dilution of the ownership interests of existing shareholders, may further dilute common stock book value, and that dilution may be material. Such issuances may also serve to enhance existing management’s ability to maintain control of the Company because the shares may be issued to parties or entities committed to supporting existing management.

	As of September 30, 2016, we owed $107,000, of which $55,000 are in connection with professional services provided to us ($50,000 by a related party) and $52,000 pursuant to a unsecured, interest-free note to our Chief Executive Officer payable on demand. There are no other significant liabilities at September 30, 2016.


	 



	Going Concern



	 


	Our auditor has issued a "going concern" qualification as part of its opinion in the Audit Report for the year ending December 31, 2015, and our unaudited financial statements for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 include a "going concern" note disclosing that our ability to continue as a going concern is contingent on us being able to raise working capital to grow our operations and generate revenue.


	 



	Critical Accounting Policies



	 


	The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the financial statements and accompanying notes. The SEC has defined a company's critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company's financial condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. We believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances; however, actual results may vary from these estimates and assumptions. We have identified in Note 2 - "Summary of Accounting Policies" to the Financial Statements contained in this Quarterly Report certain critical accounting policies that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements.


	 



	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements



	 


	We have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources and would be considered material to investors.


	 



	Contractual Obligations



	 


	As a "smaller reporting company" as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, the Company is not required to provide this information.

	ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.




	 



	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures



	 


	We conducted an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. The term "disclosure controls and procedures", as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ("Exchange Act"), means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC`s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures also include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.


	 


	Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded as of September 30, 2016, that our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective at a reasonable assurance level and are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the controls and procedures will meet their objectives due to the material weaknesses described below. However, it should be noted that the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote.


	 



	Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting



	 


	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The internal controls for the Company are provided by executive management's review and approval of all transactions. Our internal control over financial reporting also includes those policies and procedures that:


	 









	(1)




	pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets;


















	(2)




	provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with the authorization of our management; and


















	(3)




	provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.





	 


	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.


	 






	 




	11














	Table of Contents





	 


	Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2016. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations ("COSO") of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Management's assessment included an evaluation of the design of our internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of these controls.


	 


	Based on this assessment, management has concluded that as of September 30, 2016, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles due to the existence of the following material weaknesses:


	 









	·



	Lack of segregation of duties







	 




	 








	·



	Lack of audit committee and independent directors







	 




	 








	·



	Management is dominated by a single individual without adequate compensating controls providing for multiple levels of supervision and review




	 


	Although we are unable to meet the standards under COSO because of the limited resources available to a company of our size, we are committed to improving our financial organization. As funds become available, we will undertake to: (1) create a position to segregate duties consistent with control objectives, (2) increase our personnel resources and technical accounting expertise within the accounting function (3) appoint one or more independent directors to our board of directors who shall be appointed to a Company audit committee resulting in a fully functioning audit committee who will undertake the oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; and (4) prepare and implement sufficient written policies and checklists which will set forth procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of US GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements.




	 


	We will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting on an ongoing basis and are committed to taking further action and implementing additional enhancements or improvements, as necessary and as funds allow

	.



	 


	This annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company's registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management's report was not subject to attestation by the Company's registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the SEC that permit the Company to provide only management's report in this annual report.


	 



	Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting



	 


	There were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  This discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting the operating results, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows of the Company for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. The discussion and analysis that follows should be read together with the section entitled "Forward Looking Statements" and our consolidated financial statements and the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.  Except for historical information, the matters discussed in this section are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties and are based upon judgments concerning various factors that are beyond the Company's control. Consequently, and because forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, the actual results and outcomes may differ materially from the results and outcomes discussed in the forward-looking statements. You are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by us in this report.  Company Overview  After change in ownership on December 30, 2016, new management plans to operate the company under the new name of "Sheng Ying Entertainment Corp.". The Company's new business plan is to engage in the service of sub-junkets for a junket in Cambodia. For sub-junkets introduction service performed, we will charge 0.05% of total bets played by players introduced by us to a junket in casino located in Cambodia.  On January 9, 2017, the Company filed a certificate of amendment (the "Amendment") to its Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada in order to change its name to "Sheng Ying Entertainment Corp." in order to better reflect the direction and business of the Company. The filling was approved on January 10, 2017 and we have obtained the business license under the new company name on the same day. As of the filing date, the name change is still subject to the approval of Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The Company has adopted a fiscal year end of December 31.  We have plans to establish a website which set forth general information for our new junket business of the Company in next future.  Based on our current operating plan, we expect that we will be able to generate revenue that is sufficient to cover our expenses for the next twelve months.  Table of Contents  Results of Operations  For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  Selling, general and administrative expenses for the period ending December 31, 2016 were $61,000 compared to $63,000 for the year ending December 31, 2015. The expenses were consisted primarily of contributed services from the former major shareholder and sole officer, legal, accounting and travel expenses.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  The following is a summary of the Company's cash flows provided by (used in) operating, investing, and financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 and for the year ending December 31, 2015:   Year ended December 31, Year ended December 31, 2016 2015 Operating Activities (31,000 ) (28,000 ) Investing Activities - - Financing Activities 30,130 10,000 Net Effect on Cash (870 ) (18,000 )  As of December 31, 2016, most of our resources and work have been devoted to planning our previous business and completing our registration statement, as our new sub-junket business has yet to commence as of December 31, 2016.  With the new business plan to involve in sub-junket service, we expect that we will be able to generate revenue that is sufficient to cover our expenses for the next twelve months.  We are a public company and as such we have incurred and will continue to incur significant expenses for legal, accounting and related services. As a public entity, subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act of 1934, we incur ongoing expenses associated with professional fees for accounting, legal and a host of other expenses including annual reports and proxy statements, if required. We estimate that these costs will range up to $50,000 per year over the next few years and may be significantly higher if our business volume and transactional activity increases but should be lower during our first year of being public because our overall business volume (and financial transactions) will be lower, and we will not yet be subject to the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 until we exceed $75 million in market capitalization (if ever). These obligations will certainly reduce our ability and resources to expand our business plan and activities. We hope to be able to use our status as a public company to increase our ability to use noncash means of settling outstanding obligations (i.e. issuance of restricted shares of our common stock) and compensate independent contractors who provide professional services to us, although there can be no assurances that we will be successful in any of these efforts. We will also reduce compensation levels paid to management (if we attract or retain outside personnel to perform this function) if there is insufficient cash generated from operations to satisfy these costs.  Table of Contents  We hope to be able to use our status as a public company to enable us to use non-cash means of settling obligations and compensate persons and/or firms providing services to us, although there can be no assurances that we will be successful in any of those efforts. However, these actions, if successful, will result in dilution of the ownership interests of existing shareholders, may further dilute common stock book value, and that dilution may be material. Such issuances may also serve to enhance existing management's ability to maintain control of the Company because the shares may be issued to parties or entities committed to supporting existing management. The Company may offer shares of its common stock to settle a portion of the professional fees incurred in connection with its registration statement. No negotiations have taken place with any professional and no assurances can be made as to the likelihood that any professional will accept shares in settlement of obligations due to them.  As of December 31, 2016, total liabilities dropped to $1,130 from $80,000 as of December 31, 2015, mainly is because new shareholder took over the Company and former major shareholder and sole officer took over all the net liabilities when he resigned. Hence there are minimal liabilities at December 31, 2016.  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements  Refer to the notes to the financial statements for a complete description of recent accounting standards which we have not yet been required to implement and may be applicable to our operation, as well as those significant accounting standards that have been adopted during the current year.  Critical Accounting Policies  The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("US GAAP") requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates which are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions. The following accounting policies require significant management judgments and estimates.  We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from these estimates.  Going Concern  Our auditor has issued a "going concern" qualification as part of their opinion in the Audit Report dated March 31, 2017 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  We have no outstanding off-balance sheet guarantees, interest rate swap transactions or foreign currency contracts. We do not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts.  Contractual Obligations  As a "smaller reporting company" as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, the Company is not required to provide this information.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  The following discussion contains certain statements that may be deemed "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements appear in a number of places in this Report, including, without limitation, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and requirements that are difficult to predict or are beyond our control. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this quarterly report. You should not put undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. We assume no responsibility to update the forward-looking statements contained in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. The following should also be read in conjunction with the unaudited Financial Statements and notes thereto that appear elsewhere in this report.  Company Overview  Crowd 4 Seeds was incorporated in Nevada on April 11, 2014. Most of the activity through June 30, 2016 involved incorporation efforts, registration to become a reporting company, planning our business and developing our website.  We are a development stage company and have limited financial resources. We have not established a source of equity or debt financing. Our financial statements include a note emphasizing the uncertainty of our ability to remain a going concern.  Crowd 4 Seeds plans to become an online platform for investments in Israeli startup companies through equity-based crowdfunding.  Results of Operation  Six and three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to six and three months ended June 30, 2015  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  Selling, general and administrative expenses amounted to $29,000 and $26,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively and to $15,000 and $12,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Liquidity and Capital Resources The following is a summary of the Company's cash flows used in operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and the six months ended June 30, 2015: Six Months Six Months ended ended June 30, June 30, 2016 2015 Net Loss $ (29,000 ) $ (26,000 ) Net cash used in operating activities $ (20,000 ) $ (10,000 )  Tables of Contents  Since inception, most of our resources and work have been devoted to planning our business and web site development. We need additional funding to continue the implementation of our business plan. If we are unable to raise any funds, the development costs would have to be provided by our president and chief executive officer to the extent that he is capable and willing to provide such funds.  Private capital, if sought, we believe will be sought from former business associates of our president and chief executive officer or through private investors referred to us by those same business associates. To date, we have sold 804,000 shares of our common stock for $20,100 through a private placement.  If a market for our shares ever develops, of which there can be no assurances, we may use restricted shares of our common stock to compensate employees/consultants and independent contractors wherever possible. We cannot predict the likelihood or source of raising capital or funds that may be needed to complete the development of our business plan.  As a public company, we will incur ongoing expenses associated with professional fees for accounting, legal and a host of other expenses including annual reports and proxy statements, if required. We estimate that these costs will range up to $50,000 per year over the next few years and may be significantly higher if our business volume and transactional activity increases but should be lower during our first year of being public because our overall business volume (and financial transactions) will be lower, and we will not yet be subject to the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 for an opinion on our system on internal controls by our independent audit firm until we exceed $75 million in market capitalization (if ever). These obligations may reduce our ability and resources to expand our business plan and activities. We hope to be able to use our status as a public company to increase our ability to use noncash means of settling outstanding obligations (i.e. issuance of restricted shares of our common stock) and compensate independent contractors who provide professional services to us, although there can be no assurances that we will be successful in any of these efforts.  We hope to eventually be able to use our status as a public company to enable us to use non-cash means of settling obligations and compensate persons and/or firms providing services to us, although there can be no assurances that we will be successful in any of those efforts. However, these actions, if successful, will result in dilution of the ownership interests of existing shareholders, may further dilute common stock book value, and that dilution may be material. Such issuances may also serve to enhance existing management's ability to maintain control of the Company because the shares may be issued to parties or entities committed to supporting existing management.  As of June 30, 2016, we owed $97,000, of which $56,000 are in connection with professional services provided to us ($50,000 by a related party) and $41,000 pursuant to a unsecured, interest free note to our Chief Executive Officer payable on demand. There are no other significant liabilities at June 30, 2016.  Going Concern  Our auditor has issued a "going concern" qualification as part of its opinion in the Audit Report for the year ending December 31, 2015, and our unaudited financial statements for the quarter ended June 30, 2016 include a "going concern" note disclosing that our ability to continue as a going concern is contingent on us being able to raise working capital to grow our operations and generate revenue.  Tables of Contents  Critical Accounting Policies  The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the financial statements and accompanying notes. The SEC has defined a company's critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company's financial condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. We believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances; however, actual results may vary from these estimates and assumptions. We have identified in Note 2 - "Summary of Accounting Policies" to the Financial Statements contained in this Quarterly Report certain critical accounting policies that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  We have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources and would be considered material to investors.  Contractual Obligations  As a "smaller reporting company" as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, the Company is not required to provide this information.
