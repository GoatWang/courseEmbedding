Investor Overview Our Company









Our Company




	At Michaels, we believe anyone can make, and we’re on a mission to inspire and encourage everyone to unleash their inner maker. With helpful store Team Members and a broad selection of merchandise, combined with compelling in-store events and online content, we believe we offer the most complete arts and crafts experience and are the preferred destination in the industry.

	 

	With 1,367 stores (consisting of 1,223 Michaels stores in the 49 states and Canada and 109 Aaron Brothers stores) as of January 28, 2017, and $5.2 billion in sales in fiscal 2016, The Michaels Companies is the largest arts and crafts specialty provider in North America. In addition to our retail outlets, we also own Artistree, a manufacturer of high quality custom and specialty framing merchandise, and Darice, a premier wholesale distributor in the craft, gift and decor industry.

	 

	Our stores are at the heart of our customer engagement strategy, showcasing our artistic and creative products while providing an opportunity for our store Team Members to interact with customers and help them develop creative ideas. We carry a broad and deep assortment of more than 30,000 stock-keeping units ("SKUs") in arts, crafts, scrapbooking, floral, framing, home décor, seasonal offerings, and children's hobbies that enable us to satisfy the diverse needs of our customers. We have also developed a robust online platform which promotes social networking and includes expert tips, project ideas, marketing content and information about upcoming in-store events. In recent years, we have capitalized on our market-leading scale to create a team and infrastructure dedicated to designing, sourcing and delivering high quality, on-trend merchandise, including a growing number of products under our portfolio of private brands.

	 

	Our private branded products, which represented approximately 57% of net sales in fiscal 2016, are only available at Michaels and allow us to further differentiate our merchandise while enhancing product margins. We are also able to use our scale and market leadership to identify and secure exclusive third party products. We believe our compelling store experience and broad product offering distinguish us from our competitors and position Michaels as the leading brand that defines arts and crafts.

Investor Overview Corporate Governance









Corporate Governance




	The Board of Directors of The Michaels Companies, Inc. (the "Company") sets high standards for the Company's employees, officers and directors. Implicit in this philosophy is the importance of sound corporate governance. It is the duty of the Board of Directors to serve as a prudent fiduciary for stockholders and to oversee the management of the Company's business. To fulfill its responsibilities and to discharge its duty, the Board of Directors follows the procedures and standards that are set forth in these guidelines. These guidelines are subject to modification from time to time as the Board of Directors deems appropriate in the best interests of the Company or as required by applicable laws and regulations.

	 

Code of Business Conduct and Ethics Violations

	 

	In order to facilitate the reporting of possible violations of Michaels' Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, we have established Michaels' Hotline, which allows Company employees to report any possible violations of the Code on a confidential, anonymous basis. You can access Michaels' Hotline by calling 1 (800) 241-5689 (toll-free) or by visiting www.tnwgrc.com. In addition, Company employees or individuals outside the Company who have concerns relating to Michaels' accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing practices may also utilize Michaels' Hotline to report such concerns. Michaels' Hotline is completely administered by a third party and is available to callers 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Please refer to Michaels' Code of Business Conduct and Ethics if you have any questions as to the types of activities that may be a violation of the Code or constitute questionable accounting or audit activities. Electronic copies of Michaels' Form 10K, Form 10Q, Form 8-K filings and amendments to those reports, as well as other SEC required reports, can be found on our Financials & Filings page.

History[edit]




Framing counter of a Michaels store in Springfield, Virginia


In 1973, Dallas businessman Michael J. Dupey opened Michaels in the former Northtown Mall in Dallas, Texas. The location closed in the 1990s and is now a technology building.[3][unreliable source?]
In 1982, Dallas businessman Samuel Wyly bought controlling interest in Michaels,[4] when the company's annual revenues were around $10 million.[5] After the sale, Dupey founded MJ Designs which was later bought out by Michaels.
In 1984, the Michaels chain was first publicly traded. At the time it had 16 stores.
In 1994, Michaels acquired the Treasure House Crafts chain in the Northwest United States. It also acquired Oregon Craft & Floral Supply, as well as H&H Craft & Floral.[6] In July 1994, Michaels acquired Leewards Creative Crafts, a 101-unit store chain, which gave Michaels a "solid footing" in the Midwestern and Northeastern regions of the United States.
In 1995, Michaels acquired Aaron's Brothers Holdings, Inc., a specialty framing and art supply store.
In 1996, sales were $1.24 billion and the company opened its 450th store.[5] By 2003, the company's annual sales were in excess of 3 billion dollars.

In 2006, two private equity groups, Bain Capital and the Blackstone Group, purchased the company for $6 billion.[4] The two own equal shares[5] and 93 percent between them. Highfields Capital Management owns another 6.2 percent of the company.[7]
Michaels opened its 1000th store in Texas in the fall of 2008.
In 2010, Michaels Arts and Crafts started bringing back a revised class program. These classes include beading, knitting, crocheting, scrapbooking, painting, and cake decorating. In addition, Michaels introduced two bi-monthly do-it-yourself craft nights allowing customers to bring their projects into the store where Michaels provides tools, supplies, and a workspace for crafting. Bead Night for jewelry makers and Crop Night for the scrapbooker both launched in 2010.
In August 2016, Michaels announced its intent to acquire Hancock Fabrics' intellectual property and customer database as part of its bankruptcy and liquidation.[8]
IPO[edit]
In March, 2012, Reuters reported that JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs were "the leads on what could be one of the year's largest IPOs in the retail sector", with one source saying the IPO would be registered in April. None of the owners or bankers would comment by name on the record. Reuters further reported that Michaels posted earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization of $661 million in 2011 and had total debt of $3.5 billion as of January 28, 2012.[7] The filing, for a $500 million common stock issue,[9] came on March 30. The ticker would be MIK on the NYSE. A report on the filing put the company's debt at $3.8 billion and said 2011 revenue was $4.2 billion (+4% year-to-year) and net income was $176M.[10]
In July 2012, the IPO was "put on hold indefinitely" after CEO Menzer had a stroke.[11]
In June 2014, a $528 million IPO valuing the company overall at $3.86 billion. was announced, with pricing expected late in the month. "Bain and Blackstone...will own about 40 per cent of the company each after the IPO" and the company will still have a "$3.7bn debt pile, which includes $1.6bn of variable rate debt", according to the Financial Times.[12]
Management[edit]
In April 2012, Chief Executive John Menzer suffered a stroke. The IPO was postponed in July 2012[11] and later in the month Menzer retired.[13]
In Menzer's absence, Lew Klessel, Bain managing director, and Charles Sonsteby, Michaels’ chief administrative officer and chief financial officer, served in a temporary Office of CEO. In February 2013, Chuck Rubin was appointed CEO. Rubin was president and CEO of personal-care specialty retailer Ulta Beauty at the time of his appointment and had previously been with Office Depot and Accenture. The Michaels Office of CEO was discontinued when Rubin assumed his position later in February and Sonsteby continued as CAO/CFO.[14]
Products[edit]

Michaels sells a variety of arts and crafts products, including scrapbooking, beading, knitting, rubber stamping, home decor items, floral items, kids' crafts, paints, framing, greenery, baking and many seasonal items. Michaels produces 10 exclusive private brands sold throughout its stores including Recollections, Studio Decor, Bead Landing, Creatology, Ashland, Celebrate It, Art Minds, Artist's Loft, Craft Smart and Loops & Threads. In April 2007, Martha Stewart teamed up with Michaels to launch a line initially available exclusively at Michaels called "Martha Stewart Crafts". The line features over 650 different products for the craft enthusiast. In May 2010, Michaels was the first retailer[citation needed] to feature Chef Duff's Duff Goldman Collection in its store. The baking line features more than 70 products including fondant, sprinkle sets, color spray, cake tattoos and color paste.
Data compromise[edit]
On May 5, 2011, Michaels sent an email alert to its customers revealing that its debit card terminals in 20 states had been compromised. Customers who made PIN-based purchases between February 8 and May 6, 2011 may have had their data exposed.[15] A class action lawsuit was filed against Michaels in the County Court of Passaic, New Jersey over the incident.[16]
On January 25, 2014, Michaels warned of a possible second hacking of its customers' data and urged shoppers to keep an eye on their card statements for fraudulent activity.[17]

In 1984, the Michaels chain was first publicly traded. At the time it had 16 stores.
In 1994, Michaels acquired the Treasure House Crafts chain in the Northwest United States. It also acquired Oregon Craft & Floral Supply, as well as H&H Craft & Floral.[6] In July 1994, Michaels acquired Leewards Creative Crafts, a 101-unit store chain, which gave Michaels a "solid footing" in the Midwestern and Northeastern regions of the United States.
In 1995, Michaels acquired Aaron's Brothers Holdings, Inc., a specialty framing and art supply store.
In 1996, sales were $1.24 billion and the company opened its 450th store.[5] By 2003, the company's annual sales were in excess of 3 billion dollars.

In 2006, two private equity groups, Bain Capital and the Blackstone Group, purchased the company for $6 billion.[4] The two own equal shares[5] and 93 percent between them. Highfields Capital Management owns another 6.2 percent of the company.[7]
Michaels opened its 1000th store in Texas in the fall of 2008.
In 2010, Michaels Arts and Crafts started bringing back a revised class program. These classes include beading, knitting, crocheting, scrapbooking, painting, and cake decorating. In addition, Michaels introduced two bi-monthly do-it-yourself craft nights allowing customers to bring their projects into the store where Michaels provides tools, supplies, and a workspace for crafting. Bead Night for jewelry makers and Crop Night for the scrapbooker both launched in 2010.
In August 2016, Michaels announced its intent to acquire Hancock Fabrics' intellectual property and customer database as part of its bankruptcy and liquidation.[8]
IPO[edit]
In March, 2012, Reuters reported that JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs were "the leads on what could be one of the year's largest IPOs in the retail sector", with one source saying the IPO would be registered in April. None of the owners or bankers would comment by name on the record. Reuters further reported that Michaels posted earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization of $661 million in 2011 and had total debt of $3.5 billion as of January 28, 2012.[7] The filing, for a $500 million common stock issue,[9] came on March 30. The ticker would be MIK on the NYSE. A report on the filing put the company's debt at $3.8 billion and said 2011 revenue was $4.2 billion (+4% year-to-year) and net income was $176M.[10]
In July 2012, the IPO was "put on hold indefinitely" after CEO Menzer had a stroke.[11]
In June 2014, a $528 million IPO valuing the company overall at $3.86 billion. was announced, with pricing expected late in the month. "Bain and Blackstone...will own about 40 per cent of the company each after the IPO" and the company will still have a "$3.7bn debt pile, which includes $1.6bn of variable rate debt", according to the Financial Times.[12]
Management[edit]
In April 2012, Chief Executive John Menzer suffered a stroke. The IPO was postponed in July 2012[11] and later in the month Menzer retired.[13]
In Menzer's absence, Lew Klessel, Bain managing director, and Charles Sonsteby, Michaels’ chief administrative officer and chief financial officer, served in a temporary Office of CEO. In February 2013, Chuck Rubin was appointed CEO. Rubin was president and CEO of personal-care specialty retailer Ulta Beauty at the time of his appointment and had previously been with Office Depot and Accenture. The Michaels Office of CEO was discontinued when Rubin assumed his position later in February and Sonsteby continued as CAO/CFO.[14]

Michaels sells a variety of arts and crafts products, including scrapbooking, beading, knitting, rubber stamping, home decor items, floral items, kids' crafts, paints, framing, greenery, baking and many seasonal items. Michaels produces 10 exclusive private brands sold throughout its stores including Recollections, Studio Decor, Bead Landing, Creatology, Ashland, Celebrate It, Art Minds, Artist's Loft, Craft Smart and Loops & Threads. In April 2007, Martha Stewart teamed up with Michaels to launch a line initially available exclusively at Michaels called "Martha Stewart Crafts". The line features over 650 different products for the craft enthusiast. In May 2010, Michaels was the first retailer[citation needed] to feature Chef Duff's Duff Goldman Collection in its store. The baking line features more than 70 products including fondant, sprinkle sets, color spray, cake tattoos and color paste.
Data compromise[edit]
On May 5, 2011, Michaels sent an email alert to its customers revealing that its debit card terminals in 20 states had been compromised. Customers who made PIN-based purchases between February 8 and May 6, 2011 may have had their data exposed.[15] A class action lawsuit was filed against Michaels in the County Court of Passaic, New Jersey over the incident.[16]
On January 25, 2014, Michaels warned of a possible second hacking of its customers' data and urged shoppers to keep an eye on their card statements for fraudulent activity.[17]

Reuters further reported that Michaels posted earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization of $661 million in 2011 and had total debt of $3.5 billion as of January 28, 2012.[7] The filing, for a $500 million common stock issue,[9] came on March 30. The ticker would be MIK on the NYSE. A report on the filing put the company's debt at $3.8 billion and said 2011 revenue was $4.2 billion (+4% year-to-year) and net income was $176M.[10]
In July 2012, the IPO was "put on hold indefinitely" after CEO Menzer had a stroke.[11]
In June 2014, a $528 million IPO valuing the company overall at $3.86 billion. was announced, with pricing expected late in the month. "Bain and Blackstone...will own about 40 per cent of the company each after the IPO" and the company will still have a "$3.7bn debt pile, which includes $1.6bn of variable rate debt", according to the Financial Times.[12]
Management[edit]
In April 2012, Chief Executive John Menzer suffered a stroke. The IPO was postponed in July 2012[11] and later in the month Menzer retired.[13]
In Menzer's absence, Lew Klessel, Bain managing director, and Charles Sonsteby, Michaels’ chief administrative officer and chief financial officer, served in a temporary Office of CEO. In February 2013, Chuck Rubin was appointed CEO. Rubin was president and CEO of personal-care specialty retailer Ulta Beauty at the time of his appointment and had previously been with Office Depot and Accenture. The Michaels Office of CEO was discontinued when Rubin assumed his position later in February and Sonsteby continued as CAO/CFO.[14]

Michaels sells a variety of arts and crafts products, including scrapbooking, beading, knitting, rubber stamping, home decor items, floral items, kids' crafts, paints, framing, greenery, baking and many seasonal items. Michaels produces 10 exclusive private brands sold throughout its stores including Recollections, Studio Decor, Bead Landing, Creatology, Ashland, Celebrate It, Art Minds, Artist's Loft, Craft Smart and Loops & Threads. In April 2007, Martha Stewart teamed up with Michaels to launch a line initially available exclusively at Michaels called "Martha Stewart Crafts". The line features over 650 different products for the craft enthusiast. In May 2010, Michaels was the first retailer[citation needed] to feature Chef Duff's Duff Goldman Collection in its store. The baking line features more than 70 products including fondant, sprinkle sets, color spray, cake tattoos and color paste.
Data compromise[edit]
On May 5, 2011, Michaels sent an email alert to its customers revealing that its debit card terminals in 20 states had been compromised. Customers who made PIN-based purchases between February 8 and May 6, 2011 may have had their data exposed.[15] A class action lawsuit was filed against Michaels in the County Court of Passaic, New Jersey over the incident.[16]
On January 25, 2014, Michaels warned of a possible second hacking of its customers' data and urged shoppers to keep an eye on their card statements for fraudulent activity.[17]

Need Help With Your Invention or Product Idea?
If you are an inventor with a patent or just someone who has one great idea for a new invention, we can help you make it very profitable.
We are licensing agents in search of great inventions, both with patents and without patents, to bring to market by way of a licensing agreement.
Simply put, we find companies who will manufacture and distribute your invention and give you a generous royalty percentage of sales.
Let Us Pay For It!
Besides a nominal small fee to evaluate your invention, which only serves to weed out those that are simply curious, we are only compensated when we license a deal for you.
Depending on how developed your invention is at the time you submit it, our services of marketing and licensing for your invention or patent can range but may include:
Invention Marketing and Licensing Services



•  Patent assistance
•  Market research
•  Prototype development
•  Engineered drawings
•  Computer renderings
•  Manufacturing feasibility
•  Invention marketing material creation
•  Networking with potential licensees
•  Trade show representation
•  Invention presentation
•  Licensing negotiation
•  License agreement administration



So, if your invention is great like you say it is, and we choose to represent you, all other costs for seeking a license deal will be paid by us!
There are no hidden charges, no large up-front fees, just a no-risk-high-reward offer that we are making to those with great inventions!

Who We Are
Lambert & Lambert is an innovative group of specialists dedicated to licensing our clients’ inventions.  We employ attorneys, engineers, and those with expertise in market research, marketing and promotion, video production, drafting, CAD, industrial design, prototyping, and manufacturing.
Our one goal is that our clients and their invention achieve success.  This is because we have a vested interest in them of our time and resources and only get paid when they do.
To us, success means that the inventor receives royalty checks from manufacturers that far exceeds his or her initial investment.  And maybe even more importantly to some, that they get the pleasure of contributing to society and seeing their invention on the shelves of their local stores.  To do this we employ all of our talents and connections to tailor a plan specifically for our clients’ inventions.
Lambert & Lambert is also a proud member of the Better Business Bureau, the MN Inventors Congress, Professional Member of the United Inventors Association, Licensing Executives Society and has been recognized by the National Inventor Fraud Center as “Official Good Guys”.
 
 
 


 

 

 

 
 
 



Who We Are NOT
We are NOT an invention marketing company who accepts every invention, promises high returns for large up-front fees, and then only sends out an unsolicited mailer advertising the invention.
These fraudulent companies give the few honest ones a very bad name.  Their main (if not only) stream of income is in charging huge sums of money to the inventors of whom they are representing. The way they work is by offering the inventor a marketability analysis that touts of high returns if only the inventor moves to the next step which costs upwards of $10,000-$15,000.
The inventor gets a second mortgage on his or her home and nothing comes of it.  It is very sad to hear of these good-intentioned inventors who were ripped-off by these companies.  So, beware and be sure to ask important questions regarding their business and how they operate.

Successful Inventions
Below are just some of the products that we have successfully licensed or commercialized on behalf of our clients. This sampling of products highlights some of the many industries that we work in.


 



Featured Licensed Product
 
 
 


Instant Trainer
L&L Licenses Pet Invention to As Seen on TV Marketer
Invented by Terry Silva 
The story of Terry Silva’s invention had a painful beginning.  After being dragged across the street, causing cuts and bruises that sent her to the emergency room, Terry knew she needed a new solution to help control her  110 pound German Shepherd-Alaskan Husky, named Ziggy.
“I went to the Dollar Store and purchased a bunch of dog collars and linked them together over his spine and around his abdomen,” said Silva.  “I was pleasantly surprised when it worked, so I had a sturdier one made that my dog Ziggy loved!  He walked by my side and I never had to put any pressure on the new leash.” Like most inventors who develop their invention, Terry determined that licensing it to a company with connections at retail would be the best option.
That’s when she reached out to Lambert & Lambert to help her design and market her new invention, make presentations, and negotiate the license deal.  “Working with Lambert & Lambert has been a pleasure.  They are true professionals and I couldn’t have done it without them.”

Michaels stores sell various arts and crafts supplies, baking & party items, custom products, floral arrangements and much more. In addition to their limitless ideas for your next Pinterest project, they also offer classes and projects in store to help create that personalized masterpiece you've been dreaming of making. DealCatcher has been tracking Michael's offers since November 2008. The page is updated regularly and features both in-store and online coupons for Michael's stores. The most commonly seen discounts include 40% off one regular priced item and 20% - 25% off your entire purchase.How to Use a Michael's Coupon:Add items to your shopping cart and click the "checkout" button when you are done shopping. Find the "Do You Have a Promotional Code?", click it and enter the coupon code. Discount will be revealed after you click the apply button.How to Use a Michael's In Store Coupon: Michael's in-store coupons can be either printed out or shown on your mobile device if you are green and like to save trees. Michael's Exclusions:Nearly all Michaels Coupons come with a list of exclusions. Here are the details of most Michaels exclusions. Check your specific coupon to see if there are additional rules. "Certain exclusions and conditions may apply. Click the offer boxes to see full terms of offer. Some advertised items may not be available at all locations. Percent off discounts are off original ticketed price. All credit cards may not be accepted at all stores. Regular prices may vary. Typographic, photographic and printing errors are subject to correction at the store level. Due to the seasonal nature of our products, quantities may be limited and there may be no rain checks issued. We reserve the right to limit quantities."Michael's Black Friday Sale:Michael's Black Friday sale began at 4am Thanksgiving Day and featured Doorbusters up to 70% off. Their Black Friday ad normally contains coupons valid for each day of their sale to entice shoppers to come back each day. I highly recommend checking their ad out if you are in the market for a Christmas tree / outdoor decorations as you can usually score a really good deal during that weekend!
