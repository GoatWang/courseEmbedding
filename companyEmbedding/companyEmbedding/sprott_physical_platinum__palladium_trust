Why The Sprott Physical Platinum And Palladium Trust Is The Best PGM Bullion Fund - Sprott Physical Platinum & Palladium Trust (SPPP) (NYSEARCA:SPPP) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Why The Sprott Physical Platinum And Palladium Trust Is The Best PGM Bullion FundNov.12.13 | About: Sprott Physical (SPPP) Ben Kramer-Miller Gold & precious metals, macro, research analyst, Deep ValueminingWEALTHI recently wrote an article in which I argue that shares of Sprott Inc. (OTC:OTCPK:SPOXF) stand to benefit from an increase in revenues realized from the Sprott physical bullion trusts. In my discussion I list specific benefits that the company's gold (NYSEARCA:PHYS) and silver (NYSEARCA:PSLV) trusts have over their more popular counterparts (the SPDR Gold Trust (NYSEARCA:GLD) and the iShares Silver Trust (NYSEARCA:SLV). However I did not discuss the Sprott Physical Platinum and Palladium Trust (NYSEARCA:SPPP) as I felt that doing so would add substantially to the amount of information that readers had to digest without really adding to my thesis. SPPP is small, and there are no comparable funds given that it holds both platinum and palladium.
I feel a follow-up is welcomed given my omission from the aforementioned article, although my focus here will be to outline the advantages that the SPPP has over other platinum and palladium funds, particularly those offered by ETF Securities ((NYSEARCA:PPLT) for platinum and (NYSEARCA:PALL) for palladium). This is the case because not only am I bullish on both platinum and palladium (although more so on the latter, as I discuss here), but because there are very few options available to platinum and palladium investors: most of the mines are located in geo-political hot spots, and the few that aren't have failed to impress me as potential investment options.
There are just a handful of ETPs available to platinum and palladium investors, and they are all quite illiquid (a feature that reflects trading activity in the futures markets, especially for palladium). The three that are sizeable enough to consider holding are those already mentioned:

The ETF Securities Physical Platinum Trust
The ETF Securities Physical Palladium Trust
The Sprott Physical Platinum and Palladium Trust

The first two funds are pretty straightforward in their holdings. The Sprott Trust gives investors exposure to both platinum and palladium, although like myself, it favors the latter. As of the end of October the trust contained 82,185 ounces of platinum and 187,714 ounces of palladium. At current spot prices ($1,435 for an ounce of platinum and $750 for an ounce of palladium), the fund holds about 54.4% palladium and 45.6% platinum.

I think that the Sprott fund is superior for the following reasons.
Management Fees
The Sprott Trust has an annual expense ratio of 0.5%, whereas the ETF Securities offerings each have a 0.6% expense ratio, making the Sprott fund 17% cheaper.
Tax Treatment
The platinum and palladium held by the ETF Securites funds are treated as collectibles, and profits on them will be taxed at 28%. Profits on SPPP holdings will be treated as if it were a stock, meaning that if you hold the fund for longer than a year then it will be taxed at 15% or 20%, depending upon your tax bracket.
The Custodial Situation
Sprott's platinum and palladium are held with a single custodian in Canada. As stated on Sprott's website: "the Trusts hold their bullion assets in custody at a Federal Crown Corporation of the Government of Canada."
The custodial situations for the ETF Security funds are far more complex. The platinum and palladium may be held with subcustodians, which are chosen by the custodian (JP Morgan (NYSE:JPM)). Subcustodians may employ additional subcustodians to hold the funds' platinum or palladium. The trustee (The Bank of New York Mellon (BK)) has no say in this. If platinum or palladium that is held by a subcustodian is lost, then PPLT or PALL shareholders have limited legal recourse (ETF Securities Platinum Trust prospectus, p. 11). Basically, if (1) the custodian gives some of the PPLT's platinum or PALL's palladium to a subcustodian to hold, (2) this subcustodian loses or steals some or all of this platinum or palladium, and (3) the custodian can prove in court that (1) was a reasonable action (i.e., JP Morgan had reason to believe in the competence and integrity of the subcustodian), then the custodian is not responsible for shareholders' losses.

Redemption of Shares For Bullion
Investors in the Sprott Trust can redeem shares for physical platinum and palladium. This is not the case for ETF Securities' platinum and palladium products.
Disadvantages of the Sprott Trust
There are two disadvantages to the Sprott Trust that investors should consider. First, investors are stuck with the allocation to the two metals chosen by Sprott. If an investor wants 70% palladium to 30% platinum, then s/he can easily do this by buying appropriate amounts of the ETF Securities' funds.
Second, the Sprott Trust is a closed-end fund, and it can trade at a premium or a discount to its NAV. In fact given its favorable tax treatment it should trade at a slight premium. However for those investors and traders looking for more precise exposure to platinum and palladium the ETF Securities funds should be a better option. Nevertheless the lack of liquidity in all three funds means that bid/ask spreads will be relatively wide and direct exposure to platinum and palladium prices will be difficult to achieve using any of them.
Conclusion
While all of these funds have their problems, especially for those with a trader's mentality, the Sprott Trust has several advantages that make it especially appealing for longer term investors in platinum and palladium.

Reasons To Own Platinum and Palladium - Sprott Asset Management










































Reasons To Own Platinum and Palladium
SUPPLY
1. PGMs have a high supply risk.
In the British Geological Survey’s Risk List 2012, the platinum group metals (PGMs), of which platinum and palladium are widely viewed as the most significant, received a high supply risk index based on the list’s seven criteria: scarcity in the Earth’s crust; production concentration—location of principal producers and contribution to global supply; reserve distribution—global distribution of reserves; recycling rate; substitutability; governance (top producing nation); and governance (top reserve-hosting nation).
2. Overall global increase in demand for platinum and palladium is expected result in continued supply deficit in 2013.
A substantial increase in industrial and investment demand is expected to keep the platinum and palladium market in deficit in 2013, according to the Johnson Matthey Platinum 2013 Interim Review. Gross demand for platinum is predicted to increase by 4.9%, which will more than compensate for a slight fall in purchases by the jewellery and autocatalyst sectors. With supplies recovering only marginally, and little growth in recycling, the market is set to move further into deficit. Primary supplies of palladium are forecast to decline slightly in 2013, mainly due to a drop in sales from Russian government stocks. With an anticipated 3% decrease in gross demand and a 7% jump in recycling, the gap between supply and demand is expected to narrow, nevertheless remaining in significant deficit, anticipated to be 740,000 oz.
3. Production is highly concentrated in only two countries.
Unlike many other metals that are found in numerous regions, the majority of platinum and palladium production is concentrated in South Africa and Russia, which combined to account for estimated 85% of platinum production and 78% of palladium production in 2013.
4. Dwindling stockpiles of palladium in Russia are nearing depletion and may not be able to offset declines in mine production.
Russia is the largest source of palladium, through both mining and state sales of stockpiles. However, the supply of the metal from existing stockpiles is projected to drop in 2013. Additionally, mining supply from the active mines in the Norilsk region of Russia is projected to drop due to the declining grades of ore extracted.
5. Alternative sources of new supply for platinum and palladium are not readily available.
The only region expected to increase platinum and palladium production in 2013 is Zimbabwe, though it remains a relatively small producer of the metals. However, increasing political tensions and threats over security of tenure in the country has deterred new investment.
6. PGM producers in South Africa are highly exposed to the South African Rand.
The depreciating South African Rand has helped the producers immensely as labour accounts for a majority of the mining costs. Prior the decline in the Rand, these PGM producers were in dire straits as a majority of their operations were losing money. However, a 15-year trend of declining ore grades and anticipated labour settlements with increased wages are expected to further increase cost and stress balance sheets for these producers.
DEMAND
7. There are diverse sources of demand for platinum and palladium.
More than a quarter of the demand for platinum and palladium is from non-autocatalyst industrial uses. For platinum, sectors utilizing the metal include petroleum refining, electrical, glass manufacturing, medical, biomedical and dental, and other manufacturing such as turbines. For palladium, demand comes from the electronics (as resistors and capacitors in circuit boards), dental and chemical industries. The metals are also used in jewelry, particularly platinum which is sought after for its rarity, silvery-white lustre and resistance to wear and tarnish.
8. Investment demand is expected to reach a record 765,000 oz. in 2013.
South Africa’s new, rand-denominated platinum exchange traded fund has accumulated 660,000 oz. of metal between its launch in April and the end of September of 2013. This ETF is the first to be readily accessible to South African institutional investors, who are subject to limits on overseas investments, and it therefore benefited from considerable pent-up demand: over 360,000 oz. of platinum were purchased in the first month. Including sales through ETFs in other regions, as well as bars and coins, total physical investment is expected to reach an all-time record of 765,000 oz. in 2013.
9. More stringent vehicle emission standards continue to drive demand growth for platinum/palladium in autocatalysts.
Due to their powerful catalytic properties, platinum and palladium are essential components in catalytic converters in automobiles as they form the surface catalyst upon which the critical chemical reaction converting engine exhaust emissions into neutral compounds occurs, resulting in the reduction of the toxic components from combustion. There is no widely used substitute for the metals in autocatalysts and emission standards are becoming increasingly stringent across Asia increasing platinum/palladium loadings per vehicle. Demand for palladium in autocatalysts is expected to remain strong in 2013.
10. China is an increasingly important demand driver for both platinum and palladium.
11. Strong long-term annualized returns and uncertainty about the global financial system has the potential to take more supply of platinum and palladium off the market.
The returns on both platinum and palladium outpaced the S&P 500 Total Return Index in the ten years leading up to December 31, 2013, according to Bloomberg. The Manager of the Trust believes investor demand, through ETFs and funds acquiring the physical bullion, may increase as investors seek to protect their portfolios from inflation, deflation, economic slowdown and currency devaluation.

A Sprott Fund That’s Not

January 30, 2012 




 
Ana Kostioukova 





 



  



The recently registered Sprott Physical Platinum and Palladium Trust is just convoluted.


A few weeks ago, Sprott Asset Management, a Canadian firm owned and operated by Eric Sprott, filed to launch its third physically backed closed-end fund, worth $115 million.
First off, let’s dispel any misconceptions about what an ETF truly is. To the vast majority of investors out there, an ETF is an open-end fund traded on an exchange that at its core has all the benefits of the creation/redemption mechanism that keeps its price pegged, as closely as possible, to its net asset value.
Calling a closed-end mutual fund an ETF, as Reuters did in a story about Sprott’s plans, simply because it trades on an exchange—is wrong. Dave Nadig and I are on the same page on this. He had a similar complaint almost two years ago about the launch of the Sprott Physical Gold Trust.
 
Poor Alternatives To Gold And Silver
Investing in physically backed funds is a safe haven for jittery investors. The benefit of holding physical gold and silver is to guard against economic, political or social instability—the more uncertain the outlook, the higher the prices of gold and silver.
Meanwhile, platinum and palladium perform a bit differently in the market, and may not be ideal alternatives to gold and silver.
Platinum group metals (PGMs) have many industrial applications in manufacturing. According to the World Gold Council, 66 percent of platinum and 93 percent of palladium are used in industry, compared to 11 percent of gold.
Therefore, the prices of platinum and palladium partly depend on the demand for the products that they help produce. In other words, platinum and palladium are more tied to cycles of industrial demand than gold and silver.
The graph below illustrates the price of gold versus platinum per troy ounce. Note the drop in price of platinum during the unraveling of the 2008-2009 market crash, as well as the surge in gold prices in late 2011 brought on by tension in the Middle East, S&P’s downgrade of U.S. debt and the European sovereign debt crisis.

For savvy investors who already knew this, arguing that the Sprott Physical Platinum and Palladium Trust is a convoluted investment is hardly a stretch. 
Hodgepodge Exposure
The platinum/palladium fund is markedly different from its physically backed sister funds—Sprott Physical Gold Trust (NYSEArca: PHYS) and Sprott Physical Silver Trust (NYSEArca: PSLV)—since it combines two precious metals in one fund.
