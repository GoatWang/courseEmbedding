Research Activities

My research interests are in the application of quantitative methods to decision making
problems and in the development of new theory for optimization. I am particularly
interested in the uses of mathematical analysis in the simplification of optimization
problems prior to computation, although some of my work has suggested powerful new
computational techniques.
1. Development of a methodology and associated algorithms for models of spatial
interaction. This has been applied in transportation planning, in the forecasting of
residential population distribution, and in mineral processing. (See Publications 6, 8,
15, 18, 19, 28, 37, 43, 58.)
2. A new theory for quasi-concave programming and equilibrium problems which has
particular relevance to economics (29, 38, 39, 40). 
3. Various generalizations of duality theory (9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 21, 22, 25, 30, 49,
50, 52, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 68) and its application to: 


Resource Allocation (23, 59)
Portfolio Analysis (31)
Linearly Constrained Convex Programs (51)
Sensitivity Analysis (47)
Nonlinear Multicommodity Flow Problem (44)
Minmax Location (53, 68)
Fractional Programming (35, 39, 62, 76, 77, 78,79)
Machinery Economics (54, 74)
Equilibrium (57)
Composite Functions (65, 66)
Project Management (72)
Facility Location (73)

4. Miscellaneous applications of operations research methodology to: 


Sugar Cane Harvesting (4, 17)
Control of Queues (3)
Machine Maintenance Policies (26)
Manufacture of Heart Valves (69)
Allocation of Work Orders (70)
Warehouse Location (75)

Currently I am writing a book entitled, "Convex Programming: Analysis and
Application," with T. R. Jefferson, which will highlight the role of prior
analysis in facilitating the solution of optimization problems.
