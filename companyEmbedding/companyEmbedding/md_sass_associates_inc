We focus on undiscovered or misperceived investment
niches that drive significant value to our clients.





The most fertile investment opportunities are frequently
discovered outside the bounds of conventional wisdom.





Looking beyond conventional investment dogma, we seek out,
analyze and exploit inefficiencies in the financial markets.





Excellent client service results from superior portfolio
management, listening to our clients and anticipating their needs.





Across every high quality asset category, 
we search for the best value.





We look past popular market perceptions to take aim 
at attractive opportunities others fail to discern.

The information contained herein: (1) is proprietary to Morningstar; (2) may not be copied or distributed; and (3) is not warranted to be accurate, complete or timely. Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information.
For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating (based on a Morningstar risk-adjusted return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance, including the effects of sales charges, loads, and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. As of 3/31/17, the MD Sass Short Term US Government Agency Income Fund was rated 3-Stars against the following numbers of Short Government funds over the following time periods: 105 funds in the last three- and 95 funds in the last five-years. The M.D. Sass Equity Income Plus Fund (Institutional Class) was rated 3 stars against the following numbers of Option Writing Funds over the following time periods: 75 funds in the last three years.


Past performance does not guarantee future results.
Before you invest in the M.D. Sass Short Term US Government Agency Income Fund or the M.D. Sass Equity Income Plus Fund, please refer to the Short Term US Government Agency Income prospectus and Equity Income Plus prospectus for important information about the investment company, including investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. You may also obtain a hard copy of the prospectus by calling 855-MDS-Fund (855-637-3863). The prospectus should be read and considered carefully before you invest or send money.
Mutual fund investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Investments in debt securities typically decrease in value when interest rates rise. This risk is usually greater for longer-term debt securities. However, MDSIX only intends to invest in 1 to 3 year duration securities. Investments in U.S. Agency Mortgage Backed Securities include additional risks that investors should be aware of such as prepayment risk, extension risk, and possible illiquidity.
The M.D. Sass Equity Income Plus Fund invests in a limited number of companies. Therefore, changes in the value of a single security may have a more significant effect on the value of the Fund's portfolio than for other funds that invest in a greater number of companies. The Fund invests in mid-cap companies, which involves additional risks such as limited liquidity and greater volatility than large capitalization companies. The Fund invests in options, which may be more volatile than investments directly in the underlying securities, involve additional costs and may involve a small initial investment relative to the risk assumed. When the Fund writes a call option, its ability to participate in the capital appreciation of the underlying obligation is limited. There is no assurance that a closing transaction on a call option can be effected at a favorable price. During the option period, the covered call writer has, in return for the premium received, given up the opportunity for capital appreciation above the exercise price should the market price of the underlying security increase, but has retained the risk of loss should the price of the underlying security decline. If the Fund has purchased an index option and exercises it before the closing index value for that day is available, it runs the risk that the level of the underlying index may subsequently change. If such a change causes the exercised option to fall out-of-the-money, the Fund will be required to pay the difference between the closing index value and the exercise price of the option (times the applicable multiplier) to the assigned writer. If an index put option purchased by the Fund were permitted to expire without being exercised, its premium would represent a loss realized by the Fund. When the Fund invests in other investment companies, including ETFs, it will bear additional expenses based on its pro rata share of the other investment company's or ETF's operating expenses, including the potential duplication of management fees. The risk of owning an ETF generally reflects the risks of owning the underlying investments the ETF holds. The Fund may purchase securities of companies that are offered in an IPO. The risk exists that the market value of IPO shares will fluctuate considerably due to factors such as the absence of a prior public market, unseasoned trading, and the small number of shares available for trading and limited information about the issuer.  Non-U. S. securities, including ADRs and GDRs, are subject to risks relating to political, social and economic developments abroad and differences between U.S. and foreign regulatory requirements and market practices, including fluctuations in foreign currencies. Issuers of foreign securities may not be required to provide operational or financial information that is as timely or reliable as those required for issuers of U.S. securities.
The Funds are offered only to United States residents, and information on this site is intended only for such persons. Nothing on this web site should be considered a solicitation to buy or an offer to sell shares of any Fund in any jurisdiction where the offer or solicitation would be unlawful under the securities laws of such jurisdiction.
Duration: A measure of the sensitivity of the price (the value of principal) of a fixed-income investment to a change in interest rates.
The M.D. Sass Funds are distributed by Quasar Distributors, LLC.
