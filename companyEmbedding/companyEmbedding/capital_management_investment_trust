Investment Management
Insights, Strategies and Solutions
Our experienced professionals have expertise in a broad spectrum of traditional, alternative and non-financial assets.  We can work with you to develop and manage a portfolio tailored to your needs.






Portfolio Consulting
A collaborative dialogue with your portfolio manager
Your portfolio manager is a key member of your U.S. Trust relationship team and serves as your personal "chief investment officer." He or she will work with you to create an Investment Policy Statement, which serves as a blueprint for your portfolio by documenting your:

Objectives
Risk tolerance
Cash flow needs
 Tax situation
Wealth aspirations

Your portfolio manager's ongoing role is to incorporate our best strategic and tactical thinking, most relevant research analysis, current market insights and appropriate investment solutions into your portfolio. He or she will regularly monitor your portfolio to make sure it conforms to your Investment Policy Statement, which will be updated whenever there are significant changes in your life or goals.
Asset management
A more complete approach to asset allocation1
We analyze a wide range of asset classes, including hedge and private equity funds2 and global investment opportunities, as potential components of an asset allocation. In addition, we believe that true diversification requires managing for cash flows across and within asset classes in various market environments — not simply allocating according to a grid.
Your asset allocation will be based on the long-term expectations established for each asset class by our most senior investment professionals. Over the shorter term, however, your portfolio manager can adjust your portfolio tactically in response to emerging opportunities and risks, and reflecting U.S. Trust insights about trends and themes relevant to you.
How you own your assets — personally or in trusts; in taxable or tax-exempt solutions — can have a material impact on the overall performance of your portfolio. At U.S. Trust we focus on this wealth structuring aspect of your portfolio in conjunction with managing the assets themselves.
Alternative Investments
SOPHISTICATED SOLUTIONS TO MEET YOUR NEEDS2
Alternative investments at U.S. Trust focus on non-traditional assets such as:

Hedge funds
Private equity
Real estate and tangible assets

Because performance is often differentiated from equity and fixed income markets, alternative investments may be an ideal complement to traditional investments. 
Through our access to the industry's premier managers, we are able to offer solutions that provide options for all client segments. And we support you every step of the way with knowledge built on our experience in alternatives, including industry-leading research, rigorous due diligence, and cutting-edge portfolio construction.
Drawing from the experience, resources and expertise of the firm, you and your portfolio manager can explore alternative investments that can help you pursue what matters most to you.
Specialty asset management
Expertise in nonfinancial assets3
Specialty asset management at U.S. Trust focuses on nonfinancial assets such as:

Farm and ranch land
Timberland
Oil and gas properties
Private businesses
Real estate

Our Specialty Asset Management team can work with your portfolio manager and wealth strategist, as appropriate, to integrate these real assets into your overall plan and portfolio.
We can help you realize your objectives with assets you already own, or help you acquire specific assets to take advantage of their capital growth and diversification potential — whether you own these assets outright or they are held in trust.
Our team of specialists can provide complete turnkey services including identifying and purchasing real property and providing ongoing management.
Capital markets
Sophisticated market-linked solutions4
Through our access to the resources of Merrill Lynch, one of the world's leading capital markets participants, we can tailor approaches to risks and opportunities in the foreign exchange, interest rate, commodity and equity markets. Derivative-based transactions target the risks you seek to hedge, and are designed to dovetail with your overall portfolio and wealth management strategies.

1 Asset allocation and diversification do not ensure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets.
2 Alternative Investments such as derivatives, hedge funds, private equity funds, and funds of funds can result in higher return potential but also higher loss potential. Changes in economic conditions or other circumstances may adversely affect your investments. Before you invest in alternative investments, you should consider your overall financial situation, how much money you have to invest, your need for liquidity, and your tolerance for risk. Alternative investments are speculative and involve a high degree of risk.
3 Nonfinancial assets, such as closely-held businesses, real estate, oil, gas and mineral properties, and timber, farm and ranch land, are complex in nature and involve risks including total loss of value.  Special risk considerations include natural events (for example, earthquakes or fires), complex tax considerations, and lack of liquidity.  Nonfinancial assets are not suitable for all investors.  Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager, and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax, or estate planning strategy.
4 Brokerage services are provided by Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, a registered broker-dealer, Member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation.
Certain U.S. Trust associates are registered representatives with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated ("MLPF&S") and may assist you with investment products and services provided through MLPF&S and other nonbank investment affiliates. MLPF&S is a registered broker-dealer, member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation ("BofA Corp."). U.S. Trust operates through Bank of America, N.A., and other subsidiaries of BofA Corp.

We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

MONTREAL, June 27, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Addenda Capital Inc. and SEI Trust Company today announced a partnership to launch a collective investment trust (CIT) fund in the United States. The Montréal-based, SEC-registered investment management firm with more than USD$20 billion in assets under management will act as an advisor for the CIT. 








The fund was created by the SEI Trust Company, a subsidiary of SEI, a leading supplier of customized operating infrastructure and services to investment organizations worldwide. Addenda Capital chose to work with SEI in order to cater to investors of all sizes. 
Addenda Capital is a strong proponent of sustainable investment. In addition to promoting sustainable financial markets, the Company performs deep fundamental research which integrates ESG (environmental, social and governance) factors into its investment processes in an effort to deliver consistently superior long-term returns while maintaining a low turnover. 
"Building on our success in Canada, we want to intensify our business development activities in the United States," said Roger Beauchemin, President and Chief Executive Officer of Addenda Capital. "Our International Equity strategy has performed well above industry average and we are confident that we can deliver superior results to investors thanks to our 20+ years of experience, our innovative approach and the CIT's low-cost structure. We now have dedicated resources to build relationships with institutional investors and consultants across the U.S."
CITs: Flexible, Efficient and Effectively-Priced 
CITs, also known as collective investment funds (CIFs), are pooled funds operated by a bank or trust company. They are available to qualified retirement plans, such as 401(k) plans and other retirement and employee retirement benefit plans. Economies of scale allow for generally lower marketing, overhead and no Board of Directors or SEC filing expenses. Thus, investors benefit from enhanced profits. Unlike mutual funds, collective trusts are regulated by either the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) or a state banking authority or agency.
A pioneer in the CIT arena, the SEI Trust Company has successfully partnered with CIT advisors for more than 25 years. It currently provides services to more than 170 CITs representing $45 billion in assets under management, making it one of the leading providers of CITs. "Addenda Capital's expertise with its International Equity Strategy coupled with SEI's scalable, flexible infrastructure is an appealing combination for investors and consultants," said John Alshefski, Senior Vice President and Managing Director of SEI's Investment Manager Services division.  
About Addenda Capital
Addenda Capital is a solution-driven privately-owned investment management firm with more than USD$20 billion in assets under management. The Firm offers a broad range of strategies that can be customized to meet the evolving needs of its clients, which include institutional clients such as pension funds, corporations, insurance companies and not-for-profit organizations, as well as high net worth clients. Addenda Capital aims to add value through deep fundamental research, active management, innovation, discipline and integrity. It prides itself on exceptional client relationships built on open and transparent communications. Its approach to sustainable investment focuses on integrating environmental, social and governance issues into all of its investment processes to deliver higher-quality portfolios. 
Headquartered in Montréal (Québec), Canada, Addenda Capital has offices in Toronto, Guelph and Regina. It is co-owned by Co-operators Financial Services, a subsidiary of Canadian insurance co-operative The Co-operators Group Limited, by labour-sponsored firm Fonds de Solidarité FTQ, and by Management Shareholders. Addenda Capital is a Sustaining Member of the Responsible Investment Association (RIA), an Investor Member of the Green Bond Principles, and a signatory of the United Nations' Principles for Responsible Investment (UN PRI) and of the Montréal Carbon Pledge. Thanks to exceptional employee engagement, Addenda Capital was awarded Aon Hewitt's highest recognition in its 2017 Canadian Small and Medium Enterprise ranking as a Platinum-level Employer of Choice.

MONTREAL, June 27, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Addenda Capital Inc. and SEI Trust Company today announced a partnership to launch a collective investment trust (CIT) fund in the United States. The Montréal-based, SEC-registered investment management firm with more than USD$20 billion in assets under management will act as an advisor for the CIT. 








The fund was created by the SEI Trust Company, a subsidiary of SEI, a leading supplier of customized operating infrastructure and services to investment organizations worldwide. Addenda Capital chose to work with SEI in order to cater to investors of all sizes. 
Addenda Capital is a strong proponent of sustainable investment. In addition to promoting sustainable financial markets, the Company performs deep fundamental research which integrates ESG (environmental, social and governance) factors into its investment processes in an effort to deliver consistently superior long-term returns while maintaining a low turnover. 
"Building on our success in Canada, we want to intensify our business development activities in the United States," said Roger Beauchemin, President and Chief Executive Officer of Addenda Capital. "Our International Equity strategy has performed well above industry average and we are confident that we can deliver superior results to investors thanks to our 20+ years of experience, our innovative approach and the CIT's low-cost structure. We now have dedicated resources to build relationships with institutional investors and consultants across the U.S."
CITs: Flexible, Efficient and Effectively-Priced 
CITs, also known as collective investment funds (CIFs), are pooled funds operated by a bank or trust company. They are available to qualified retirement plans, such as 401(k) plans and other retirement and employee retirement benefit plans. Economies of scale allow for generally lower marketing, overhead and no Board of Directors or SEC filing expenses. Thus, investors benefit from enhanced profits. Unlike mutual funds, collective trusts are regulated by either the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) or a state banking authority or agency.
A pioneer in the CIT arena, the SEI Trust Company has successfully partnered with CIT advisors for more than 25 years. It currently provides services to more than 170 CITs representing $45 billion in assets under management, making it one of the leading providers of CITs. "Addenda Capital's expertise with its International Equity Strategy coupled with SEI's scalable, flexible infrastructure is an appealing combination for investors and consultants," said John Alshefski, Senior Vice President and Managing Director of SEI's Investment Manager Services division.  
About Addenda Capital
Addenda Capital is a solution-driven privately-owned investment management firm with more than USD$20 billion in assets under management. The Firm offers a broad range of strategies that can be customized to meet the evolving needs of its clients, which include institutional clients such as pension funds, corporations, insurance companies and not-for-profit organizations, as well as high net worth clients. Addenda Capital aims to add value through deep fundamental research, active management, innovation, discipline and integrity. It prides itself on exceptional client relationships built on open and transparent communications. Its approach to sustainable investment focuses on integrating environmental, social and governance issues into all of its investment processes to deliver higher-quality portfolios. 
Headquartered in Montréal (Québec), Canada, Addenda Capital has offices in Toronto, Guelph and Regina. It is co-owned by Co-operators Financial Services, a subsidiary of Canadian insurance co-operative The Co-operators Group Limited, by labour-sponsored firm Fonds de Solidarité FTQ, and by Management Shareholders. Addenda Capital is a Sustaining Member of the Responsible Investment Association (RIA), an Investor Member of the Green Bond Principles, and a signatory of the United Nations' Principles for Responsible Investment (UN PRI) and of the Montréal Carbon Pledge. Thanks to exceptional employee engagement, Addenda Capital was awarded Aon Hewitt's highest recognition in its 2017 Canadian Small and Medium Enterprise ranking as a Platinum-level Employer of Choice.

Why Invest with U.S. Bank







U.S. Bank HomeInvestments and Wealth ManagementInvestment Products GlossaryInvestment Products GlossaryWe can help you understand some of today's most popular investment options.Overview
Owning a diversified mix of investments may be appropriate to help you work toward your most important long-term goals. The good news is that you have more choices than ever before to help you round out your portfolio. But that also creates challenges, especially if you have little experience managing your own investments. A good starting point is to understand basic investment options.
Investment products and financial services are provided through U.S. Bank and/or its affiliate, U.S. Bancorp Investments, Inc.. StocksShares of stock provide an investor an ownership position in a specific corporation and represent a claim on the corporation’s earnings and assets. As an equity position, investors who purchase stock in a company seek to benefit from its continued growth and ability to generate profits, just as other owners of the company would receive. Common stock typically entitles shareholders to vote in the election of a board of directors and other matters presented for voting. Preferred stock typically does not include voting rights, but has priority on claims (such as dividend payments) compared to common stock. Corporations across the world and of all different sizes offer shares of their stock on the public market, giving all individuals an opportunity to own stock in their firms. Stock prices fluctuate throughout the day as they are bought and sold on public exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange.
Equity securities are subject to stock market fluctuations that occur in response to economic and business developments.  Investments in small and mid-sized companies may be more volatile than securities issued by larger companies. Investments outside of the USA have risks such as currency fluctuations, economic or financial instability, lack of timely or reliable information or unfavorable political or legal developments.  These risks increase for investments in emerging markets.BondsA bond is an interest-bearing security issued by a government entity or corporation. The issuer is obligated to pay the bondholder a specified amount, usually at specific intervals (interest payments) and to repay the principal amount when the bond matures. Fixed income securities are normally issued in maturities ranging from 30 days to 30 years. The ratings of bonds by various rating agencies can vary based on the reliability of the issuer and the potential risk that the issuer could default on the timely payment of interest and principal. Bonds can be traded on the open market and their principal value can fluctuate in large part due to changes in the interest rate environment or in the financial stability of the issuer.
Investing in fixed income securities (debt securities) is subject to various risks, including changes in interest rates, credit quality, market valuations, liquidity, prepayments, early redemption, corporate events, tax ramifications and other factors. Investment in debt securities typically decrease in value when interest rates rise. This risk is usually greater for longer term debt securities. Investments in lower rated and non rated securities present a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher rated securities.Mutual FundsA pool of money collected from shareholders that is invested in stocks, bonds, money market securities and other types of assets. Professional managers oversee a fund’s investment decision-making process and execute trades. Mutual funds allow individuals to gain access to a diversified group of assets for a relatively modest investment. Each fund has a stated investment objective that specifies how the underlying portfolio should be structured. Investors can choose from funds that are focused on owning stocks, bonds, specialty investments such as commodities, or a mix of different types of assets. Because funds are available across a broad range of asset classes, they may be an effective instrument to use in implementing an asset allocation strategy. Mutual funds are priced at the end of each trading day based on a fund’s Net Asset Value (NAV), which represents the combined worth of all underlying securities held in the portfolio.
Mutual fund investing involves risk; principal loss is possible. Investing in certain funds involves special risks, such as those related to investments in small- and mid-capitalization stocks, foreign, debt and high-yield securities, and funds that focus their investments in a particular industry. Mutual funds are sold by prospectus only.  Before investing, read the prospectus carefully to consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.  The current value of a collective investment fund share is calculated by dividing the total value of all securities in its portfolio, less any liabilities by the number of fund shares outstanding.Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs)Securities that track a specific index, commodity or basket of assets. They are similar to a mutual fund, but trade like a stock on an exchange. The value of individual ETFs fluctuates in price throughout the day as it is bought and sold on the open market. Investors in ETFs can trade it as they would a stock, including the use of techniques such as short selling and margin buying. ETFs tend to have lower costs than the average mutual fund.
Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) are baskets of securities that are traded on an exchange like individual stocks at negotiated prices and are not individually redeemable. ETFs are designed to generally track a market index – broad stock or bond market, stock industry sector or international stock. Shares of ETFs may trade at a premium or a discount to the net asset value of the underlying securities.  The current value of a collective investment fund share is calculated by dividing the total value of all securities in its portfolio, less any liabilities by the number of fund shares outstanding. Because ETFs and closed-end funds trade like stocks, their shares trade at market value which price can be at a premium or discount to NAV.  Exchange-traded funds are sold by prospectus. Please consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing. The prospectus, which contains this and other information, can be obtained by calling your financial advisor. Read it carefully before you invest.Unit Investment Trusts (UITs)A Unit Investment Trust (UIT) is a type of investment company that offers shares as “units” usually redeemable by the investor with the company.  A UIT does not actively trade its investment portfolio so there is usually little to no portfolio turnover.  UITs typically invest in stocks or bonds, which are selected as part of an overall investment strategy.  UITs may adopt a variety of strategies designed for income or capital appreciation.  The investment minimums are usually low, often $1,000 for nonqualified accounts ($100 for IRAs).  A UIT does not have a board of directors and does not employ an investment adviser to render advice during the life of the trust.Managed AccountsA personalized account for individual investors where a professional manager selects investments designed to work toward specific goals. The investor can count on a professional to monitor the account and make appropriate changes as necessary. Typically, a simple annual fee is charged for the account, and there are no charges for individual transactions. Managed accounts tend to have the flexibility to own a broad range of assets, including stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETFs and other vehicles.AnnuitiesA contract between an individual and an insurance company designed to allow for tax-deferred accumulation of investment earnings. Fixed annuities come with a rate of return that is guaranteed by the claims-paying ability of the insurance company. An annuity contract can be annuitized, providing the individual with a guarantee (from the insurance company) of a fixed or variable payment at a future date.
A deferred variable annuity is a long-term financial product designed for retirement purposes. Before investing, read the prospectus carefully to consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, expenses and other important information. Early withdrawals may be a subject to surrender charges, and if taken prior to age 59 1/2, a 10% federal income tax penalty may apply. All guarantees are back by the claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company. How to Get Started

Investment Management
Insights, Strategies and Solutions
Our experienced professionals have expertise in a broad spectrum of traditional, alternative and non-financial assets.  We can work with you to develop and manage a portfolio tailored to your needs.






Portfolio Consulting
A collaborative dialogue with your portfolio manager
Your portfolio manager is a key member of your U.S. Trust relationship team and serves as your personal "chief investment officer." He or she will work with you to create an Investment Policy Statement, which serves as a blueprint for your portfolio by documenting your:

Objectives
Risk tolerance
Cash flow needs
 Tax situation
Wealth aspirations

Your portfolio manager's ongoing role is to incorporate our best strategic and tactical thinking, most relevant research analysis, current market insights and appropriate investment solutions into your portfolio. He or she will regularly monitor your portfolio to make sure it conforms to your Investment Policy Statement, which will be updated whenever there are significant changes in your life or goals.
Asset management
A more complete approach to asset allocation1
We analyze a wide range of asset classes, including hedge and private equity funds2 and global investment opportunities, as potential components of an asset allocation. In addition, we believe that true diversification requires managing for cash flows across and within asset classes in various market environments — not simply allocating according to a grid.
Your asset allocation will be based on the long-term expectations established for each asset class by our most senior investment professionals. Over the shorter term, however, your portfolio manager can adjust your portfolio tactically in response to emerging opportunities and risks, and reflecting U.S. Trust insights about trends and themes relevant to you.
How you own your assets — personally or in trusts; in taxable or tax-exempt solutions — can have a material impact on the overall performance of your portfolio. At U.S. Trust we focus on this wealth structuring aspect of your portfolio in conjunction with managing the assets themselves.
Alternative Investments
SOPHISTICATED SOLUTIONS TO MEET YOUR NEEDS2
Alternative investments at U.S. Trust focus on non-traditional assets such as:

Hedge funds
Private equity
Real estate and tangible assets

Because performance is often differentiated from equity and fixed income markets, alternative investments may be an ideal complement to traditional investments. 
Through our access to the industry's premier managers, we are able to offer solutions that provide options for all client segments. And we support you every step of the way with knowledge built on our experience in alternatives, including industry-leading research, rigorous due diligence, and cutting-edge portfolio construction.
Drawing from the experience, resources and expertise of the firm, you and your portfolio manager can explore alternative investments that can help you pursue what matters most to you.
Specialty asset management
Expertise in nonfinancial assets3
Specialty asset management at U.S. Trust focuses on nonfinancial assets such as:

Farm and ranch land
Timberland
Oil and gas properties
Private businesses
Real estate

Our Specialty Asset Management team can work with your portfolio manager and wealth strategist, as appropriate, to integrate these real assets into your overall plan and portfolio.
We can help you realize your objectives with assets you already own, or help you acquire specific assets to take advantage of their capital growth and diversification potential — whether you own these assets outright or they are held in trust.
Our team of specialists can provide complete turnkey services including identifying and purchasing real property and providing ongoing management.
Capital markets
Sophisticated market-linked solutions4
Through our access to the resources of Merrill Lynch, one of the world's leading capital markets participants, we can tailor approaches to risks and opportunities in the foreign exchange, interest rate, commodity and equity markets. Derivative-based transactions target the risks you seek to hedge, and are designed to dovetail with your overall portfolio and wealth management strategies.

1 Asset allocation and diversification do not ensure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets.
2 Alternative Investments such as derivatives, hedge funds, private equity funds, and funds of funds can result in higher return potential but also higher loss potential. Changes in economic conditions or other circumstances may adversely affect your investments. Before you invest in alternative investments, you should consider your overall financial situation, how much money you have to invest, your need for liquidity, and your tolerance for risk. Alternative investments are speculative and involve a high degree of risk.
3 Nonfinancial assets, such as closely-held businesses, real estate, oil, gas and mineral properties, and timber, farm and ranch land, are complex in nature and involve risks including total loss of value.  Special risk considerations include natural events (for example, earthquakes or fires), complex tax considerations, and lack of liquidity.  Nonfinancial assets are not suitable for all investors.  Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager, and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax, or estate planning strategy.
4 Brokerage services are provided by Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, a registered broker-dealer, Member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation.
Certain U.S. Trust associates are registered representatives with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated ("MLPF&S") and may assist you with investment products and services provided through MLPF&S and other nonbank investment affiliates. MLPF&S is a registered broker-dealer, member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation ("BofA Corp."). U.S. Trust operates through Bank of America, N.A., and other subsidiaries of BofA Corp.

Wealth Structuring
Preservation and Transfer
Your wealth plan is designed to provide you and your family with thoughtful and innovative solutions customized to the financial and personal complexities of your life.  We bring you knowledge, experience and expertise across the broad range of wealth structuring disciplines.






Wealth Planning
Integrating your personal and financial affairs
By thinking holistically about all aspects of your wealth, we develop customized strategies to help pursue your unique goals. Wealth structuring can help you address issues including:

The cash flow required to help meet your lifestyle
The investments needed to help meet long-range objectives 
The most effective way to pursue estate planning goals 
The tax implications of the many aspects of managing and transferring your wealth

Trusts and Estates
Shaping your legacy and transferring your wealth
For more than two centuries, U.S. Trust has been helping many of America's wealthiest families build estate plans and implement wealth transfer strategies. Your team can work with you to build a sound estate plan that may help you:

Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan
Identify the best-qualified grant recipients
Monitor the impact of your efforts

We can help you design and implement a philanthropic strategy that helps you fulfill your values-based commitments in a way that is consistent with your lifestyle.

Benefiting from the experience of dedicated custody specialists
U.S. Trust is the custodian of choice for many sophisticated investors with extensive and complex holdings. Whether you manage your own portfolio or work with multiple brokers and investment managers, we can structure a personalized custody program that simplifies portfolio and trade monitoring and helps meet your specific safekeeping, service and information needs.

Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax or estate planning strategy.
