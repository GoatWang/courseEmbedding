Who Needs Antivirus Software?These days, everybody needs antivirus software.Computer viruses don’t just come from streaming or downloading movies. Many people think that they can avoid potential threats by making sure they don’t visit certain websites or download certain files.The truth is computer viruses can make their way onto your computer or any other device in a number of ways. You can pick up viruses and malware simply by checking your email, browsing the web or from putting a USB memory stick into your laptop.Virus protection is a requisite of having your own personal computer. Luckily for you, there are hundreds of choices of antivirus software – each with its pros and cons. Making a choice between internet security software can be difficult, but that’s what we’re here for!How Antivirus WorksMost antivirus software works on a signature database, monitoring the internet 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Every time a new virus is reported – it’s indexed, catalogued and added to the software’s database. Once your antivirus software is up-to-date it is equipped to tackle the new virus should it ever reach your device.How to Handle VirusesYou often have three options when faced with a threat on your computer: delete the threat, quarantine it or ignore it.Deleting is almost always the best option, but some viruses make themselves "un-deletable" and quarantining becomes your only option. Your quarantine folder will keep the virus isolated and prevent it from spreading or causing damage to other files. Antivirus can be passive or active – passive requires you to make scheduled or manual virus scans, while active runs in the background; detecting and fighting threats in real-time.Free vs Paid Antivirus SoftwareIf you are deciding on a new antivirus software and may want to try a free version, keep in mind that there are pros and cons for both paid and free versions. Using a free antivirus software can cost you more in the long run and most experts suggest that it’s better to use a paid version. Free versions can be great to try a new software or set of features, but will never provide the same level of protection - and your service most certainly won’t include internet security software.Paid versions of an antivirus software will cover both online and offline activities, permanently delete sensitive digital files and provide extra encryption to protect your most private files from malware like Trojans, worms and ransomware.A paid antivirus software is especially helpful if you have a PC or device that has already been infected. Many paid versions offer virus removal and cleanup tools, in addition to the highest-quality prevention and detection rates.Extra FeaturesThere are a few key features that you should look out for when looking for antivirus software, and it will vary depending on your needs.Online Protection - If you’re online, then you probably want an internet security software with a built-in firewall.Email Protection - If you’re a heavy email user then you’ll want be on the lookout for anti-spam, spyware and phishing.Parental Controls - Parents need to look for software with easy-to-use parental controls and restrictions.Gaming Protection - Gamers can look forward to a "gaming mode," which prompts the internet security software to use less resources.Compatibility - You will want to check the compatibility of your chosen software with your operating system, whether that be Windows protection, Mac OS antivirus and everything in between.How We Review & ScoreChoosing the best antivirus software should be much easier with our expert reviews. Our experts have analyzed some of the best choices on the market, and each review covers a wide range of topics, including:PricingFeaturesEase of useOverall value for moneyCustomer supportUser experienceIndependent testingBut it’s up to you to decide which is the most applicable for your needs. If you need more help, checkout all of our in-depth, expert reviews.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
