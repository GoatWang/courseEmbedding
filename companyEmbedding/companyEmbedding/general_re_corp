History[edit]
General Reinsurance Corporation’s history began in 1921 as the General Casualty and Surety Reinsurance Corporation, before it took over the U.S. business of the Norwegian Globe Insurance Company of Christiania, Norway.[5]
In 1923, American investors acquired the company and changed the name to General Reinsurance Corporation. In 1928, the General Alliance Corporation was organized to acquire and hold the shares of General Reinsurance Corporation, as well as a half interest in the holdings of the Royal Exchange Assurance Group (London) in the United British Insurance Co., Ltd. In 1929, the General Alliance Corporation owned all the stock of General Reinsurance Corporation, and jointly with the Royal Exchange Group, a controlling interest in the United British. The United British Insurance Co., Ltd. established a U.S. branch that transacted casualty reinsurance as a "running mate for the General, and has the same management as the General. The two companies transact practically all forms of casualty and surety reinsurance and constitute the first example of a 'Group' in the history of American casualty reinsurance."[5]
Also in 1929, General Reinsurance affirmed that it would be only a direct reinsurer. In 1945, General Reinsurance merged with Mellon Indemnity Corporation. In 1954, the company created the first professional casualty facultative reinsurance department. Property facultative followed, beginning in 1956. North America branch offices were opened during this time. In the 1950s, General Reinsurance began writing reinsurance internationally, expanding in this area during the 1960s and 1970s. The company continued to grow through the next two decades, opening more U.S. and Canada branch offices and making various acquisitions. The company moved its headquarters from New York City to Greenwich, Connecticut in 1974, and then to Stamford, Connecticut in 1984. In 1980, General Re Corporation, the parent holding company, was listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
In 1994, General Reinsurance Corporation formed an alliance with what was then Cologne Re (Kölnische Rückversicherungs-Gesellschaft, which was founded in 1846), now General Reinsurance AG. In 1998, General Re Corporation was acquired by Berkshire Hathaway Inc., and in 2003 General Reinsurance Corporation and Cologne Re began marketing under the brand name of Gen Re.[6] In 2009, General Reinsurance Corporation completed its purchase of Cologne Re,[7] whose name was changed to General Reinsurance AG in 2010.[8] The company continues to market globally as Gen Re.
AIG Securities Fraud[edit]
Main article: American International Group
In October 2000, some Wall Street analysts questioned the decline in American International Group (AIG) loss reserves.[9] In an effort to quell these concerns, AIG entered into two sham reinsurance transactions with Cologne Re Dublin, a subsidiary of General Reinsurance, that had no economic substance but were designed to add $500 million in phony loss reserves to AIG’s balance sheet in the fourth quarter of 2000 and first quarter of 2001.[9][10]
In 2005, New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer began an investigation into the two reinsurance transactions. Soon afterwards, AIG came under market pressure, and admitted it had undertaken what could be construed as securities fraud. The staff admitted that the two reinsurance transactions had inflated AIG’s balance sheet and propped up AIG’s stock price. In the resultant stock crash, investors lost $500 million in investments.[10]
Cologne Re Dublin's CEO, John Houldsworth, agreed to turn state's witness for the Department of Justice (DOJ) and Securities and Exchange Commission, in agreement for a plea bargain. Houldsworth then pleaded guilty to conspiring to commit securities fraud, resultantly facing a sentence of up to five years in prison and $250,000 in fines. The final sentencing was placed on hold, subject to consequential SEC prosecutions.[10]
The DOJ subsequently undertook successful prosecutions against four former Gen Re executives and one former AIG executive: CEO Ronald Ferguson was sentenced to two years in prison and fined $200,000; CFO Elizabeth Monrad was sentenced to 18 months in prison and fined $250,000; Senior Vice President Christopher Garand was sentenced to a year and a day in prison and fined $150,000; Senior Vice President and Assistant General Counsel Robert Graham was sentenced to a year and a day in prison and fined $100,000; AIG's Vice President Christian Milton was sentenced to four years in prison and fined $200,000.[10]
In 2009, in front of U.S. District Judge Christopher Droney in Hartford, Houldsworth apologized. He was resultantly fined $5,000 and ordered to perform 400 hours of community service during a two-year probation period.
On August 1, 2011, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit vacated the five Gen Re and AIG defendants’ convictions and remanded the defendants for a new trial, holding that the reported drop in share prices could not be attributed to the two reinsurance deals.[11] [12]
Resolution[edit]
"In June 2012, the U.S. government agreed to not pursue any further legal action against the former Gen Re executives pursuant to deferred prosecution agreements that have since expired and are no longer in effect. As a result, the government matter is fully and finally resolved. Civil litigation related to the AIG matter has also been fully and finally resolved. The lead plaintiffs and Gen Re reached a settlement agreement which the court approved pursuant to a final order entered on September 11, 2013." [13]
Business[edit]
Reinsurers "insure insurance companies", i.e., they will pay a portion of an insurance company's claims in exchange for a portion of the premium received by the insurance company for policies that cover those claims.
As a direct reinsurer, Gen Re delivers reinsurance solutions to companies in all segments of the insurance industry on both a Treaty and Facultative basis. Gen Re's Property and Casualty reinsurance in North America is written through General Reinsurance Corporation and internationally through Germany-based General Reinsurance AG and other wholly owned affiliates. Gen Re's Life and Health reinsurance is written in North America through General Re Life Corporation and internationally through General Reinsurance AG.
Office locations[edit]
Gen Re's headquarters are in Stamford, Connecticut. Branch and subsidiary offices are located all over the world:[14]
In North America, Gen Re also operates in Atlanta, Boston, Charlotte, Chicago, Columbus, Dallas, Hartford, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Montreal, New York, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Seattle, South Portland, St. Paul and Toronto.
Gen Re further operates in Latin America (Mexico City, São Paulo), Europe/Middle East (Beirut, Cologne, Copenhagen, London, Madrid, Milan, Moscow, Paris, Vienna), Africa (Cape Town, Johannesburg), Asia (Beijing, Hong Kong, Mumbai, Seoul, Shanghai, Singapore, Taipei, Tokyo) and Australasia (Auckland, Melbourne, Sydney).

History[edit]
General Reinsurance Corporation’s history began in 1921 as the General Casualty and Surety Reinsurance Corporation, before it took over the U.S. business of the Norwegian Globe Insurance Company of Christiania, Norway.[5]
In 1923, American investors acquired the company and changed the name to General Reinsurance Corporation. In 1928, the General Alliance Corporation was organized to acquire and hold the shares of General Reinsurance Corporation, as well as a half interest in the holdings of the Royal Exchange Assurance Group (London) in the United British Insurance Co., Ltd. In 1929, the General Alliance Corporation owned all the stock of General Reinsurance Corporation, and jointly with the Royal Exchange Group, a controlling interest in the United British. The United British Insurance Co., Ltd. established a U.S. branch that transacted casualty reinsurance as a "running mate for the General, and has the same management as the General. The two companies transact practically all forms of casualty and surety reinsurance and constitute the first example of a 'Group' in the history of American casualty reinsurance."[5]
Also in 1929, General Reinsurance affirmed that it would be only a direct reinsurer. In 1945, General Reinsurance merged with Mellon Indemnity Corporation. In 1954, the company created the first professional casualty facultative reinsurance department. Property facultative followed, beginning in 1956. North America branch offices were opened during this time. In the 1950s, General Reinsurance began writing reinsurance internationally, expanding in this area during the 1960s and 1970s. The company continued to grow through the next two decades, opening more U.S. and Canada branch offices and making various acquisitions. The company moved its headquarters from New York City to Greenwich, Connecticut in 1974, and then to Stamford, Connecticut in 1984. In 1980, General Re Corporation, the parent holding company, was listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
In 1994, General Reinsurance Corporation formed an alliance with what was then Cologne Re (Kölnische Rückversicherungs-Gesellschaft, which was founded in 1846), now General Reinsurance AG. In 1998, General Re Corporation was acquired by Berkshire Hathaway Inc., and in 2003 General Reinsurance Corporation and Cologne Re began marketing under the brand name of Gen Re.[6] In 2009, General Reinsurance Corporation completed its purchase of Cologne Re,[7] whose name was changed to General Reinsurance AG in 2010.[8] The company continues to market globally as Gen Re.
AIG Securities Fraud[edit]
Main article: American International Group
In October 2000, some Wall Street analysts questioned the decline in American International Group (AIG) loss reserves.[9] In an effort to quell these concerns, AIG entered into two sham reinsurance transactions with Cologne Re Dublin, a subsidiary of General Reinsurance, that had no economic substance but were designed to add $500 million in phony loss reserves to AIG’s balance sheet in the fourth quarter of 2000 and first quarter of 2001.[9][10]
In 2005, New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer began an investigation into the two reinsurance transactions. Soon afterwards, AIG came under market pressure, and admitted it had undertaken what could be construed as securities fraud. The staff admitted that the two reinsurance transactions had inflated AIG’s balance sheet and propped up AIG’s stock price. In the resultant stock crash, investors lost $500 million in investments.[10]
Cologne Re Dublin's CEO, John Houldsworth, agreed to turn state's witness for the Department of Justice (DOJ) and Securities and Exchange Commission, in agreement for a plea bargain. Houldsworth then pleaded guilty to conspiring to commit securities fraud, resultantly facing a sentence of up to five years in prison and $250,000 in fines. The final sentencing was placed on hold, subject to consequential SEC prosecutions.[10]
The DOJ subsequently undertook successful prosecutions against four former Gen Re executives and one former AIG executive: CEO Ronald Ferguson was sentenced to two years in prison and fined $200,000; CFO Elizabeth Monrad was sentenced to 18 months in prison and fined $250,000; Senior Vice President Christopher Garand was sentenced to a year and a day in prison and fined $150,000; Senior Vice President and Assistant General Counsel Robert Graham was sentenced to a year and a day in prison and fined $100,000; AIG's Vice President Christian Milton was sentenced to four years in prison and fined $200,000.[10]
In 2009, in front of U.S. District Judge Christopher Droney in Hartford, Houldsworth apologized. He was resultantly fined $5,000 and ordered to perform 400 hours of community service during a two-year probation period.
On August 1, 2011, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit vacated the five Gen Re and AIG defendants’ convictions and remanded the defendants for a new trial, holding that the reported drop in share prices could not be attributed to the two reinsurance deals.[11] [12]
Resolution[edit]
"In June 2012, the U.S. government agreed to not pursue any further legal action against the former Gen Re executives pursuant to deferred prosecution agreements that have since expired and are no longer in effect. As a result, the government matter is fully and finally resolved. Civil litigation related to the AIG matter has also been fully and finally resolved. The lead plaintiffs and Gen Re reached a settlement agreement which the court approved pursuant to a final order entered on September 11, 2013." [13]
Business[edit]
Reinsurers "insure insurance companies", i.e., they will pay a portion of an insurance company's claims in exchange for a portion of the premium received by the insurance company for policies that cover those claims.
As a direct reinsurer, Gen Re delivers reinsurance solutions to companies in all segments of the insurance industry on both a Treaty and Facultative basis. Gen Re's Property and Casualty reinsurance in North America is written through General Reinsurance Corporation and internationally through Germany-based General Reinsurance AG and other wholly owned affiliates. Gen Re's Life and Health reinsurance is written in North America through General Re Life Corporation and internationally through General Reinsurance AG.
Office locations[edit]
Gen Re's headquarters are in Stamford, Connecticut. Branch and subsidiary offices are located all over the world:[14]
In North America, Gen Re also operates in Atlanta, Boston, Charlotte, Chicago, Columbus, Dallas, Hartford, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Montreal, New York, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Seattle, South Portland, St. Paul and Toronto.
Gen Re further operates in Latin America (Mexico City, São Paulo), Europe/Middle East (Beirut, Cologne, Copenhagen, London, Madrid, Milan, Moscow, Paris, Vienna), Africa (Cape Town, Johannesburg), Asia (Beijing, Hong Kong, Mumbai, Seoul, Shanghai, Singapore, Taipei, Tokyo) and Australasia (Auckland, Melbourne, Sydney).

Berkshire Hathaway and General RE Corp. to Merge




FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE


 


Berkshire Hathaway Inc.
General Re Corporation


1440 Kiewit Plaza
Financial Centre


Omaha, NE 68131
Stamford, Connecticut 06904






 
BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC. AND GENERAL RE CORPORATION TO MERGE
 

Omaha, Nebraska and Stamford, Connecticut, June 19, 1998 -- Berkshire
Hathaway Inc. and General Re Corporation announced today that they have
reached a definitive agreement to merge.

Under the agreement, General Re shareholders will have the option at
closing of accepting either 0.0035 Class A shares or 0.105 Class B shares
of Berkshire. The transaction is expected to be tax-free to General Re
shareholders. Based on Thursday's closing prices, the value of the consideration
to be received by General Re shareholders is approximately $276.50 per
General Re share. The total consideration for the transaction will be approximately
$22 billion. The merger will be accounted for by Berkshire as a purchase.

Pro forma for the transaction, Berkshire would have had GAAP net worth
of approximately $56 billion, as of March 31, 1998, the highest of any
company in the United States, and a market capitalization today of approximately
$120 billion.

Ron Ferguson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of General Re, will
join Berkshire's Board of Directors. General Re will operate independently
of Berkshire's other insurance and reinsurance operations.

It is anticipated that the transaction, which is subject, among other
things, to regulatory approvals and the approvals of the two companies'
shareholders, will be completed in the fourth quarter.

Under the terms of the agreement, General Re has agreed to grant Berkshire
options to purchase, subject to certain terms, up to 19.9% of the outstanding
General Re shares at the transaction price, subject to a cash limit of
3% of the aggregate consideration.

Warren Buffett, Chairman of Berkshire, commented: "The merger will bring
more than $80,000 of investments to Berkshire for each Class A or Class
A-equivalent share issued. That's beneficial, being nearly double the existing
level, or, put another way, the merger brings more than $24 billion of
additional investments to Berkshire.

"But the main attraction of the merger is synergy, a word that heretofore
has never been used in listing the reasons for a Berkshire acquisition.
In this transaction, however, there are at least four areas of powerful
synergy, which Charles Munger, Berkshire's Vice Chairman, and I believe
justify the premium price that Berkshire is paying.

"First, this transaction removes constraints on earnings volatility
that have caused General Re, in the past, to decline certain attractive
business and, in other cases, to lay off substantial amounts of the business
that it does write. Because of both its status as a public company and
its desire to maintain its AAA credit rating, General Re has, understandably,
been unable to operate in a manner that could produce large swings in reported
earnings. As part of Berkshire, this constraint will disappear, which will
enhance both General Re's long-term profitability and its ability to write
more business. Furthermore, General Re will be free to reduce its reliance
on the retrocessional market over time, and thereby have substantial additional
funds available for investment.

"Second, General Re has substantial opportunities to develop its global
reinsurance franchise. As part of Berkshire, General Re will be able to
make investments to grow its international business as quickly as it sees
fit.

"Additionally, General Re will gain tax flexibility as a result of the
merger. In managing insurance investments, it is a distinct advantage to
know that large amounts of taxable income will consistently recur. Most
insurance companies are in no position to make this assumption. Any Berkshire
insurance subsidiary can fashion its investment strategy without worry
as to the presence of taxable income in the future due to Berkshire's large
and diverse streams of taxable income.

"Finally, Berkshire's insurance subsidiaries never need to worry
about having abundant capital. Therefore, they can follow whatever asset
strategy makes the most sense, unconstrained by the effect on the capital
of the Company of a sharp market decline. Periodically, this flexibility
has proven of enormous advantage to Berkshire's insurance subsidiaries.

"These synergies will be coupled with General Re's pristine worldwide
reputation, long-standing client relationships and powerful underwriting,
risk management and distribution capabilities. This combination virtually
assures both Berkshire and General Re shareholders that they will have
a better future than if the two companies operated separately."

Ron Ferguson stated: "I am very enthusiastic about our merger with Berkshire.
The combined entity is a unique and extraordinary business model that provides
us with the long-term commitment, the financial resources and the optimal
platform to serve our clients and, thus, grow our franchise. General Re's
future has never been brighter."

Berkshire is a holding company owning subsidiaries engaged in a number
of diverse business activities. The most important of these is the property
and casualty insurance business conducted on both a direct and reinsurance
basis through a number of subsidiaries.

General Re Corporation is a holding company for global reinsurance and
related risk management operations. It owns General Reinsurance Corporation
and National Reinsurance Corporation, the largest professional property/casualty
reinsurance group domiciled in the United States, and also holds a controlling
interest in Köinische Rückversicherungs-Gesellschaft AG (Cologne
Re), a major international reinsurer. Together, General Re and Cologne

General Re Corporation, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway, is a holding company for global reinsurance and related operations. It owns the General Reinsurance Corporation and holds a controlling interest in Cologne Re. Together, General Re and Cologne Re conduct business as Gen Re. The organization is among the largest reinsurers worldwide.

Insurance is a key component in helping you recover from accidents, disasters and lawsuits. At General Re Corp, we have you covered. Our agents and support staff are here to give you the right insurance related advice based on your specific needs – helping you get the right coverage for you, your family and/or your business. While we can help you with almost any type of insurance, or guide you to the right partner of ours here are some of the key areas that most folk require insurance -

Home Insurance (including renters insurance, condo insurance) – every community and locality has specific needs. Some areas are more prone to fires, others to floods. Our agents understand the vagaries of homeowners insurance needed in the Boston, MA area and we can help you get great insurance coverage for – fire protection, flood insurance, insuring valuables, and even personal umbrella insurance – coverage that gives you additional peace of mind.
Auto Insurance – in the vast majority of states it is illegal to drive without at the very minimum liability insurance coverage for a vehicle you drive. But, the nuances are different from state to state and in some cases county and city rules may require special consideration. Our agents can help you navigate the different auto insurance coverages, riders and recommend carriers, pricing and adequate coverage based on your specific needs.
Business insurance – every business has different needs. While all businesses need some form of liability insurance; professional services need additional E&O, there are specific needs for each and every class of business - for example construction/contractors may need specific coverage based on the location (Boston, MA); and many blue collar businesses need special commercial auto insurance and workers compensation coverages.
Pick up the phone – call 617-728-3800, we would love to hear your story, give you some great insurance advice, and if you think we can get you some comparative quotes, we will use our expertise to your advantage.

History of Gen Re



With our roots beginning in 1921 in North America and in 1846 in Europe, we've always been an "underwriting company" - more interested in underwriting quality than volume. We've been a direct reinsurer since 1929 when General Reinsurance® affirmed that it would only sell directly to insurers. 
Gen Re has made significant contributions to the structure of today's reinsurance markets. In Germany in 1846 (as Cologne Re), the world's first independent professional reinsurance company was born, and in 1852, the first professional reinsurance treaty was signed. Gen Re was the first company to offer casualty and property facultative reinsurance in the 1950s and the first company to write reinsurance on an excess basis. 
In 1994, General Re® formed an alliance with Cologne Re (now General Reinsurance AG). In 1998, Berkshire Hathaway acquired General Re Corporation, our holding company, and in 2003 General Re and Cologne Re began marketing globally under the brand name of Gen Re. In 2009 General Re completed its purchase of Cologne Re, whose name was changed to General Reinsurance AG in 2010.
We have no exit strategy. Gen Re will be here for the long term. 
 
 
 
 



Corporate Responsibility


Gen Re takes social responsibility very seriously with respect to our associates, our clients, our community and our environment. We have a Code of Business Conduct in place, which guides our employees to fair and ethical business conduct and explains our shared responsibilities to the public and our business partners, and amongst ourselves. This code is an essential means for achieving our corporate goals. Every employee is expected to be familiar with it, and every manager is expected to ensure the observance of these rules.
Gen Re makes annual donations that focus on social services and culture. We also have a "100% matching" program for the private donations of our North American and German staff members, and we award an annual scholarship to young classical musicians in Cologne. And we sponsor a visiting professor at the Institute for Insurance Education at the University of Cologne.  
Gen Re has implemented a number of energy-saving and recycling initiatives, and we continue to expand the number and scope of our "green" initiatives.  With our risk management expertise, as a leading global reinsurer and financial services company, we believe that we may be able to make an impact on some of the considerable challenges and opportunities posed by rapid environmental, economic and societal changes and the risks that emerge from those changes.
Gen Re’s IT security landscape addresses the ever-evolving security challenges and threats,  and at the same time contributes to the development and deployment of  robust IT governance mechanisms.
We will continue to build on our activities in these fields, and will consider undertaking specific and appropriate Corporate Social Responsibility initiatives as they arise.
