Our Company
From our very beginnings in 1976, M/I Homes has been deeply committed to quality, value, integrity and above all, treating the customer right. Today, our commitment to our customers is evident in all of our new homes in Austin. Choose from one of our beautiful move-in ready homes or build your own home to fit the way you live in one of our convenient new home communities.
10-Year Transferable Structural Warranty
We back our homes with an industry-leading, 10-year Structural Warranty. What kind of company would offer that kind of coverage? One that's confident it builds a better home. That means you can buy with confidence. And it's transferable, so your home will have added value if you decide to sell.
More Included Options and Choices
At M/I Homes, we pride ourselves on our extensive included features list. Not only do we include things like Rinnai Tankless Water Heaters, 16 SEER A/C systems, full sod, fenced backyards, 10ft ceilings, and 8ft doors, but many other included features come with a choice! What that means is you get to choose between 7 different included granites, four different included lighting packages, 4 different interior door styles, two styles of door hardware, two styles and two different colors of bathroom fixtures, plus many more, and all choices are included! We dare you to compare an M/I Homes included feature list to that of one of our competitors…we promise you will be impressed!
Where we Build
We are building new homes in premier locations across Austin! We are in communities minutes away from Williamson County Regional Park, Brushy Creek Park, Dell Diamond, Cedar Park Center, Round Rock Premium Outlets, Hill Country Galleria, Lakeline Mall, I-35, 183A, and 71. Not only that, but we are in the leading school districts: Leander ISD, Lake Travis ISD, Georgetown ISD, and Round Rock ISD! No matter what community you decide on, you will be minutes away from major employers, great schools, shopping, outdoor fun, and entertainment!

Arrowhead Ranch


The Location.
Arrowhead Ranch is M/I Homes' first community in Dripping Springs and Hays County. Located 25 miles west of Austin, Arrowhead Ranch is on the west side of Dripping Springs. Arrowhead Ranch gives you the homey, small town feel yet conveniently located only minutes away from HEB, restaurants, banks, and parks! Making it even more special, Dripping Springs is the nation's sixth city to be designated as a Dark Sky Community!
The Community.
Located on 362 acres, Arrowhead Ranch sits on a plateau that overlooks Onion Creek and has beautiful Texas Hill country views. It's hard to choose the perfect lot with so many options! Our homesites feature incredible views, with numerous greenbelt and cul-de-sac lots available. This gated community will include trails, several pocket parks, and an amenity center with pool! Students of Arrowhead Ranch will be in the Dripping Springs ISD and will attend Walnut Springs Elementary (2 miles away), Dripping Springs Middle School (.4 miles away), and Dripping Springs High School (1.6 miles away).
The Homes.
Homes in this community sit on 60ft or 70ft homesites with floorplans from our Prestige and Legacy collection. Depending on the floorplan; homes range in size from 2,263 - 3,913 square feet. Features include items such as granite in the kitchen, bathrooms, and valet, 10ft main floor ceilings, blinds on all windows, tongue and groove patio ceilings, Rinnai tankless water heaters, and many more additional options! There are 1-story, 1.5-story, and 2-story homes. These plans will include or give you the option to add, 3-5 bedrooms, formal dining, game room, study, media room, and covered back patios.
The Builder.
M/I Homes of Austin is proud to build your new home. You can be confident in the quality and the energy efficiency of your home as each home is built with a 10-Year Transferable Structural Warranty and built to our Whole Home Standards. In addition to our Whole Home Standards and warranty, financing through M/I Financial is a real M/I Difference. Because there are specific timetables in construction, financing a new home is more complicated than financing an existing home. We're experts. And our title companies will make your closing quick and convenient. To learn more about M/I Homes in Dripping Springs at Arrowhead Ranch, contact us today!

      "When we saw what options & upgrade choices were available, along with the location, we just knew it was the perfect fit for us.  Not to mention the overall open floorplan is amazing!"
    

      -Nycia Emerson M/I Homes Blog









      "Our Construction Supervisor is very hands-on and really strives to make sure we are satisfied. He communicated frequently with us as the house neared completion and was always open to answering any questions we had. His commitment to quality was evident at the walkthrough and he has personally followed up in the 30 days since we closed on any minor issue we've had, no matter how small. He is very good with people and make sure that the buyer is informed and comfortablethroughout the process. I've been around a lot of construction supervisors and superintendents and John would rank among the best that I've experienced. We want him to build our next home (although, not for a while)!"
    

      -S. Whitworth 
    








      "We looked at as many builders in our area as possible and the second we stepped into the M/I Homes model we knew it was a perfect fit for us. The other builders were offering "upgrades" that M/I was offering as items that were already included in the base price. There was a clean and classic, yet modern feel to what was being offered."
    

      -Johnna Hold M/I Homes Blog









      "We purchased our M/I Home in November and have been extremely pleased with it. We love the craftsmanship, the quality, and the attention to detail that M/I Homes has put in our house. It has made adding things like an alarm system much easier and cost effective. The sales staff are knowledgable and friendly. They literally bent over backwards to make the entire process as quick and easy as possible. We highly recommend M/I Homes to anyone that wants a quality home at an affordable price."
    

      -John and Shari Suter Arrowhead Ranch

Goodnight Ranch





The Location.
Goodnight is a rapidly growing community in Travis County. It is located just shy of 3 miles from I-35 and Slaughter Lane and about 10 miles from downtown Austin as well as the Austin-Bergstrom International Airport. With this South Austin community in close proximity to downtown you will be minutes away from the dining and entertainment found at Congress Ave, 6th Street, Lady Bird Lake, and Zilker Park. Goodnight has beautiful new homes located just south of the Onion Creek Metropolitan Park and to the west of Blazier Elementary School.
The Community.
Goodnight is a master planned community that is projected to include 3,500 new homes and 226,000 square feet of mixed use commercial space once completed. Residents will enjoy a community center with a pool, several ponds, and pocket parks. Additionally, as a unique bonus, Goodnight will include a continuous trail system which will loop the community, connecting it to the adjacent Onion Creek Metro Park, future commercial developments, as well as AISD's Blazier Elementary school and an additional future AISD campus, just west of the residential lots. With underground pedestrian tunnels designed to avoid major street crossings, enjoying all that Goodnight has to offer will be easy and safe!
The Homes.
Goodnight has inspired a brand new series of homes to be added to the M/I Homes line up, the Legend Series. Sitting on 45ft home sites and designed to fit the South Austin lifestyle, these homes have front porches and rear loading garages with a variety of styles ranging from Craftsman to Hill County and even Contemporary designs. They range in size from 1,700 - 2,800 square feet and offer one and two story options. These homes are full of amazing included features and design selections! Select homes may include a game room, study or a flex space. Covered patios, additional bedrooms and gourmet kitchens are all options offered to make the home your own! All Legend Series homes come complete with full sod, granite in kitchen and all bathrooms, strategic low voltage, the highest energy efficiency standards, numerous design options that come with a choice, plus much more!
The Builder.
M/I Homes of Austin is proud to build your new home. You can be confident in the quality and the energy efficiency of your home as each home is built with 10-Year Transferable Structural Warranty and built to our Whole Home Standards.  Our exclusive Whole Home Building Standards give you the features and benefits of a better built-home. They include the structural features that really matter to homeowners today. And our green features are the result of our relentless pursuit of the ultimate, energy-efficient home.  Not only do we build energy efficient homes, but we have financing through M/I Financial.  Financing through M/I Financial is a real M/I Difference. Because there are specific timetables in construction, financing a new home is more complicated than financing an existing home. We're experts. And our title companies will make your closing quick and convenient.

      "When we saw what options & upgrade choices were available, along with the location, we just knew it was the perfect fit for us.  Not to mention the overall open floorplan is amazing!"
    

      -Nycia Emerson M/I Homes Blog









      "Our Construction Supervisor is very hands-on and really strives to make sure we are satisfied. He communicated frequently with us as the house neared completion and was always open to answering any questions we had. His commitment to quality was evident at the walkthrough and he has personally followed up in the 30 days since we closed on any minor issue we've had, no matter how small. He is very good with people and make sure that the buyer is informed and comfortablethroughout the process. I've been around a lot of construction supervisors and superintendents and John would rank among the best that I've experienced. We want him to build our next home (although, not for a while)!"

Highlands At Mayfield Ranch


The Location.
With its ideal location within one of the nation's fastest growing counties, Highland's at Mayfield Ranch is the perfect community for your new home. You will have an easy commute to most major Austin employers by being located minutes away from I-35 and 183A! Looking for somewhere close by to spend free time together, the Round Rock Premium Outlets,Dell Diamond, and the Southwest Williamson County Regional Park are just a short drive away. We've also got you covered for those hot Texas days with a resort style community pool equipped with its own pool toys!
The Community.
 Surrounded by the Williamson County Regional Park, this community is covered in gorgeous oak trees! Aside from the privacy offered by tree covered lots, the Highlands at Mayfield Ranch is the pocket of the community, making this community even more private, serene and quiet! Being surrounded by the Williamson County Regional Park there are plenty of beautiful and established trees that are throughout the community that provide shaded lots and tree lined streets. If these trees don't provide enough shade for those hot Texas days we have you covered with a brand new community amenity center and pool that is equipped with its own pool toys.

      "When we saw what options & upgrade choices were available, along with the location, we just knew it was the perfect fit for us.  Not to mention the overall open floorplan is amazing!"
    

      -Nycia Emerson M/I Homes Blog









      "Our Construction Supervisor is very hands-on and really strives to make sure we are satisfied. He communicated frequently with us as the house neared completion and was always open to answering any questions we had. His commitment to quality was evident at the walkthrough and he has personally followed up in the 30 days since we closed on any minor issue we've had, no matter how small. He is very good with people and make sure that the buyer is informed and comfortablethroughout the process. I've been around a lot of construction supervisors and superintendents and John would rank among the best that I've experienced. We want him to build our next home (although, not for a while)!"

      "When we saw what options & upgrade choices were available, along with the location, we just knew it was the perfect fit for us.  Not to mention the overall open floorplan is amazing!"
    

      -Nycia Emerson M/I Homes Blog









      "M/I built a beautiful home in a great community! I am extremely happy with the sales and construction team. We were looking at a few other builders, but are glad we chose M/I!"
    

      -Jason Parker 
    








      "If you’re looking for a new home in Austin, check with Ursula at the model home in Palmera Ridge. She is awesome.  You won’t feel pressured to buy and she is more than happy to answer questions you might have.  She will spend all the time you need to help you find the right home."
    

      -Donna Reynolds M/I Homes Blog









      "We looked at as many builders in our area as possible and the second we stepped into the M/I Homes model we knew it was a perfect fit for us. The other builders were offering "upgrades" that M/I was offering as items that were already included in the base price. There was a clean and classic, yet modern feel to what was being offered."

Our Company
From our very beginnings in 1976, M/I Homes has been deeply committed to quality, value, integrity and above all, treating the customer right. Today, our commitment to our customers is evident in all of our new homes in Austin. Choose from one of our beautiful move-in ready homes or build your own home to fit the way you live in one of our convenient new home communities.
10-Year Transferable Structural Warranty
We back our homes with an industry-leading, 10-year Structural Warranty. What kind of company would offer that kind of coverage? One that's confident it builds a better home. That means you can buy with confidence. And it's transferable, so your home will have added value if you decide to sell.
More Included Options and Choices
At M/I Homes, we pride ourselves on our extensive included features list. Not only do we include things like Rinnai Tankless Water Heaters, 16 SEER A/C systems, full sod, fenced backyards, 10ft ceilings, and 8ft doors, but many other included features come with a choice! What that means is you get to choose between 7 different included granites, four different included lighting packages, 4 different interior door styles, two styles of door hardware, two styles and two different colors of bathroom fixtures, plus many more, and all choices are included! We dare you to compare an M/I Homes included feature list to that of one of our competitors…we promise you will be impressed!
Where we Build
We are building new homes in premier locations across Austin! We are in communities minutes away from Williamson County Regional Park, Brushy Creek Park, Dell Diamond, Cedar Park Center, Round Rock Premium Outlets, Hill Country Galleria, Lakeline Mall, I-35, 183A, and 71. Not only that, but we are in the leading school districts: Leander ISD, Lake Travis ISD, Georgetown ISD, and Round Rock ISD! No matter what community you decide on, you will be minutes away from major employers, great schools, shopping, outdoor fun, and entertainment!

Leading Central Ohio Homebuilder
From our very beginnings in 1976, M/I Homes has been deeply committed to quality, value, integrity and above all, treating the customer right. Choose from one of our beautiful move-in ready homes or build your own new home to fit the way you live in one of our convenient new home communities.
15 Year Transferable Structural Warranty
We back our homes with a 15 Year Transferable Structural Warranty. What kind of company would offer that kind of coverage? One that's confident it builds a better home. That means you can buy with confidence. And it's transferable, so your home will have added value when you decide to sell.

A Safe & Secure Home
We want you to feel safe in your new home!  That’s why every new home in Columbus comes with a Schlage Keypad Lock .  You can control the locks on your home directly from your phone.  This safety device allows you to see what time the door is locked and unlocked using specific user codes. *Not included in Smart Series homes.
Where We Build
We are building new homes in premier locations across Columbus and Central Ohio.  From the white fences of New Albany to the old world architecture of Dublin, our neighborhoods are a step above.  We offer new community and new home opportunities in: Blacklick,  Delaware, Gahanna, Galena, Grove City, Hilliard, Lewis Center, Licking Heights, Marysville, Olentangy, Pickerington, Powell, and Westerville.

Our Company
From our very beginnings in 1976, M/I Homes has been deeply committed to quality, value, integrity and above all, treating the customer right. Today, our commitment to our customers is evident in all of our new homes in Indianapolis. Choose from one of our beautiful move-in ready homes or build your own home to fit the way you live in one of our convenient new home communities.
Industry Leading 15-Year Transferable Structural Warranty
We back our homes with an Industry Leading 15-Year Structural Warranty. What kind of company would offer that kind of coverage? One that's confident it builds a better home. That means you can buy with confidence. And it's transferable, so your home will have added value when you decide to sell.

Quality Construction
At M/I Homes, quality construction has always been a part of our backbone. This means we go above the industry standards to ensure our homes are well built. We use 2”x6” lumber to create stronger, more stable exterior walls.  This also allows for R19, a thicker insulation than the standard (R13).  We also build our homes' walls with the ZIP System®, a one-of-a-kind structural system with a built-in, energy efficient barrier that keeps the elements out while keeping you comfortable and helping you save on your energy bills!
Where We Build
We are building new homes in premier locations across Indianapolis and Central Indiana. Whether it's neighboring the Carmel Arts District, Monon Trail, inches from Grand Park, or historic Cumberland Trail, we build where you want to live.  We offer new community and new home opportunities in leading school districts, Avon, Brownsburg, Carmel, Center Grove, Clark Pleasant, Franklin Township, Franklin, Hamilton Southeastern, Lawrence, Noblesville, Pike, Mt. Vernon, Washington, Westfield-Washington and Zionsville.

Leading New Homebuilder in Tampa
From our very beginnings in 1976, M/I Homes has been deeply committed to quality, value, integrity and above all, treating the customer right. Our new homes in Tampa are no exception.  M/I Homes in Tampa offers a wide variety of award winning floor plans to choose from whether you are a first-time home buyer or looking to move up to a new home. Choose from one of our beautiful move-in ready homes or build your own to fit your lifestyle in one of our beautiful communities and see for yourself why we are the new home leader.
Cleaner, Greener and More Cost Efficient Living
Every home we build is built to our stringent Whole Home guidelines. What does this mean to you? Not only do you get one of the most energy efficient homes on the market today, but we also care about the environment and use procedures to lessen the carbon footprint. Each home is tested and provided with a HERS score showing just how energy efficient your home is.
15 Year Transferable Structural Warranty
We back our homes with an Industry-Leading 15 Year Structural Warranty. What kind of company would offer that kind of coverage? One that's confident it builds a better home. That means you can buy with confidence. And it's transferable, so your home will have added value when you decide to sell.
Where We Build
We build new homes in premier locations across the Tampa Bay Area. You can find your perfect home in locations such as The Westchase area, Citrus Park, Odessa, Lutz, New Tampa, Lakeland, Land O'Lakes, and Riverview.

From the earliest planning stages through the final touches on our project, he consistently went above and beyond anything we could have expected to ensure that our home was not only picture perfect, but was exactly and precisely what we wanted.  From choosing the perfect build site on our 7 acres to suggesting a loft area to link the kids' rooms, Cottonwood contributed not only solid practical ability in building and managing our project, but also creative and aesthetic ideas that dramatically improved our house.  They patiently worked through each of our exacting requirements, and insisted that every worker on the project get every detail perfect.  They even went so far as to take over managing the pool construction (at no extra charge, though it was beyond the scope of his contract) when the poolbuilders proved incompetent, just to be sure we weren't left with an unfinished or substandard outcome.

I had them out to finish the work on my bathroom remodel that my previous contractor couldn't complete. Thanks for picking up the slack & restoring a homeowner's faith in finding a reliable contractor.  Joe Bland Construction, L.PPatrick S. ratedHonest people who get the job done.Did You Know?There has perhaps never been a better tool for do-it-yourself home handymen than the internet. With detailed instructions and videos explaining how to perform a number of common maintenance and renovation tasks around a house, an untrained homeowner might be surprised at how much he or she can accomplish with a quick search online. But even with all of this information, there are still many jobs that lie far outside the scope of most DIY enthusiasts. General contractors are there to fill in this gap.A general contractor specializes in seeing a home remodel or repair project through from start to finish. To do this, the contractor works with the client - whether they are a homeowner or business - to nail down the scope of the work. Then he or she will turn to one or more subcontractors for specific tasks, like equipment operation, design, electrical work or whatever else is needed.In essence, general contractors could be thought of as middlemen between a homeowner or business owner and any number of specialists. To get their money's worth, many assume they should just "cut out the middleman" and hire specialists directly, but this often proves more difficult in practice. General contractors won't be completing an entire project by themselves, but should have a long list of dependable experts who can work together and accomplish any task. They might also serve as the manager on the site of a construction project, overseeing workers and providing guidance and assistance when needed. For larger projects, though, the contractor might only handle administrative matters and employ a foreman or other professional for on-site supervision.Common JobsThere are many general contractors who also specialize in certain tasks themselves. There is usually at least one general contractor on hand to organize the construction of an entire home, for example. But general contractors could also help a homeowner add an additional bedroom, build an in-ground pool or complete a major landscaping project. They could also work with a business to add or improve office space, whether that means making more room or converting a commercial building from a nail salon to a restaurant. Basically, if it's a job that involves building or repairing, a general contractor probably knows how to get it done.No matter what the exact job may be, a contractor will probably need to accomplish several other essential tasks in pursuit of the ultimate goal, which may include:Understanding and applying for building permits to meet local regulationsOrganizing a budget and adhering to it throughout the projectGathering all the necessary tools and equipment, from hammers and shovels to large excavators and generatorsSecuring the construction site and equipment after work hoursWorking with personnel on-site to address any issuesKeeping records of materials, labor and all other expensesLicensingEvery general contractor performing any kind of work on a project must be licensed to do so in their state. The guidelines for the specifics on licensing vary from state to state. Some states might only require registration of contractors, which is different from licensing. Registration typically means that there must be a written record of what work is being performed and by whom, but it does not guarantee professional knowledge. Licensing, on the other hand, involves an examination process to assess professional competence.Whether your state requires licensing or registration of contractors, there should be a record of most professionals willing to complete certain projects in your area. Check your state or county website for more information. In states that require licensing, every licensed contractor's contact information is available online or from another public source.Not every project needs to be completed by a licensed or registered contractor. If it's just a minor job that won't take more than a day or two, and will cost less than a few hundred dollars, it's likely not necessary to find a licensed or registered contractor. However, anything bigger or more expensive, or a project involving plumbing or electrical work, needs to be completed by a licensed or registered professional.General contractors also must be covered by an insurance policy. This should include liability coverage for any property damage that could be inflicted in the course of a job. It should also include a worker's compensation policy in case anyone is injured on the job. Before hiring a contractor for anything, ask for written proof of this insurance to see exactly what is covered. Trade AssociationsA number of trade associations for contractors in the U.S. exist. Some of the biggest include:Associated General Contractors of America: Represents more than 6,500 general contracting firms and more than 9,000 specialty contractors nationwide.Associated Builders and Contractors: Represents non-union contracting firms.Most trade associations for general contractors will provide references for anyone looking to hire a contractor for a specific project. They may also provide a number of benefits for their members, including assistance with licensing, training, insurance and business development.Hiring a General ContractorNo matter what you need accomplished, you want to choose a contractor who can get the job done right at a reasonable price. Obviously, this is easier said than done, but there are a few steps you can take to ensure you find a trustworthy general contractor.Finding general contractorsThe first, and perhaps most reliable, way to find a general contractor is to ask friends and family members for a recommendation. If you know anyone who has had major work done on their home, particularly if it's a similar job, ask them who they hired and if they were pleased with the result. You could also ask neighbors about who they've hired if you notice work being done on their house. Many remodeling contractors post signs in front of homes to advertise their services. As a general rule, it's rarely a good idea to hire a contractor who solicits work by going door to door.If you are considering hiring a contractor without a personal recommendation, ask the contractor for references from past clients, and do as much background research on them as possible. Look for any complaints (or compliments) online to get a better idea of their track record. There are a number of websites specializing in connecting contractors with people or businesses who need work done. These sites may also allow past clients to submit their own reviews of the contractor. BudgetBefore hiring a contractor, make sure you are both in agreement on the project's budget. It's normal for most contractors to charge clients a premium not only for the labor expenses and zoning expertise, but for acquiring the materials as well. Be as clear and concise as possible regarding what you'll be purchasing yourself and what you will be paying the contractor to complete. Homeowners may be able to find a better deal on raw materials when they purchase these directly, but they first need to be sure they aren't buying the wrong things.Don't forget to discuss how the project will be finalized and what will be done about cleanup. Plans for how the work site will be cleaned at the end of each day as well as at the conclusion of work need to be put in writing. An experienced general contractor should make every effort to keep the workspace clean and prevent dirtying or damaging any other area. Even so, talk with the contractor about the daily schedule, the logistics of transporting workers and equipment, and how cleanup will be handled.Prioritizing SafetyAs previously mentioned, you need to make sure to follow any state and local regulations regarding construction work, which includes hiring a licensed or registered general contractor. Ask the contractor for proof of their certification before signing anything, as well as their proof of insurance. You should also check your homeowners insurance policy to see if they offer coverage for contracted work. You may want to call your insurance provider and ask for more details on what your plan will and won't cover.Perhaps the best way to feel safe about a contractor and the work being done is to hire a contractor you trust. This is why relying on personal references from friends and family is so important, and will often provide a great deal of peace of mind. If you aren't able to obtain a reference, work to conduct extensive research on the contractor as well as the work you are hiring them to perform. This should bring everyone's expectations into alignment and result in a safe work environment.Financial safetyBefore any money changes hands, there should be a contract to sign. Make sure the specifics of the work to be done and all costs are listed in the contract, right down to the most precise details. If you forget to have something included in the contract after signing it, there's rarely a chance of recourse. Once the specifics of the job are nailed down, be sure to discuss the payment schedule with the contractor. This is important because paying too much up front offers the homeowner minimal leverage if the quality of work does not meet expectations or contractual specifications. Try to establish a reasonable pay schedule with the contractor, such as paying 10 percent of the total cost for each 10 percent of the work that is completed. It's a good idea to include this payment plan in the contract as well.Finally, look into getting a lien release signed before work begins. If there is ever a dispute regarding payment over the course of the project, a contractor or subcontractor could place a payment claim, or lien, on your property. This can trigger a long legal process that may be frustrating. To avoid this, ask the contractor to sign a lien release, which is a legal agreement that states that any payment accepted is final. This can come in handy if a contractor has his or her own payment issues with their subcontractors. Signing a lien release form certifies that any payment made by a client to the contractor is enough to pay for any goods or services rendered. A lien dispute could also be prevented by performing due diligence prior to picking a contractor, as any contractor with good credit and a long track record of satisfied clients should have no trouble paying for materials and labor once all contract conditions have been met.Once work is underway, it's never a bad idea to check up on the progress of the job, either by staying in touch with the contractor over the phone or visiting the site in person. If you work with a trustworthy professional, it's probably best to keep your distance and allow everyone to stay busy. If you want to keep an eye on things, make sure workers wear the right safety gear and that everything looks to be moving along according to schedule. Finally, once work is finished and you are satisfied, be sure to thank your contractor and tell friends or family members about your experience.

BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.
                    





Out of Business









                        BBB reports on a company that is out of business for three years from the date the company closes its doors or ceases to do business.
                    





Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.

BBB Rating System Overview














Customer Review Rating:









                        The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business.
                        The Customer Review Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive,
                        neutral, and negative reviews posted.

Composite Score:





                        M / I Homes has received 3.73 out of 5 stars based on 14 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
