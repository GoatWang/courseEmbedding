EcoWorx: Cradle to Cradle Certified Silver - Safe materials, perpetually cycled


Material Health

Careful consideration of the individual components that go into our wide portfolio of flooring products is a vital part of Shaw’s commitment to sustainability. Our vigilant perspective on minimizing the impact of the materials used in the manufacturing of our products led us to align with the Cradle to Cradle philosophy, which focuses on creating products that are safe, and that can be reused and recycled.

View 2015 Sustainability Report











Our commitment to transparency: inventory, disclose, assess, validate, optimize


Certifications

We are committed to transparency and third party verification of our rigorous sustainability efforts. Our product certifications include Cradle to Cradle Certified™, GREENGUARD, CRI Green Label Plus, FloorScore, NSF 140, and numerous others. To further support our transparency efforts, we also maintain Health Product Declarations (HPDs) for all commercial carpet products and Living Building Challenge (LBC) Compliant Declare labels for EcoWorx® tile products.


Learn more about our certifications








Transparency, Verification and Evaluation
Shaw is committed to transparency and to thorough and independent verifications of the environmental and material health impacts of our products. The programs in which we participate include:

The Cradle to Cradle Certified™ Products Program is among the most rigorous in the world. Cradle to Cradle focuses on safe materials, material reutilization, renewable energy, water stewardship, and social fairness. Cradle to Cradle Certified products are verified by the Cradle to Cradle Products Innovation Institute to include only chemicals and components that are safe for human contact, and that can be recycled or reused. In 2015, 65 percent of the sales of Shaw manufactured product were Cradle to Cradle Certified as we make progress towards our 2030 sustainability goal to design 100 percent of our products to this standard.

Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs) are reports that communicate the environmental impacts of a product across all phases of its lifecycle - from raw material extraction, manufacturing, and distribution, to product use and end of life. Shaw has third-party verified EPDs for the vast majority of our commercial and residential carpets.

GREENGUARD Certification, conducted by UL Environment, verifies that products meet some of the worlds most rigorous and comprehensive standards for low emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) into indoor air. All of Shaw’s hardwood and laminate flooring is GREENGUARD certified.

Green Label Plus is an independent testing program of the Carpet and Rug Institute that verifies low volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions for carpet, adhesive and cushion products. All Shaw carpet products meet this standard.

Health Product Declarations (HPDs) are a standard report format for the transparent disclosure of product content and associated health information for building products and materials. Shaw’s HPDs cover all EcoWorx carpet tile products as well as Shaw commercial broadloom, Classicbac, and UltralocMPC. HPDs for Shaw Contract Group and Patcraft products can be found on the brand websites.

ILFI Declare is an ingredients label program for building products from the International Living Future Institute. It requires manufacturers to ensure that they are free of Red List chemicals and materials, which are known to pose serious risks to human health and the greater ecosystem. EcoWorx backed carpet tile with Eco Solution Q® fiber are registered through the Declare program.

NSF/ANSI 140 is a sustainability assessment for carpet that focuses on quantifiable metrics covering public health and environment; energy and energy efficiency; biobased, recycled, and environmentally preferable content materials; manufacturing, reclamation, and end-of-life management and innovation. All EcoWorx carpet tile and broadloom products, along with all Ultraloc, Stalok, and Classicbac broadlooms with nylon face fibers are NSF 140 Gold Certified.








Converting carpet back into carpet, into materials for other industries, and into energy to power our manufacturing operations


Reclamation and Recycling

Shaw continues to be an industry leader in the reclamation and recycling of end-of-use carpet, and as we continue to drive innovation into our business, we look for new solutions to pieces of the puzzle that continue to challenge us.

Guided by Cradle to Cradle principles, Shaw has led the establishment of a national infrastructure to reclaim and recycle as much end-of-life carpet as possible. Shaw has reclaimed and recycled more than 900 million pounds of post-consumer carpet since 2006.
