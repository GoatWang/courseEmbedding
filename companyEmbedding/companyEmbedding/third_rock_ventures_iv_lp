Third Rock Ventures Raises $616 Million Fund IV




- Announces Strategic Additions to Team -






October 31, 2016 06:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Third 
      Rock Ventures, LLC announced today the closing of Third Rock 
      Ventures IV, LP (“Fund IV”), raising $616 million in an oversubscribed 
      fund. With Fund IV, the firm will continue to execute on its strategy of 
      creating innovative healthcare companies to make a meaningful difference 
      in the lives of patients and their families. Since launching in 2007, 
      Third Rock has raised $1.9 billion – including Fund IV – 
      for building transformative companies with a particular emphasis in 
      areas such as oncology, immunology, neurological disorders, 
      cardiovascular disease and rare genetic diseases.
    


      “We appreciate the ongoing support from all the investors participating 
      in Fund IV. Over the years, we have continued to build a leading 
      investor base that is supportive of our unique model – a 
      hands-on, team-based approach of discovering, launching and building 
      great companies based on bold ideas that meet at the intersection of 
      science, strategy, business and medicine,” said Robert Tepper, M.D., 
      partner at Third Rock. “Our investment philosophy has always been shaped 
      by the ongoing tremendous innovation in science and medicine. We aim to 
      be both the preferred partner to scientific innovators from academia, 
      and the preferred provider of innovative programs in important disease 
      areas to address the bio-pharma industry’s pipeline needs.”
    

      To date, Third Rock has launched more than 40 companies, all sharing a 
      common goal of addressing significant medical needs through bold ideas 
      and transformative science. The firm focuses on building product engine 
      companies, which offer unique opportunities for growth and value in that 
      they are built on technologies with the potential to generate multiple 
      therapeutics. In less than 10 years, Third Rock portfolio companies have 
      delivered four products and one device to the market and advanced more 
      than 40 programs in clinical development. Compelling clinical data from 
      many of these programs point to the potential to make an impact in 
      disease areas in need of new and better treatment options.
    

      Third Rock also announced today that industry veteran Abbie Celniker, 
      Ph.D., is joining the firm as a partner. Charles Homcy, M.D., previously 
      a venture partner, is becoming a partner. Frank Gentile, Ph.D., Stephen 
      Sherwin, M.D., and Barbara Weber, M.D., who have served as 
      entrepreneurs-in-residence for the firm, are becoming venture partners.
    

      “Without a doubt, people are the most important asset in our efforts, 
      and I am incredibly proud of all that our team has accomplished to 
      date,” said Alexis Borisy, partner at Third Rock. “We are thrilled today 
      to welcome Abbie and Charles as partners. Many of us have had the 
      pleasure of working with them previously and know their insight and 
      expertise will be invaluable as we continue to work collectively to 
      translate the unprecedented level of innovation emerging from academia 
      and industry to our company creation efforts.”
    

      “I am delighted to be joining Third Rock. Having worked with many 
      members of the team previously I have tremendous respect for their 
      high-engagement, team-oriented and value-creation driven approach,” said 
      Dr. Celniker. “I am looking forward to contributing to ongoing efforts 
      and long-term success as we continue to advance important science to 
      build great companies to make a difference in the lives of patients and 
      their families.”
    

      Dr. Celniker brings over 30 years of experience in R&D and senior 
      leadership roles. Prior to joining the firm, she served as president and 
      CEO of Eleven Biotherapeutics, a Third Rock portfolio company. Before 
      that, Dr. Celniker was the president and CEO of Taligen Therapeutics 
      until its acquisition by Alexion. Previously, she had R&D leadership 
      roles at Novartis, Millennium Pharmaceuticals and Wyeth Research. She 
      received her Ph.D. from the University of Arizona.
    

      Dr. Homcy joined Third Rock as a venture partner in 2010, bringing over 
      30 years of experience as a preeminent physician scientist discovering 
      and developing drugs in a number of disease areas, with particular 
      expertise in cardiovascular disease. He has played an integral role in 
      the launching and building of several of the firm’s west-coast based 
      portfolio companies. Prior to Third Rock, Dr. Homcy co-founded Portola 
      Pharmaceuticals and served as president and CEO. Previously, he was at 
      Millennium Pharmaceuticals and COR Therapeutics. He received his M.D. 
      from Johns Hopkins University.

- Announces Strategic Additions to Team -

      Third 
      Rock Ventures, LLC announced today the closing of Third Rock 
      Ventures IV, LP (“Fund IV”), raising $616 million in an oversubscribed 
      fund. With Fund IV, the firm will continue to execute on its strategy of 
      creating innovative healthcare companies to make a meaningful difference 
      in the lives of patients and their families. Since launching in 2007, 
      Third Rock has raised $1.9 billion – including Fund IV – 
      for building transformative companies with a particular emphasis in 
      areas such as oncology, immunology, neurological disorders, 
      cardiovascular disease and rare genetic diseases.
    

      “We appreciate the ongoing support from all the investors participating 
      in Fund IV. Over the years, we have continued to build a leading 
      investor base that is supportive of our unique model – a 
      hands-on, team-based approach of discovering, launching and building 
      great companies based on bold ideas that meet at the intersection of 
      science, strategy, business and medicine,” said Robert Tepper, M.D., 
      partner at Third Rock. “Our investment philosophy has always been shaped 
      by the ongoing tremendous innovation in science and medicine. We aim to 
      be both the preferred partner to scientific innovators from academia, 
      and the preferred provider of innovative programs in important disease 
      areas to address the bio-pharma industry’s pipeline needs.”
    

      To date, Third Rock has launched more than 40 companies, all sharing a 
      common goal of addressing significant medical needs through bold ideas 
      and transformative science. The firm focuses on building product engine 
      companies, which offer unique opportunities for growth and value in that 
      they are built on technologies with the potential to generate multiple 
      therapeutics. In less than 10 years, Third Rock portfolio companies have 
      delivered four products and one device to the market and advanced more 
      than 40 programs in clinical development. Compelling clinical data from 
      many of these programs point to the potential to make an impact in 
      disease areas in need of new and better treatment options.
    

      Third Rock also announced today that industry veteran Abbie Celniker, 
      Ph.D., is joining the firm as a partner. Charles Homcy, M.D., previously 
      a venture partner, is becoming a partner. Frank Gentile, Ph.D., Stephen 
      Sherwin, M.D., and Barbara Weber, M.D., who have served as 
      entrepreneurs-in-residence for the firm, are becoming venture partners.
    

      “Without a doubt, people are the most important asset in our efforts, 
      and I am incredibly proud of all that our team has accomplished to 
      date,” said Alexis Borisy, partner at Third Rock. “We are thrilled today 
      to welcome Abbie and Charles as partners. Many of us have had the 
      pleasure of working with them previously and know their insight and 
      expertise will be invaluable as we continue to work collectively to 
      translate the unprecedented level of innovation emerging from academia 
      and industry to our company creation efforts.”
    

      “I am delighted to be joining Third Rock. Having worked with many 
      members of the team previously I have tremendous respect for their 
      high-engagement, team-oriented and value-creation driven approach,” said 
      Dr. Celniker. “I am looking forward to contributing to ongoing efforts 
      and long-term success as we continue to advance important science to 
      build great companies to make a difference in the lives of patients and 
      their families.”
    

      Dr. Celniker brings over 30 years of experience in R&D and senior 
      leadership roles. Prior to joining the firm, she served as president and 
      CEO of Eleven Biotherapeutics, a Third Rock portfolio company. Before 
      that, Dr. Celniker was the president and CEO of Taligen Therapeutics 
      until its acquisition by Alexion. Previously, she had R&D leadership 
      roles at Novartis, Millennium Pharmaceuticals and Wyeth Research. She 
      received her Ph.D. from the University of Arizona.
    

      Dr. Homcy joined Third Rock as a venture partner in 2010, bringing over 
      30 years of experience as a preeminent physician scientist discovering 
      and developing drugs in a number of disease areas, with particular 
      expertise in cardiovascular disease. He has played an integral role in 
      the launching and building of several of the firm’s west-coast based 
      portfolio companies. Prior to Third Rock, Dr. Homcy co-founded Portola 
      Pharmaceuticals and served as president and CEO. Previously, he was at 
      Millennium Pharmaceuticals and COR Therapeutics. He received his M.D. 
      from Johns Hopkins University.

      and I am incredibly proud of all that our team has accomplished to
      date,” said Alexis Borisy, partner at Third Rock. “We are thrilled today
      to welcome Abbie and Charles as partners. Many of us have had the
      pleasure of working with them previously and know their insight and
      expertise will be invaluable as we continue to work collectively to
