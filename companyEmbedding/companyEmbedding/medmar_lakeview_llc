2843 N. Halsted St.
View Full Caption


LAKEVIEW — A medical marijuana dispensary could be coming to Lakeview.Chicago-based company MedMar Inc. presented plans Monday for a dispensary at 2843 N. Halsted St. The site has previously housed bars, but is currently vacant.Representatives from MedMar met with locals at a South East Lake View Neighbors meeting.The company said it hoped to provide safe, affordable access to legal marijuana. Patients would only be served if they have medical conditions like cancer, multiple sclerosis, HIV or Alzheimer's disease.The dispensary hopes to employ about 20 people, including managers and doctors.Security measures would include interior and exterior surveillance cameras and regular security guards. All deliveries would take place in a secure delivery bay accessible from a back alley.
Current plans call for a segmented layout with multiple small rooms and offices. The setup would restrict access to marijuana, allowing only employees and patients near the substance.MedMar could not immediately be reached for comment.Illinois plans to grant up to 60 medical marijuana dispensary licenses statewide by the end of this year. MedMar's Lakeview proposition is one of 211 applications statewide that officials are currently reviewing.Mike Demetriou, president of South East Lake View Neighbors, said the group will decide next month whether to support MedMar's proposal.Ald. Tom Tunney (44th) said MedMar will make appearances at two more community meetings to presents its plans to Lakeview residents. These meetings include:• South East Lake View Neighbors, 7 p.m. Nov. 10, 656 W. Barry Ave.• Central Lakeview Neighbors, 7 p.m. Nov. 11, 836 W. Wellington Ave. (Olson Auditorium)For more neighborhood news, listen to DNAinfo Radio here:

Halsted, Chicago, ILZoning Board of AppealsDeny the applicant, Medmar, Inc., zoning approval for a Medicinal Marijuana facility within a residential community.2847 N Halsted Condo Association United States2847 N Halsted Condo AssociationUnited States842SupportersAs residents and small business owners of Lakeview and Lincoln Park, we are expressing our extreme opposition to the Medical Cannabis Dispensary permit for 2843 N Halsted Street. This petition is in no way attempting to deny or discredit marijuana as a medical use. Our objection is the location of the facility within an established residential community. It is our strong belief that the applicant, Medmar, is a nonconforming use, and does not meet the required criteria for a special use permit at its proposed location. Listed below are a few key points to help articulate our collective communitys' stance on this issue.

* The applicant, MedMar, Inc. will have an adverse impact on the general welfare of the neighborhood or community.
* The applicant, Medmar, Inc. is NOT designed to promote pedestrian safety and comfort.
* The use WILL increase crime in the neighborhood in which it is located.
* The use WILL cause substantial injury to the value of other property in the neighborhood in which it is to be located.
* Written notice WAS NOT provided to all property owners of the subject property and to all property owners within 250 feet of the property lines of the subject property.
* There are at least 2 parks within 1000 feet of said property, where children congregate. 

I, the undersigned, as a resident or business owner within the Lakeview/Lincoln Park community, wish to state my opposition to the proposed special use permit which would allow MedMar, Inc. to operate a medicinal marijuana facility at 2843 N. Halsted, Chicago, IL 60657. ** Please plan to be in attendance for the ZBA Hearing on Dec. 19th at 2:00PM - 121 N. Lasalle St. Rm 200, your presence and testimony will be the most helpful. This petition was delivered to:Zoning Board of Appeals-Proposed special use permit - MedMar, Inc. at 2843 N.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
