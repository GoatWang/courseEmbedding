Strategy & Benefits

Principal Investment Strategy
The investment strategy of the Direxion Indexed Commodity Strategy Fund includes:

A quantitative, strategic index-based approach to commodity investing
Exposure to 12 commodities that can individually be long or flat (if a short signal is triggered the position is moved to cash)
The ability to make position changes intra-month based on trends
Monthly rebalance based on risk reduction where the allocation of individual components is reduced if volatility exceeds certain predetermined risk levels
A “smart” contract roll approach1

1 Smart Contract Roll Approach – A futures contract roll approach designed to select cost effective futures contracts to roll into upon expiration of current contract.
Why Invest in the Fund?

The long/flat approach provides exposure to commodities that can individually be positioned long or flat (in cash) based upon price trends
Seeks to mitigate the downside risk and maximum declines relative to notable long-only commodity indices
Has the flexibility to make individual commodity position changes intra-month
Risk management controls designed to adjust exposure levels if volatility gets too high
Low- or non-correlation to stocks and bonds
Disciplined, quantitative, rules-based approach to commodity investing




Why Commodities?

Not just commodities – Long/Flat commodities.
Most traditional commodity funds provide long only exposure to commodities. This limits their potential to contribute to a portfolio’s long-term performance because they only benefit if commodity prices rise.
The Direxion Indexed Commodity Strategy Fund seeks to match the performance of the Auspice Broad Commodity ER Index (ABCERI), which provides exposure to 12 commodities that can individually be positioned long or flat (in cash) based upon price trends.
This long/flat index is potentially more adaptive to volatile commodity markets because it seeks to take advantage of individual commodities by going long when prices rise, and mitigate risk by going flat (to cash) when prices fall.
Why consider long/flat commodities?
Most traditional commodity funds can only benefit if commodity prices rise. However, these long-only commodity strategies have shown to be inconsistent over time because:

Commodity returns are typically cyclical and sporadic
Individual commodity sub-sectors tend to perform dissimilarly in different market environments
Significant draw-downs can be damaging to the long-term performance of a portfolio

Within the inherently volatile commodity markets, a long/flat approach is potentially more adaptive to whip-sawing market conditions.

Target Index

The Auspice Broad Commodity ER Index aims to capture upward trends in the commodity markets while minimizing risk during downward trends. The index uses a quantitative methodology to track either long or flat positions in a diversified portfolio of 12 commodity futures covering energy, metals, and agriculture. The index incorporates dynamic risk management and contract rolling methods.

The Fund’s Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Services Agreement with each Fund. Under this Operating Service Agreement, Rafferty has contractually agreed to pay all expenses of each Fund through September 1, 2018 other than the following: management fees, Rule 12b-1distribution and/or service fees, any front-end or contingent deferred sales loads, acquired fund fees and expenses, taxes, swap financing and related costs, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses such as litigation or other expenses outside the typical day-to-day operations of the Fund. If these expenses were included, the net expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

Alternative strategies have the potential to be a viable way for investors, whether institutional or retail, to reduce risk in their investment portfolios.


  Alternatives? Too Many, or Not Enough?

Some clients confuse negative correlation with low (or non-) correlation. They mistakenly believe that returns for investments with low correlation move in opposite directions from each other.

Commodity Hedge Fund Blenheim Opens Up Ownership for First Time - Bloomberg






























































  
















Commodity Hedge Fund Blenheim Opens Up Ownership for First Time
By Javier Blas

April 18, 2017, 1:05 PM EDT



April 18, 2017, 7:01 PM EDT










                Willem Kooyker founded Blenheim in 1989 and remains top owner
            



                Blenheim’s assets dropped after several years of poor returns
            



Willem Kooyker, a pioneer of investing in commodities, broadened the ownership of his $1.5 billion hedge fund for the first time since it was created almost three decades ago.One of the most powerful and enigmatic traders in the natural resources industry, Kooyker said Thomas Kopczynski, James Wohlmacher, Gus Rossi, and his son Terence Kooyker will join him as owners of Blenheim Capital Management LLC. Blenheim invests in everything from oil to metals and agriculture, and at its height in 2011, was the world’s largest commodities-focused hedge fund.The ownership shakeup is the first since 74-year-old Kooyker, who retains a majority interest, started Blenheim in 1989. The changes come as the firm navigates one of its most difficult periods in its existence, with assets under management down 85 percent from a record after several years of poor returns. The new partners have long worked at the New Jersey-based company.








“My new partners will help me chart a new course for growth in an industry that has changed enormously in recent years,” Kooyker said in a statement. “Blenheim was a pioneer in commodity trading and investing and we aim to be among the leading managers in those markets for many years to come.”Kooyker will remain as head of the asset allocation committee and actively engaged in trading strategy, according to a person familiar with the firm, who asked not to be identified when discussing internal matters.Kooyker has gradually reduced the amount of money that he personally manages. He oversaw as little as 15 percent of the company’s assets in early 2016, down from 75 percent in the years before that, according to consultant NEPC LLC, which advises pension funds. The consultant said last year that the decrease could signal a move toward his retirement. The person familiar with Blenheim said Kooyker wasn’t retiring.




Flagship FundThe Blenheim Global Markets Fund lost money in the three years through 2013 and again in 2015. That was a rare occurrence for the flagship fund, which over three decades returned in excess of 30 percent in several years and twice doubled its money.Read more: The rise and fall of commodities hedge fund king Kooyker

Despite the drop in assets, Blenheim is emerging from the commodities downturn as one of the few survivors in the hedge fund industry. Citadel LLC, the $26 billion hedge fund run by Ken Griffin, placed its metals business under review in November, joining other commodities-focused funds such as Galena Asset Management, Brevan Howard Asset Management LLP and Clive Capital LLP in retrenching. Cargill Inc., the world’s top agricultural trader, also closed several hedge funds.Blenheim said it’s planning to expand its product offering to “address both a growing opportunity set in the commodity markets and the more varied ways in which investors seek to access the firm’s capabilities.”Kopczynski, 45, is a long-time lieutenant of Kooyker, while 52-year-old Wohlmacher is Blenheim’s chief risk officer and once worked at Commodities Corp., the firm where Kooyker made his name. Rossi, 45, is chief financial officer and Terence Kooyker, 33, has been trading with Blenheim for a decade.

Strategy & Benefits

Principal Investment Strategy
The investment strategy of the Direxion Indexed Commodity Strategy Fund includes:

A quantitative, strategic index-based approach to commodity investing
Exposure to 12 commodities that can individually be long or flat (if a short signal is triggered the position is moved to cash)
The ability to make position changes intra-month based on trends
Monthly rebalance based on risk reduction where the allocation of individual components is reduced if volatility exceeds certain predetermined risk levels
A “smart” contract roll approach1

1 Smart Contract Roll Approach – A futures contract roll approach designed to select cost effective futures contracts to roll into upon expiration of current contract.
Why Invest in the Fund?

The long/flat approach provides exposure to commodities that can individually be positioned long or flat (in cash) based upon price trends
Seeks to mitigate the downside risk and maximum declines relative to notable long-only commodity indices
Has the flexibility to make individual commodity position changes intra-month
Risk management controls designed to adjust exposure levels if volatility gets too high
Low- or non-correlation to stocks and bonds
Disciplined, quantitative, rules-based approach to commodity investing




Why Commodities?

Not just commodities – Long/Flat commodities.
Most traditional commodity funds provide long only exposure to commodities. This limits their potential to contribute to a portfolio’s long-term performance because they only benefit if commodity prices rise.
The Direxion Indexed Commodity Strategy Fund seeks to match the performance of the Auspice Broad Commodity ER Index (ABCERI), which provides exposure to 12 commodities that can individually be positioned long or flat (in cash) based upon price trends.
This long/flat index is potentially more adaptive to volatile commodity markets because it seeks to take advantage of individual commodities by going long when prices rise, and mitigate risk by going flat (to cash) when prices fall.
Why consider long/flat commodities?
Most traditional commodity funds can only benefit if commodity prices rise. However, these long-only commodity strategies have shown to be inconsistent over time because:

Commodity returns are typically cyclical and sporadic
Individual commodity sub-sectors tend to perform dissimilarly in different market environments
Significant draw-downs can be damaging to the long-term performance of a portfolio

Within the inherently volatile commodity markets, a long/flat approach is potentially more adaptive to whip-sawing market conditions.

All data as of 6/30/2017 and is subject to change at any time and are not recommendations to buy or sell any security. When the positions within the various components are flat, they will be invested in cash and U.S. Treasury Bills. Individual components may vary based on risk levels.






Target Index

The Auspice Broad Commodity ER Index aims to capture upward trends in the commodity markets while minimizing risk during downward trends. The index uses a quantitative methodology to track either long or flat positions in a diversified portfolio of 12 commodity futures covering energy, metals, and agriculture. The index incorporates dynamic risk management and contract rolling methods.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 1.26% for DXCTX, 2.01% for DXSCX, and 1.01% for DXCIX.  The Fund’s Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Services Agreement with each Fund. Under this Operating Service Agreement, Rafferty has contractually agreed to pay all expenses of each Fund through September 1, 2018 other than the following: management fees, Rule 12b-1distribution and/or service fees, any front-end or contingent deferred sales loads, acquired fund fees and expenses, taxes, swap financing and related costs, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses such as litigation or other expenses outside the typical day-to-day operations of the Fund. If these expenses were included, the net expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

  Addressing The Top Misconceptions About Alternative Investments    


Alternative strategies have the potential to be a viable way for investors, whether institutional or retail, to reduce risk in their investment portfolios.


  Alternatives? Too Many, or Not Enough?    


The key to risk-adjusted returns and diversification is not the number of securities – it’s their correlation – or, really, non-correlation – to each other, that’s paramount.


  A Correlation Misconception    


Some clients confuse negative correlation with low (or non-) correlation. They mistakenly believe that returns for investments with low correlation move in opposite directions from each other.

Fund Summary and Key Points
The VanEck CM Commodity Index Fund (the "Fund") seeks to track, before fees and expenses, the UBS Bloomberg Constant Maturity Commodity Index (the “CMCI”). CMCI is a next-generation commodity index diversified across maturities, minimizing its exposure to the front end of the futures curvesBy spreading its exposure across multiple maturities and maintaining a constant maturity per commodity, CMCI seeks to mitigate the impacts of negative roll yield in contango environmentsDiversified across five commodity sectors and 27 commodity components; energy allocation typically around 35%In contrast with many “enhanced” commodity funds, offers “pure” commodity exposure by investing in commodity-linked derivative instruments and more conservative fixed income securities, such as U.S. Treasury Bills

Investment Approach

The VanEck CM Commodity Index Fund is a passively-managed mutual fund that seeks to track the CMCI by primarily investing in commodity-linked derivative instruments and conservatively-managed fixed income instruments. 


The Fund may invest in instruments linked to the value of a particular commodity or commodity futures contract, or a subset of commodities or commodity futures contracts, through a wholly owned subsidiary of the Fund formed in the Cayman Islands.

Important Disclosure 
Unless otherwise stated, portfolio facts and statistics are shown for Class A shares; other classes may have different characteristics. 
†NAV: Unless you are eligible for a waiver, the public offering price you pay when you buy Class A shares of the Fund is the Net Asset Value (NAV) of the shares plus an initial sales charge. The initial sales charge varies depending upon the size of your purchase.  No sales charge is imposed where Class A shares are issued to you pursuant to the automatic investment of income dividends or capital gains distribution. It is the responsibility of the financial intermediary to ensure that the investor obtains the proper “breakpoint” discount. Class I and Class Y do not have an initial sales charge. See the 
                 
    prospectus for more information.
1Van Eck Absolute Return Advisers Corporation (the “Adviser”) has agreed to waive fees and/or pay Fund expenses to the extent necessary to prevent the operating expenses of the Fund (excluding acquired fund fees and expenses, interest expense, trading
            expenses, dividends and interest payments on securities sold short, taxes and extraordinary expenses) from exceeding 0.95% for Class A, 0.65% for Class I, and 0.70% for Class Y of the Fund’s average daily net assets per year until May 1, 2018. During such time, the
            expense limitation is expected to continue until the Board of Trustees acts to discontinue all or a portion of such expense limitation.

2The UBS Bloomberg Constant Maturity Commodity Index (CMCI) is a Total Return rules-based composite benchmark index diversified across 27 commodity components from within five sectors, specifically energy, precious metals, industrial metals, agricultural and livestock. The S&P® 500 Index consists of 500 widely held common stocks covering industrial, utility, financial and transportation sectors. The S&P® Goldman Sachs Commodity Total Return Index (SPGSCITR) is a composite index of commodity sector returns, representing an unleveraged, long-only investment in commodity futures. The Bloomberg Barclays US Aggregate Bond (BbgBarc US Agg Bond) Index is composed of the mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities and government/credit bonds. All indices are unmanaged and include the reinvestment of all dividends, but do not reflect the payment of transaction costs, advisory fees or expenses that are associated with an investment in the Fund. An index’s performance is not illustrative of the Fund’s performance. Indices are not securities in which investments can be made.

UBS and Bloomberg own or exclusively license, solely or jointly as agreed between them, all proprietary rights with respect to the Index. In no way do UBS or Bloomberg sponsor or endorse, nor are they otherwise involved in the issuance and offering of the Fund, nor do either of them make any representation or warranty, express or implied, to the holders of the Fund or any member of the public regarding the advisability of investing in the Fund or commodities generally or in futures particularly, or as to results to be obtained from the use of the Index or from the Fund.
The views and opinions expressed are those of VanEck. Fund manager commentaries are general in nature and should not be construed as investment advice. Opinions are subject to change with market conditions. Any discussion of specific securities mentioned in the commentaries is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation to buy these securities. Fund holdings will vary.

You can lose money by investing in the Fund. Any investment in the Fund should be part of an overall investment program, not a complete program. Commodities are assets that have tangible properties, such as oil, metals, and agriculture. Commodities and commodity-linked derivatives may be affected by overall market movements and other factors that affect the value of a particular industry or commodity, such as weather, disease, embargoes or political or regulatory developments. The value of a commodity-linked derivative is generally based on price movements of a commodity, a commodity futures contract, a commodity index or other economic variables based on the commodity markets. Derivatives use leverage, which may exaggerate a loss. The Fund is subject to the risks associated with its investments in commodity-linked derivatives, risks of investing in wholly owned subsidiary, risk of tracking error, risks of aggressive investment techniques, leverage risk, derivatives risks, counterparty risks, non-diversification risk, credit risk, concentration risk and market risk. The use of commodity-linked derivatives such as swaps, commodity-linked structured notes and futures entails substantial risks, including risk of loss of a significant portion of their principal value, lack of a secondary market, increased volatility, correlation risk, liquidity risk, interest-rate risk, market risk, credit risk, valuation risk and tax risk. Gains and losses from speculative positions in derivatives may be much greater than the derivative’s cost. At any time, the risk of loss of any individual security held by the Fund could be significantly higher than 50% of the security’s value. Investment in commodity markets may not be suitable for all investors. The Fund’s investment in commodity-linked derivative instruments may subject the Fund to greater volatility than investment in traditional securities. For a description of these and other risk considerations, please refer to the Fund’s 
        
    prospectus, which should be read carefully before you invest. Again, the Fund offers investors exposure to the broad commodity markets, currently, by investing in commodity-linked swaps.
Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal. An investor should consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the investment company carefully before investing. The prospectus and summary prospectus contain this and other information.  Please read them carefully before investing.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
