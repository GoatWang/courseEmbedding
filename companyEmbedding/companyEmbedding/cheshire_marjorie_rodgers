What inspires Marjorie Rodgers Cheshire?


Marjorie Rodgers Cheshire is a mom, a wife, and the President & COO of A&R Companies in Baltimore.
What inspires you Marjorie? My family inspires me. My father is my boss and my mentor – he has nurtured my love of business and given me a platform to serve my employees and the community. My daughter and husband inspire me every day to grow and do what I can to make our community a better place.
I am also inspired by Baltimore School for the Arts where I am Chair of the Board. The students are so wildly talented and accomplished beyond their years. We are having our annual fundraising event March 1st-3rd that we call Expressions. Details here.
What’s your favorite WK product? Sweet Lips, Natural Honey Lip Balm. I think it is on par with the La Mer product that I have been using for years at a fraction of the cost. I use it daily and so does my daughter. I am very careful about the products that my daughter uses, that this is an all natural product, with very good ingredients, I don’t hesitate to share it with her.
What inspires you?
Waxing Kara.
Bee Inspired.
