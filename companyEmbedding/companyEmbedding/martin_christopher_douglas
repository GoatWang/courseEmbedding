Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/26/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

What are analysts saying about Pandora Media stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Pandora Media stock: 
1. FBR & Co analysts commented, "In this note we outline three ways for P , under the incoming Liberty/Sirius leadership, to generate meaningful upside to our base case SOTP argument for an $11 stock, or to limit downside risk." (6/26/2017)
2. Aegis analysts commented, "We readily admit that there are challenges, but we see greenshoots for the businesses, coupled with the discipled management of Liberty Media, the makes the risk-reward to owning the shares at the current depressed share price, compelling. Ad Supported. While we expect continued pressure on active users and listener hours in 2Q17, app tracking data has shown strengthening usage in May and June over levels in April. Pandora has opportunity to increase ad RPMs through a combination of increasing ad loads, increasingly monetizing auto and CE, the addition of programmatic in 2H17, video ads, and increasing premium direct pricing." (6/14/2017)
3. Macquarie analysts commented, "We remain skeptical that Verizon could pursue one or both of these assets, but think it’s worth considering and could push things along between SIRI-P. We remain Neutral on Pandora as share movement is now largely driven by the whims of M&A." (6/6/2017)
4. Piper Jaffray Companies analysts commented, "Pandora shares remain under pressure as Liberty and SiriusXM continue to flip-flop in their public stance on takeover prospects. While we continue to believe that Liberty/SiriusXM remains a potential buyer, the price will likely depend on the success of Pandora's new Premium and Plus offerings. To that end, we conducted a second survey of Pandora users, to reassess consumer demand for the products amid recent competitive actions by Amazon and Spotify. Our survey focused on the intent of current Pandora users to subscribe to the enhanced Pandora Plus ($5 per month) plan and the full-featured on-demand Pandora Premium service ($10 per month). We found demand from current Pandora listeners for the Pandora Premium remained largely unchanged at 15%; however, interest in Pandora Plus has diminished from 28% to 14%. The survey continues to illustrates meaningful pentup demand for Pandora's new offerings, supporting our positive outlook on the shares." (3/22/2017)
5. Wells Fargo & Company analysts commented, "We analyze this data monthly to check for significant deviations from run-rate uses to build our full quarter estimate for ad-supported hours. We remind investors that with the increased focus on driving subscriptions of Pandora’s ad-free Plus product and the impending roll-out of Pandora’s full on-demand product Pandora Premium, ad- supported hours growth will over time become a less important driver of total company revenue growth. Based on our analysis, we remain confident in our current 1Q hrs forecast and leave our estimates, Market Perform rating, and $12- $14 valuation range unchanged." (3/16/2017)

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Pandora Media (NYSE:P) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 1 Sell Rating, 20 Hold Ratings, 16 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.41)Consensus Price Target: $12.83 (30.50% upside)
