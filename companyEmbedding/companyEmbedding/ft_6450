Surface Preparation


Surfaces must be sound, dry and clean.  Remove previous coatings that have poor adhesion.  
			Wash areas where mold and mildew are present.  Remove all dirt, oil, grease, wax and/or other contaminant.  Repair 
			cracks and fill voids.  De-gloss shiny surfaces by lightly sanding.  Clean and prime all bare metal surfaces with an 
			appropriate primer.  Prime areas as needed.  Test for adhesion and compatibility with existing finishes.



Disposal


Never pour leftover coating 
      down any sink or drainuse up material on the job or seal can and store safely for future use. Do 
			not incinerate closed containers. For  specific disposal guidelines or recycling  opportunities for leftover product and packaging, contact 
			your local waste management agency or district.  Always attempt to recycle whenever possible.



Warranty


Limited Warranty:  Miller Paint Company, Inc. warrants to the purchaser that this product 
			will provide satisfactory performance when applied according to label directions.  If this product does not perform 
			to specifications, return unused portion along with sales receipt to place of purchase.  As the sole remedy to purchaser, 
			dealer will, at its option:  provide additional product to correct affected areas, replace with product of equal value or 
			refund the purchase price paid for this paint product.  Failures caused by poor surface  preparation, improper application 
			or a breakdown of the underlying surface or previous paint film are not covered by this warranty.  THIS WARRANTY 
			SPECIFICALLY EXCLUDES LABOR OR COST OF LABOR OR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF THIS PRODUCT.
			



Possible Existing Lead Warning


WARNING!  If you scrape, sand, or remove old paint, you may release lead dust.  LEAD IS TOXIC. 
			EXPOSURE TO LEAD DUST CAN CAUSE SERIOUS ILLNESS, SUCH AS BRAIN DAMAGE, ESPECIALLY IN CHILDREN.  PREGNANT WOMEN SHOULD 
			ALSO AVOID EXPOSURE.  Wear a NIOSH-approved respirator to control lead exposure.  Clean up carefully with a HEPA vacuum 
			and a wet mop.  Before you start, find out how to protect yourself and your family by contacting the National Lead 
			Information Hotline at 1-800-424-LEAD or log on to www.epa.gov/lead.



Specification figures should 
      be taken as accurate for products being produced at the time of publication in untinted white bases 
			only.  Formulation improvements may be made from time to time that may affect these figures to some degree.  Also, 
			manufacturing tolerances of ą2% are considered acceptable.  Whenever a change is made that the Manufacturer considers 
			substantial, the Product Analysis will be revised.
