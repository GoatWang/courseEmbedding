The Family Of President Benjamin Harrison
from A Family Album, the Harrison Home, Indianapolis, IN
Submitted by Shirley Vaughn, 1209 Apache, Wichita, KS 67207
 
"In 1854, Indianapolis was a young and growing land of opportunity. Among the young men who recognized this was 20 year old Ben Harrison, who with his bride of several months, Caroline, journeyed from the Cincinnati area to set up housekeeping and start his career. They rented the lower half of a 2-story frame house on Pennsylvania St. and Ben struggled to establish himself in the legal profession. Before many months passed they faced their first separation. Due to financial stress and Carrie's need for medical care during pregnancy, they decided it was wise for her to return to her parent's home in Oxford, OH to await the birth of their first child. So it was there, on August 12, 1854; eight days before his father's 21st birthday, that Russell Benjamin Harrison was born. He was named for Russell Farnum Lord, who married Carrie's older sister, Elizabeth. In Indianapolis at that time, the late summer and early fall were damp and unhealthy; so after a few weeks, mother and baby moved to "The Point", farm home of Ben's parents. It was not until mid-October that a doctor advised Ben that the 'sickly season' was over and the family was reunited. Russell was almost four when his sister, Mamie, was born. The day after his sixth birthday, his father marched off to war with the 70th Indiana Regiment. It was nearly three years later when he returned. Harrison bought a buggy as he had promised in letters to Russell and took his family on regular buggy rides along the White River. Russell was frequently his father's companion on bass fishing and quail hunting expeditions. Russell and Mamie attended private academies in Indianapolis before he was enrolled as a cadet at the Pennsylvania Military Academy.
By the time the house on N. Delaware was built in 1875, he was a student of "Greek and science" at Lafayette College in Easton, PA. He received his degree in Mechanical Engineering from Lafayette in 1877. His first job was as an assayer at the Philadelphia mint. Following a short assignment in New Orleans, he transferred to Helena, MT, an area that intrigued him because it was America's last frontier. He returned from Montana for Garfield's inauguration and his father's swearing-in as senator.
Over the next two years he made frequent visits to Washington because of his interest in May Saunders, daughter of the senator from Nebraska and known at the time as the "Belle of Washington". In 1883, Russell spent several months in New York to be near his mother whose health had sunk to a new low and required surgery and medical care not available in Washington. He stayed with her during her long convalescence.
Russell and May were married in the cathedral in Omaha on January 9, 1884. The bride's wedding ring was fashioned from gold from her husband's mine in Montana. Ben and Carrie gave the couple a set of silver flatware in a Chrysanthemum pattern. The next year Russell became manager of the Montana Cattle Co. in addition to his duties as assayer. In succeeding years he became a journalist, publisher, and his father's White House aide. His daughter Marthena, was born in 1888 and with her mother became a member of the Harrison White House while Russell traveled in the U.S. and abroad for his various business interests.

HARRISON HERITAGEp. 304 SEPTEMBER 1982
The Family Of President Benjamin Harrison - Cont.
 
Russell's son, William Henry Harrison, was born in 1896 in Terre Haute while his father was president of the street railway company. It was from there that Russell left to serve his country in the Spanish-American War. He spent three years, first as a major, then as a lieutenant colonel in Cuba and Puerto Rico. As he was returning to Terre Haute, he received word of his father's death and went instead to Indianapolis. Due to circumstances, he never returned to Terre Haute.
In 1907, he was made Vice-Counsul for Mexico for Indianapolis. He passed the Indiana Bar and practiced law. He served in both Indiana houses; from 1921-23 as a representative, and from 1925-27 as a senator. During his last term his son, William Henry Harrison, was also in the legislature. Russell Harrison died in Indianapolis on December 13, 1916 at the age of 82.
Russell's son, William Henry Harrison, left Indianapolis after his father's death. He practiced law in Sheridan, WY and served five terms as U. S. Congressman from Wyoming. He now resides in Sheridan where his grandson, William Henry Harrison III, is a city policeman who states he has no political ambitions. Another grandson, named for John Scott Harrison, Ben Harrison's father, was attending Staunton Military Academy in 1974. Will this be another Harrison military officer?
Russell's daughter, Marthena, who died in 1972, married and had two children. Her daughter, also named Marthena, lives in the Washington, DC area.
Note: We will continue the stories of Ben Harrison's family in the December issue: Mary "Mamie" Harrison McKee and Elizabeth Harrison Walker. Elizabeth was the daughter of Ben and his second wife, Mary Lord Dimmick.
