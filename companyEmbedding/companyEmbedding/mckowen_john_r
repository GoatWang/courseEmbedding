DENVER, June 1, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- Two Rivers Water Company (OTC QB: TURV) (http://www.2riverswater.com) announced today that John R. McKowen, the Company's Founder, Chairman and CEO and a group of investors have entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement ("SPA") with a seven-member group of investors.  
Under the SPA, a copy of which will be timely filed with the SEC, Mr. McKowen and other investors have agreed to purchase stock and place additional stock under options exercisable over the next two years.  In addition to selling stock and covered options to Mr. McKowen and the other investors, the seven-member selling group has agreed to lock up their remaining shares of the Company's common stock for a period of two years.  In all, the SPA involves 6,503,570 shares, roughly 22% of the Company's outstanding common stock.  The SPA was approved by the Company's Board of Directors at a special meeting earlier today.  The initial closing is scheduled during the week of June 4, 2012.
