Ms. Hoke also served as the Senior Vice President, Global Business Development and Strategic Initiatives, Generic Pharmaceuticals, at Cardinal Health, Inc., a healthcare company, from 2005 to 2007, and served as General Counsel from 2001 to 2005. Previously, Ms. Hoke was in-house counsel at Abbott Laboratories, a healthcare company, and a business partner at the law firm of Kegler, Brown, Hill & Ritter Co., LP. Ms. Hoke received a B.S. from Michigan State University and a J.D. from Thomas M. Cooley Law School.
